                <p><label type="entry">RAPE</label> in <hi rend="italic">Law,</hi> the carnal
                    knowledge of a woman forcibly and against her will. This, by the Jewish law, was
                    punished with death, in case the damsel was betrothed to another man; and in
                    case she was not betrothed, then a heavy fine of fifty shekels was to be paid to
                    the damsel’s father, and she was to be the wife of the ravisher all the days of
                    his life, without that power of divorce which was in general permitted by the
                    Mosaic law.</p>
                <p>The Roman law punishes with death and confiscation of goods the crime of
                    ravishment, under which it includes both the offence of forcible abduction, or
                    taking away a woman from her friends, and also the present one of forcibly
                    dishonouring her; either of which, without the other, is in that law sufficient
                    to constitute a capital crime. The stealing away a woman from her parents or
                    guardians, and debauching her, is equally penal by the emperor’s edict, whether
                    she consent or be forced; and this in order to take away every opportunity of
                    offending in this way from women, whom the Roman law supposes never to go astray
                    without the seduction and arts of the other sex; and therefore, by restraining
                    and making so highly penal the solicitations of the men, they meant to secure
                    effectually the honour of the women. But our English law does not entertain
                    quite such sublime ideas of the honour of either sex, as to lay the blame of a
                    mutual fault upon one of the transgressors only; and therefore it is a necessary
                    ingredient in the crime of rape, that it must be against the woman’s will.</p>
                <p>Rape was punished by the Saxon laws, particularly those of Athelstane, with
                    death; which was also agreeable to the old Gothic or Scandinavian constitution.
                    But this was afterwards thought too hard; and in its stead another severe but
                    not capital punishment was inflicted by William the Conqueror, namely,
                    castration and loss of eyes, which continued till after Bracton wrote, in the
                    reign of Henry III. But in order to prevent malicious accusations, it was then
                    the law (and, it seems, still continues to be so in appeals of rape), that the
                    woman should, immediately afterwards, go to the next town, and there make
                    discovery to some credible persons, of the injury she had suffered, and
                    afterwards should acquaint the high constable of the hundred, the coroners, and
                    the sheriff, with the outrage. This seems to correspond in some degree with the
                    laws of Scotland and Aragon, which require that complaint must be made within
                    twenty-four hours; though afterwards, by statute Westra. 1, c. 13, the time of
                    limitation in England was extended to forty days. At present there is no time of
                    limitation fixed; for, as it is usually now punished by indictment at the suit
                    of the king, the maxim of law takes place, that <hi rend="italic">nullum
                    tern-</hi><hi rend="italic">pus occurrit régi;</hi> but the jury will rarely
                    give credit to a stale complaint. During the former period also it was held for
                    law, that the woman, by consent of the judge and her parents, might redeem the
                    offender from the execution of his sentence, by accepting him for her husband;
                    if he also was willing to agree to the exchange, but not otherwise In the 3d
                    Edward I. by the statute Westm. 1, c. 13, the punishment of rape was much
                    mitigated; the offence itself, of ravishing a damsel within age, that is, twelve
                    years old, either with or without her consent, or of any other woman against her
                    will, being reduced to trespass, if not prosecuted by appeal within forty days,
                    and subjecting the offender only to two years’ imprisonment, and a fine at the
                    king’s will. But this lenity being productive of the worst consequences, it was,
                    in ten years afterwards, 13 Edward I., found necessary to make the offence of
                    forcible rape felony by statute Westm. 2, c. 34. And by statute 18 Elizabeth, c.
                    7, it is made felony without benefit of clergy; as is also the abominable
                    wickedness of carnally knowing or abusing any woman-child under the age of ten
                    years, in which case the consent or non-consent is immaterial, as by reason of
                    her tender years she is incapable of judgment and discretion. Sir Matthew Hale
                    is indeed of opinion that Buch profligate actions committed on an infant under
                    the age of twelve years, the age of female discretion by the common law, either
                    with or without consent, amount to rape and felony, as well since as before the
                    statute of Queen Elizabeth. But that law has in general been held only to extend
                    to infants under ten; though it should seem that damsels between ten and twelve
                    are still under the protection of the statute Westm. 1, the law with respect to
                    their seduction not having been altered by either of the subsequent
                    statutes.</p>
                <p>A male infant, under the age of fourteen years, is presumed by law to be
                    incapable of committing a rape, and therefore, it seems, cannot be found guilty
                    of it. For though in other felonies <hi rend="italic">malitia supplet
                    octatem;</hi> yet, as to this particular species of felony, the law supposes an
                    imbecility of body as well as mind.</p>
                <p>The civil law seems to suppose a prostitute or common harlot incapable of any
                    injuries of this kind; not allowing any punishment for violating the chastity of
                    her who has indeed no chastity at all, or at least has no regard to it. But the
                    law of England does not judge so hardly of offenders, as to cut off all
                    opportunity of retreat even from common strumpets, and to treat them as
                    incapable of amendment. It therefore holds it to be felony to force even a
                    concubine or harlot, because the woman may have forsaken that unlawful course of
                    life; for, as Bracton well observes, <hi rend="italic">licet meretrix fuerit
                    antea, certe tunc temporis non fuit, cum reclamando nequitia ejus Conserdire
                    noluit.</hi></p>
