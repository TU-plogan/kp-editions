                    significant corrections to the OCR text, predominantly in cases of confusing "c"
                    and "e." Isolates 90 entries that were mistakenly included at the end of prior
                    entries in v1 and v2. Normalizes ordinal numbers. Separates metadata in
                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra
                    space around the <gi>pb</gi> tag. Where a word is hyphenated at a <gi>pb</gi>,

                <p><label type="entry">RUBENS</label> Sir Peter Paul, the most eminent of the
                    Flemish painters, was born in the year 1577, but whether at Antwerp or Cologne
                    is uncertain. His father, who was a counsellor in the senate of Antwerp, had
                    been forced by the civil wars to seek refuge in Cologne; and during his
                    residence there Rubens is commonly said to have been born.</p>
                <p>The genius of Rubens, which began to unfold itself in his earliest years, was
                    cultivated with peculiar care, and embellished with every branch of classical
                    and polite literature. He soon discovered a strong inclination for designing,
                    and used to amuse himself with that employment in his leisure hours, whilst the
                    rest of his time was devoted to other studies. His mother, perceiving the bias
                    of her son, permitted him to attend the instructions of Tobias Verhaecht, a
                    painter of architecture and of landscape. He next became the pupil of Adam Van
                    Oort; but he soon found that the abilities of this master were insufficient to
                    answer his elevated ideas. His surly temper, too, was dis<pb break="no"

                    />gustful to Rubens, whose natural disposition was modest 'and amiable.</p>
                <p>Anxious to find an artist whose genius and dispositions were congenial with his
                    own, he became the disciple of Octavio Van Veen, generally known by the name of
                    Otho Venius, a painter of singular merit, and who was not only skilled in the
                    principles of his art, but also distinguished for learning and other
                    accomplishments. Between the master and the scholar a remarkable similarity
                    appeared in temper and inclination; indeed the whole turn of their minds was the
                    same. It was this congeniality of sentiments which animated Rubens with that
                    ardent passion for the art of painting which at length determined him to pursue
                    it as a profession. From this time he gave up his whole mind to it; and so
                    successful were his exertions, that he soon equalled his master.</p>
                <p>In order to arrive at that perfection which he already beheld in idea, it became
                    requisite to study the productions of the most eminent artists; and for this
                    purpose he travelled throughout Italy, visiting the most valuable collections of
                    paintings and antique statues with which that country abounds.</p>
                <p>Sandrat, who was intimately acquainted with Rubens, informs us that he was
                    recommended to the Duke of Mantua by the Archduke Albert, who had witnessed his
                    talents in the finishing of some fine paintings designed for his own palace. At
                    Mantua he was received by the duke with the most flattering marks of
                    distinction, and had opportunities of improving himself, which he did not
                    neglect. He there carefully studied the works of Julio Romano; and he next
                    visited Rome, where he had an opportunity of examining the productions of
                    Raffaelle. The paintings of Titian and Paul Veronese called him to Venice, where
                    he improved himself in the art of colouring.</p>
                <p>He continued in Italy seven years. At length receiving intelligence that his
                    mother was taken ill, he hastened to Antwerp. But his filial affection was not
                    gratified with a sight of her. She died before his arrival. He married soon
                    afterwards; but his wife dying at the end of four years, he retired for some
                    time from Antwerp, and endeavoured to soothe his melancholy by a journey to
                    Holland. At Utrecht he visited Hurtort, whom he greatly esteemed.</p>
                <p>The fame of Rubens was now spread all over Europe. He was invited by Mary de’
                    Medici, queen of Henry IV. of France, to Paris, where he painted the galleries
                    in the palace of Luxembourg. These form a series of paintings which delineate
                    the history of Mary; and afford a convincing proof how well qualified he was to
                    excel in allegorical and emblematical compositions. Whilst at Paris he became
                    acquainted with the Duke of Buckingham, who was so taken with his great talents
                    and accomplishments, that he judged him well qualified to explain to Isabella,
                    the wife of Albert the archduke, the cause of the misunderstanding which had
                    taken place between the courts of England and Spain. In this employment Rubens
                    acquitted himself with such propriety, that Isabella appointed him envoy to the
                    king of Spain, with a commission to propose terms of peace, and to bring back
                    the instructions of that monarch. Philip was not less captivated with Rubens,
                    conferring on him the honour of knighthood, and making him secretary to his
                    privy council. Rubens returned to Brussels, and thence passed over into England
                    in 1630 with a commission from the Catholic king to negotiate a peace between
                    the two crowns. He was successful in his negotiation, and a treaty was
                    concluded. Charles I. who then filled the British throne, could not receive
                    Rubens in a public character on account of his profession; nevertheless, he
                    treated him with every mark of respect. Having engaged him to paint some of the
                    apartments of Whitehall, he not only gave him a handsome sum of money, but, as
                    an acknowledgment of his merit, created him a knight; and the Duke of
                    Buckingham, his friend and patron, purchased of him a collection of pictures,
                    statues, medals, and antiques, for the sum of ten thousand pounds.</p>
                <p>He returned to Spain, where he was magnificently honoured arid rewarded for his
                    services, being created a gentleman of the king’s bed-chamber, and named
                    secretary to the council of state in the Netherlands. Rubens, however, did not
                    lay aside his profession. He returned to Antwerp, where he married a second
                    wife, called Helena Forment, who, being an eminent beauty, helped him much in
                    the figures of his women. But he died on the 30th of May 1640, in the
                    sixty-third year of his age, leaving vast riches to his children. Albert his
                    eldest son succeeded him in the office of secretary of state in Flanders.</p>
                <p>As Rubens was possessed of all the ornaments and advantages that render a man
                    worthy to be esteemed or courted, he was always treated as a person of
                    consequence. His figure was noble, his manners engaging, and his conversation
                    lively. His learning was universal. Though his favourite study must have
                    occupied him much, yet he found time to read the works of the most celebrated
                    authors, especially the poets. He spoke several languages perfectly, and was an
                    able statesman, as well as an excellent painter. His house at Antwerp was
                    enriched with every thing that was rare and valuable in the arts. It contained
                    one spacious apartment, in imitation of the rotunda at Rome, adorned with a
                    choice collection of pictures which he had purchased in Italy, part of which he
                    sold to the Duke of Buckingham.</p>
                <p>His genius qualified him to excel equally in every thing that can enter into the
                    composition of a picture. His invention was so fertile, that, if he had occasion
                    to paint the same subject several times, his imagination always supplied him
                    with something striking and new. The attitudes of his figures are natural and
                    varied, the carriage of the head is peculiarly graceful, and his expression is
                    noble and animated.</p>
                <p>He is by all allowed to have carried the art of colouring to its highest pitch.
                    He understood so thoroughly the true principles of the chiaro-scuro, that he
                    gave to his figures the utmost harmony, and a prominence resembling real life.
                    His pencil is mellowed, his strokes are bold and easy, his carnation glows with
                    life, and his drapery is simple but grand, broad, and hung with much skill. The
                    great excellence of Rubens appears in his grand compositions. For as they are to
                    be viewed at a distance, he laid on a proper body of colours with uncommon
                    boldness, and fixed all his tints in their proper places; so that he never
                    impaired their lustre by breaking or torturing them, but touched them in such a
                    manner as to give them a lasting force, beauty, and harmony.</p>
                <p>It is generally allowed that Rubens wanted correctness in drawing and designing;
                    some of his figures being heavy and too short, and the limbs in certain parts
                    not being justly sketched in the outline. Though he had spent seven years in
                    Italy in studying those antiques by which other celebrated artists had modelled
                    their taste, and though he had examined them with such minute attention as not
                    only to perceive their beauties, but to be qualified to describe them in a
                    dissertation which he wrote on that subject; yet he seems never to have divested
                    himself of that heavy style of painting which, being peculiar to his native
                    country, he had insensibly acquired. The astonishing rapidity too with which he
                    painted, made him fall into inaccuracies, from which those works that he
                    finished with care are entirely exempted. Amongst his finished pieces may be
                    mentioned the Crucifixion of Jesus Christ between the Two Thieves; but of all
                    his works the paintings in the palace of Luxembourg best display his genius and
                    his style.</p>
                <p>It is the observation of Algarotti, that he was more moderate in his movements
                    than Tintoretto, and softer in his chiaro-scuro than Carravaggio; but not so
                    rich in his compositions,<pb break="no"

                    nor so light in his touches, as Paul Veronese, in his carnations less true than
                    Titian, and less delicate than</p>
                <p>" Vandyck. Yet he contrived to give his colours the utmost transparency and
                    harmony, notwithstanding their extraordinary deepness; and he possessed a
                    strength and grandeur of style which were entirely his own. See the article
