                <p><label type="entry">REYNOLDS, Sir Joshua</label>, the celebrated painter, was
                    born at Plympton, a small town in Devonshire, on the 16th July 1723. His father
                    was minister of the parish, and also master of the grammar school; and being a
                    man of learning and philanthropy, he was beloved and respected by all to whom he
                    was known. Such a man, it will naturally be supposed, was assiduous in the
                    cultivation of the minds of his children, amongst whom his son Joshua shone
                    conspicuous, by displaying at a very early period a superiority of genius and
                    the rudiments of a correct taste. Unlike other boys, who generally content
                    themselves with giving a literal explanation of their author, regardless of his
                    beauties or his faults, young Reynolds attended to both these, displaying a
                    happy knowledge of what he read, and entering with ardour into the spirit of his
                    author. He discovered likewise talents for composition, and a natural propensity
                    for drawing, in which his friends and intimates thought him qualified to excel.
                    Emulation was a distinguishing feature in his mind, which his father perceived
                    with the delight natural to a parent; and designing him for the church, in which
                    he hoped that his talents might raise him to eminence, he sent him to one of the
                    universities.</p>
                <p>Soon after this period he grew passionately fond of painting; and, by the perusal
                    of Richardson’s theory of that art was determined to make it his profession
                    through'life. At his own earnest request therefore, he was removed to London;
                    and about the year 1742 became a pupil to Mr Hudson, who, though not himself an
                    eminent painter, was preceptor to several who afterwards excelled in the art.
                    One of the first advices which he gave to Mr Reynolds was to copy carefully
                    Guercino’s drawings. This was done with such skill, that many of the copies are
                    said to be now preserved in the cabinets of the curious as the originals of that
                    very great master.</p>
                <p>About the year 1749, Mr Reynolds went to Italy under the auspices and in the
                    company of Lord, then Commodore, Keppel, who was appointed to the command of the
                    British squadron in the Mediterranean. In this garden of the world, this magical
                    seat of the arts, he failed not to visit the schools of the great masters, to
                    study the productions of different ages, and to contemplate with unwearied
                    attention the various beauties which are characteristic of each. His labour
                    here, as has been observed of another painter, was “the labour of love, not the
                    task of the hireling ;” and how much he profited by it is known to all
                    Europe.</p>
                <p>Having remained about two years in Italy, and studied the language as well as the
                    arts of the country with great success, he returned to England, improved by
                    travel and refined by education. On the road to London from the port where he
                    landed, he accidentally found in the inn where he lodged Johnson’s life of
                    Savage; and was so taken with the charms of composition and the masterly
                    delineation of character displayed in that performance, that having begun to
                    read it whilst leaning with his arm on the chimney-piece, he continued in that
                    attitude insensible of pain till he was hardly able to raise his hand to his
                    head. The admiration <pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:wu.89119129625&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=206" xml:id="kp-eb0719-0206-0196"
                    />of the work naturally led him to seek the acquaintance of its author, who
                    continued one of his most sincere admirers and warmest friends till 1784, when
                    they were separated by the stroke of death.</p>
                <p>The first thing that distinguished him after his return to his native country,
                    was a full-length portrait of Commodore Keppel; which in the polite circles was
                    spoken of in terms of the highest encomium, and testified to what a degree of
                    eminence he had arrived in his profession. This was followed by a portrait of
                    Lord Edgecumbe, and a few others, which at once introduced him to the first
                    business in portrait-painting; and that branch of the art he cultivated with
                    such success as will for ever establish his fame with all descriptions of
                    refined society. Having painted some of the first-rate beauties of the age, the
                    polite world flocked to see the graces and the charms of his pencil; and he soon
                    became the most fashionable painter, not only in England, but in all Europe. He
                    has indeed preserved the resemblance of so many illustrious characters, that we
                    feel the less regret for his having left behind him so few historical paintings;
                    though what he has done in that way shows him to have been qualified to excel in
                    both departments. <note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>As

                    he ever painted, except those beautiful and chaste ones which compose the back
                    grounds of many of his portraits, is a View on the Thames from Richmond, which
                    in 1784 was exhibited by the Society for Promoting Painting and Design in
                    Liverpool.</p>
                <p>In 1764 Mr Reynolds had the merit of being the first promoter of that club which,
                    having long existed without a name, became at last distinguished by the
                    appellation of the <hi rend="italic">Literary Club.</hi> Upon the foundation of
                    the Royal Academy of Painting, Sculpture, and Architecture, he was appointed
                    president; and his acknowledged excellence in his profession made the
                    appointment acceptable to all the lovers of art. To add to the dignity of this
                    new institution, his majesty conferred on the president the honour of
                    knighthood; and Sir Joshua delivered his first discourse at the opening of the
                    academy on the 2d of January 1769. The merit of that discourse has been
                    universally admitted among painters; but it contains some directions respecting
                    the proper mode of prosecuting their studies, to which every student of every
                    art would do well to pay attention. “I would chiefly recommend,” says he, “that
                    an implicit obedience to the rules of art, as established by the practice of the
                    great masters, should be exacted from the young students. That those models
                    which have passed through the approbation of ages should be considered by them
                    as perfect and infallible guides; as subjects for their imitation, not their
                    criticism. I am confident, that this is the only efficacious method of making a
                    progress in the arts; and that he who sets out with doubting, will find life
                    finished before he becomes master of the rudiments. For it may be laid down as a
                    maxim, that he who begins by presuming on his own sense, has ended his studies
                    as soon as he has commenced them. Every opportunity, therefore, should be taken
                    to discountenance that false and vulgar opinion, that rules are the fetters of
                    genius. They are fetters only to men of no genius; as that armour which, upon
                    the strong, becomes an ornament and a defence, upon the weak and mishapen turns
                    into a load, and cripples the body which it was made to protect.”</p>
                <p>Each succeeding year, on the distribution of the prizes, Sir Joshua delivered to
                    the students a discourse of equal merit with this: and perhaps we do not hazard
                    too much when we say, that, from the whole collected, the lover of belles
                    lettres and the fine arts will acquire juster notions of what is meant by taste
                    in general, and better rules for acquiring a correct taste, than from multitudes
                    of those volumes which have been professedly written on the subject.</p>
                <p>In the autumn of 1785 he went to Brussels, where he expended about L.1000 on the
                    purchase of paintings, which, having been taken from the different monasteries
                    and religious houses in Flanders and Germany, were then exposed to sale by the
                    command of the Emperor Joseph. Gainsborough and he had engaged to paint each
                    other’s portrait; and the canvass for both being actually stretched, Sir Joshua
                    gave one sitting to his distinguished rival; but, to the regret of every admirer
                    of the art, the unexpected death of the latter prevented all further
                    progress.</p>
                <p>In 1790 he was anxiously desirous to procure the vacant professorship of
                    perspective in the academy for Mr Bononi, an Italian architect; but that artist
                    no* having been yet elected an associate, was of course no academician, and it
                    became necessary to raise him to these situations, in order to qualify him for
                    being a professor. Mr Gilpin being his competitor for the associateship, the
                    numbers on the ballot proved equal, when the president by his casting vote
                    decided the election in favour of his friend, who was thereby advanced so far
                    towards the professorship. Soon after this, an academic seat being vacant, Sir
                    Joshua exerted all his influence to obtain it for Mr Bononi; but finding himself
                    cutvoted by a majority of two to one, he quitted the chair with great
                    dissatisfaction, and next day sent to the secretary of the academy a formal
                    resignation of the office, which for twenty-one years he had filled with honour
                    to himself and his country. His indignation, however, subsiding, he suffered
                    himself to be prevailed upon to return to the chair, which within a year and a
                    half he was again desirous to quit for a better reason.</p>
                <p>Finding a disease of languor, occasioned by an enlargement of the liver, to which
                    he had for some time been subject, increase upon him, and daily expecting the
                    total loss of sight, he wrote a letter to the academy, intimating his intention
                    to resign the office of president on account of bodily infirmities, which
                    disabled him from executing the duties of it to his own satisfaction. The
                    academicians received this intelligence with the respectful concern due to the
                    talents and virtues of their president; and either then did enter, or designed
                    to enter, into a resolution, honourable to all parties, namely, that a
                    deputation from the whole body of the academy should wait upon him, and inform
                    him <hi rend="italic">of</hi> their wish, that the authority and privileges of
                    the office of president might be his during his life; declaring their wil<pb
                    break="no" facs="ht:wu.89119129625&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=207"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0719-0207-0197"/>lingness to permit the performance of any of its
                    duties which might be irksome to him by a deputy.</p>
                <p>From this period Sir Joshua never painted more. The last effort of his pencil was
                    the portrait of Charles James Fox, which was executed in his best style, and
                    shows that his fancy, his imagination, and his other great powers in the art
                    which he professed, remained unabated to the end of his life. When the last
                    touches were given to this picture,</p>
                <p>The hand of Reynolds fell, to rise no more.</p>
                <p>On Thursday the 23d of February 1792, the world was deprived of this amiable man
                    and excellent artist, at the age of sixty-eight years; a man than whom no one,
                    according to Johnson, had passed through life with more observation of men and
                    manners. The following character of him is said to be the production of Mr
                    Burke.</p>
                <p>“His illness was long, but borne with a mild and cheerful fortitude, without the
                    least mixture of anything irritable or querulous, agreeably to the placid and
                    even tenor of his whole life. He had from the beginning of his malady a distinct
                    view of his dissolution, which he contemplated with that entire cotnposure which
                    nothing but the innocence, integrity, and usefulness of his life, and an
                    unaffected submission to the will of Providence, could bestow. In this situation
                    he had every consolation from family tenderness, which his tenderness to his
                    family had always merited.</p>
                <p>“Sir Joshua Reynolds was, on very many accounts, one of the most memorable men of
                    his time; he was the first Englishman who added the praise of the elegant arts
                    to the other glories of his country. In taste, in grace, in facility, in happy
                    invention, and in the richness and harmony of colouring, he was equal to the
                    great masters of the renowned ages. In portrait he went beyond them; for he
                    communicated to that description of the art in which English artists are the
                    most engaged, a variety, a fancy, and a dignity, derived from the higher
                    branches, which even those who professed them in a superior manner did not
                    always preserve when they delineated individual nature. His portraits remind the
                    spectator of the invention of history and the amenity of landscape. In painting
                    portraits he appears not to be raised upon that platform, but to descend to it
                    from a higher sphere. His paintings illustrate his lessons, and his lessons seem
                    to be derived from his paintings.</p>
                <p>“He possessed the theory as perfectly as the practice of his art. To be such a
                    painter, he was a profound and penetrating philosopher.</p>
                <p>“In full happiness of foreign and domestic fame, admired by the expert in art,
                    and by the learned in science, courted by the great, caressed by sovereign
                    powers, and celebrated by distinguished poets, his native humility, modesty, and
                    candour never forsook him, even on surprise or provocation; nor was the least
                    degree of arrogance or assumption visible to the scrutinizing eye in any part of
                    his conduct or discourse.</p>
                <p>“His talents of every kind, powerful from nature, and not meanly cultivated in
                    letters, his social virtues in all the relations and all the habitudes of life,
                    rendered him the centre of a very great and unparalleled variety of agreeable
                    societies, which will be dissipated by his death. He had too much merit not to
                    excite some jealousy, too much innocence to provoke any enmity. The loss of no
                    man of his time can be felt with more sincere, general, and unmixed sorrow.” See
