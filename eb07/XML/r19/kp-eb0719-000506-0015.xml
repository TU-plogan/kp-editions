                    significant corrections to the OCR text, predominantly in cases of confusing "c"
                    and "e." Isolates 90 entries that were mistakenly included at the end of prior
                    entries in v1 and v2. Normalizes ordinal numbers. Separates metadata in
                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra
                    space around the <gi>pb</gi> tag. Where a word is hyphenated at a <gi>pb</gi>,

                <p><label type="entry">RACINE</label> John, a great and illustrious French poet, was
                    born at Ferte-Milon on the 21st of December. 1630. He was the son of John
                    Racine, controller of the salt magazine of that city, and of Joan Sconin,
                    daughter of the king’s warden of the woods and waters of Villers-Caterets.
                    Deprived of his father and mother at the early age of three, he passed under
                    tile guardianship of his paternal grandfather, also named John Racine, who, not
                    long afterwards, bequeathed the trust to his widow. He studied first at
                    Beauvais; next at Paris, in the college of Fearcount; and lastly at
                    Port-Royal-des-Champs, whither a number of eminent persons had retired to devote
                    themselves to piety and the instruction of youth, amongst whom were the advocate
                    Lemaitre, Dr. Hamon, Nicoe, Lacy, and Launcelot, authors of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Logic,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">General Grammar,</hi> and other
                    works, known under the title of <hi rend="italic">Me· thodes de Port-Royal.</hi>
                    Launcelot, in particular, undertook to teach Greek to the youthful Racine. But
                    besides the taste for sound literature and serious studies, these mn-mortal
                    solitaries inspired their pupil with those religious principles which never
                    abandoned him, and which were common to an the great writers and great men of
                    that age. The docility of Racine towards his masters equalled his ardour for
                    study. On one occasion, however, he showed himself refractory. Having
                    accidentally met with the Greek romance of <hi rend="italic">Theagenes and
                    Chariclea,</hi> he commenced the perusal of this work of fiction, when his
                    master surprising him, whilst thus engaged, took from him the book, and
                    consigned it to the flames. The youth procured another copy, and learned it by
                    heart, after which he placed it in the hands of Launcelot, saying, “You may bum
                    this also.” An act of disobedience of a kind so novel was the more readily
                    excused because it was not likely to have many imitators.</p>
                <p>The first poetical essay of Racine was <hi rend="italic">La Nymphe de la
                    Seine,</hi> an ode which he composed for the marriage of Louis XIV. and which
                    having made him known to Chaplain, the temporary arbiter of literary reputations
                    and court favours, produced him a hundred louis, which Colbert sent him on the
                    part of the king; and not long afterwards, he received a pension of six hundred
                    livres. Four years later, towards the close of 1663, another ode, <hi
                    rend="italic">La Renommée aux Muses,</hi> composed on the occasion of the
                    establishment of the three Academies, procured for him a second royal gratuity,
                    the order for which was couched in terms peculiarly flattering to the youthful
                    poet. This ode, though inferior to the preceding, was nevertheless more
                    fortunate. Recompensed, like the other, by the king, it had the good fortune to
                    be criticised by Boileau. The poet took an early opportunity to thank the
                    critic, and this proved the origin of that connexion so intimate, so honourable,
                    so useful to Racine, and which was not one of the least advantages which fortune
                    gave him over Corneille. A little before this period, Racine had made the
                    acquaintance of Molière, and had communicated to him a tragedy, entitled <hi
                    rend="italic">Theagene et Chari-clee,</hi> taken from the romance, which had
                    afforded him such delight at Port-Royal. Molière, disapproving of this
                    production, gave him the plan of the <hi rend="italic">Thébaide, ou les Frères
                    Ennemis,</hi> a subject on which it is alleged that he had himself been engaged.
                    Racine executed the design, and the piece had some success. <hi rend="italic"
                    >Alexandre,</hi> which was performed the following year, 1665, met with a still
                    more favourable reception, and showed great progress in the versification of the
                    author, who was then only twenty-five years of age. But, excepting the verses,
                    neither of these works gave any indication of what Racine afterwards proved.
                    They were but feeble imitations of Corneille, of whom, by a misfortune common to
                    all imitators, Racine had only adopted the defects; that is, the cold gallantry
                    mixed with heroism, the idle maxims, the metaphysical reasonings, and the
                    elaborate declamation. Corneille, to whom Racine read his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Alexandre,</hi> counselled him, it is said, to write no more tragedies. At a
                    subsequent period the same advice was given to Voltaire by Fontenelle, after the
                    reading of <hi rend="italic">Brutus.</hi> But it is fortunate for letters that
                    such counsels are never followed. Voltaire replied to Fontenelle by the
                    production of <hi rend="italic">Zaire,</hi> and Racine responded to Comeille by
                    that of his <hi rend="italic">Andro-maque.</hi> Finding himself pursuing a wrong
                    direction, he suddenly changed his route and took a different one, unknown
                    perhaps even to Comeille himself. The latter had astonished and surprised his
                    audience; his young rival sought to move and to soften them. Pity appeared to
                    him a tragic resource more active, more extensive, and of an effect more
                    penetrating and less transitory, than admiration. He studied the human heart,
                    its passions, its weaknesses, and its most secret recesses, and there he
                    discovered a species of tragedy altogether new, of which he gave the first and
                    probably most inimitable model in his <hi rend="italic">Andromaque;</hi> that
                    one of all his tragedies which, without being the most perfect, produces the
                    greatest effect on the stage, by the vigorous and just expression of the
                    sentiments and characters, and by the alternations of hope and fear, of terror
                    and pity, with which the poet agitates the soul.</p>
                <p>The representation of the <hi rend="italic">Andromaque</hi> in 1667, was followed
                    almost every year by a new masterpiece. But at first Racine surprised the public
                    by an excursion into the domain of Molière. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >Plaideurs,</hi> imitated from the <hi rend="italic">Wasps</hi> of Aristophanes,
                    is a comedy the plot of which is somewhat feeble and inartificial; but in
                    nature, truth, facility, and <pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:wu.89119129625&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=16" xml:id="kp-eb0719-0016-0006"
                    />gaiety, it is admirable, and its verses became so fixed in the general mind
                    that they passed into proverbs. The piece was first represented at Paris in
                    1668, when it was indifferently received; but it succeeded pretty well at
                    Versailles, and the players, elated with the success, came to awaken Racine in
                    the middle of the night, to communicate the good news. The noise of vehicles at
                    such an hour, in the Rue des Marais, convinced first the neighbours, and next
                    day all Paris, that justice had avenged itself on the author of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Plaideurs,</hi> by causing him to be seized and sent to the
                    Bastille. This pleasant mistake, and the knowledge which soon became general,
                    that the comedy had obtained the suffrage of the monarch, conciliated the favour
                    of the loyal Parisians; and from that time the piece has continued in possession
                    of the stage, privileged to extort a smile, perchance a laugh, even from the
                    iron visage of justice herself It is not true, as has sometimes been said, that
                    the <hi rend="italic">Plaideurs</hi> is the work of several hands. Racine may
                    have received from his friends hints or suggestions for some scenes, and
                    borrowed from certain <hi rend="italic">hommes de palais,</hi> or gentlemen of
                    the robe, some formulas and expressions foreign to his habitual studies; but the
                    unity of the style and the general coherence of the whole are too perfect to be
                    the work of any but one and the same hand.</p>
                <p>The success of the <hi rend="italic">Andromaque,</hi> which was only equalled by
                    that of the <hi rend="italic">Cid,</hi> had excited envy; perhaps, also, it had
                    rendered the public fastidious. In 1669, <hi rend="italic">Britannicus</hi> was
                    coldly received, and with difficulty reached the eighth representation. At first
                    no one felt the truth, the depth, and the force displayed in the magnificent
                    historical picture of Nero and his court. Boileau alone was struck with its
                    merit, and hurrying to embrace Racine, he exclaimed, “Voila ce que vous avez
                    fait de mieux.” This great critic was not only useful to Racine in praising his
                    performance, his severity was of full more service in inducing him to suppress
                    two scenes which deformed his work; one between Burrhus and Narcissa, at the
                    commencement of the third act; and another, in the fifth, in which Junia is
                    brought back into the presence of Nero. <hi rend="italic">Britannicus</hi> was
                    followed by <hi rend="italic">Berenice,</hi> which, in some respects, is one of
                    the most remarkable of Racine’s works. At the solicitation of the celebrated
                    Henrietta of England, Racine and Corneille both treated this subject which is so
                    little fitted for representation, neither being aware that the other was engaged
                    upon it. Besides the pleasure of seeing two illustrious rivals unconsciously
                    contending for the palm, this princess secretly promised herself another, in the
                    treatment of the heroic separation of the two august lovers; but a premature
                    death deprived her of the pleasure she had anticipated, in witnessing this
                    singular competition. Three words of Suetonius represent the subject of the
                    piece: <hi rend="italic">Invitus invitam dimisit;</hi> too slight a foundation
                    upon which to work, and in the case of Corneille, who was now old, an ungrateful
                    task, far more dangerous to him than even to Racine. The two rival plays were
                    represented towards the close of 1670; that of Corneille at the Palais-Royal, by
                    the company of Molière, and that of Racine at the Hôtel de Bourgogne.
                    Corneille’s totally failed; that of Racine had thirty consecutive
                    representations, during which it drew tears alike from the court and the city.
                    The great Conde replied to some criticisms which were made in his hearing in the
                    following verses of the piece itself:</p>
                <p>Depuis cinq ans entiers chaque jour je la vois,</p>
                <p>Et crois toujours la voir pour la première fois.</p>
                <p>It has been said, and even zealous admirers of Racine have confessed, that <hi
                    rend="italic">Berenice</hi> was not a veritable tragedy. But, tragedy or drama,
                    what signifies the title which maybe given to it, provided we be agreed that it
                    is a miracle of art, and that never, in any piece, were greater difficulties
                    more meritoriously overcome. The style possesses exquisite beauties in detail,
                    and an inexpressible charm pervades the diction throughout.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Bajazet</hi> appeared in 1672, and obtained immediate vogue,
                    partly, no doubt, from the novelty of the manners and costumes, but in a greater
                    degree, from admiration of the force and truth with which the poet had
                    delineated the characters of Roxana and Acomat; two real creations, which, in
                    spite of all its faults, will make <hi rend="italic">Bgjazet</hi> immortal. At
                    the same time, there is not a little truth in the remark of Corneille, that
                    though the costumes be Turkish, the characters are French. <hi rend="italic"
                    >Mithridate,</hi> which was represented for the first time in January 1678, is,
                    according to Lallarpe, the work where Racine appears to have come nearest to
                    Corneille in bringing on the stage the great personages of antiquity, as they
                    are delineated in history. Few characters, indeed, have, upon the whole, been
                    more vigorously traced than that of Mithridates; and were it not that Racine,
                    sacrificing to the taste of the time, has made the hero amorous and jealous,
                    Corneille would not have enjoyed unquestioned supremacy in reviving and
                    reanimating history. Voltaire regards <hi rend="italic">Iphigénie,</hi> first
                    represented in 1674, as the masterpiece of the stage. Do we desire grandeur? We
                    find it in Achilles. Do we wish for true policy? It is exemplified in the part
                    of Ulysses; a policy founded solely on the love of the public good, and equally
                    adroit, dignified, and resolute. Clytem-nestra is the model of the lofty
                    pathetic; Iphigenia, that of noble and touching simplicity. Agamemnon is as he
                    should be; and, then as to the style, Voltaire has declared it to be the true
                    sublime. Three years elapsed between tile appearance of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Iphigénie</hi> and that of <hi rend="italic">Phèdre,</hi> which was first
                    represented in 1677. The former had been the object of sundry ill-natured and
                    depreciatory criticisms; but all these were only a feeble essay, or rather a
                    mere foretaste, of the attacks which were now directed against the latter,
                    chiefly at the instigation of the Duke de Nevers and the Duchess de Bouillon,
                    nephew and niece of Cardinal Mazarin, the declared enemies of Racine, though for
                    what reason does not appear. Every engine was put in action to ensure the
                    condemnation of Racine’s <hi rend="italic">Phèdre,</hi> and extol to the skies
                    that of Pradon, a person of no genius, and whose name is not worth remembering,
                    except that he was employed by the chiefs of his odious cabal to have a drama on
                    the same subject ready for representation against the time when Racine’s was to
                    appear. Pradon lent himself to the vengeance of these intriguers; his <hi
                    rend="italic">Phèdre</hi> was represented four days after that of Racine; and,
                    for the moment, the cabal were successful. But, in about a year, each piece
                    found its natural level, and Pradon and his <hi rend="italic">Phèdre</hi> were
                    alike forgotten or despised.</p>
                <p>This tardy reparation, however, could not console Racine; and, besides, it was
                    poisoned by new indignities, which were heaped upon him by his indefatigable
                    enemies. Disgusted with the theatre, where he had met with such injustice, he
                    now determined to renounce it for ever; though not more than thirty-eight years
                    of age, and still in all the vigour and maturity of his genius. Besides, in his
                    infancy, he had imbibed a deep sense of religion, which, suppressed for a while
                    by his connexion with the theatre, now returned in full force. He conceived that
                    his past life had been full of errors, nay, even tainted by vices, and, under
                    this impression he not only resolved to write no more plays, but had even
                    thoughts of devoting himself to penitence and prayer in monastic solitude. His
                    spiritual guide, however, justly distrusting a zeal springing out of wounded
                    feelings, advised him to marry and settle in the world; and this judicious
                    advice Racine had the good sense to comply withal. In the year 1677 he married
                    the daughter of the treasurer of Amiens, a fortunate choice, which greatly
                    contributed to his future happiness. He next effected a reconciliation with the
                    solitaries of Port-Royal, whose censures of dramatic composition, which had
                    formerly offended him, he now acknow<pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:wu.89119129625&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=17" xml:id="kp-eb0719-0017-0007"
                    />ledged. He first made his peace with Nicoe, who received him with open arms;
                    and Boileau introduced him to Ar-nauld, who also embraced him tenderly, at the
                    same time freely forgiving him all his satire. About the same time Louis XIV.
                    appointed Racine and Boileau historiographers of France, upon the understanding,
                    of course, that they were to write the history of his reign; and the public
                    expected great things from two writers of such distinguished reputation. But
                    both the king and his subjects were equally disappointed. Boileau and Racine,
                    after having for some time laboured at the work, perceived that it was entirely
                    opposite to the genius of each; and they also judged, with reason, that the
                    history of such a king could not, and indeed ought not, to be written until long
                    after his death, unless it were to be made up of extracts of gazettes and such
                    like materials.</p>
                <p>During a period of twelve years, Racine had steadily adhered to his resolution
                    not to write any more poetry, especially for the stage; but the entreaties of
                    Madame de Main-tenon so far prevailed as to induce him to resume his dramatic
                    character, and in consequence he composed his <hi rend="italic">Esther,</hi>
                    which was to be represented, not on the French stage, but in the house of
                    Saint-Cyr. On the 20th of January 1689, it was performed for the first time, and
                    had prodigious success. “It appears to me very remarkable,” says Voltaire, “that
                    this tragedy should then have had universal success, and that two years
                    afterwards <hi rend="italic">Athalie,</hi> though performed by the same persons,
                    had none. It happened quite otherwise when these pieces were acted at Paris long
                    after the death of the author, and when prejudice and partiality had ceased. <hi
                    rend="italic">Athalie,</hi> represented in 1717, was received, as it deserved to
                    be, with transport; whilst <hi rend="italic">Esther,</hi> in 1721, inspired
                    nothing but coldness, and never appeared again. But at that time there were no
                    courtiers who complaisantly acknowledged Esther in Madame de Maintenon, and with
                    equal malignity saw Vashti in Madame de Montespan, Haman in M. de Louvois, and
                    above all, the persecution of the Hugonots by this minister, in the proscription
                    of the Hebrew’s.” The same writer, who had no taste for scriptural subjects,
                    thinks the story of <hi rend="italic">Esther</hi> uninteresting and even
                    improbable; “but, notwithstanding the badness of the subject,” he adds, “thirty
                    verses of <hi rend="italic">Esther</hi> are of more value than many tragedies
                    which have had great success.”</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Athalie,</hi> composed, like Esther, for Saint-Cyr, had, as
                    already intimated, a very different fate. Envy masked under a false zeal
                    prevented the representation. It was only performed twice at Versailles, in a
                    chamber without scenes and costumes, by the ladies of Saint-Cyr. Racine having
                    Originally intended it for publication, now sent it to the press; but, to the
                    eternal disgrace of the age and nation, this masterpiece of sublime genius,
                    unsurpassed either in ancient or in modern times, found no readers; and, in some
                    societies of pretended wits, the perusal of it was ironically prescribed as
                    penance. It is in truth lamentable to think that Racine should have descended to
                    the grave suffering under this injustice, and with the bitter feeling of seeing
                    his age dissatisfied with his immortal work. In vain did Arnauld, from the depth
                    of his solitude, try to sustain, by his suffrage, the sinking spirits of his old
                    pupil; in vain did Boileau repeat, “C’est votre meilleur ouvrage, le public y
                    reviendra.” Racine almost believed that he had survived his genius, and the
                    authority of Boileau, so potential with posterity, was disregarded during the
                    lifetime of his friend. This second injustice of the public towards Racine
                    reopened the wound inflicted by the first, completed his disgust, and decided
                    him to abandon definitively writing for the theatre, which, in fact, his
                    religious impressions had, for some time, led him to regard as incompatible with
                    the Christian life. He accordingly withdrew' from all connection with the stage,
                    and employed the remainder of his days in the grateful and almost filial task of
                    composing a history of Port-Royal, the place of his education, which is drawn up
                    with equal taste and elegance, but was not published till 1767, when it appeared
                    in two volumes 12mo.</p>
                <p>Racine, although he had conversed much with the court, had not learned to
                    disguise his sentiments, the usual, perhaps the necessary accomplishment of a
                    courtier. In 1697, during one of those interviews which Madame de Maintenon
                    frequently granted him, the conversation having turned upon the misery of the
                    people exhausted by long wars, and the best means of affording them relief, this
                    celebrated woman entreated the poet to throw his ideas on the subject into the
                    form of a memoir, promising that the writing should not pass out of her hands.
                    Racine consented, not from the mere complaisance of a courtier, and still less
                    from any ambitious view, which the whole tenor of his life contradicts, but
                    solely with the design of being useful. The king surprised this memoir in the
                    hands of his mistress, and the name of the author was disclosed. Perhaps the
                    lesson was a little too direct, since the monarch, who had all along favoured
                    the poet, immediately took offence. “Because he makes good verses,” said Louis,
                    “does he think he knows every thing? and because he is a great poet, does
                    hepretend to be a statesman ?” Racine was greatly hurt by this observation, not
                    from any selfish consideration, but from the idea of having unnecessarily
                    offended his royal benefactor. But to say as some have done, that it shortened
                    his days, is manifestly absurd. His constitution had for several years been
                    sinking under the wasting influence of excitement, and, in consequence, the term
                    of his earthly career was now fast approaching. During his last illness,
                    however, the king evinced the greatest interest in the expiring poet, about whom
                    he daily sent to make the most anxious inquiries; and his benefits followed him
                    even beyond the tomb. Racine died on the 22d of April, 1699, after much
                    suffering, borne with truly Christian fortitude, and was interred, according to
                    his wish, at Port-Royal, at the feet of Dr. Hamon, that he might not be
                    separated even in death, from the master whom he so loved and respected in life.
                    After the destruction of this monastery, his remains were transported to Paris,
                    and deposited in the church of Saint-Etienne-du-Mont, where they were placed
                    beside those of Pascal.</p>
                <p>Racine was naturally melancholy when alone, though gentle and pleasing with
                    others. His nature was tender and affectionate, inclined to indulge sorrowful or
                    religious emotions rather than those which spring out of mirth or joy. He was
                    generous, and knew how to preserve the means of being so by much order and
                    economy. He afforded assistance to a number of distant relations, and had a
                    regard almost filial for his nurse, whom he did not forget in his will. There
                    was no better husband, no more affectionate father. The Christian education of
                    his children formed his chief concern. He had family prayers daily, at the same
                    time reading and explaining a portion of the gospel to his wife, his children,
                    and his domestics. During the last ten years of his life, all his pleasures, and
                    all his happiness were concentred in his domestic circle. He no longer went to
                    court except when called thither by the duties of his charge, and the interests
                    of his family; and yet who else could boast of the same meansof pleasing and
                    making himself beloved; his fine and noble figure, his gracious manners, all the
                    charms of wit, all the splendour of renown, united with the happy art of causing
                    them to be forgotten? He was, indeed, what the ladies of Saint-Cyr described
                    him, a man of great genius and great simplicity; and he had, in fact, enchanted
                    the world, more by the amenity and grace of his instructions, than by his talent
                    for declamation, which, however, he possessed in the very highest degree. No man
                    of his time read and recited better than Racine. One day, at Boileau’s, in his
                    house at Anteuil, reading and translating off-hand the <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Edipus</hi> of Sophocles, he drew tears from all present. He also taught Baron
                    and La Champmale a system of declamation more conformable to nature and good
                    taste, or. to express it <pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:wu.89119129625&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=18" xml:id="kp-eb0719-0018-0008"
                    />more correctly, he taught them to speak and not to declaim.</p>
                <p>Asto his works, his countrymen have reason to be proud of them. He is the poet of
                    theheart and the affections, and yields to none in the truth, the beauty, and
                    the force of his delineations. If Corneillesurpassed him in heroic sentiments,
                    and the grand character of his personages, he was inferior to Racine in moving
                    the passions, and in purity of diction. Such is the perfection of Racine in this
                    last respect, that in all his pieces, there is not perhaps, we do not say a
                    scene, but even a single verse, which could be replaced by another. All is just
                    and true; all is full of that poetry of images and sentiments, and that
                    continued elegance which, since the time of the Greeks, Virgil and Racine have
                    alone possessed. But above all, it is in <hi rend="italic">Esther</hi> and in
                    <hi rend="italic">Athalie,</hi> particularly in the choruses of these two
                    tragedies, that, sustained by the most sublime models, he is himself almost
                    always sublime. It is there that Racine has all the elevation of a Hebrew
                    prophet, who had come to announce divine truths in strains almost divine. But
                    that which chiefly characterises Racine is the complete union, perhaps unique,
                    of two qualities which appear to be incompatible; of imagination the most
                    brilliant, and reason the most perfect, of sensibility the most exquisite, with
                    good sense the most invariable. Reason, in fact, as much and even more perhaps
                    than imagination, predominates in the conception of his most touching
                    productions, in the execution of his most dramatic scenes, in the choice of his
                    richest expressions, and in his boldest combinations, as well as most elliptical
                    turns. Boileau, who has been surnamed the poet of reason, is not, even in this
                    view, superior to Racine; and, besides, the quality here mentioned is the less
                    astonishing in him, because it is accompanied with an imagination much less
                    lively. Racine has often been pronounced the greatest of the French poets. He
                    should also be set down as the most rational; or rather, it is precisely because
                    he really is the most rational, that he is likewise the greatest.</p>
                <p>There are some smaller pieces of Racine which hate not been mentioned in the
                    course of this article, particularly Idylle sur la Paix, 1685; Discours prononcé
                    à l’Académie Française, en 1685; Cantiques Spirituelles, 1689; and Epigrammes
                    Diverses. The most complete edition of the Works of Racine is that which M. Aimé
                    Martin published at Paris in six vols. 8vo. in 1820, reprinted by Lefèvre in
                    1822.</p>
