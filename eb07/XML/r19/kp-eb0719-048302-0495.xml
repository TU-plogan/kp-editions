                <p><label type="entry">ROSS-SHIRE</label> a county of Scotland, having that of
                    Cromarty so curiously intermixed with it, that the description of both under one
                    head is a matter not only of convenience, but of necessity. Ross-shire,
                    comprising the districts of Ar-dross, Easter Ross, Ardmeanach or the Black Isle,
                    Kintail, Strathearron, and the island of Lewis, is the most extensive county in
                    Scotland, and second only to Yorkshire as regards Great Britain. The county of
                    Cromarty, on the other hand, is comparatively small. It is divided into ten
                    portions, which are whimsically inserted into various parts of the larger county
                    of Ross, like fragments of a more ancient rock in some newer geological
                    formation. One of these parts is the original county of Cromarty, so called from
                    <hi rend="italic">Cromba,</hi> that is, crooked bay, from the windings of its
                    shores, consisting of that portion which lies in the peninsula to the south of
                    the Cromarty Frith, and which surrounds the county town. This part rises like a
                    huge lump to a height of 470 feet above the level of the sea, which washes the
                    base of its cliffs. As a county, it was very inconsiderable both in extent and
                    in value. But by the straggling additions which were made to it towards the end
                    of the seventeenth century, it was increased to fifteen times its former extent.
                    Of these additions, one is that district surrounding Tarbat House, on the
                    northern shore of Cromarty Bay; and a second runs from the south side of Dornoch
                    Frith to Moray Frith, cutting off that portion of the county of Ross which
                    terminates in Tarbat Ness. Two more fragments are found lying on the north of
                    the river Carron, which has its embouchure near Bonnar Bridge; a fifth is that
                    which runs northward from the burgh of Dingwall, taking in Castle Leod and part
                    of Ben Weavish; the sixth lies to the north of Loch Fannich, at some distance to
                    the north-west of which a triangular morsel is found to the north of Loch Nid;
                    the eighth is that which stretches along the southern shore of Little Loch
                    Broom; and the ninth is the large district of Coygach, lying between the
                    northern shore of Loch Broom and Sutherlandshire; to which may be added the
                    Summer Islands at the mouth of Loch Broom, which are about sixty miles distant
                    from the town of Cromarty. As we have already mentioned under the article
                    Cromarty, this strange arrangement of territory was produced by the influence of
                    that great and powerful proprietor, George viscount Tarbat, afterwards earl of
                    Cromarty, who, wishing to have all his various lands included in one shire, got
                    them annexed to his own county in 1685 and 1698. But these were not all, nor the
                    most extraordinary, annexations which he accomplished. For, as a part of the
                    county of Cromarty, we are compelled to notice Royston, or Caroline Park,
                    locally situated within the county of Edinburgh, and but a couple of miles from
                    the Scottish capital. But such arrangements were by no means singular. The
                    district of Ferintosh, belonging locally to Ross-shire, is in fact a part of
                    Nairnshire; and from similar causes many of the houses in the Canongate of
                    Edinburgh belong to different counties in Scotland, from their having been the
                    town residences of Scottish noblemen whose estates lay in those different
                    shires. By the addition of all those portions which we have enumerated, the
                    extent of Cromarty is calculated to be equal to an area of 345 square miles, or
                    about 220,800 imperial acres. It contains only one entire parish, that of
                    Cromarty, the other parts of it being parochially connected with parishes
                    belonging to Rossshire. The two towns of Cromarty and Ullapool belong to it, and
                    its whole population may be estimated at about 5000 or 6000 souls. It is
                    judicially under the jurisdiction of the sheriff of Ross, the sheriff-court
                    being held at Cromarty every alternate Friday; and it is politically united with
                    Ross-shire in returning a member to parliament. It contains about 20,000 arable
                    acres. It has a considerable trade in pork for the English market; and at
                    Cromarty there is a thriving manufactory of hempen cloth, which employs about
                    two hundred individuals.</p>
                <p>Having thus given a general notion of the county of Cromarty as distinct from
                    that of Ross, we may now proceed to consider the united counties under one view.
                    Ross has its name from <hi rend="italic">Ross,</hi> a promontory, and probably
                    from that of Tarbat Ness. The united shires lie between 57.8. and 58. 10. north
                    latitude, and between 4. 0. and 5. 46. west longitude from Greenwich. From the
                    extreme northern point of Coygach, to the southern extremity of the Ross-shire
                    boundary, which lies to the north-east of Loch Hourn, in Inverness-shire, the
                    distance may be about seventy-two miles; whilst from Strath Oikel to the Cowrie
                    Water the measurement is not more than thirty or thirty-five miles. The breadth
                    from Tarbat Ness to the extreme western coast to the north of Gairloch is about
                    eighty-five miles. The whole surface may be about 2424 square miles, or about
                    1,545,600 acres; but to this must be added the Lewis, which contains four of the
                    thirty-three parishes of which the united county of Ross and Cromarty consists.
                    The boundaries are Sutherlandshire and Dornoch Frith on the north, and Moray
                    Frith on the east, Inverness-shire on the south, and the Western Ocean on the
                    west. On the eastern coast Cromarty Frith shoots inland from that of Moray
                    through the narrow strait produced by those grand and picturesque headlands
                    called the Sutors of Cromarty, and expands into a still and land-locked basin,
                    capable of holding the whole navy of Great Britain. The headlands themselves are
                    so lofty and precipitous, that it is not uncommon during gales of wind from the
                    north-eastward, to see waves breaking upon them to the height of an hundred
                    feet, whilst all within is smooth. Stowe, in his Chronicle, calls it “an
                    exceeding quiet and saue hauen ;” Boyce calls it “the hail of seamen ;” and
                    Buchanan is still more particular in his praise of it. It is rather more than
                    five miles broad at the widest part, and its length is about eighteen. The depth
                    averages from nine to twelve fathoms, but in the entrance it in some places
                    exceeds thirty, a depth which nearly doubles that of Moray Frith, into which it
                    opens. The continuity of outline of the western coast is interrupted by many
                    bays and sea-lochs, which afford numerous havens of shelter. From south to
                    north, these are Loch Alsh, with its two branches Loch Duich and Loch Ling; Loch
                    Carron, with its branch Loch Keeshorn; Loch Tor-ridon, Gairloch, Loch Ewe, Loch
                    Greinord, Little Loch Broom, Loch Broom, and Loch Enard. All these exhibit
                    magnificent scenery. That of Loch Torridon, for example, is of the grandest and
                    wildest character; as is likewise that of Loch Duich, rendered peculiarly
                    interesting by the remains of the Castle of Eilean Donnan, the ancient
                    stronghold of the Mackenzies, the Lords of Kintail. The outer <pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:wu.89119129625&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=496" xml:id="kp-eb0719-0496-0484"
                    />headlands of the western coast of Ross-shire, north of Loch Carron, are
                    composed of sandstone, exhibiting the usual smooth and regular outline
                    characteristic of that formation; and hence the promontories are tame, and of an
                    unvaried reddish coloured aspect, and the shores of the bays are for the most
                    part covered over with brown heath. It is therefore more in the inner recesses
                    of these inlets, and perhaps somewhat inland, that truly beautiful and romantic
                    scenery is to be found. The coast of the island of Lewis is so indented with
                    bays, lochs, creeks, and long and tortuous arms of the sea, as to bid defiance
                    to any enumeration or description within the confined limits assigned to this
                    article.</p>
                <p>The general surface of Ross and Cromarty is wild and mountainous, the mountain
                    chains and groups being interspersed with valleys, glens, lakes, and rivers,
                    exhibiting nature in every variety of form and character. The mountains, and
                    particularly those towards the west, are covered with excellent pasture for
                    sheep. Some of the sheep-farms are extensive, and possessed by sheep-farmers of
                    capital, who have introduced the Cheviot breed of sheep, or a cross of that
                    breed. The valleys and glens are depastured by large herds of cattle. Although
                    agriculture is found in patches in the valleys and on the shores of the west
                    coast, the great agricultural district of Ross and Cromarty is that extending
                    from Dingwall along the northern shore of Cromarty Frith, and so onwards in a
                    north-eastern direction along the Moray Frith and that of Dornoch. The soil and
                    climate of Easter Ross are as fine as any in Scotland, the agriculture is of the
                    very best description, and the numerous gentlemen’s seats and extensive
                    plantations with which it is ornamented render this one of' the most pleasant,
                    smiling, and cheerful countries that the stranger can visit. All the grains and
                    other agricultural produce of Britain are here raised in perfection; and if we
                    were desired to fix on a spot in any part of Scotland where the best fruits
                    could be produced, or where the rarest or most delicate plants or trees could
                    best be reared, we should be disposed to fix on Tarbat House, on the northern
                    shore of the Bay of Cromarty. We may further venture to assert, that no
                    traveller of taste can possibly drive along that northern shore, from Dingwall
                    eastwards, without very great enjoyment. The roads made in Ross-shire by the
                    parliamentary commissioners are extensive and excellent, and they are kept in
                    the highest state of repair. Many of the wildest and most unapproachable
                    districts have thus been opened; but there are still many left hermetically
                    sealed against all but the adventurous horseman or the unwearied pedestrian.</p>
                <p>Amongst the numerous fresh-water lakes and rivers to be found in Ross and
                    Cromarty, we may particularize the following. On the eastern side of the island
                    we have Loch Ailsh and Loch Craggan, that give birth to the river Oikel, which
                    divides Ross-shire from Sutherland, and which, after a course of forty miles,
                    finds its way into the upper end of Dornoch Frith, near the fine iron-arched
                    bridge of Bonnar. Then, as we move southwards, we have the river Carron and the
                    Water of Fearn, discharging themselves into the same frith. Cromarty Frith
                    receives the large and important stream of the river Conan, which drains off the
                    waters of Lochs Tolimuir, Garrogan, and Garve; Loch Fannich, Loch Roslik, Lochs
                    Lett, Achin, Hular, and Luichart; Loch Benachan, Loch Scolbuck, and Lochs Negin
                    and Nerick, and Loch Gowrie, by the important tributary river Orrin. Lochs
                    Calavie and Gedd furnish their supplies to the river BeauΓy of Inverness-shire.
                    Loch Clunie, half of which is in Ross-shire, pays its tribute to Loch Ness by
                    the river Morrison. On the west coast we have the rivers Shed and Ling, the one
                    tributary to Loch Duich, and the other to Loch Ling; the river Carron
                    discharging into Loch Carron the waters of Lochs Doule and Scaven. In Applecross
                    we have Lochs Lundie and Daroph, and the rivers of Applecross and Torridon, the
                    last mentioned discharging itself into Loch Torridon. Loch Vallich, and a great
                    chain of small lakes, empty their waters into Gairloch, as do Lochs Naheig,
                    Padnascally, and Slat-tadale. The river Ewe, which is only one mile in length,
                    discharges into Loch Ewe the waters of the grand Loch Maree, together with those
                    of Loch Clare and its chain of small lochs, and those of Loch Gurraig; Loch
                    Poolewe also sends its stream into Loch Ewe. Loch Fuir and Loch Shallag have
                    their embouchures in Loch Greinord. The waters of Lochs Arin and Druin find
                    their way into Loch Broom, as do those of Loch Damph and Loch Auchall, and those
                    of Loch Cruisk through the stream of the Strakemort; Loch Kynoch, Loch Lurgan,
                    and Loch Baddagyle send their streams into Loch Enard; and Lochs Skinaskink,
                    Achyle, Vattie, and Fin also discharge themselves into the same bay, at the
                    north-western point of the Coygash part of Cromarty. All these lochs and streams
                    abound with fish, and salmon are particularly abundant in all the rivers,
                    especially in the Oikel and in the Ewe. Short as is the course of this
                    last-mentioned stream, it so swarms with salmon that twenty fish are no uncommon
                    number for an expert angler to take in one day. Loch Maree, from which it
                    derives its stream, is by far the largest and finest lake in Ross-shire. It is
                    eighteen miles long, and from one to three miles broad; and the greater part of
                    it is full sixty fathoms deep, so that it has never been known to freeze even in
                    the most intense frosts. It contains no less than twenty-four islands, and its
                    mountains are magnificent. The highest of the group is Sliabhach or Slioch,
                    which is estimated at about three thousand feet. The Messrs Andersons of
                    Inverness, in their admirable Guide to the Highlands and Islands of Scotland,
                    tell us that the scenery of this lake is the most utterly savage and terrific,
                    in its barrenness and loncliness, of any part of this land of the mountain and
                    the flood. A few ash-trees, oaks, birches, and pines, the latter but remnants of
                    a gigantic ancient forest, are seen along the water’s edge, and beautify some of
                    the islands in a high degree. But above this narrow zone scarcely a blade of
                    grass exists, and eternally recurring sheets, precipices, and tables of
                    dark-brown sandstone and quartz rock meet the eye in every direction. Ben Eye,
                    at the south-eastern end, is the only exception, for it consists of two high
                    sharp peaks of pure white quartz rock, and its form is altogether beautiful and
                    stately. The Corries, and the solitudes of Glen Logan, opposite to it, on the
                    other side of the lake, are the favourite haunts of the red deer. Ben Lairg and
                    Stengach, also on the northern shore, are both stupendous mountains: the former
                    recedes to a considerable distance from the margin of the lake, while the latter
                    is visible at once from its base to the summit. Its lower acclivities are
                    remarkably steep, and in one part it presents a front of abrupt lofty cliffs,
                    disposed in great horizontal sections, along the crevices of which' a few aged
                    and fantastically shaped pine-trees are seen casting forth their arms against
                    the western breeze. Its rocks contain an unexampled number of varieties of
                    quartz, and the view from its top is unusually grand and extensive. The easiest
                    way to survey its scenery is from a boat. The path on the northern shore by
                    Letterewe is hardly passable, and that on the opposite side is surpassed by none
                    in the Highlands for ruggedness and sterility. It clambers up many rocky
                    channels of torrents, and then, adapting its course to the shelf of a long ledge
                    of sandstone, it stops suddenly over a precipice, leaving the bewildered
                    stranger in utter uncertainty where he is next to step. Yet there are many
                    beauties mingled with all this ruggedness, and some of the numerous little bays
                    are full of the loveliest features of fairy landscape. In the middle of this
                    romantic lake, there is an island called Island Maree, on which there is a very
                    ancient burying-ground. Some think that it was dedicated to the Virgin Mary, and
                    that, from this circumstance, both the island and the lake de<pb break="no"

                    />rived their name. It contains a number of tombstones covered with inscriptions
                    and hieroglyphical figures, which can hardly now be satisfactorily deciphered.
                    Some of these are believed to be tombs of Danish kings, which induces certain
                    individuals to believe that the name is a corruption from <hi rend="italic"
                    >Eilean-nan-Righ,</hi> or the King’s Island; whilst others take it from a good
                    man called Saint Maree, who inhabited this island many generations ago, and of
                    whose benevolent and charitable actions many traditions are still preserved in
                    the surrounding districts. In the centre of the island there is a deep well,
                    dedicated to Saint Mary or Maree. To this a strange superstition attaches.
                    Unhappy maniacs are carried to it and made to drink of its waters; after which
                    they are plunged into the lake, and towed round the island at the stern of a
                    boat, in the absurd hope that they will be thus restored to their senses.
                    Fortunately for humanity, this absurd practice is fast wearing out.</p>
                <p>The scenery on the river Conan and some of its tributaries is beautiful and
                    interesting. The fails of Rogie are by many considered as inferior only to those
                    of Foyers and Moness. We may indeed affirm that most of the valleys or
                    river-courses in the united counties are more or less worth visiting, for the
                    wild, the romantic, or the retired pastoral scenes which they contain. The
                    waterfall of Glomach, in the parish of Kintail, is one of the highest and finest
                    in the kingdom. It is to be found in a remote uninhabited valley on the estate
                    of Mr Mackenzie of Applecross, about seven miles from the inn of Sheal-house;
                    and it will well repay the lover of the grandeur of nature for any fatigue or
                    trouble which he may have in visiting it. Its height, lately ascertained,
                    without instruments, but as accurately as the nature of the ground admitted, is
                    about 350 feet. At the height of about fifty feet the water meets with a slight
                    interruption from a shelving projection in the rock. This, however, is a
                    circumstance that adds greatly to the effect, by increasing the volume of spray,
                    and producing variety in the form of the fall. But when the river Gir-sac is
                    swollen, the sheet of water is unbroken, terrific, and sublime. The fall is best
                    viewed from a solitary tree standing on a narrow neck of rock projecting towards
                    the water, about 100 feet down the ravine, to the south-west of the fall. There
                    the stream appears to issue from an oblong fissure in the rock, from whence,
                    with a fearful rush, it urges its way, chiefly in one great column, to the pool
                    below, from which, at this station, no outlet can be perceived. The environs of
                    the fall are wild and barren, consisting of great naked sheets of perpendicular
                    rocks partially covered with tufts of grass, ferns, or mountain saxifrage,
                    adding, if possible, to the savage character of the scene.</p>
                <p>The mountain groups of Ross and Cromarty are very lofty. They rise gradually from
                    the east coast, and more suddenly and boldly from the western sea, to which the
                    summit-level of the country is more generally approximated. The mountains are
                    all of the primitive formation, the secondary strata being found reclining on it
                    on both sides of the island. The granitic series present extremely abrupt
                    sections towards Moray Frith, and there we also find the older and other
                    sandstones, with argillaceous formations abounding in animal remains, with
                    plates resembling those of the tortoise, pieces of rough skin like that of the
                    shark, the scales and bones of fish; and in a ridge of bituminous shale, near
                    the Cromarty rocks, we find ammonites, bellemnites, scallops plain and striated,
                    pieces of wood, and a thick fleshy-looking leaf resembling that of the aloe. The
                    mineralogical catalogue is large. Limestone, and primitive limestone of the
                    character of marble, are very commonly to be met with. Ironstone is disseminated
                    in great abundance. A vein of iron was worked above 150 years ago on the shores
                    of Loch Maree, the works having been discontinued solely from the failure of
                    wood necessary for fuel. There is a rich vein of iron ore in the parish of
                    Alness, and in the same vicinity there is a vein of lead, and indications of
                    that metal have been found in the parish of Kilteam. A copper-mine at Keeshorn,
                    in the northern district of the parish of Applecross, was considered by Williams
                    as equally rich with any mine of the same metal to be found in Great Britain. On
                    the farm of Scor-raig, on the Dundonnell estate, there is a prodigious quantity
                    of bog-iron ore, which gives a strong and harsh chalybeate taste to all the
                    springs in the neighbourhood. There are various mineral springs in the united
                    shires of Ross and Cromarty, but those which have attained the greatest
                    celebrity are the two wells of Strathpeffer, which have now for many years
                    attracted numerous visitors to their neighbourhood in search of health and
                    recreation. Both of these springs have the smell of sulphuretted hydrogen gas,
                    but the upper spring is stronger than the lower. According to Dr Thomson, the
                    temperature of the lower well, on the 24th of June 1824, was 39°, and that of
                    the upper 39¼° , the day being rainy, and the temperature of the air rather
                    under 60°. The specific gravity of the water of these wells was as follows:</p>
                <p>Upper well............1∙00193.</p>
                <p>Lower well............1*00091.</p>
                <p>An imperial gallon of the upper spring was found to contain,</p>
                <p>Sulphuretted hydrogen gas......26∙167 cubic inches.</p>
                <p>Sulphate of soda..................67*770 grains.</p>

                <p>An imperial gallon of the water from the pump-room yielded</p>
                <p>Sulphuretted hydrogen gas......13*659 cubic inches.</p>
                <p>The saline contents were similar to those of the upper spring, but in the
                    proportion to them of seven to nine, via.</p>

                <p>Many of the mountains of Ross and Cromarty are of first-rate British magnitude.
                    Scuirvullin is about 2500 feet high. It consists entirely of micaceous schist,
                    inclining in some places to gneiss, and traversed by a few granite and quartz
                    veins. The rocks lie in thin upright stratiform shapes, which dip in opposite
                    directions all round the mountain; and they contain numerous round nodules of
                    quartz, feldspar, and red garnets. All the common alpine plants are to be met
                    with on Scuirvullin. Ben Weavish, or Ben Uaish, that is, the mountain of storm,
                    is one of the most remarkable mountains, not only in Ross and Cromarty, but in
                    Scotland. Its height, by the late trigonometrical survey, is 3720 feet; but it
                    is most wonderful for its immense bulk, by which it stands prominently
                    distinguished from the other hills around it, so as to be peculiarly striking
                    from great distances. Its corries or ravines are never without snow, so that the
                    proprietor can always fulfil his quit-rent by paying a snowball to his sovereign
                    when required to do so, on any day of the year. The primitive rocks of which it
                    is composed are chiefly a gray gneiss, abounding in large scales of mica and
                    garnets, which impart great beauty to the unpolished rock, though they are not
                    sufficiently pure or free from cracks to be used as ornamental stones. The
                    plants which it presents most interesting to the botanist are, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Saxifraga oppositifoUa, Arbutus alpina, Azalea procumbens, Betula nana,</hi>
                    &amp;c. Bean Dearig on Loch Broom is 3551 feet in height. It is composed of
                    gneiss, with granite veins and beds of quartz. We might mention many other
                    mountains, but we shall content ourselves with stating, that Tullochard, on the
                    north side of Loch Duich, merits particular notice»</p>

                <p>from being the crest of the Seaforth family, and from its summit in ancient times
                    being used to blaze with those beacon-fires that raised up the whole country at
                    the will of its lord.</p>
                <p>The natural woods in Ross and Cromarty, though much diminished, are still
                    numerous, and widely scattered through the glens and over the mountain sides.
                    The trees are chiefly firs, oaks, ash, birch, and alder. The whole face of the
                    wilder country bears the strongest evidence of its having been once covered with
                    extensive forests, fragments of which only now remain in certain places, whilst
                    the mosses or bogs still preserve the trees which have probably fallen by
                    extensive conflagrations. In the central district, the forest of Fainish still
                    stands, twenty miles in extent. But as these ancient forests are diminishing,
                    artificial plantation, already very extensive, is every day increasing with
                    rapid strides; and in many parts of the country even the soil that is apparently
                    the most barren appears to have a tendency to throw up young plants of birch,
                    and in some places of oak, proving that it is so filled with the seeds or roots
                    of those trees that preservation from sheep and cattle is all that is wanting to
                    restore the ancient natural forests. The island of Lewis is almost entirely
                    destitute of trees.</p>
                <p>From the great extent and immense variety of elevation and of surface of Ross and
                    Cromarty, it naturally contains by much the greater part, if not nearly all, the
                    plants to be found in the Flora Scotica; and in the same way, speaking
                    generally, almost all the animals to be found in the zoology of Scotland have
                    been discovered to belong to it. The larger wild quadrupeds are red and roe
                    deer, hares, alpine hares, foxes, badgers, wild cats, &amp;c. Grouse, ptarmigan,
                    black game, and partridges abound; and in some places pheasants have been
                    introduced, and have amazingly increased. We are not aware that any attempt has
                    been as yet made to restore to the older forests that magnificent bird, once
                    indigenous to them, we mean the <hi rend="italic">Tetrao wrogallus,</hi>
                    cappercailzie, or cock of the woods; but such an attempt would be highly
                    desirable, and, from the facility with which the live birds may now be obtained
                    from Norway, it might be made with comparative ease. The golden eagle and the
                    ospray are both common, as well as all the other birds of prey. Water-fowls of
                    all kinds abound on the coasts; and the frith of Cromarty is especially
                    remarkable for the number and variety of sea-fowl which may be obtained by the
                    skilful sportsman. In severe winters it frequently happens that many wild swans
                    are shot there. The list of fishes, both marine and fresh-water, is very ample.
                    Salmon, as already noticed, are especially abundant; and the trouts of Loch
                    Luichart, and many other lakes, are far famed. The pearl mussel, <hi
                    rend="italic">Mya margaritifera,</hi> is found in the stream of the river Conan,
                    and frequently affords pearls of remarkable beauty. In Strath Conan bees are
                    much cultivated, and a great deal of honey is made in that district.</p>
                <p>The landed property of these united counties is chiefly divided into estates,
                    which are more extensive in surface than valuable in rent, the average of them
                    being upwards of 16,000 imperial acres. The whole is valued in the cess-books at
                    L.75,043. lθs. 3d. Scots, and in 1811 the real rent was valued at about
                    L.91,089. 18s. 8d. sterling, affording a mean rental for each estate of not more
                    than L.1075, or about, one shilling and fourpence an acre. But we are disposed
                    to think that this last calculation would now be considerably increased, both by
                    the more extensive and better managed occupation of the hills with sheep-farms,
                    and the improvement which has taken place on the agricultural districts. As a
                    sample of the best soil, we may state, that the average rent of arable land in
                    the parish of Dingwall is about L.2 an acre, though some of it is as high as
                    L.4∙. lOs. The wages of farm-servants in the same district are L.7 or L.8 in
                    money, seven bolls of meal, a quarter of an acre of potatoes, and a free house
                    and garden, altogether worth about L.20. Occasional labourers get about seven
                    shillings and sixpence a week, and country artisans about nine shillings.
                    Mason-work is from L.l. 16s. to L.2 a rood, journeymen being paid about twelve
                    shillings a week. Carpenters are paid from ten to twelve shillings, and slaters
                    about twelve shillings a week. The gentlemen’s seats are numerous in Ross and
                    Cromarty, but they are chiefly situated in the eastern or more cultivated
                    districts.</p>
                <p>We have already said that the system of agriculture pursued in the more
                    favourable and more strictly agricultural districts of Ross and Cromarty does
                    not fall below the standard of more southern counties. The farms are extensive,
                    and generally let on leases of nineteen years’ duration. They are for the most
                    part well enclosed, and the dwelling-houses and other buildings are large and
                    commodious. In the poorer districts, and especially on the west coast, and in
                    Lewis, where the farmers hold only a few acres of arable land, they raise oats,
                    bear or big, and potatoes; and in many places where grazings are attached, they
                    rear a great many cattle and horses of the Highland breed, both of which are
                    often very much stinted in their growth for want of sufficient food in severe
                    winters. Illicit distillation, which once so much occupied these smaller
                    tenants, has now, we believe, been effectually put an end to, chiefly by the
                    introduction of legal small stills. The climate, particularly towards the west
                    coast, may well be termed rather a weeping one; and the carrying of the crops in
                    the western districts is often an exceedingly precarious operation. But where
                    there is so great a variety of surface, we must also look for a great variety of
                    climate. The following meteorological tables, taken from the Statistical Account
                    of the Parish of Dingwall, may furnish a general average view of the climate of
                    the more thickly inhabited districte.</p>

                    which it has created for the export of cattle and sheep to London. The change in
                    this respect may be readily conceived, when we consider the immense land-journey
                    which the animals had to undergo before they could be brought to the London
                    market They were driven off in a lean state, and were fed in southern pastures
                    before they could there be produced. Now, a Ross-shire farmer has it in his
                    power to send them direct to the London market, so fed as to be in a condition
                    for immediate slaughter; and thus he is placed on an equality, with regard to
                    expense of transport, with any English farmer who may not be fifty or sixty
                    miles from London. The effect of this in raising the value of property in these
                    and other northern counties may easily be imagined.</p>
                <p>The importance of the fisheries to Ross and Cromarty may be estimated from the
                    following table, furnished by Mr Dunsmure, the secretary of the Board of
                    Commissioners for the Herring Fishery.</p>

                </table>
                <p>In the above table, it must be observed that the column of persons employed
                    comprehends not only the fishermen, but the coopers, labourers, gutters,
                    packers, and those engaged in cleaning and drying the fish. It is also to be
                    noticed, that the Loch Carron fishery district includes the Isle of Skye in
                    Inverness-shire. The official brand applied by the officers of the board to the
                    casks of herrings cured and packed, strictly according to the acts of parliament
                    by which the commissioners are guided, is so highly estimated as to give a
                    confidence and a ready sale, and a superiority of price, in all foreign markets,
                    which no herrings can obtain without it. It is therefore becoming every day more
                    and more highly appreciated both by fish-curers and merchants. Every kind of
                    fish that frequents the northern seas may be taken on the coasts of Ross and
                    Cromarty, particularly on those of the island of Lewis. The Broad Bay flounder
                    of Stornoway is the finest in the world. The saithe is much more delicate than
                    the whiting. The haddock is remarkably good. In Lewis, in the parish of Lochs
                    alone, above 100, 000 lobsters are sent annually to the London market Whales,
                    porpuses, and grampuses, are often driven on shore in Lewis in numbers amounting
                    to a hundred and fifty or more, and varying from five to thirty feet in
                    length.</p>
                <p>The manufacture of kelp is still extensively practised <pb break="no"

                    />especially on the western coast and in Lewis; but the price is now so low and
                    fluctuating, and the time and trouble bestowed in making it so great, that it is
                    believed the sea-weed employed would be much more profitably used as manure.</p>
                <p>The burghs of Cromarty, Dingwall, and Tain, along with Dornoch, Wick, and
                    Kirkwall, return a member to parliament. Fortrose and Rosemarkie, two small
                    adjacent towns included in one burgh, return a member along with Inverness,
                    Nairn, and Forres, Besides these burghs, the united county has several villages
                    or small towns in it, such as Contin, Shildag, Domie, Plocktown, and Ullapool,
                    which last has 500 or 600 inhabitants. Stornoway, in Lewis, is a thriving burgh
                    of barony, with some good streets of houses, and a considerable quantity of
                    shipping, and, with its suburbs and environs, it contains nearly 3000
                    inhabitants. Sheriff and commissary courts, bailie, excise, and justice of peace
                    courts, are regularly held in it.</p>
                <p>In Ross and Cromarty there are many ancient and curious remains. In the parish of
                    Nigg, the site of the castle of Dunskeath, built by William the Lion in the year
                    1174, is still to be distinguished. At Shandwick is the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Clach-a-Charridh,</hi> or the Stone of the Burial-place. On one side of it a
                    large cross is still to be traced, wrought with an intricate maze of runic
                    knotting. On the sides of the shaft are two animals resembling an elephant and a
                    lion, above each of which there is a figure that appears to lean forward from a
                    cross. On the reverse side of the obelisk there are processions, hunting scenes,
                    and combats. The ground surrounding the spot where it stands was for centuries
                    used as a place of interment. There is a similar though smaller stone in the
                    church-yard of Nigg. It originally stood near the gate, but it was thrown down
                    by the fall of a belfrey in 1725, and it is now fixed to the eastern gable. The
                    top is of a triangular shape, and it has on one side of it two priest-like
                    figures attired in long garments, each furnished with a book, and inclining
                    forward as if intent on reading and devotion. Between them is a small circular
                    table or altar; and a dove seems to descend from above with a circular cake in
                    its bill. Under the table there are two large dogs. Lower down on the stone
                    there is a cross, and the spaces above and below the arms of it are divided into
                    rectangular compartments of mathematical exactness. The hieroglyphics of the
                    opposite side are in lower relief; and in the centre appears the chief figure,
                    that of a man attired in long garments, caressing a fawn, with a lamb and harp
                    directly fronting him. In the space beneath there is a man clashing a pair of
                    cymbals, and a man on horseback surrounded by animals of the chase; while on the
                    upper part of the stone there are dogs, deer, and armed huntsmen, with an eagle
                    or raven surmounting the whole. These obelisks or crosses are supposed to be of
                    Scandinavian origin. Craig-chenichan, or the Rock of Lamentation, in the parish
                    of Kincardine, is memorable for being the place where the Marquis of Montrose
                    was defeated by Colonel Strachan, after which he swam across the Kyle, and lay
                    concealed in Assint, until apprehended and sent prisoner to Inverness. On the
                    summit of Ormondy Hill, 200 feet above the level of the sea, near Castletown
                    Point, in the parish of Avoch, are the foundations of a large and very ancient
                    castle, to which tradition has given the name of Douglas. On a large plain to
                    the westward of the church of Eddertown there are indications of an encampment,
                    where a battle is said to have been fought with the Danes. In its vicinity there
                    is an extensive circle of earth, about two feet higher than the circumjacent
                    ground, flat on the top, with an obelisk in the centre ten feet in height, on
                    which a number of rude figures may still be traced. This is regarded as the tomb
                    of some Danish prince. The abbey and castle of Lochlin, in the parish of Fearn,
                    are remarkable. The former measured ninety-nine by twenty-five feet within the
                    walls. It was used for divine service till October 1742, when the roof fell in
                    and killed thirty-six people. The castle of Lochlin is supposed to be more than
                    five centuries old. It stands on an eminence about six miles to the eastward of
                    Tain. Its plan is that of two squares united at the angles, in which there is a
                    staircase leading to the top of it, which is sixty feet high. The castle of
                    Cadboll, of which little remains, is supposed to be yet more ancient than that
                    of Lochlin. There is a tradition that no one ever died in it; and that about a
                    century and a half ago, a certain Lady May, whose lingering diseases made her
                    long for death, was removed from it at her own request that she might die, and
                    her wish is said to have been gratified immediately after her removal. In the
                    parish of Kirkmichael, and close on the edge of a precipice rising from the
                    shore of Cromarty Frith, is <hi rend="italic">Tigh-na-Craig,</hi> or the House
                    of the Rock. It is a very curious old building, fifty feet in height, of great
                    antiquity, having been erected by the Urquharts, barons of Cromarty. In Loch
                    Carron are the ruins of Strome Castle; and at Lan-ganduin there is one of those
                    buildings called <hi rend="italic">Duin,</hi> which are so frequent on the west
                    coast. The castle of Eilean Donnan, on an insulated point between Lochs Ling and
                    Duich, in Kintail, though greatly dilapidated, is still a fine picturesque ruin.
                    It is supposed to have been built in the time of Alexander the Third. It was
                    long the baronial strength of the lords of Kintail; but after the battle of
                    Glen-sheil in 1719, it was demolished by a ship of war. Some of the cannon-balls
                    fired against it have been found nearly a mile above the castle. Near Ob-Inag,
                    in the parish of Glensheil, is to be found a fine specimen of what has been
                    called the Pictish Tower. At Dingwall are the remains of the ancient castle of
                    the earls of Ross. The hill of Knock-farril, in the parish of Fodderty, is
                    crowned with one of those curious and puzzling morsels of antiquity, usually
                    known by the name of vitrified forts. The walls enclose nearly an acre of level
                    ground, from which Craig Phadric near Inverness, and Dunskaith on the northern
                    Sutor of Cromarty, are distinctly visible, and so it is connected with a chain
                    of these signal-posts. It is probable that the early inhabitants of the country
                    burned their beltane fires on these signal-hills; and these we know were so
                    immense that they might very well account for the vitrification of the circular
                    walls of dry stone which were erected to prevent the fuel from being blown about
                    and dispersed. There are many ancient single stones, and circles of stones, and
                    cairns, in different parts of Ross and Cromarty. In Lewis are to be found the
                    following ruins of religious houses: St Collums in Ui, St Cowstans in Garrabost,
                    and St Aula in Gress. On the Flannel Isles, called by Buchanan <hi rend="italic"
                    >Insuloe Sacroe,</hi> the ruins of religious houses are still extant. At
                    Mealister and Pabay are the remains of nunneries; and there is a similar ruin on
                    the island of St Colme, in the entrance to Loch Erisort. At Carloway there is a
                    fine specimen of those towers already mentioned, perfectly circular, and thirty
                    feet high; and there are three or four more in Barras parish. In the year 1831,
                    a considerable number of little figures, carved in ivory, were found in the
                    sands at the head of the Bay of Uig. We saw them in Edinburgh, and they appeared
                    to us very much to resemble the kings and pieces at chess.</p>
                <p>There are many curious caves both on the east and west coasts of Ross and
                    Cromarty; but the most remarkable is the Seal Cave, in the parish of Stornoway,
                    in Lewis, which is considered to be only secondary in grandeur, and in the
                    splendour of its stalactitic formations, to the famous cave in Skye.</p>
                <p>The principal clans in Ross and Cromarty are the Mackenzies, Rosses, Frasers,
                    Mackays, Macraes, and Munroes. Gaelic is universally spoken, though it is less
                    used on the eastern than on the western side of the county. In Lewis it is the
                    chief language. The Highland dress is now seldom worn, except on occasions of
                    ceremony or festivity.</p>
