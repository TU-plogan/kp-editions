                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Rome,</hi> a city of Italy, formerly the capital of the
                    greatest empire in the world, and still remarkable as the chief seat of the
                    papal power, is situated on the river Tiber, in east long. 13°, and north lat.
                    41° 45'.</p>
                <p>To trace, even briefly, the rise and progress of this mighty city towards
                    universal empire, would demand a voluminous history, especially were we to enter
                    into disquisitions respecting the views which have been adopted in this article;
                    but as our limits forbid such an attempt, we must content ourselves in a great
                    measure with the statement of general results, with such occasional references
                    as may enable our readers to investigate the subject at greater length; and we
                    think it fortunate, that many of the views which were held as mere paradoxes
                    when first proposed by Niebuhr, may now be regarded as firmly established, and
                    without hesitation followed as essentially correct.</p>
                <p>For the history of the various tribes, which, when united under the Roman name,
                    formed one mighty nation, we must refer to the different heads under which, in
                    other parts of this work, they are mentioned. The chief of these were the Oscan,
                    probably the most ancient race that inhabited Italy; the Pelasgian, under which
                    designation may also be comprised the Tyrrhenian, <note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See Niebuhr, vol. i. p. 38, <hi rend="italic"
                    > et seq.</hi></p></note> with its numerous branches; and the Etrurian, which
                    was marked by various features distinguishing it from both the other races,
                    being also probably less ancient than either. From all that appears in history
                    or tradition, the Oscan, Opican, Auruncan, and Ausonian, were the same race of
                    people, and the earliest inhabitants of that part of Italy contained between
                    Oenotria and Tyrrhenia, or the country of the Etruscans; <note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Id. vol. i. p. 64, <hi rend="italic">et
                    seq.</hi></p></note> in a word, they were the original stock whence sprung
                    several of the most powerful nations of Italy, as the Sabines or Sabellians, the
                    Samnites, and others. The Pelasgi <note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Id. vol. i. p, 29. </p></note> appear to have been a branch
                    of that once mighty race of whom traces may be discovered from the river
                    Strymon, along the coast of Ionia, throughout Greece and its islands, and along
                    the maritime shores of Italy. It was from their Pelasgic ancestors that the
                    Romans derived the radical affinities which are found to connect the Italian
                    language with that of Greece, both having had, at some remote period, a common
                    origin. The Pelasgi seem to have driven the Oscan nations from the seacoast,
                    back to the mountains, and in their turn to have been overpowered in part of
                    their acquired territory by the Etruscans. The origin of this latter people is
                    involved in obscurity hitherto impenetrable. <note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Id. vol. i. p. 109, et <hi rend="italic"

                    think, of an Egyptian origin. We incline, for many reasons, to believe them of
                    Phoenician extraction; not merely the peculiarities of their alphabet, but those
                    also of their religious rites, bearing a very close resemblance to the most
                    ancient forms of the Phoenician language and religion. Itis probable that a
                    careful investigation into the customs, laws, and religion of the ancient
                    Etrusci, or rather</p>
                <p>Raseni, to use their own name, will ultimately prove them to have belonged to a
                    race more ancient still than even the Phoenicians, that is, to the ancient
                    oriental race whence the Phoenicians themselves derived their origin, their
                    language, and religion.</p>
                <p>Respecting the institutions of these primitive races, very little is known; yet
                    from that little, important conclusions may fairly be drawn. Both the Osci and
                    the Pelasgi seem to have lived under the patriarchal form of government; the
                    origin of which is to be traced to the paternal sway which a father naturally
                    exercises over his household, and the head of a tribe, or number of households,
                    over the whole collectively. The Etrusci, on tile other hand, appear to have
                    adopted the system of <hi rend="italic">castes,</hi> and especially to have been
                    very much under the influence of a sacerdotal caste, which was of course
                    hereditary, and which possessed almost unbounded influence over the rest of the
                    nation. The effect of the combination of these nations, and their peculiar
                    institutions, in forming the character of the Roman people, will soon
                    appear.</p>
                <p>Rome itself is said to have been founded in the year 753b .c. This date,
                    therefore, we shall assume as the most probable, if not absolutely authentic,
                    and shall make it the basis of all subsequent chronological statements. <note

                    rend="italic">et seq.</hi></p></note> According to the fabulous accounts
                    preserved by Livy, the founders and earliest inhabitants of Rome were of Trojan
                    descent. Aeneas is said to have led a colony of Trojans, after the destruction
                    of Troy, through a series of perilous voyages and adventures, to the shores of
                    Italy, near the mouth of the Tiber. Here he formed an alliance with Latinus,
                    king of the adjoining country, received his daughter Lavinia in marriage, and
                    built a town, called, from her name, Lavinium. A war, which soon afterwards
                    arose between the new settlers and the Rutulians, terminated in the death of
                    their king, Turnus, who was slain in battle by Aeneas. Another war ensued
                    between the Trojans and Mezentius, king of the Etruscans of Caere. In this war
                    Aeneas himself perished, having been drowned in the Numicius, into which he was
                    forced in a disastrous battle, and was succeeded by his son Ascanius, or lulus.
                    On the banks of the river where he disappeared, an altar was built in honour of
                    him, and he was worshipped under the name of Jupiter Indiges. Mezentius soou
                    afterwards fell by the hand of Ascanius, who thus obtained undisputed possession
                    of the territory formerly held by Latinus. The Trojan settlers became completely
                    incorporated with the people of the land, and from king Latinus they derived the
                    common name of Latins. The thirty years had now elapsed dining which it had been
                    predicted that the Trojan race were to inhabit their first town, Lavinium. They
                    removed to a more propitious situation, and built a new town on a lofty ridge
                    farther inland, which overlooks all the land around it, and to their new abode
                    they gave the name of Alba Longa. Of the Latian confederacy, this became the
                    chief city; and hither the thirty confederate cities of Latium resorted to offer
                    common sacrifices to the gods of the Pelasgic nation.</p>
                <p>The traditionary legends proceed to state, that Lavinia, fearing some injustice
                    from Ascanius, had sought shelter in the woods, where she gave birth to a son,
                    named from that circumstance, and from his lather, Aeneas Sylvius. Ascanius,
                    however, took no unfair advantage of his position, and was succeeded by Sylvius.
                    For an uncertain period, the sceptre was swayed by successive monarchs of the
                    Sylvian race and name, till the death of Procas. This king left two sons,
                    Numitor and Amulius, but by birthright the throne belonged to Numitor. Amulius,
                    however, seizing the government in defiance of his brother’s right, caused
                    Numitor’s only son to be put to death, and made his daugh<pb break="no"

                    />ter Silvia a vestal virgin, by which she became bound to perpetual celibacy.
                    According to the legend, this scheme proved abortive; for Silvia became pregnant
                    by the god Mars, and was delivered of twin sons. Amulius ordered the infants to
                    be thrown into the river, and their mother to be buried alive; the doom of a
                    vestal virgin who should violate her vow of chastity. The river happened at that
                    time to have overflowed its banks, so that the two infants were not carried into
                    the middle of the stream, but drifted along the margin, till the basket which
                    contained them became entangled in the roots of a wild vine, at the foot of the
                    Palatine hill. At this time a she-wolf coming down to the river to drink,
                    suckled the infants, and carried them to her den among the thickets hard by.
                    Here they were found by Faustulus, the king’s herdsman, who took them home to
                    his wife Laurentia, by whom they were carefully nursed, and named Romulus and
                    Remus.</p>
                <p>The two youths grew up, employed in the labours, the sports, and the perils of
                    the pastoral occupation of their foster-father. But, like the two sons of
                    Cymbeline, their royal blood could not be quite concealed. Their superior mein,
                    courage, and abilities, soon acquired for them a decided superiority over their
                    young compeers,and they became leaders of the youthful herdsman in their
                    contests with robbers, or with rivals. Having quarrelled with the herdsmen of
                    Numitor, whose flocks were accustomed to graze on the neighbouring hill
                    Aventinus, Remus fell into an ambush, and was dragged before Numitor to be
                    punished. While Numitor, struck with the noble bearing of the youth, and
                    influenced by the secret stirrings of nature within him, was hesitating what
                    punishment to inflict, Romulus, accompanied by Faustulus, hastened to the rescue
                    of Remus. On their arrival at Alba, the secret of their origin was discovered,
                    and a plan was speedily organized for the expulsion of Amulius, and the
                    restoration of their grandfather Numitor to his throne. This was soon
                    accomplished; but the twin brothers felt little disposition to remain in a
                    subordinate position in Alba, after the enjoyment of the rude liberty and power
                    to which they had been accustomed among their native hills. They therefore
                    requested from their grandfather permission to build a city on the banks of the
                    Tiber, where their lives had been so miraculously preserved. Scarcely had this
                    permission been granted when a contest .arose between the two brothers
                    respecting the site, the name, and the sovereignty of the city which they were
                    about to found. Romulus wished it to be built on the Palatine hill, and to be
                    called by his name; Remus preferred the Aventine, and his own name. To terminate
                    their dispute amicably, they agreed to refer it to the decision of the gods by
                    augury. Romulus took his station on the Palatine hill, Remus on the Aventine. At
                    sun-rise Remus saw six vul∙ tures, and immediately afterwards Romulus saw
                    twelve. The superiority was adjudged to Romulus, because he had seen the greater
                    number, against which decision Remus remonstrated indignantly,on the ground that
                    he had first received an omen. <note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>According to the interpretation of the Etruscan augurs, the
                    twelve vultures seen by Romulus portended that the duration of the city would
                    extend to twelve centuries; and it may strike even an incredulous reader us
                    remarkable, that the actual duration of Rome as a frer and imperial city
                    coincided very nearly with the time assigned by this augury. It ended in the
                    1229th year of thecity, by the dethronemen <hi rend="superscript">,</hi> of the
                    last emperor Romulus Augustulus. </p></note></p>
                <p>Romulus then proceeded to mark out the boundaries for the wall of the intended
                    city. This was done by a plough with a brazen plough-share, drawn by a bull and
                    a heifer, and so directed that the furrow should fall inward. The plough was
                    lifted and carried over the spaces intended to be left for the gates; and in
                    this manner a square space was marked oβt, including the Palatine hill, and a
                    small portion of the land at its base, termed <hi rend="italic">Roma
                    quadrata.</hi> This took place on the 21st of April, on the day of the festival
                    of Pales, the goddess of shepherds. While the wall was beginning to rise above
                    the surface, Remus, whose mind was still rankling with his discomfiture, leaped
                    over it scornfully, saying, “Shall such a wall as that keep your city!”
                    Immediately Romulus, or, as others say, Celer, who had charge of erecting that
                    part of the wall, struck him dead to the ground with the implement in his hand,
                    exclaiming, “So perish whosoever shall hereafter overleap these walls.” By this
                    event Romulus was left the sole sovereign of the city; yet he felt deep remorse
                    at his brother’s fate, buried him honourably, and when he sat to administer
                    justice, placed an empty throne by his side, with a sceptre and crown, as if
                    acknowledging the right of his brother to the possession of equal power.</p>
                <p>To augment as speedily as possible the number of his subjects, Romulus set apart
                    in his new city a place of refuge, to which any man might flee, and be protected
                    from bis pursuers. By this device the population increased rapidly in males; but
                    there was a great deficiency of females; for the adjoining states, regarding the
                    followers of Romulus as little better than a horde of brigands, refused to
                    sanction intermarriages. But the schemes of Romulus were not to be so
                    frustrated. In honour of the god Consus, he proclaimed games, to which he
                    invited the neighbouring states. Great numbers came, accompanied by their
                    families; and at an appointed signal, the Roman youth, rushing suddenly into the
                    midst of the spectators, snatched up the unmarried women in their arms, and bore
                    them off by force. This outrage was immediately resented, and Romulus found
                    himself involved in a war with all the surrounding states. Fortunately for Rome,
                    though these states had sustained a common injury, they did not unite their
                    forces in the common cause. They fought singly, and were each in turn defeated;
                    Caenina, Antemnae, and Crustumerium, fell successively before the Roman arms.
                    Romulus slew with his own hand, Aeron, king of Caenina, and bore off his spoils,
                    dedicating them as <hi rend="italic">spoila opima,</hi> to Jupiter Feretrius.
                    The third part of the lands of the conquered towns was seized by the conquerors;
                    and such of the people of these towns as were willing to remove to Rome, were
                    received as free citizens.</p>
                <p>In the mean time, the Sabines, to avenge the insult which they had sustained, had
                    collected together their forces under tile command of Titus Tatius, king of the
                    Quirites, or people of the Sabine town of Cures. The Romans were unable to meet
                    so strong an army in the field, and withdrew within their walls. They had
                    previously placed their flocks in what they thought a place of safety, on the
                    Capitoline hill, which, strong as it was by nature, they had still further
                    secured by additional fortifications. Tarpeia, the daughter of the commander of
                    that fortress, having fallen into the hands of the Sabines, agreed to betray the
                    access to the hill, for the ornaments they wore upon their arms. At their
                    approach she opened the gate, and as they entered, they crushed her to death
                    beneath their shields. From her the clift of the Capitoline hill was called the
                    Tarpeian rock. The attempt of the Romans to regain this place of strength
                    brought on a general engagement. The combat was long and doubtful. At one time
                    the Romans were almost driven into the city, which the Sabines were on the point
                    of entering along with them, when fresh courage was infused into the fugitives,
                    in consequence of Romulus vowing a temple to Jupiter Stator, and by a stream of
                    water which rushed out of the temple of Janus, and swept away the Sabines from
                    the gate. The bloody struggle was renewed during several successive days, with
                    various fortune and great mutual</p>

                <p>slaughter. At length the Sabine women who had been carried away, and who were now
                    reconciled to their fate, rushed with loud outcries, outspread hands, and
                    dishevelled locks, between the combatants, imploring their husbands and their
                    fathers to spare on each side those who were now to them equally dear. Both
                    parties paused; a conference began, a peace was concluded, and a treaty framed,
                    by which the two nations were united into one. The Sabines built a new city on
                    the Quirinal and Capitoline hills, on the north and north-west of the Roman
                    hill, the Palatine; and Romulus and Tatius became the joint sovereigns of the
                    combined people. But though united, each nation continued to be governed by its
                    own king and senate; and in all that respected their common interest they met in
                    the valley between the Palatine and Capitoline hills, in a place from that
                    circumstance called the Comitium.</p>
                <p>During the double sway of Romulus and Tatius, a war was undertaken against the
                    Latin town of Cameria, which was taken and made a Roman colony, and its people
                    admitted into the Roman state, as had been done with those whom Romulus
                    previously subdued. Tatius was s∞n afterwards slain by the people of Laurentum,
                    because he had refused to do them justice against his kinsmen, who had violated
                    the laws of nations by insulting their ambassadors. The death of Tatius left
                    Romulus sole monarch of Rome. He was soon again engaged in a war with Fidenae, a
                    Tuscan settlement on the banks of the Tiber. This people he likewise overcame,
                    and placed in the city a Roman colony. This war extending the Roman frontier,
                    led to a hostile collision with Veii, in which he was also successful, and
                    deprived Veii, at that time one of the most powerful cities in Etruria, of a
                    large portion of its territories, though he found the city itself was too strong
                    to be taken.</p>
                <p>The reign of Romulus now drew near its close. One day, while holding a military
                    muster or review of his army on a plain near the lake Capra, the sky was
                    suddenly overcast with thick darkness, the light of the sun was quenched, and a
                    dreadful tempest of thunder and lightning arose. The people fled in dismay; and
                    when the storm abated, Romulus, over whose head it had raged most fiercely, was
                    no where to be seen. A rumour was circulated that during the tempest he had been
                    carried to heaven by his father, the god Mars. This opinion was speedily
                    confirmed by the report of Proculus Julius, who declared, that as he was
                    returning by night from Alba to Rome, Romulus appeared to him in a form of more
                    than mortal majesty, and bade him go and tell the Romans, that Rome was destined
                    by the gods to be the chief city of the earth, that human power should never be
                    able to withstand them, and that he would himself be their guardian god
                    Quirinus.</p>
                <p>So terminates what may be termed the legend of Romulus, the founder and first
                    king of Rome. That no person, bearing any resemblance in name and actions, to
                    what is recorded of him, ever existed, it would be perhaps too hazardous to
                    affirm; while it is perfectly evident that the greater part of the narrative is
                    entirely fabulous. The story of Aeneas and his Trojans rests upon no better
                    foundation, and has no better claim to be believed. Indeed the various accounts
                    respecting the Trojan leader and colony, are so contradictory as completely to
                    destroy the pretensions of any of them to credibility. All the accounts of the
                    reigns of Ascanius and his successors at Alba Longa, are equally fabulous. The
                    divine paternity, miraculous preservation, and early exploits of Romulus and
                    Remus, are evident fables, of a daringly poetic cast. But that a small strength,
                    a <hi rend="italic">ρώμη,</hi> may have been constructed on the Palatine hill,
                    by some bold and skilful leader of a band of freebooters, about the period
                    assumed for the foundation of Rome, is by no means improbable. A city so
                    founded, by a band so formed, not only might, but evidently must, have passed
                    through a series of contests with the neighbouring cities, similar to those
                    related of Romulus and his people. There may, therefore, be perfect poetical
                    truth, so to speak, in the narrative, though it should be in a great measure
                    devoid of real historical truth. Discarding its miraculous passages, it is
                    sufficiently natural and self-consistent to be received as a traditional account
                    of the adventures, perils, and fluctuating fortunes of the early founders of
                    Rome, of whatsoever race descended, and by whomsoever led.</p>
                <p>Upon the death of Romulus an interregnum took place; during which the senate is
                    reported to have divided itself into ten Decuriae, each of which governed the
                    state by turns, during periods of five days. At length it was agreed that a king
                    should be chosen out of the Sabine part of the united people, but that the
                    choice should be left to the Romans. Their choice fell upon Numa Pompilius, who
                    is said to have been a citizen of Cures, of noble birth, and greatly
                    distinguished for his wisdom and piety. Upon his election to the sovereignty, he
                    refused to accept it till he had inquired by augury whether it were the will of
                    the gods that he should be king. The omens being favourable, he next laid before
                    the <hi rend="italic">comitia curiata</hi> the proposal of an enactment by which
                    he should be acknowledged as king, and intrusted especially with full military
                    command. Having received this public and formal recognition of his sovereign
                    power, he then applied himself to the consolidation of the new kingdom and
                    people, by the enactment of laws, and the appointment of whatever pertained to
                    religious worship. To him is ascribed the apportion ing of the public territory
                    which had been gained by conquest, to the new people who had become freemen of
                    the Roman state. He determined the extent of the lands to be held by private
                    citizens, marked their boundaries, and fixed them by landmarks consecrated to
                    the god Terminus. Instead of endeavouring to extend the territory of the state,
                    he assigned it also a fixed boundary, restrained the aggressive spirit of the
                    warlike Romans, and strove to mollify them by the cultivation of the arts of
                    peace, and especially by the exact and constant observance of religious rites.
                    He instituted the orders of the priesthood, and determined their respective
                    offices. To the Pontifex Maximus he gave the supreme authority in matters of
                    religion. He appointed the flaraens, or priests of the three great gods of the
                    nation, Jupiter, Mars, and Quirinus. To the service of the goddess Vesta he
                    consecrated four virgin priestesses, whose duty it was to tend the ever-burning
                    tire in her temple. By him was formed the institution of the Salii, who honoured
                    Mars Gradivus by solemn songs and dances on appointed festal days, and who were
                    intrusted with the custody of the sacred shield <hi rend="italic">Ancile,</hi>
                    which fell down from heaven. To him is also ascribed the institution of the
                    college of augurs, whom he himself instructed in the observation of the greater
                    auspices, which were drawn from lightning, and other signs in the heavens.</p>
                <p>But in the formation of these sacred institutions, Numa did not solely trust to
                    his own wisdom. He was instructed, says the legend, by the nymph Egeria, who met
                    him in a sacred grotto, and taught him the will of the gods. So highly did she
                    honour, and so dearly did she love him, that she took him to be her husband. To
                    confirm the authority of Numa, and to ratify the laws which he made, and the
                    sacred rites which he taught, Egeria gave to the Romans a token and proof of
                    their divine origin. While Numa was entertaining a party of distinguished
                    citizens, with a meal of homely fare, and served on earthen vessels, Egeria, at
                    his word, changed it into a feast of the most delicious viands in vessels of
                    gold. But though a favourite of the gods, Numa was still mortal. He died full of
                    age and honours, beloved and lamented by all his people, and mourned with
                    ever-flowing sorrow by the nymph Egeria.</p>
                <p>Such is the peaceful and lovely legend of Numa Pompilius, said to have been the
                    second king of Rome, and to bave reigned forty years. It is, however, so
                    manifestly poeti <pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:wu.89119129625&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=373" xml:id="kp-eb0719-0373-0363"
                    />cal, or perhaps mythical, that it is utterly in vain to attempt to extract
                    from it any thing like real history. It may have been merely meant to represent
                    the period of the establishment of forms of laws and religion, which naturally
                    follows that of founding a city and collecting a people. And as all ancient
                    lawgivers assumed divine authority for the sanction of their institutions, so
                    the Roman lawgiver is said to have obtained the instructions of Egeria. The
                    legend is too beautiful to be lost, though too imaginative to be believed; and
                    we turn reluctantly from its evanescent loveliness, to the consideration of
                    matter of a harsher mould.</p>
                <p>An interregnum again followed the death of Numa. At length Tullus Hostilius, a
                    man of Latin or Romish extraction, was chosen by the <hi rend="italic"
                    >curiae;</hi> and his election having been sanctioned by the auspices, he, like
                    his predecessor, submitted to the <hi rend="italic">comitia curiata</hi> the
                    laws which conferred upon him full regal power. The new king was more desirous
                    of military renown, than of the less dazzling fame which may be gained by
                    cultivating the arts of peace. An opportunity was soon offered for indulging his
                    warlike disposition. Plundering incursions had been made into each others’
                    territories by the borderers of the two states of Rome and Alba. Both nations
                    sent ambassadors at the same time to demand redress. The Roman ambassadors had
                    private orders from Tullus to be peremptory in their demands, and to limit their
                    stay within the stated period of thirty days. They did so, and receiving no
                    immediate satisfaction, returned to Rome. In the mean time, Tullus amused the
                    Alban embassy by shews and banquets, till, when they opened their commission, he
                    had it in his power to answer, that he had already in vain sought redress from
                    Alba, and that now they must prepare for the events of a war, the blame of
                    originating which was chargeable upon them. By this device Tullus thought to
                    avoid the guilt of being the aggressor, and to secure the favour of the gods by
                    the justice of his cause.</p>
                <p>Under the command of Cluilius, the Albans sent a powerful army against Rome, and
                    encamped about five miles from the city. There Cluilius died; and the Albans
                    elected Mettius Fufetius in his stead. Tullus Hostilius, at the head of the
                    Roman army, now drew near the Albans. But when the two armies were ready for a
                    general engagement, Mettius, the Alban general, proposed to save the effusion of
                    blood, by committing the fortune of the war to the valour of certain champions
                    selected from either side. To this proposal Tullus agreed. It so happened that
                    there were in each army three brothers, each three the children of one birth,
                    whose mothers also were sisters, though their fathers belonged to different
                    nations. The three Romans were named Horatii, the three Albans Curiatii. These
                    youthful warriors were chosen to be the champions of their respective nations,
                    and immediately prepared for the combat. It was agreed, that by the issue of
                    this contest should be determined the dominion or subjection of each people. The
                    two armies were drawn up in battle array, each on their own side of the boundary
                    line that divided their territories. The young combatants advanced, and met on
                    the very line. The combat began, and was sustained for some time with equal
                    skill, courage, and ardour, while the two armies gazed on the eventful struggle
                    with the suspended breath of intense anxiety. At length two of the Horatii fell
                    at the feet of their antagonists; a sight which called forth loud shouts of joy
                    from the Albans, while the Romans remained quivering with suspense for the fate
                    of their remaining champion, and the freedom of their country. Horatius was
                    still unhurt, whilst the three Curiatii were all severely wounded. Believing
                    himself more than a match for each singly, he feigned a flight to divide them.
                    They pursued with unequal strength and speed, and were separated to considerable
                    distances from each other. On a sudden he turned, rushed on the enemy nearest
                    him, and slew him at a blow. With equal impetuosity he assailed and killed the
                    second, while the third was hastening to render his brother aid. There was now
                    but one combatant on either side, yet it could no longer be called a battle.
                    Faint, exhausted, and dispirited, the third of the Curiatii sunk beneath the
                    vigorous arm of the victorious Roman, who thus at once avenged his brothers, and
                    won for his country the sovereign sway.</p>
                <p>As the Romans were returning in triumph to the city, Horatius bearing the triple
                    spoils, they were met at the Ca-penian gate by his sister, who had been
                    betrothed to one of the Curiatii. When she beheld the bloody mantle of her
                    lover, which she had wrought with her own hands, borne aloft by her brother, she
                    burst into loud lamentations, flinging loose her scattered locks. Horatius,
                    enraged at her untimely grief and outcry, drew his sword and pierced her to the
                    heart, exclaiming, “So perish the Roman woman that shall bewail a foe.” For this
                    tierce deed, Horatius was by the judges condemned to death. But he appealed to
                    the people, and his father defended him, saying, that if his daughter had not
                    deserved to die, he would himself have punished his son, in virtue of his own
                    authority as a father. The people refused to stain the victory which Horatius
                    had achieved for his country by shedding the blood of the conqueror, and
                    therefore spared his life, but caused him to undergo the semblance of capital
                    punishment, and perform certain expiating sacrifices and rites, which
                    thenceforth became hereditary in the Horatian family.</p>
                <p>Notwithstanding the agreement which had been entered into between the Romans and
                    the Albans, the latter were unwilling to forfeit their national independence
                    without an additional struggle. This, however, they were desirous to avoid
                    provoking single-handed. They accordingly encouraged the people of Fidenae to
                    revolt, by giving them secret promises of assistance. Tullus Hostilius
                    immediately levied a Roman army, and summoned the Albans to his aid. The two
                    armies met, the Veientes being drawn up opposite to the Romans, and the
                    Fidenates confronting the Albans. When the battle began, Mettius Fufetius, the
                    Alban leader, wanted courage and decision to fulfil his own treacherous pledge;
                    he neither joined the Romans nor the Fidenates, but drawing his men off from the
                    conflict, stood aloof, to watch the event and act accordingly. His defection
                    struck a temporary panic into the Romans, which was speedily allayed by the
                    bravery and skill of Tullus; and his remaining aloof caused distrust in the
                    Fidenates, who finally fled before the vigorous onset of their antagonists.
                    Tullus gained a complete victory; and concealing his knowledge of the treachery
                    of Mettius, next day called an assembly of his whole army. The Albans came
                    unarmed, and arrived first. The Romanscame next, wearing, as they had been
                    directed, their swords hid beneath their mantles, and at a signal surrounded the
                    Albans. Tullus then denounced the treachery of Mettius, and commanded him to be
                    torn asunder by two chariots of four horses, as his mind had been divided
                    between the Romans and the Fidenates in the battle. It was then decreed that
                    Alba should be razed to the ground, and the whole Alban people removed to Rome,
                    to prevent the possibility of future strife. Not only the walls of Alba, but
                    every human habitation, was totally demolished, and the temples of the gods
                    alone left standing in solitary majesty amid the ruins.</p>
                <p>But though Tullus had thus put an end to the separate existence of Alba, he did
                    not reduce its inhabitants to slavery. He assigned them habitations on the
                    Caelian hill, which had formerly been possessed by the followers of the Etruscan
                    Lucumo, Caeles Vibenna. Those who had been of patrician rank at Alba were
                    allowed to retain the same rank at Rome, and a new tribe was formed, called the
                    Luceres. The construction and numbers of this tribe were the same as those of
                    the other two; so that the entire senate, composed of the beads of houses of the
                    three tribes,</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="ht:wu.89119129625&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=374"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0719-0374-0364"/>
                <p>amounted now to 300, which continued to be its stated number.</p>
                <p>Soon after these events, Tullus made war upon the Sabines, and in a bloody, and
                    for some time doubtful encounter, again obtained the victory. Another war arose
                    with the confederate towns of Latium, who began to dread the growing polver of
                    Rome after the destruction of Alba. The Latian war terminated without any
                    decided reverses sustained by either party; and an alliance was formed between
                    the Romans and the Latins. Tullus had now leisure to direct his attention to the
                    arts of peace, in which, however, he did not equally excel. The only public
                    works ascribed to him were the enclosing of a space for the Comitium, or
                    assembly of the people; and the building of a Curia, or senate-house. Towards
                    the end of his reign his mind was disturbed by prodigies, indicating the wrath
                    of the gods, for religion neglected, and temples left desolate. A shower of
                    stones fell from heaven on the Alban mount; and the awful accents of a
                    supernatural voice were heard to issue from the consecrated summit of the hill.
                    A plague swept away numbers of the Roman people. The king himself sickened; and
                    from having been neglectful of religion, became the slave of superstitious
                    terrors. In vain did he supplicate the gods. He had disregarded them in his days
                    of prosperity, and in his adversity no deity regarded his prayers, or sent
                    relief. In his despair he presumed to use the divinations of Numa, by the rites
                    of Jupiter Elicius; but the only answer returned tvas the lightning of the
                    offended gods, by which Tullus himself and his whole household were smitten and
                    consumed. Such is the legend of Tullus Hostilius, said to have been the third
                    king of Rome.</p>
                <p>After the death of Tullus Hostilius there followed another interregnum, during
                    which the senate, as usual, exercised the functions of sovereignty. An assembly
                    was then held, in which Ancus Marcius, a son of the daughter of Numa, and a
                    Sabine by race, was chosen king. He assumed the sovereignty with the usual
                    formalities, receiving the sanction of the comitia curiata. Ancus seems to have
                    taken the conduct and character of Numa for his model rather than those of his
                    more warlike predecessors. His first object was to restore those religious rites
                    which had been neglected by Tullus; and for this purpose he caused the
                    institutions of Numa to be inscribed on tables, and suspended in public places,
                    that all might read, know, and observe them.</p>
                <p>While he was thus busied in restoring religious worship, the Latins imagined they
                    might recover that power which had been wrested from them by Tullus. They soon
                    found that Ancus, though peacefully inclined, was by no means incapable of
                    resenting injuries. He raised an army, encountered the insurgent Latins, and
                    after a severe struggle, not only defeated them in the field wherever he met
                    them, but also took from them several cities, whose inhabitants he removed to
                    Rome, and settled on the Aventine hill, on the south of the Palatine. On the
                    left bank of the Tiber he prosecuted his conquests till he reached the sea,
                    where he built Ostia, and settled a colony in it to secure it as a permanent
                    conquest, and that it might be a sea-port for Rome. He obtained also some
                    advantages over the Sabines and Veientines; and to render his intercourse with
                    the right bank of the river both more easy and more secure, he formed a wooden
                    bridge across the Tiber, and fortified the hill Janiculum. The oldest remaining
                    monument of Rome, the prison, formed out of a stone quarry on the Capitoline
                    hill, is also said to have been the work of Ancus. He died in peace, respected
                    and beloved, and was known in tradition by the designation of “the good
                    Ancus.”</p>
                <p>That part of Roman history at which we have now arrived, is at once characterized
                    by great interest and by great obscurity. It has the appearance of a great poem,
                    containing just enough of fact to give it credibility in the ears of willing
                    listeners, and enough of fiction and embellishment to destroy all its
                    pretensions to the severely simple character of history. In our opinion this is
                    its real character; and we are by no means disposed to discard more of it than
                    seems of itself to assume no claim upon our belief. No reader can possibly
                    mistake poetic ornament for fact; but there is one aspect of the narrative in
                    which the common reader may be mistaken. It is not enough that an event be
                    strange, or even almost marvellous, in order to be discredited. Many things are
                    abundantly strange in our eyes which nevertheless did actually occur. The wild,
                    strange, and daring exploits recorded of the early founders of nations are
                    liable to be disbelieved by posterity, in the exercise of its cool philosophic
                    criticism. But the founders of a nation are generally men of daring and
                    enthusiastic character, whose actual deeds are constantly hovering on the brink
                    of the incredible. Nations, like individuals, have a period of youth, in which
                    their history is naturally full of deeds of lofty daring, strange adventure, and
                    all but miraculous exploit. The most truthful narrative of a nation’s youth must
                    contain accounts of those deeds of scarcely imaginable hardihood; and such a
                    narrative will seem utterly unworthy of belief to the cool philosopher of a
                    calmer and more thoughtful age. Hitherto we have been attempting to obtain a
                    glimpse of the very infancy of Rome; now we are to view the exploits of its
                    fiery and impetuous youth. We are not lightly to credit every miraculous
                    statement that claims our attention; but neither are we to demand a succession
                    of events regulated by a cool deliberate prudence, such as our own habits of
                    thought and action could alone approve.</p>
                <p>In the days of Ancus Marcius a noble and wealthy Tuscan sought a residence in
                    Rome. He was the son of a citizen of Corinth of some distinction, who had left
                    his native country to avoid the tyranny of an usurper. Having settled at
                    Tarquinii, a city on the coast of Etruria, he married an Etruscan lady of the
                    highest rank. His son, in virtue of his mother’s rank, belonged to the ruling
                    caste of Etruria, the Lucumones; but the pride of that caste would not permit
                    them to suffer a person of mixed descent to participate in their hereditary
                    honours. He married an Etruscan lady of the noblest birth, Tanaquil by name, who
                    could not brook that her husband should be disparaged by her haughty kindred.
                    They left Tarquinii, and journeyed to Rome, in the hope of being received by
                    Ancus in a manner more suited to their dignity. They had reached the brow of the
                    Janiculum, and were in sight of Rome, when an eagle hovering over them, stooped,
                    snatched his cap, and after soaring aloft with it to a great height, again
                    descended and placed it on his head. Tanaquil, versed in the lore of Tuscan
                    augury, understood the omen, and embracing her husband, bade him proceed
                    joyfully, for the loftiest fortunes awaited him. He was received as a Roman
                    citizen, and assumed the name of Lucius Tarquinius. His courage, his wisdom, and
                    his wealth, soon recommended him to the favourable notice of the king, and made
                    him greatly esteemed also by the people generally. On the death of Ancus he was
                    chosen king, and received from the assembly the customary sanction to his
                    assumption of sovereignty.</p>
                <p>Scarcely was Tarquin seated on the throne when the Latin states broke the treaty
                    which they had made with Ancus, and began to make inroads upon the Roman
                    territor)·. Tarquinius marched against them, defeated them in battle, and took
                    and plundered Apiolae, where he obtained an immense booty. Prosecuting his
                    victorious career, he made himself master of Cameria, Crustumerium, Medullia,
                    Ameriola, Ficulnea, Corniculum, and Nomentum. The Aequi also felt the power of
                    his arms, and were obliged to humble themselves before him. While he was engaged
                    with the Latins, the Sabines availed themselves of his absence, mustered their
                    forces, crossed the Anio, and ravaged the country up to the very walls of Rome.
                    Tarquinius returning from his Latin wars, encountered the Sabines, and after a
                    <pb break="no" facs="ht:wu.89119129625&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=375"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0719-0375-0365"/>desperate conflict, drove them from the Roman
                    territories. Next year they again passed the Anio by a bridge of boats, and
                    advanced towards Rome. Tarquinius met them in battle, and by the superiority of
                    his cavalry gained a complete victory. During the battle a party of Romans, sent
                    for that purpose, burned the bridge of boats, so that the routed Sabines were
                    cut off from their retreat, and driven into the river, where great numbers of
                    them perished. Their bodies and arms, floating down the Tiber, brought the first
                    intelligence of the victory to Rome. He then crossed the river, inflicted upon
                    them a second defeat, and compelled them to surrender the town and lands of
                    Collatia, which they had previously taken from the Latins. Tarquinius placed a
                    strong garrison in the town, and assigned the capture to his brother’s son, who
                    thence took the name of Collatinus. In this war the king’s son, a youth of
                    fourteen, slew a foe with his own hand, and received as a reward of honour a
                    robe bordered with purple, and a hollow ball of gold to be suspended round his
                    neck; and these continued to be the distinctive dress and ornament of the Roman
                    youth of patrician rank, till they assumed the <hi rend="italic">toga
                    virilis,</hi> or manly gown.</p>
                <p>Tarquinius is likewise said to have engaged in war with the Etruscan nations, to
                    have taken several of their cities, and to have overthrown them, notwithstanding
                    a confederacy of all their twelve states against him. In token of their
                    submission to his power, the Etruscans at length sent him a golden crown, an
                    ivory throne and sceptre, a purple tunic and robe figured with gold, and twelve
                    axes bound up in bundles of rods to be borne before him, such as they used when
                    their twelve cities chose a common leader in war. These, by the permission of
                    the people, Tarquinius adopted as the insignia of kingly power; and, with the
                    exception of the crown, and of the embroidered robe, they remained as such both
                    to his successors on the throne, and to the consuls, unless on the days when
                    they went in public triumph to the Capitol.</p>
                <p>Such were the military exploits ascribed to Tarquinius; and there is nothing so
                    improbable in them as to startle our belief. It is indeed manifest from other
                    indications, that about the period assumed as the reign of Tarquinius Priscus,
                    as he is called for the sake of distinction, the dominions of Rome must have
                    comprised nearly all the territory which he is said to have conquered, and also
                    that the city must have risen to great wealth and power. The latter point is
                    proved by the great public works, which all accounts agree in ascribing to him.
                    He built the cloaca maxima, or great sewers, to drain off the water from between
                    the Capitoline and Palatine, and the Palatine and Aventine hills. This vast
                    drain was constructed of huge blocks of hewn stone, triply arched, and of such
                    dimensions, that a barge could float along in it beneath the very streets of the
                    city. Earthquakes have shaken the city and the adjacent hills; but the cloaca
                    maxima remains to this day unimpaired, an enduring monument of the power and
                    skill of the king and the people by whom it was constructed. The Circus Maximus,
                    or great race-course, was also a work of this monarch, intended for the display
                    of what were called the great, or Roman games, “ludi magni Romani.” The forum,
                    with its rows of shops, was also the work of Tarquinius; and he began to
                    surround the city with a wall of massy hewn stones. He likewise made preparation
                    to fulfil a vow to build a great temple on the Capitoline hill to the chief
                    deities of Rome. <note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>This
                    mention of the building of temples on the Capitoline hill to the chief deities
                    of Rome by Tarquinius Priscus, refers in all probability to the introduction to
                    Rome of the refined and poetical idolatry of Greece, and receives some colouring
                    of credibility from the account of his descent from a native of Corinth.
                    Beaufort proves, that for the first 170 years of its existence at least, there
                    were no images at Rome, unless the rude block of stone called the god Terminus
                    might be considered an image. See <hi rend="italic"> La République Romaine,</hi>
                    par M. de Beaufort. </p></note></p>
                <p>To conclude the legendary history of Tarquinius, he is said to have been murdered
                    by the treachery of the sons of his predecessor Ancus Marcius. They, perceiving
                    the favour with which the king regarded Servius Tullius, and fearing an attempt
                    to make him king, to the exclusion of their own pretensions and hopes, hired two
                    countrymen to pretend a quarrel, and to appear before the king seeking redress.
                    While he was listening to the complaint of one, the other struck him on the head
                    with an axe, and then they both made their escape. The conspirators did not,
                    however, obtain the fruit of their treachery. Tanaquil gave out that the king
                    was not dead, but only stunned by the blow, and had appointed Servius Tullius to
                    rule in his name till he should recover. Servius immediately assumed the ensigns
                    and exercised the power of royalty. The murderers were seized and punished, and
                    the Marcii fled disappointed from the city. When the death of Tarquinius could
                    no longer be concealed, the power of Servius was so well established, that the
                    people were perfectly ready to grant him the usual confirmation in the powers of
                    the sovereignty.</p>
                <p>The accounts respecting the origin of Servius Tullius are as obscure as those of
                    any of his predecessors. The most ancient and poetical legend represents him as
                    the son of Ocrisia, a captive and slave of Tanaquil the queen, by the Lar, or
                    household god. Later legends made him a son of one of the king’s clients, and
                    for sometime a slave; or the son of a man of rank and power in one of the
                    conquered Latin cities, who being slain in the war, his widow was carried to
                    Rome in her pregnancy, and she and her infant son were protected by Tanaquil.
                    <note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Another account of the
                    origin of Servius has been preserved by a speech of the emperor Claudius, as
                    given in the Etruscan Annals. Claudius begins to recount how often the form of
                    government had been changed, and even the royal dignity bestowed on foreigners.
                    Then, be says of Servius Tullius, “According to our Annals, he was the son of
                    the captive Ocrisia; but if we follow the Tuscans, he was the faithful follower
                    of Caeles Vibenna, and shared all his fortunes. At last, driven by various
                    fortunes, he quitted Etruria with the remains of the army which had served under
                    Caeles, went to Rome, and occupied the Caelian hill, giving it that name after
                    his former commander. He exchanged his Tuscan name, Mastarna, for a Roman one,
                    obtained the kingly power, and employed it to the great advantage of the state.”
                    See Niebuhr, vol. t. p. 381. </p></note> All accounts represent him as enjoying
                    the favour of Tarquinius and his queen, and obtaining the throne in a great
                    measure by the judicious management of the latter. It would seem as if Servius
                    had in the very beginning of his reign encountered the opposition of the
                    patricians. He is said not to have allowed any interregnum, or to have permitted
                    the senate to take the lead in his election to the sovereignty; but as he had
                    already acted as king before the death of Tarquinius was publicly known, so to
                    have made a direct application, without any other preliminary process, to the
                    comitia curiata, and to have been by them invested with the powers of former
                    kings. The only historical conclusion which can be deduced from these incidental
                    notices is, that a contest had begun between the kings and the patrician body,
                    in which the kings deemed it their soundest policy to diminish the power of the
                    patricians, in order to maintain their own. But as no direct diminution of their
                    power could have been attempted without exciting an immediate insurrection, it
                    was deemed expedient by these kings to raise a counterbalancing power in the
                    state, which, having received its existence from them, might be expected to lend
                    them aid in repressing the exorbitant power of the patrician body, combined with
                    their hereditary privileges.</p>
                <p>This view, it will be observed, both coincides completely with the tradition that
                    Tarquinius first elevated the tribe of the Luceres to the possession of full
                    senatorial power; and <pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:wu.89119129625&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=376" xml:id="kp-eb0719-0376-0366"
                    />with the tradition that his very coming to Rome was caused by the pride of the
                    privileged and hereditary order of Lucumones, who had excluded him from
                    participating in the honours to which he thought himself entitled both by birth
                    and merit. Finding at Rome also a patrician class, in the possession of
                    hereditary powers and privileges, he not unnaturally regarded them with
                    jealousy, and endeavoured to call into being a counterbalancing power, by which
                    his influence might not only be maintained, but rendered predominant. The policy
                    pursued by all the kings of the Etruscan line entirely accords with this view,
                    so as to give it at least an air of great probability.</p>
                <p>The twelve Etruscan cities which had acknowledged the dominion of Tarquinius,
                    revolted on hearing of his death. They were speedily reduced to subjection by
                    Servius, for which military success he was decreed a triumph by the people. But
                    his triumphs in war were not to be compared with his triumphs in peace. Finding
                    the population of Rome increasing rapidly, he enlarged the pomoerium, or sacred
                    boundary of the city. When first formed by Romulus, the pomoerium included
                    merely the Palatine hill and a portion of the plain at its base. It was extended
                    by Numa so as to include the Capitoline and Quirinal hills, in consequence of
                    which the Sabine town became completely incorporated with the Roman. Servius
                    again enlarged it, so as to bring within its compass the Viminal and Esquiline
                    hills, in addition to those which were the appropriate seats of the great
                    tribes. He finished the work begun by Tarquinius, by building the walls of the
                    city of hewn stone; and where the hills which he had included in the new
                    addition to the city sloped gently down towards the plain, he fenced them by a
                    large mound of earth, and a moat from which the earth of the mound was dug. For
                    the purpose of consolidating more firmly the union of the races of which the
                    nation was composed, he built the temple of Diana on the Aventine hill, which
                    was to be the chief abode of the Latin population recently brought to Rome. This
                    temple constituted a monument of the league between the Roman people and the
                    thirty confederate Latin towns; and, although Romans, Sabines, and Latins
                    sacrificed there in common, yet, as Rome was now recognised as the head of the
                    confederation, the Romans were allowed to have the precedency.</p>
                <p>But the most important achievements of Servius Tullius, were his alterations of,
                    and additions to, the constitutional principles of the state. Incidental notices
                    have already been given respecting the origin and development of the Roman
                    constitution, so far as the obscurity of the traditional narratives and poetic
                    legends have furnished scope for the treatment of such topics. To these we shall
                    subsequently advert; but we must now prosecute the historical narrative, so far
                    as it can be called historical; for there is no part of ancient Rome that more
                    evidently abounds with poetic legends than the conclusion of the kings, and the
                    first years of the commonwealth. Fortunately there is no absolute necessity to
                    discard the poetic legends; for however destitute they may be of what is termed
                    historical truth, there can be no question but that they present a very accurate
                    and lively picture of the times and events in which they are said to have taken
                    place.</p>
                <p>Servius Tullius had given his two daughters in marriage to the two sons of
                    Tarquinius Priscus. These daughters were of tempers very unlike, as were also
                    their husbands. The elder, Tullia, was of a gentle disposition, her younger
                    sister fierce, imperious, and ambitious. Aruns Tarquinius was of a mild and
                    quiet character, his brother Lucius proud, restless, and domineering. To
                    counteract these tempers, Servius had given the gentle princess to the ambitious
                    prince, and made the haughty damsel wife to the mild husband. But this
                    dissimilarity of temper did not produce the effect which he had expected. The
                    fiery tempered of each couple became dissatisfied with the one of gentler
                    nature; the milder wife and husband perished by the crimes of their aspiring
                    mates, who were speedily united in a second shameless marriage. Then did the
                    aspiring temper of the one urge on the haughty and ambitious heart of the other,
                    till they resolved to make way to the throne by the murder of the good old man,
                    their king and father. To this attempt Lucius was encouraged by the unconcealed
                    dissatisfaction of the patricians with the influence obtained by the plebeians
                    in the new constitution. Their dissatisfaction was increased by a rumour that
                    Servius intended to abolis!)The monarchical form altogether, and divide the sway
                    between two consuls, one to be chosen from the patrician,and onefrom the
                    plebeian body. Having formed a strong faction among the patricians, Tarquinius
                    went to the senate-house, seated himself in the royal chair, and summoned the
                    senators to meet king Tarquinius. Servius having heard the rumour, hastened to
                    the senate-house, accused Tarquinius of treason, and laid hold of him to remove
                    him from the royal chair. The usurper instantly seized the old man, dragged him
                    to the door, and threw him with great force down the steps. There he lay for a
                    few moments stunned and bleeding with the fall; then rising slowly staggered
                    away towards his palace. Some ruffians employed by Tarquinius, pursued,
                    overtook, and killed him, leaving the body lying bleeding in the street.
                    Meantime, tidings of what was going on had reached Tullia, who immediately
                    mounted her chariot, drove to the senate-house, and saluted Tarquinius as king.
                    He bade her withdraw from such a tumult; and she, on her return, passed along
                    the same street where lay the bleeding body of her newly murdered father. The
                    mules shrunk, the charioteer stopped short, and pointed out the appalling
                    spectacle. In a loud and imperious tone of voice she commanded him to drive on;
                    the chariot wheels rolled over the yet warm form, crushing and mangling it as
                    they proceeded, till the spurting blood stained the robes of the more than
                    parricide. From that hour, in remembrance of that hideous scene, the street was
                    called the Vicus Sceleratus, or Wicked Street.</p>
                <p>Tarquinius having thus obtained forcible possession of the throne, declined to
                    submit to the form of an election, or to make the customary appeals to the
                    comitia curiata for the ratification of his kingly power. He seized the crown as
                    if it were hereditary; and seemed resolved to rule without the concurrence of
                    any of the great assemblies. But as he had been raised to the throne by the aid
                    of the patricians, his first act was to gratify them by repealing the privileges
                    which Servius had granted to the plebeians. He suppressed the institution of the
                    comitia centuriata, and even prohibited the meetings of the country tribes at
                    the paganalia. But this was only the beginning of his tyranny. He depressed the
                    commons or plebeians; but he had no intention to permit the power of the
                    patricians to become too strong, especially as he was himself but too well aware
                    of their treachery to the former king. He therefore surrounded himself with a
                    bodyguard, the ready instruments of his oppression; and, under colour of
                    justice, banished or put to death, on false accusations, all who were either too
                    powerful or too wealthy to be trusted, or whom he suspected of disaffection to
                    himself. In this manner he reduced the patricians into a state of subjection
                    almost as deep as that into which they had assisted him to reduce the
                    plebeians.</p>
                <p>Being now possessed of nearly despotic powet, he turned his attention to the
                    enlargement of his kingdom. He gave his daughter in marriage to Octavius
                    Mamilius of Tusculum, the most powerful of the Latin chiefs; and partly by
                    intrigues, partly by force, he procured Rome to be acknowledged the head of the
                    Latin confederacy. Herdonius, the only man who dared to oppose his proud
                    demeanour, he caused to be put to death by false accusations, and completely
                    incorporated the Latin troops with those of Rome. The Hernici were also included
                    in this confederacy. One <pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:wu.89119129625&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=377" xml:id="kp-eb0719-0377-0367"
                    />Latin city, Gabii, refused to join this league, and was assailed by
                    Tarquinius. The struggle was long and severe; but at length Tarquinius is said
                    to have obtained possession of it by means of a stratagem, conducted by his son
                    Sextus, similar to that by which Zopyrus gained possession of Babylon for Darius
                    Hystaspis. He turned his arms next against the Volsci, and took Suessa Pometia,
                    where he obtained a very great booty, and retained the tithe of it for his own
                    share.</p>
                <p>Thus powerful and enriched, he next proceeded to finish the great works left
                    incomplete by his predecessors. He finished the cloaca maxima, and prepared to
                    build the temple which his father, during the Sabine war, had vowed to the three
                    great deities, Jupiter, Juno, and Minerva. For this purpose he levelled the brow
                    of the hill, originally called by the Sabines Saturnius, but better known by its
                    subsequent name, the Capitoline hill. In clearing away the ground for the
                    foundation of this temple, a fresh human skull was found; whence the augurs
                    predicted that Rome should be the capital, or chief city of the world; whence
                    also the name by which that hill was always subsequently known. The hill had
                    formerly been almost covered with altars and shrines consecrated by the Sabines.
                    Tarquinius inquired by augury whether the deities, to whom these were sacred,
                    would yield their places toJupiter, Juno, and Minerva. Theauguries allowed the
                    removal of all except the shrines ofTerminus and Youth. This was interpreted as
                    itself an omen, that the boundaries of the Roman empire should never recede, and
                    that the state should be for ever young.</p>
                <p>The chief builders of the capitol were Etruscan workmen, whose skill was superior
                    to that of the Romans; but Tarquinius compelled the Roman commons to work also
                    as labourers, giving them merely a certain supply of provisions daily, as if
                    they were mere slaves. They groaned wearily underneath his heavy yoke, but he
                    ruled them with a high hand, and sent colonies of the most refractory of them to
                    the frontiers of his conquests in the Volscian lands. Under the strong and
                    imperious sway of this haughty, yet able tyrant, Rome reached an extent of
                    territory and a pitch of power greatly beyond what it had ever before attained.
                    There may, however, be the aspect of external greatness, and the reality of
                    internal wretchedness; but such a state of affairs cannot be permanent.</p>
                <p>Hitherto, the narrative diverges little from the plain course of what was, or
                    might have been, historical truth; and it is not undeserving of remark, that the
                    conduct of Tarquinius Superbus is very natural for a prince who retained much of
                    the Etruscan notions respecting hereditary rights, and scorn of the lower
                    classes. The plan of employing the plebs in task-work, without any other support
                    than a scanty allowance of food, might have been brought from the Nile, as
                    easily as from Etruria; and is some corroboration of the theory which would
                    bring the hereditary half priest half noble caste of Lucumones from Egypt.</p>
                <p>About this time the strange story of the Sibyl is told. An unknown woman, of
                    foreign aspect and manners, came to the king and offered him nine books of
                    prophecies, for which she demanded a large sum. The king refused. The woman
                    departed, burnt three of the books, and then returned and demanded the same sum
                    for the remaining six. The king still refused; and again the woman went away,
                    burnt three, and returning, demanded the same price as at the first. Struck by
                    this strange conduct, Tarquinius consulted the augurs, who told him that it was
                    essential to the safety of Rome to procure the books. Accordingly he purchased
                    them, and the woman departed, and was seen no more. These Sibylline books were
                    then deposited in a chest of stone, and entrusted to the charge of two men of
                    the highest rank, who kept them under ground in the Capitol. Their contents were
                    never divulged; nor were they ever consulted, except by a decree of the senate,
                    and in times of the greatest public danger and distress.</p>
                <p>But the tyranny of Tarquinius had now nearly reached its limits. Various portents
                    foreshewed its approaching overthrow. According to the legend, the first
                    indications of the coming doom were seen in an unnatural violation of the sacred
                    rites. A huge snake crawled out from an altar in the court of the palace, in the
                    time of sacrifice; the fire suddenly died out, and the snake devoured the
                    victim. To ascertain what this prodigy portended, the king sent two of his sons
                    to consult the oracle of Apollo at Delphi. They took with them their cousin,
                    Lucius Junius Brutus, who had been brought up along with them in the palace,
                    disregarded on account of his apparent apathy of manner, and laughed at as
                    almost half an idiot. He was the younger son of a sister of Tarquinius by Marcus
                    Junius; and his elder brother had been put to death by his uncle for his wealth.
                    To escape a similar fate he had feigned idiocy, and was consequently spared and
                    despised. So runs the legend, to account for the name Brutus; which, however, in
                    old Latin is nearly synonymous with Severus, and may have been given him merely
                    on account of his reserved gravity of manner. The answer of the Delphic oracle
                    was, that the king should fall when a dog should speak with a human voice. This
                    response was of course intended secretly to apply to Brutus, and his unexpected
                    display of mental ability. The young princes also asked which of the king’s sons
                    should succeed him; and were answered in general terms, that the regal power
                    should be enjoyed by the person who should first salute his mother. Brutus, as
                    they were departing, stumbled, fell, and kissed the earth, thus fulfilling the
                    meaning of the oracle.</p>
                <p>Soon after this event, Tarquinius waged war against Ardea of the Rutuli, a people
                    on the coast of Latium. The city was very strong both by nature and art, and
                    made a protracted resistance. The army lay encamped around the walls, in order
                    to reduce it by hunger, since they could not by direct force. While lying half
                    idle at Ardea, the princes and their kinsmen, Brutus and Collatinus, happening
                    to feast together, began in their gaiety to boast each of the beauty and virtue
                    of his wife. Collatinus extolled his wife Lucretia as beyond all rivalry. On a
                    sudden they resolved to ride to Rome and decide the dispute by ascertaining
                    which of the respective ladies was spending her time in the most becoming and
                    laudable manner. They found the wives of the king’s sons entertaining other
                    noble ladies with a costly banquet. They then rode on to Collatia; and though it
                    was near midnight, they found Lucretia with her handmaids around her working at
                    the loom. It was admitted that Lucretia was the most worthy lady; and they
                    returned again to the camp at Ardea.</p>
                <p>But the beauty and virtue of Lucretia had excited in the base heart of Sextus
                    Tarquinius the fire of lawless passion. After a few days he returned to
                    Collatia, where he was hospitably entertained by Lucretia as a kinsman of her
                    husband. At midnight be secretly entered her chamber; end when persuasions were
                    ineffectual, he threatened to kill her and one of her male slaves, and laying
                    the body by her side, to declare to Collatinus that he had slain her in the act
                    of adultery. The dread of a disgrace to her memory, from which there should be
                    no possible mode of wiping away the stain, produced an effect which the fear of
                    death could not have done; an effect not unnatural in a heathen, who might dread
                    the disgrace of a crime more than its commission, but which shews the
                    conventional morality and virtue of the time, how ill-founded, and almost weakly
                    sentimental, in even that boasted instance of female virtue. Having accomplished
                    his wicked purpose, Sextus again returned to the camp.</p>
                <p>Immediately after his departure, Lucretia sent for her husband and father.
                    Collatinus came from the camp accompanied by Brutus; and her father, Lucretius,
                    from the city, along with Publius Valerius. They found Lucretia sitting on her
                    bed, weeping and inconsolable. In brief terms <pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:wu.89119129625&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=378" xml:id="kp-eb0719-0378-0368"
                    />she told what had befallen her, required of them the pledge of their right
                    hands that they would avenge her injuries, then drawing a knife from under her
                    robe, stabbed herself to the heart and died. Her husband and father burst into a
                    loud cry of agony; but Brutus snatching the weapon from the wound, held it up,
                    and swore by the chaste and noble blood which stained it, that he would pursue
                    to the uttermost Tarquinius and all his accursed race, and thenceforward suffer
                    no man to be king in Rome. He then gave the bloody knife to her husband, her
                    father, and Valerius, and called on them to take the same oath. Brutus thus
                    became at once the leader of the enterprise. They bore the body of Lucretia to
                    the market place. There Brutus addressed the people, and moved them to
                    vengeance. The youth immediately enrolled themselves into an army. Part remained
                    to guard the city, and part proceeded with Brutus to Rome. Their coming raised a
                    tumult, and drew together great numbers of the citizens. Brutus, availing
                    himself of his rank and authority, as tribune of the celeres, or captain of the
                    knights, summoned the people to the forum, and proceeded to relate the bloody
                    deed which the villany of Sextus Tarquinius had caused. Nor did he content
                    himself with that, but set before them in the most animated manner the cruelty,
                    tyranny, and oppression of Tarquinius himself; the guilty manner in which he
                    obtained the kingdom, the violent means he had used to retain it, and the unjust
                    repeal of all the laws of Servius Tullius, by which he had robbed them of their
                    liberties. By this means he so effectually roused the people, that they passed a
                    decree abolishing the kingly power itself, and banishing for ever Lucius
                    Tarquinius Superbus, and his wife and children. In the midst of the tumult the
                    wicked Tullia fled from her house and the city, pursued by the curses of the
                    whole population wherever she passed, imprecating upon her head the vengeance of
                    the furies, for the murder of her sister, husband, and father.</p>
                <p>Intelligence of the tumult had in the mean time reached the camp at Ardea.
                    Tarquinius hastened to the city, if possible to suppress it; and Brutus,
                    assigning the command of the city to Lucretius, set out himself for the camp,
                    taking a different road, so as to avoid meeting the dethroned usurper. When he
                    reached the camp he soon roused in the army the same indignation against the
                    tyrant, which had blazed so strongly at Rome. The commanders of the troops
                    joined him; the army adhering to the observances of the comitia centuriata,
                    confirmed in legal form the decree of the citizens, banishing the Tarquin
                    family, and abolishing the regal name and power tbr ever. They then made a truce
                    with the Ardeans for fifteen years, and marched towards Rome. Tarquinius,
                    finding the gates shut against him, and learning the defection of the army, fled
                    with his sons to Caere in Etruria. Thus ended the reign of Tarquinius Superbus;
                    and with it the existence of the monarchical form of government at Rome.</p>
                <p>The monarchical form of government being thus abolished, the next step was to
                    constitute another in its stead. Lucretius was appointed <hi rend="italic"
                    >inter-rex,</hi> and the comitia centuriata were held by his authority in the
                    Campus Martius, when Brutus and Collatinus were chosen to be supreme
                    magistrates, at first with the name of praetors, which was afterwards changed to
                    that of consuls, by which title, as the better known, we shall continue to
                    designate these colleagues in the chief power. They retained all the power of
                    the kings, and all the insignia of royalty, except the diadem; but the rods and
                    axes, the emblems of the power of life and death, were carried before each
                    alternately for a month. In order that the sacred rites might be duly performed,
                    they appointed a priest with the title of <hi rend="italic">king of the
                    sacrifices,</hi> but without political power. They then proceeded to fill up the
                    due number of three hundred in the senate, which had been diminished partly by
                    the tyranny of the last king, and partly by the flight of his adherents, who
                    were implicated in his crimes. They restored those laws of Servius Tullius which
                    were favourable to the commonalty; and re-appointed the meetings and common
                    sacrifices of the tribes.</p>
                <p>Rome seemed now to have regained its liberties, but it had not obtained the sense
                    of security. It was thought necessary to banish Collatinus, who was the nephew
                    of Tarquinius, that there might remain none of that hated race in the city.
                    Collatinus yielding without a struggle, withdrew to Lavinium, and there died in
                    old age. Publius Valerius was elected consul in his stead, by the comitia
                    centuriata.</p>
                <p>It was not to be expected that the banished king would submit without a contest.
                    He first attempted to induce the Latin states to espouse his quarrel; and
                    finding them unwilling, he applied to the Etruscans. Ambassadors were sent from
                    Etruria to demand the restitution of his private property. This demand gave rise
                    to warm discussions, whether they should obey justice by giving up the private
                    property ofTarquinius, or prudence, by refiising to put money into the hands of
                    an enemy, which they foresaw would soon be used against themselves. The plea of
                    justice prevailed, and the property was ordered to be restored. But during the
                    discussion, and the period required for collecting the property, the Etruscan
                    ambassadors were intriguing with the younger patricians in the formation of a
                    plot to restore the king. Considerable numbers of the more haughty of them,
                    offended with the favour shewn to the commons, joined in the conspiracy, among
                    whom were the two sons of Brutus himself. The conspiracy was discovered by the
                    information of a slave, who had overheard them while concocting this plot in
                    secret. The two consuls called the people to the comitium, and commanded the
                    conspirators to be brought bound before them. The whole plot was detected; the
                    Etruscan ambassadors permitted to depart uninjured, out of respect to the laws
                    of nations; and the convicted traitors thrown into prison to await their trial.
                    Next day the trial was conducted in public, and sentence of condemnation passed.
                    Brutus commanded the sentence to be put in execution upon his own sons. They
                    were stripped, beaten with rods, and then beheaded. Nor till this fearful
                    example of stern retributive justice had been completed did Brutus leave the
                    assembly; and when he departed, the people could do no less than inflict an
                    equal doom on the remaining conspirators.</p>
                <p>The private danger was thus turned aside, but a public tempest was at hand. The
                    Etruscan cities of Tarquinii and Veii took up arms in the cause of the banished
                    king, and advanced against Rome. The Romans crossed the Tiber to encounter the
                    foe; and the two armies met near the grove of Arsia. Before the battle began,
                    Brutus, who was riding at the head of the Roman cavalry, was descried by Aruns
                    Tarquinius, who led those of Etruria. The banished prince, burning with personal
                    hatred, spurred his steed furiously against the consul. Brutus, with equal
                    animosity, met him in mid career; and in the shock each pierced the body of his
                    antagonist with his spear, and they fell wounded and dying together to the
                    ground. The cavalry on each side hastened to avenge their leaders; the battle
                    became general; each right wing was victorious over its opponent; and after a
                    long and bloody struggle, night put an end to the undecided contest. Both
                    parties kept the field; but in the dead of night a voice was heard from the
                    adjacent grove, declaring that the Etruscans had lost one man more than the
                    Romans, who were, and would be victorious. A panic seized the enemy, they
                    deserted their camp and fled; and at dawn the Romans found nothing to do but to
                    carry off the booty. Valerius returned to the city in triumph, and in the forum
                    pronounced a funeral oration over the body of Brutus. The matrons mourned for
                    him a whole year, and his statue was placed in the Capitol, among the kings,
                    with a sword in his hand.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="ht:wu.89119129625&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=379"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0719-0379-0369"/>
                <p>After the death of Brutus, Valerius for a time retained the consular power alone;
                    not from ambition, but probably that he might, unobstructed, pass those laws
                    which he deemed necessary for the public welfare. He enacted a law, by which
                    every person who should seek kingly power was pronounced accursed, so that any
                    man might kill him without fear of punishment. In the presence of the assembly
                    of the people, (the populus, ί. <hi rend="italic">e.</hi> the comitia curiata,)
                    he caused the ensigns of consular power to be lowered; thus acknowledging the
                    supreme authority of that assembly. But his best act was the passing of that
                    law, <hi rend="italic">flex de provocatione,)</hi> which gave to all Roman
                    citizens the right of appeal to the assembly of the people from the sentence of
                    any magistrate. This was the first law enacted by the comitia centuriata; and as
                    soon as it was passed Valerius took away the axes from the bundles of rods which
                    were borne before the consuls. This right of appeal existed only in the city
                    itself, and within a mile of it. Beyond that distance the military power of the
                    consuls remained unlimited, and the axes were borne and used as formerly. The
                    enactment of these laws obtained for Valerius the surname of Poplicola.</p>
                <p>As soon as they were passed, he held the comitia for the election of a consul in
                    the room of Brutus. Spurius Lucretius was chosen; and he dying within a few
                    days, Marcus Horatius Pulvillus was elected to complete his year. About this
                    time occurred that famous treaty between Rome and Carthage, mentioned by
                    Polybius, and which is perhaps the best proof of the power of Rome under her
                    latter kings. Ardea, Antium, Aricia, Circeii, and Terracina, are mentioned in
                    such terms as to cause them to be regarded as subject cities, and Rome
                    stipulates for them as well as for herself. The treaty was signed by Brutus and
                    Horatius; whence a difficulty has arisen, as these two were not at any time
                    colleagues in the consular office. But Gibbon <note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See Essai sur L’Etude de La Littérature.
                    </p></note> has shewn that such treaties were signed by the <hi rend="italic">
                    feciales</hi> more properly than by the consuls; and there is no reason for
                    doubting that Brutus and Horatius may have been conjoined in that office.</p>
                <p>In the mean while Tarquinius, finding the inability of the Veientians and
                    Tarquinians to replace him on the throne, applied to Lars Porsenna, king of
                    Clusium, at that time the most powerful of all the Etruscan monarchs. Porsenna
                    raised a great army, and marched towards Rome. He was met by the Romans near the
                    fortress on the Janiculum; but almost at the first encounter they took to
                    flight, and the Etrurians pursued them impetuously as they sought safety by
                    crossing the bridge. Horatius Cocles, seeing the danger that the city might be
                    taken at once if the enemy should enter it along with the flying Romans, posted
                    himself on the bridge, made head against the pursuers, and called on his
                    countrymen to cut down the bridge between him and the city. Spurius Larcius, and
                    Titus Herminius lent their aid in the heroic deed. When the bridge was nearly
                    cut through, Codes sent back his two companions, and singly maintained his post.
                    At length the crash of the falling beams, and the shouts of his countrymen gave
                    him to know that the deed was done; when calling on the god of the Tiber to
                    receive him, he plunged into the stream, and, accoutered as he was, swam in
                    safety to the shore, through the missile weapons of the enemy, which showered
                    fast and thick around him.</p>
                <p>Thus was the city saved from that sudden danger; but all its peril was not over.
                    Porsenna not only retained possession of the Janiculum, but sending his army
                    across the river in boats, pillaged the country, cut off all supplies, and
                    reduced Rome to the utmost distress by famine. In this emergency, a noble youth,
                    Caius Mucius, undertook to rid his country of this dangerous enemy. He made his
                    way into the camp of Porsenna, and entered into the very prae torium, where he
                    saw a person royally attired, and seated on a chair of state. Supposing this to
                    be the king, Mucius sprung upon him, and stabbed him to the heart. He was
                    immediately siezed, and led before Porsenna, whose secretary he had thus killed.
                    There he acknowledged his deed, and told the king that his danger was by no
                    means over. Porsenna threatened him with death by torture, unless he would
                    divulge the plots by which his life was threatened. Mucius immediately stretched
                    forth his right hand and thrust it into the fire of an altar which was burning
                    before the king, saying, “Behold how much I regard your threats of torture.” He
                    held it in the flames till it was consumed, without a feature of his stern
                    countenance indicating that he felt the pain. Porsenna, struck with his noble
                    daring and contempt of suffering, commanded him to be set at liberty. Mucius
                    then told him, in requital of his generosity, that he was only one of three
                    hundred patrician youths who had vowed to kill Porsenna; and that he must
                    prepare for their attempts, which would be not less daring than his own. From
                    that time Mucius was called Scaevola, or the left-handed, because he had thus
                    lost the use of his right hand.</p>
                <p>Alarmed by the dangers which threatened him from foes so determined, Porsenna
                    offered terms of peace to the Romans. A treaty was at length concluded,
                    according to which Porsenna ceased to maintain the cause of the Tar-quinian
                    family; but demanded the restitution of all the lands which the Romans had at
                    any time taken from the states of Etruria, and that twenty hostages, ten youths
                    and ten maidens of the first houses, should be given up to him for security that
                    the treaty would be faithfully observed. The legend relates that Cloelia, one of
                    the hostages, escaping from the Etrurian camp, swam across the Tiber on
                    horseback, amidst showers of darts from her baffled pursuers; but that the
                    Romans, jealous of their reputation for good faith, sent her back to the camp of
                    Porsenna. Not to be outdone in generosity, he gave to her and her female
                    companions their freedom, and permitted her to take with her half of the youths;
                    while she, with the delicacy of a Roman maiden, selected those only who were of
                    tender years. The Romans then, at the final settlement of the treaty, sent as a
                    present to Porsenna, an ivory throne and sceptre, a golden crown, and a
                    triumphal robe, the offerings by which the Etruscan cities had once acknowledged
                    the sovereignty of Tarquinius.</p>
                <p>When Porsenna quitted Rome, he entered the Latian territories, and attacked
                    Aricia, the chief town of Latium. The Aricians being aided by the other Latian
                    cities, and also by the Cumans, under the command of Aristodemus, defeated the
                    Etruscans in a great battle, and put a stop to their aggressions. the Romans
                    received the fugitives from Porsenna’s army, and treated them with great
                    kindness; in requital for which Porsenna restored to them thelands which he had
                    conquered beyond the Tiber.</p>
                <p>Such is an outline of the poetical legends respecting the great war against
                    Porsenna. It is, however, clear from other accounts and indications, <note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See Tacitus, Hist iii. 72.
                    and Pliny, xxxiv. 14. </p></note> that Porsenna took the city, deprived it of
                    one-third of its land, as was customary, imposed a tribute upon it, received the
                    usual recognitions of sovereign authority, and even deprived the Romans of the
                    use of metal in any other form than those employed in the purposes of
                    agriculture, that they might not have it in their power to revolt. In this
                    latter statement, we have again an incidental hint of the eastern origin and
                    customs of the Etruscans; in proof of which, reference may be made to the way in
                    which the Philistines tyrannized over the Israelites during one of their periods
                    of conquest. (See Arnold’s History of Rome.)</p>
                <p>Tarquinius, as his last resource, now applied to the Latins, through the
                    influence of his son-in-law Mamilius Oc<pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:wu.89119129625&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=380" xml:id="kp-eb0719-0380-0370"
                    />tavius. He was the more encouraged to hope for success in consequence of a
                    fierce war in which the Romans had been engaged with the Sabines, and by which
                    they had been considerably weakened. For a time the Latins hesitated to provoke
                    an encounter with Rome; and in the mean while the Sabine war continued to harass
                    the republic. Valerius gained repeated victories over them, and some of the
                    Sabines, wearied with fruitless hostilities, were anxious for peace. Attus
                    Clausus, a Sabine chief of great power, came over to the Romans, became a Roman
                    citizen, and took the name of Appius Claudius, on being admitted into the
                    Patrician order. At length Valerius, after gaining another triumph, died, was
                    buried at the public cost, and mourned by the matrons for a year.</p>
                <p>The entreaties of Tarquinius, and the influence of Mamilius, had by this time
                    prevailed among the Latins, and they prepared for a contest with Rome. Nor were
                    the Romans unaware of the approaching struggle; and that it might be full and
                    final, an opportunity was given on both sides for the dissolution of
                    intermarriages, and such other ties as had been mutually contracted by the two
                    nations. The Romans were determined to meet the decisive struggle as it ought to
                    be met. They created a new magistrate, called a Dictator, to whom was entrusted
                    for a period uncontrolled dominion. He was Master of the people; and he chose to
                    be his second in command another officer, whom he named Master of the knights.
                    The dictator was Aulus Postumius; the master of the horse Titus Aebutius. With
                    these were joined in command the most distinguished Romans who had already
                    signalized themselves in war. On the side of the Latins were Mamilius, and the
                    whole of the exiled Tarquinian family, resolved to regain their sway, or perish
                    in tile attempt. The two armies met at the lake Regillus. The dictator and the
                    banished king encountered hand to hand, but were parted by their followers.
                    Mamilius and Aebutius were likewise separated, after the infliction of mutual
                    wounds. Marcus Valerius fell while rushing into the throng of the fight against
                    Sextus Tarquinius. The exiled princes bore down or put to flight all opposed to
                    them, till the dictator himself, assailing indiscriminately the pursuers and the
                    pursued, turned the tide of battle, and forced his way even into the enemy’s
                    camp. In this battle fell the two sons of Tarquinius, Mamilius, and the chief of
                    the Roman warriors who had been the means of gaining their country’s liberty;
                    but the victory was complete. Tarquinius retired to Cumae, where he died, and
                    the Romans were left to enjoy the victory, so gloriously yet dearly
                    purchased.</p>
                <p>Thus terminate the poetic legends respecting the wars waged between the Romans
                    and the banished Tarquinii; and while it must be evident that a great deal of
                    imaginative embellishments have been added to and intermingled with the course
                    of the actual events, still there is enough of verisimilitude in them to give
                    them currency, as at least a very spirit-stirring representation of what might
                    have occurred. Besides, the effect produced on the Roman character by these
                    poetic lays can scarcely be over-estimated, in stirring them up to that stern,
                    unyielding courage, that unswerving energy of will, and that boundless ambition
                    and confidence in the fortunes of Rome, which gained for them the empire of the
                    world. While, therefore, we admit that it is impossible to state how much of
                    fiction has been introduced into the narrative of these events, we see no reason
                    to discredit the general truth of the history. The pride of the Roman historians
                    concurred with the imagination of the poets, in maintaining to the utmost the
                    glory of Rome; yet even from what they have agreed to record, we may arrive at
                    conclusions somewhat different from those which they were anxious to establish.
                    Rome was undoubtedly taken by</p>
                <p>Porsenna; and within twelve years after the expulsion of the last king, the
                    Romans had lost all their territory on tile Etruscan side of the Tiber, and all
                    their dominion over Latium.</p>
                <p>The principles of political liberty had also been severely shaken. It is plain
                    that the Tarquinian family attempted to render the crown hereditary; and availed
                    themselves of the jealousy between the patrician populus and the plebeian
                    commonalty, to deprive each of their rights, and tyrannize over both. A junction
                    enabled the nation to expel its tyrant; but tile contest cost Rome her
                    independence for a few years, and the loss of all her previous acquisitions. The
                    defeat of the Etruscan army at Aricia enabled the Romans to recover their
                    independence, but left them reduced almost within their original limits
                    immediately around the city. The liberties of the commonalty were in danger in
                    another manner, and from a different foe. Instead of a period of peace in the
                    enjoyment of their recovered freedom after tile decisive battle of Regillus, we
                    find dissensions of the most serious kind arising almost immediately between the
                    patricians and the plebeians. As these contests form a very important part of
                    Roman history, especially in a constitutional point of view, and have been much
                    misunderstood, it is necessary to offer a few remarks on their origin and
                    nature.</p>
                <p>It was the policy of Tarquinius to depress the growing power of the commons <hi
                    rend="italic"> (plebs)</hi> as much as possible, that he might the better
                    succeed in his ambitious designs. In this the patricians <hi rend="italic"
                    >(populus)</hi> injudiciously joined him; and all the wise laws of Servius were
                    repealed, or allowed to fall into desuetude. Additional enactments against
                    debtors were flamed, and every step was taken to reduce tile plebeians to a
                    condition little better than slavery. The wars arising out of the expulsion of
                    the Tarquinian family blended for a time the interests of both classes, by the
                    pressure of a common danger; but no sooner was this pressure removed, than the
                    patricians resumed the oppression to which they had been too much accustomed,
                    and were too prone. Again were the comitia centuriata allowed to fall into
                    neglect, while in the senate, and in the comitia curiata, where they possessed
                    exclusive power, the patricians enacted new laws against debtors, by which the
                    plebeians were grievously oppressed.</p>
                <p>The plebeians being composed generally of the population sprung from conquered
                    cities, and admitted to settle at Rome in the enjoyment of personal freedom,
                    were chiefly occupied in the culture of the public lands, or the lands held by
                    patrician families. The loss of territory sustained by Rome in the Etruscan
                    wars, deprived great numbers of the plebeians of their property and employment.
                    Being reduced to poverty, they were compelled to borrow money from the
                    patricians, whose lands lay chiefly within the Ager Romanus, and were not lost,
                    and who also were alone permitted to enjoy the profits of commerce. <note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See Niebuhr, vol. i. pp. 571,
                    <hi rend="italic">et</hi><hi rend="italic">seq</hi> . </p></note> By tile Roman
                    law of debtor and creditor, when a man borrowed money, and his poverty
                    continued, so that he became insolvent, there were but two resources to which he
                    could betake himself. He might sell himself to his creditor, on the condition,
                    that at the expiration of a stated term, if he did not discharge the debt, he
                    should become the slave of his creditor. This was called the entering into a <hi
                    rend="italic">nexum,</hi> and the person entering into this conditional sale of
                    himself was called a <hi rend="italic">nexus.</hi> When the day came, the
                    creditor claimed possession, the magistrates awarded it; and the debtor, his
                    family, and all that belonged to him, passed into the power of the creditor as
                    slaves, and were termed <hi rend="italic">addicti.</hi> If, on the other hand, a
                    man were unwilling thus to sell himself and family, and resolved to meet in his
                    own person the consequences of his debt, the danger thus incurred was much
                    greater. If he <pb break="no" facs="ht:wu.89119129625&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=381"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0719-0381-0371"/>failed to pay, and could neither himself give
                    security, nor obtain any person to give it for him, he might be thrown into a
                    dungeon, loaded with chains, and half starved for sixty days. If during that
                    time he refused to come to any terms with his creditor, he might be again
                    brought to the market place, and the amount of his debt stated, to see whether
                    any person would yet become security for him. On the third day, if no friend
                    appeared, he might be put to death, or sold for a slave beyond the Tiber; nay,
                    if there were more creditors than one, they might actually hew his body in
                    pieces, and divide it among them; and whether a creditor cut off a greater or
                    smaller piece than in due proportion to the debt, he incurred no penalty.</p>
                <p>In this manner vast numbers of the commonalty were reduced to the utmost
                    wretchedness; and instead of the influence which they had been promised by the
                    Servian constitution, they were in a worse condition than the veriest slaves.
                    The old Roman populus, the patricians and their clients, had engrossed all the
                    wealth and power of the community, and formed the government into an exclusive
                    aristocracy. Great numbers of the plebeians were <hi rend="italic">next,</hi>
                    though not yet <hi rend="italic">addicti;</hi> and in this condition felt
                    themselves trembling on the brink of utter ruin. Driven to despair by their
                    distress, the commonsresolved that they would no longer endure their misery and
                    degradation. Such of them as were in the city seized upon and began to fortify
                    the Aventine hill, their own quarter; those who were at the time in the field,
                    deserted their generals, marched to a hill on the north bank of the Anio, beyond
                    the limits of the Ager Romanus, and within that of the Crustuminian tribe. There
                    they established themselves, and proposed to found a new city. The patricians,
                    perceiving the ruin that must fall upon Rome if thus deserted by the great body
                    of the commons, entered into negociations with them for a return. Their demands
                    were not extravagant. They required a general cancelling of the obligations of
                    insolvent debtors, <hi rend="italic">(nexi),</hi> and the release of those who
                    in default of payment had been assigned to the power of their creditors, <hi
                    rend="italic"> (addicti).</hi> They further stipulated, that two of their own
                    body should be acknowledged as their public protectors, and that the persons of
                    these two should be held sacred and inviolable. To these terms the patricians
                    agreed; a solemn treaty was concluded; the two protectors of the commons were
                    chosen, and called Tribunes, and the commons returned to Rome. The spot where
                    this treaty had been concluded was enclosed, and consecrated to Jupiter, and
                    received the name of the Sacred Hill.</p>
                <p>This event was almost of equal importance with the expulsion of the kings and the
                    abolition of the monarchical power. It laid the foundation of the liberties
                    which the body of Roman citizens subsequently enjoyed; and by giving them legal
                    rights and legal protectors, converted into legal contests what might otherwise
                    have rent the state asunder. But at the same time it gave to the tribunate, in
                    the inviolability of the persons of those who held it, the means of acquiring an
                    unlimited power in the state, such as might and did lead to ultimate
                    despotism.</p>
                <p>The termination in an amicable manner of these feuds was greatly promoted by the
                    fact, that the state was then at war with the Aequi and Volsci, two nations of
                    Oscan race, whose lands lay south from Rome. It was no time for protracted civil
                    broils when the country was ravaged, and the city itself threatened by such
                    dangerous neighbours. To the same necessity may be traced the alliance with the
                    Latin states, formed in the consulship of Spurius Cassius, on terms of perfect
                    equality; and seven years afterwards by the same Spurius Cassius, with the
                    Hernicians, on similar terms. These leagues were of the utmost importance to
                    Rome, both as restoring to her the power which she had lost after the expulsion
                    of the kings, and that too on a more equitable and therefore more permanent
                    basis, and in commencing that thoroughly incorporating and blending system which
                    afterwards converted all the inhabitants of Italy into Roman citizens, and thus
                    consolidating her growth, confirmed her power.</p>
                <p>A measure of equal justice, and not less importance, was also attempted by
                    Spurius Cassius, the passing of which would have established the frame of Roman
                    liberties on a secure foundation. This was an Agrarian law. The nature of the
                    Agrarian laws, proposed from time to time at Rome, and always the cause of
                    bitter contests between the patricians and plebeians, was never accurately known
                    till it was explained by Niebuhr. <note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Niebuhr, vol. ii. pp. 129, <hi rend="italic">et</hi><hi

                    rend="italic">seq.</hi></p></note> From him we learn, that when a new territory
                    was gained in war, by the third being taken from the conquered people, part of
                    it was left unenclosed for pasture, and the cultivated parts were either divided
                    among the new citizens who had not previously received any allotment, or left to
                    be occupied by certain individuals, who were required to pay a tithe of the
                    produce to the state. The persons thus allowed to occupy these new acquisitions
                    were generally members of powerful patrician families; and, although tenants at
                    will of the state, they were actual proprietors with respect to the other
                    citizens. When a number of new citizens had been added to the state, it was
                    consistent with the whole polity of Rome to allot them lands: but in order to do
                    so it would be necessary for the state to resume its property from its tenants
                    at will, and divide it among the new citizens; for it was equally a matter of
                    strict justice and sound policy to unite by permanent ties to the state those
                    menby whose blood its victories were gained, and could alone be preserved. To
                    this the occupiers would by no means consent; and thus the public land was
                    wholly unprofitable to the commons, though they had been largely instrumental in
                    conquering it for Rome.</p>
                <p>The Agrarian law proposed by Spurius Cassius had for its object the division of a
                    certain proportion of the public land; while from the occupiers of the remainder
                    he intended to demand the regular payment of the tithe, which had been greatly
                    neglected. His colleague, Proculus Virginius, headed the more aristocratical
                    party of the patrician body in opposing the passing of this law, kept it in
                    abeyance, if not uncarried, till the termination of his consulship, and then
                    accused him before the comitia curiata of having treasonably conspired to make
                    himself king, and for that purpose seeking to ingratiate himself with the
                    commons. He was sentenced to die as a traitor, and was scourged and beheaded,
                    and his house razed to the ground. Such was the fate of the first proposer of an
                    Agrarian law; a topic equally detested by the Roman aristocracy, misinterpreted
                    by the historians, and misunderstood by the moderns, yet a measure of strict
                    justice and sound policy, and sufficiently intelligible when fairly stated.</p>
                <p>The contests between the patricians and the plebeians still continued; but the
                    plebeians had now obtained the means of insuring ultimate success, though for a
                    time defeated and overborne. They refused to serve as soldiers in the wars with
                    which the state was still harassed, and their tribunes protected them in this
                    refusal, till the consuls held their enrolment without the city, where their
                    power was unlimited. At length the patricians consented that one of the consuls
                    should be chosen by the plebeians in their centuries, the other by themselves,
                    as usual, in their curiae. This was a considerable advantage obtained by the
                    plebeians; and they requited it by gaining a victory over the enemy.</p>
                <p>For seven successive consulships the family of the Fabii had been elected, and
                    had headed the patrician party. At length they resolved to conciliate the
                    commons, and thereby incurred the hatred of their own order. Feeling them<pb

                    xml:id="kp-eb0719-0382-0372"/>selves thus distrusted, and incapable of serving
                    their country in council, they resolved to emigrate in a body, and establish
                    themselves on one of the outposts of the Roman territory, to be a defence
                    against aggression from that quarter. They settled on the Cremera, in Etruria;
                    but about two years afterwards the Veientians surprised them, put them all to
                    the sword, and destroyed their settlement. Three hundred of the Fabianhouse are
                    saidto have perishedby this disastrous event.</p>
                <p>In a short time afterwards new contests arose; the plebeians seized the Capitol;
                    and the patricians were obliged to yield to the passing of the Publilian law, by
                    which it was enacted, that the tribunes should thenceforth be chosen by the
                    votes of the commons in their tribes, and not by those of the whole people in
                    their centuries. They could now elect their tribunes freely; and they had
                    formerly obtained the right of discussing all national questions in their own
                    assembly. Had it been possible, when this great step was gained, for the two
                    parties to have laid aside their contention, and regarded each other as truly
                    brethren and fellow-citizens, instead of rivals, those rankling animosities
                    might have been altogether allayed, which terminated only in the destruction of
                    the republic, and the establishment of an imperial dominion, which was in fact a
                    military despotism, so frequently the consummation of civil dissensions and
                    revolutionary contests.</p>
                <p>The wars between the Romans and the Aequians and Vol-scians still continued
                    without any marked success on either side, internal feuds preventing Rome from
                    exerting her whole strength; nay, at times inducing the army to sufferitself to
                    be beaten, out of dislike to its patrician general. During these wars, some
                    eventsof a striking character are said tohave occurred, which seem to have
                    formed the subject of popular poems, and have in that form been admitted into
                    regular history. The story of Caius Marcius Coriolanus is the most brilliant of
                    these warlike legends. He is said to have contributed mainly by his great
                    personal valour to the capture of Corioli, and the defeat of a Volscian army
                    assembled for its aid, on the same day. For this gallant exploit he received the
                    name of Coriolanus. Soon afterwards, during a scarcity at Rome, he opposed the
                    distribution of a supply of provisions sent by the king of Sicily, unless the
                    plebeians would consent to forego the privileges they had so hardly won. For
                    this he was tried in the comitia tributa and banished. He immediately joined the
                    Volscians, and by his military skill and renown, at once defeated and appalled
                    the Romans, till having taken almost all their subject cities, he advanced at
                    the head of the Volscian army against Rome itself. In vain did embassies of his
                    former friends entreat him to spare his country; he remained inexorable.
                    Atlength a band of Roman ladies, headed by the mother and wife of Coriolanus,
                    proceeded to his tent, where the lofty remonstrances of his mother were more
                    powerful than all the arms of Rome. Coriolanus granted her request, at the same
                    time exclaiming, “O mother, thou hast saved Rome, but lost thy son.” Some
                    accounts state, that he was soon afterwards killed by the Volscians in a tumult;
                    others, that he lived to an advanced age among that people, often towards the
                    close of his life exclaiming, “How miserable is the state of an old man in
                    banishment!”</p>
                <p>Another well-known and spirit-stirring legend of the Volscians is that of the
                    dictator Cincinnatus. His son, Caeso Quinctius, had been banished on account of
                    his violent abuse of the tribunes during some of the numerous contests between
                    the patricians and the plebeians; and he had retired to his own patrimony, aloof
                    from popular tumults. The successes of the Aequi and Volsci atlength rendered
                    the appointment of a dictator necessary, especially for the rescue of the consul
                    and his army, who were surrounded by the enemy and blockaded in their camp. The
                    dictator laid aside his rural habiliments, assumed the ensigns of absolute
                    power, levied a new army, marched all night to bring to the consul</p>
                <p>Minucius the necessary succour, and before morning had surrounded the enemy’s
                    army, and reduced it to a condition exactly similar to that in which the Romans
                    had been. The baffled Aequi were glad to submit to the victor’s terms; and
                    returning in triumph to Rome, he laid down his dictatorial power, after having
                    held it only fourteen days.</p>
                <p>About the same time, Rome was engaged in a war which ultimately led to
                    consequences of the utmost importance. This was the war with Veii, at that time
                    the most powerful city of Etruria, and distant only about ten miles from Rome.
                    There had been peace between Rome and Etruria from the days of Porsenna; and the
                    Etruscans had even supplied Rome with grain in a time of great scarcity, and
                    when no other neighbouring state would grant any relief. A contest at length
                    arose, which led to a war of nine years’ duration, and a peace of forty years.
                    This peace was concluded in the year of Rome 280.</p>
                <p>The intestine feuds between the patricians and the plebeians still continued with
                    unabated animosity. Occasionally one of the consuls favoured the plebeians, and
                    proposed some mitigation of their suffering, or increase of their privileges,
                    but generally with little success. The Agrarian law, proposed by Spurius
                    Cassius, continued to be the main demand of the commons and their supporters;
                    but its passing was constantly either directly prevented or evaded. But at last
                    the commons became convinced that they need hope for no complete redress of
                    their grievances, until they should have previously secured the establishment of
                    some constitutional principle, from which equal justice would of necessity, and
                    from its very nature, flow. Accordingly Caius Terentilius Harsa, one of the
                    tribunes, proposed a law for a complete reform of the existing state of things.
                    Its purport was, that ten commissioners should be chosen, five by the
                    patricians, and five by the commons, to draw up a constitution, which should
                    define all points of constitutional, civil,and criminal law; and should thus
                    determine, on just and fixed principles, all the political, social, and civil
                    relations of all orders of the Roman people. The question of passing the
                    Terentilian law, was now the subject of contention in Rome; and the patricians
                    seem to have endeavoured to prevent it chiefly by interruptions to the
                    proceedings of the popular assemblies, caused by the violence of the young
                    patricians. In consequence of these interruptions, the commons carried the
                    Icilian law, by which a tribune was empowered to impeach before the commons in
                    their own assembly (the <hi rend="italic">comitia tributa),</hi> any patrician
                    who should interrupt him when discussing public measures, and might require him
                    to give security for his appearance, on the penalty of death and confiscation of
                    his goods, if he should refuse to give such security. This law gave to the
                    plebeian assembly jurisdiction over a patrician, and thus placed in their hands,
                    not only the means of defence, but of retribution or revenge. The banishment of
                    Caeso Quinctius, and perhaps also of Coriolanus, were the consequences of the
                    Terentilian law; but no dependence can be placed upon the dates given to these
                    perhaps legendary lays.</p>
                <p>Three commissioners were at length sent to Greece, to collect from the Greek
                    states, such notices of their laws and constitutions as might be serviceable to
                    the Romans. After the absence of a year they returned; andthecommons finding it
                    in vain to insist upon five of their own body forming part of the revisers of
                    the law, yielded the point, and ten of the most distinguished of the patrician
                    and senatorial body were chosen to form an entirely new and complete code of
                    laws, by which the state should be governed. They were named decemviri, and
                    during their office they were to supersede every other magistrate; and each in
                    his turn was to administer the government for a day, till they should complete
                    their legislative labours.</p>
                <p>After the careful deliberations of a few months, the result was laid before the
                    people, in the form of ten tables, fully <pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:wu.89119129625&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=383" xml:id="kp-eb0719-0383-0373"
                    />written out, and exhibited in a conspicuous place where all might read them.
                    Various amendments were proposed, and the ten tables again laid before the
                    senate, the curiae, and the centuries, and having received the sanction of both
                    orders of the state, were received and recognized as the very fountain of all
                    laws, public and private, to use the expression of Livy. Nothing but fragments
                    of these laws, afterwards known by the name of the Laws of the Twelve Tables,
                    have been preserved to us; and even of these fragments, we cannot refer to more
                    than those which relate to constitutional law, the origin and course of which we
                    have been attempting to state and trace. <note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>For an admirable view of these laws, see Arnold, vol. i. p.
                    253, </p></note></p>
                <p>Of these the most important which remain are the following. 1. That there should
                    be an appeal to the people from the sentence of every magistrate. 2. That all
                    capital trials should be conducted before the comitia centuriata. 3. That <hi
                    rend="italic"> privilegia,</hi> or acts of pains and penalties against an
                    individual, should be unlawful. 4. That the last decision of the people should
                    supersede all former decisions on the same subject. 5. That the debtor whose
                    person and property were pledged to his creditor, <hi rend="italic">nexus,</hi>
                    and he who remained the free master of both, <hi rend="italic">solutus,</hi>
                    should be equal in the sight of the law. 6. A sixth enactment, which
                    unfortunately left matter for a grievance, and for future contentions, ordained,
                    that there should be no legal marriages between the patricians and the
                    plebeians; and that, if a patrician married the daughter of a plebeian, his
                    children should follow the condition of their mother, should not be subject to
                    the paternal law like his legitimate children, and should not inherit his
                    property if he died intestate.</p>
                <p>By these laws the privileges and rights of the commons had, in certain points,
                    been greatly promoted, and in many others secured on the firm basis of national
                    laws. But not only were subjects of great importance left unsettled on any equal
                    foundation; these very laws, and the liberties of the entire community, were
                    destined to encounter another peril of a formidable nature. The decemvirs had
                    conducted matters so much to the satisfaction of the community, that when, at
                    the expiration of their year, they requested a renewal of their office, on the
                    ground that they had still two more tables to form, in order to complete their
                    task, they were permitted to resume their powers without opposition. Appius
                    Claudius, an old enemy of the commons, was one of the decemvirs, and was
                    retained among them on their re-appointment. The possession of uncontrolled,
                    irresponsible power, now began to display its usual consequences. The decemviri
                    seemed resolved to change the government of Rome into a complete oligarchy,
                    consisting of a council of ten, whose power should be absolutely supreme in
                    every thing. They arrogated the right of superseding all other magistracies; and
                    at the conclusion of their second year they shewed no intention of resigning
                    their offices, or of appointing their successors. Popular liberty seemed on the
                    point of being finally overthrown, just when its establishment on a secure basis
                    had been fondly anticipated.</p>
                <p>Matters had nearly arrived at a crisis when a war arose, the Sabines and Aequi
                    having united their forces, and being desirous to avail themselves of the
                    contentions by which Rome was weakened. The combined forces ravaged the left
                    bank of the Tiber, and the Aequi encamped on Algidus and pillaged the country
                    around Tusculum. The decemvirs assembled the senate, obtained their authority to
                    raise an army, at the head of which they placed three of their number, and sent
                    it against the Sabines. Another was raised and sent against the Aequi, while
                    Appius Claudius remained at Rome to provide for the safety of the city, and for
                    the maintenance of the power of the decemvirs. Both armies suffered themselves
                    to be defeated, and retired nearer to the city, dissatisfied rather than
                    discomfited.</p>
                <p>Meanwhile Appius chanced to see a beautiful maiden named Virginia, daughter of
                    Lucius Virginius, a centurion in the army sent against the Aequi. The maiden had
                    been betrothed to L. Icilius, one of the tribunes, and the author of the law
                    known by his name. Her beauty inflamed the passions of the licentious Appius,
                    and he caused one of his clients, M. Claudius, to seize her as his slave,
                    intending, in this manner, to get the person of the damsel within his power.
                    Intelligence was immediately sent to the camp to Virginius, who, obtaining leave
                    of absence, hastened to Rome to protect his daughter. But in vain did he claim
                    his daughter, in vain appeal to the sympathy of the people, in vain address
                    himself to the better mind of Appius. The decemvir, blind to every thing but the
                    beauty of Virginia, and deaf to all but the impulse of his own passion, passed
                    sentence assigning the maiden to Claudius. Upon this Virginius, snatching up a
                    butcher’s knife, exclaimed, “This is the only way left, my child, to keep thee
                    free and unstained !” and plunged it to her heart; then turning to Appius, he
                    cried, “On thee, and on thy head, be the curse of this innocent blood !” Appius
                    ordered him to be seized, but in vain. Waving aloft the bloody knife, he burst
                    through the multitude, flew to the gates, mounted a horse, and spurred headlong
                    to the camp near Tusculum.</p>
                <p>The wild and frantic aspect of Virginius, his attire stained with blood, and the
                    bloody knife still held convulsively in his grasp, instantly drew a crowd of the
                    soldiery around him. In brief but burning terms he told his tale, and called
                    aloud for vengeance. One thrilling sentiment of sympathetic indignation filled
                    every bosom; they called to arms, plucked up their standards, and marching to
                    Rome, seized on the Aventine. The army near Fidenae caught a similar spirit,
                    having received information of the bloody tragedy from Icilius. They likewise
                    threw off the authority of their commanders, chose military tribunes to lead
                    them, and hastening to Rome, joined their brethren on the Aventine Hill.</p>
                <p>In the city all was tumult and terror. The decemvirs were unable to make head
                    against the excited multitude, and the senate itself felt its power ineffectual
                    to allay the tempest. They began to treat with the people and the army, yet with
                    dilatoriness, hoping the ferment would abate, and they might still retain their
                    power. But the people were in earnest. Leaving a strong body to defend the
                    Aventine for the present, they marched in military array through the city, and
                    once more posted themselves on the sacred mount <hi rend="italic">(Morts
                    Sewer,)</hi> followed by vast numbers of the plebeian party, men, women, and
                    children. Then were the patricians compelled to yield, and the decemvirs
                    resigned. The plebeians obtained also the restoration of the tribuneship and of
                    the right of appeal, with a full indemnity for the authors of the sécession. The
                    commons then returned to Rome, and re-occupied the Aventine; but along with it
                    the Capitol also, as security that the terms of peace would be duly kept. The
                    decemvirate was finally abolished, and the consulship restored; with this
                    additional provision, that whereas formerly one had been appointed by the
                    patrician curiae, both were now chosen in the centuries.</p>
                <p>The new consuls were L. Valerius and M. Horatius, men who had shewn themselves to
                    be favourable to the people. They wisely endeavoured to unite the two orders of
                    the state on terms of perfect equality. A law proposed and passed by Valerius,
                    formally acknowledged the commons of Rome to be the Roman people; a plebiscitum,
                    or decree of the commons, was to be binding on the whole people; <hi
                    rend="italic">quod tri-butim pleDesjussisset,populum teneret.</hi><note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Livy, iii. 55. </p></note>
                    Such a popular decree, however, would not have passed into effect without the
                    sanction of the senate, and of the curiae; but it was a mighty stride in advance
                    towards the obtaining of a recognized and legal equality between the two great
                    orders of the state.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="ht:wu.89119129625&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=384"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0719-0384-0374"/>
                <p>Laws were also passed, rendering every magistracy open to individuals of either
                    order, the patricians to the tribunate as well as the commons to the consulship;
                    and there seemed to be now a complete union of all parties in the state, with
                    the exception of one point, the law prohibiting intermarriages between the
                    patricians and the commons.</p>
                <p>A re-action, however, took place, and the patricians had sufficient influence to
                    prevent the new constitution from coming into operation. No plebeian consul was
                    elected; and all the military tribunes, six in number, were chosen from
                    patrician houses. Another struggle took place; the tribune Canuleius proposed a
                    law to repeal the prohibition of intermarriages between the two orders; and
                    after a temporary secession to the Janiculum, this law was carried. Still the
                    plebeians were not content without the consulship being rendered accessible to
                    them; but this they were not yet able to obtain.</p>
                <p>A new patrician magistracy was next appointed, which acquired powers not probably
                    expected, or at first intended. This was the Censorship, the main duty of which
                    had at first been limited to taking the census of the people; but which, from
                    the office of superintending the public morals with which it was entrusted,
                    derived the power of reducing any dangerous citizen to insignificance, by
                    degrading him from his rank and order. The commons bad now acquired full
                    security for their persons and their property; and while ambitious individuals
                    would continue to be desirous of additional powers and privileges, the great
                    body of the community felt little interest in their personal intrigues, and the
                    state began to enjoy a period of comparative internal repose. The people had now
                    learned the secret of their own strength, and how to make it available. For not
                    long afterwards we find them aiding the senate when the consuis appeared
                    inclined to disobey its authority, thus asserting their supreme power, and also
                    refusing to permit the enrolment of soldiers for the Veientine war, unless the
                    question of war were first submitted to the comitia centuriata.</p>
                <p>The war with the Aequi and Volsci was again renewed, but was now waged by the
                    united force of the republic, and with corresponding success. Several victories
                    were gained and towns taken. Treaties were formed on favourable terms with the
                    Latins and the Hernici, and Rome again began to extend her boundaries as she had
                    done in the days of her kings. Her attention was now turned to the right bank of
                    the Tiber, the peace with Veii being near its termination.</p>
                <p>Between Rome and Veii a keen rivalship had long existed; and as the truce
                    approached its close, both nations prepared for a strife which both intended to
                    be final. The taking of Anxur from the Volsci, enabled the Romans to send the
                    greater part of their army against Veii. Several battles were fought, in which
                    the Romans were generally successful, and Veii itself was invested. For some
                    time it was rather a blockade than a siege; and when the Romans attempted a
                    complete circumvallation, the Veientians, aided by some of the neighbouring
                    states, stormed one of the Roman camps, and broke up the siege. Again was the
                    city invested by the Roman armies, and again were those armies so severely
                    worsted by the assistance of the Faliscans and Capenatians, that it was deemed
                    necessary to appoint thecelebrated Marcus Furius Camillus to the
                    dictatorship.</p>
                <p>Immediately upon his taking the command, the war began to assume a different
                    aspect. A close siege was formed, and pressed with vigour; all attempts from
                    without to raise it were defeated; all sallies from within repelled with great
                    loss. The poetical legends connected with the fall of Veii, mention several
                    prodigies that portended the approaching doom of the one or the other of the
                    belligerent nations. The supernatural swell of the Alban lake, and the formation
                    of a tunnel, by which its waters were drained off, and directed into the fields
                    of the circumjacent country, was one romantic episode of this poetic lay. The
                    stratagem by which the city was taken, a mine carried underneath the walls, and
                    opening into the precincts of the temple of Juno, by which the Roman soldiers
                    were enabled to burst from the earth in the very heart of the city, rush to the
                    gates, and open them for the admission of their countrymen, while the genera)
                    himself, issuing from the same subterranean passage, finished a sacrifice to
                    Juno, which the priest had declared to be the omen ofvictory, certainly bears
                    more the appearance ofpoetic fiction than of historic reality. Veii, the rival
                    of Rome, was taken, and the greater part of the districts, formerly subject to
                    the Veientians, added to the Roman dominions. Capena and Falerii followed its
                    fate, and the whole valley of the Tiber, on both banks, formed now the natural
                    extent of the territories acknowledging the sway of the seven-hilled city.</p>
                <p>More important to the future glory of Rome, than the territory gained by the
                    conquest of Veii, was the new principle in the organization of her armies to
                    which the siege of that city gave rise. In order to insure the destruction of
                    Veii, it was determined to surround it completely, and prevent it from receiving
                    any supplies of men or provisions, either by summer or winter. This rendered it
                    necessary that the beseiging army should continue its operations during winter,
                    which was a measure never previously adopted. But as the soldiers were, in
                    general, cultivators of land, and supported themselves by the produce of their
                    own industry, without pay from the state, it was necessary to give them pay if
                    their services were to be required permanently in the field. <note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Livy, iv. 59, CO. </p></note>
                    This could be done only by the patrician holders of public land paying fairly
                    their tithe into the public funds, besides bearing their due share of the public
                    taxes. To this they consented, in order to secure the overthrow of their rival.
                    Still the heaviest burden, and the greatest share of the danger fell on the
                    commons; and in order to procure their consent, the election of military
                    tribunes out of their order was at length sanctioned by law. Rome had now nearly
                    acquired that formidable character in which she soon afterwards appeared to
                    terrify and subdue the world; a military republic, where every citizen was, or
                    might bc, a soldier, and with a standing army inured to war and conquest.</p>
                <p>Camillus, the conqueror of Veii, and the most distinguished man of his time, was
                    accused of having secretly appropriated to his own use a portion of the plunder
                    of that city. Whether he had been really guilty of so mean an action, or whether
                    the accusation was prompted by envy of his glory, dislike of his haughtiness, or
                    dread of his power, cannot be determined; but seeing the probability that he
                    would not be acquitted, he went into voluntary exile to Ardea; and as he passed
                    through the gates he is said to have turned, and invoked the gods, that if he
                    were driven unjustly into exile, some grievous calamity might fall upon his
                    ungrateful countrymen, and force them to feel his want, and to be glad to recall
                    him to their rescue. Such a calamity was at hand, and ready to burst on the
                    devoted city.</p>
                <p>The Gauls had some time previously crossed the Alps, gained possession of the
                    plains of the Po, penetrated the passes of the Apennines, and were advancing
                    into central Italy. It is probable that the report of their approach was what
                    prevented a union of the Etruscan cities when Veii was besieged by Rome. The
                    Romans having accomplished their object, became also alarmed at the rumour of
                    the advance of this terrible foe, and sent some of their citizens into Etruria
                    to observe their movements, or at least obtain accurate intelligence. They
                    arrived at Clusium just as it was beset by the Gauls. The Roman deputies joined
                    the citizens in a sally, and one of them slew a Gaulish chief, and was
                    recognized as a Roman while he was stripping off the spoil. The Gauls sent to
                    Rome to demand the aggressors <pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:wu.89119129625&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=385" xml:id="kp-eb0719-0385-0375"
                    />to be given up to them, as there had been no war declared between the Romans
                    and the Gauls. The Romans refused to yield up their brave countrymen to torture
                    and death; and the Gauls, finding their demands rejected, broke up in haste from
                    Clusium, and marched away, shouting <hi rend="italic">“to</hi> Rome, to
                    Rome.”</p>
                <p>The Roman army had marched towards the Etrurian frontier, expecting to meet the
                    enemy at some distance from the city; but the Gauls had crossed the Tiber
                    considerably higher up, and were proceeding along its left bank towards Rome.
                    Upon receiving this intelligence, the consuls hastened back to the city, crossed
                    the river, and marched rapidly against the enemy. The Romans had scarcely time
                    to assume a hasty position on the banks of the Alia, where, through a deep bed,
                    that slight stream joins the Tiber. The Gauls at the very beginning of the
                    battle, turned the right flank of the enemy, drove it back in confusion on the
                    main body, and rushing impetuously in their victorious career, hurled the broken
                    mass headlong into the river. The rout was total, the slaughter great. Many were
                    drowned, and many more slain by the Gaulish javelins, while attempting to swim
                    across the river; those who succeeded fled to Veii, and there sought an ignoble
                    safety. Others fled to Rome, carrying the tidings of their utter discomfiture;
                    and thence continued their flight to Veii, despairing of being able to save
                    Rome. The Capitol alone was garrisoned by a devoted few, who were resolved to
                    defend this last bulwark of their country, or perish in its ruins.</p>
                <p>The city was left open and undefended, but it was on the third day after the
                    battle that the Gauls entered it. In the interval, the great body of the Roman
                    citizens had abandoned their homes, and fled for refuge to the neighbouring
                    cities, carrying the most sacred of their images and relics to Caere, and
                    leaving those which they could not remove deeply buried in a secret retreat. But
                    some of the priests, and the aged patricians of the highest rank and dignity,
                    could not endure the thought of quitting their native city, and dragging out the
                    remainder of their feeble days in a foreign land. They solemnly devoted
                    themselves and the Gauls to the infernal deities, and then seated themselves in
                    the forum to wait their death, by which they hoped to draw down on the Gauls the
                    vengeance of the gods. When the Gauls entered, all was silence in the forsaken
                    city, nor did they see a human being till they reached the forum. There they
                    beheld the majestic fathers of Rome, seated each on his ivory chair of office,
                    and clad in his senatorial robes, unmoving, silent, awful impersonations of
                    sublime despair. The Gauls gazed on them with reverential respect, regarding
                    them as more than mortal. At length one of the Gauls drew near to M. Papirius,
                    and began to stroke gently his long white beard. Papirius, a priest of the
                    highest rank and sanctity, indignant at the profane touch of the barbarian,
                    struck him on the head with his ivory sceptre. The Gaul cut down the venerable
                    man with his sword. The spell was broken; barbarian fury kindling at the sight
                    of blood, rushed on its defenceless prey, and in an instant the vows of the aged
                    senators were ratified in their blood.</p>
                <p>After pillaging the forsaken city, the Gauls turned their attention to the
                    Capitol; but being unable to scale the rock, were repulsed from the only access
                    with considerable loss. They now changed their plan, made the city their
                    head-quarters, continued the blockade of the Capitol, and spread devastation
                    into the surrounding country. Meanwhile the Romans who had taken shelter at
                    Veii, began to recover courage, and to seek to open a communication with the
                    brave garrison in the Capitol. This was accomplished by a daring youth named
                    Pontius Cominius, who swam across the Tiber and scaled the cliff during the
                    night, and having explained to the garrison the state of affairs at Veii,
                    returned as he came, undiscovered by the Gauls. But in the morning some traces
                    of his exploit were seen by the besiegers, who concluded that if the cliff had
                    been scaled by one, it might by more. They made the attempt, and the spot being
                    thought inaccessible, and therefore left unguarded by the garrison, they had
                    nearly reached the summit, when the sacred geese kept in the temple of Juno,
                    hearing the unwonted sound at such an hour, made so much noise as to awaken M.
                    Manlius, a young patrician, whose house was hard by the temple. He sprang up,
                    seized his arms, called on his sleeping comrades, and ran to the edge of the
                    cliff just as the head of a Gaul was appearing above it. Manlius rushed upon
                    him, dashed the boss of his shield into his face, and tumbled him down the
                    precipice. the falling Gaul bore down many of his countrymen along with him, and
                    the rest, perceiving themselves discovered, and struck with terror, leapt, fell,
                    or scrambled down the crags, and abandoned the attempt.</p>
                <p>But though the Capitol was thus secured against direct force or surprise, it
                    might be reduced by famine, and therefore the Gauls continued the siege. The
                    brave garrison were reduced to the utmost extremities, but still continued the
                    defence of their impregnable citadel, till the Gauls began to suffer scarcely
                    inferior calamities, arising likewise from the want of food, aggravated by the
                    unhealthiness of a Roman autumn. Great numbers daily perished; and the place
                    where their bodies were burned was long afterwards known by the name of <hi
                    rend="italic"> Gallica busta,</hi> or Gallic funeral piles. These calamities
                    induced the Gauls to offer more reasonable terms, which the exhausted garrison
                    was willing to accept. The demand was one thousand pounds of gold, on payment of
                    which the Gauls agreed to depart from the Roman city and territories. It is also
                    related that the Gauls had received intelligence of their own country being
                    inva&lt;led by the Venetians, which increased their willingness to come to terms
                    with Rome.</p>
                <p>A truce was concluded; both parties met in the forum; and the military tribune,
                    Q. Sulpicius, proceeded to weigh the stipulated sum. The Gauls fraudulently
                    attempted to falsify the weights; and when Sulpicius complained, Brennus, the
                    king of the Gauls, cast his heavy broadsword into the scale which contained the
                    weights. The tribune asked what was meant by this action; and the haughty
                    barbarian insultingly replied, “It means, woe to the vanquished.” Having
                    received this large ransom, the Gauls appear to have departed from central
                    Italy, and returned to their own.settle-ments on the regions in the valley of
                    the Po, leaving the Romans to set about repairing, as they might, their sacked
                    and desolated city.</p>
                <p>The accounts which represent Camillus to have entered the forum at the moment
                    when Brennus had uttered his insulting <hi rend="italic">Vae</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">victis,</hi> and to have ordered the gold to be taken away,
                    saying, it was the custom of Romans to ransom their country with steel, not
                    gold; to have driven the Gauls out of the city, and next day to have defeated
                    them so totally that not a man was left alive to carry the tidings of their
                    defeat to their countrymen; these accounts are manifestly parts of some poetical
                    lays in honour of Camillus, the hero of his age and country. But they are too
                    inconsistent with the more plain statements of other historians, and with the
                    well known facts of the case in other respects, to receive any other than a
                    poetic credence best suited to their poetic character. <note anchored="true"

                <p>But when the first feelings of exulting triumph abated, and the Romans began to
                    gaze around them on the scene of ruin and desolation, their hearts sunk within
                    them, and they were on the point of yielding to the wretched dictates of
                    cowardly despair. It had been previously proposed by the popular party, that a
                    large body of the Roman citizens <pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:wu.89119129625&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=386" xml:id="kp-eb0719-0386-0376"
                    />should at once migrate to Veii, and raise it to an equality with Rome in power
                    and privileges. This destructive proposal was at the time successfully resisted
                    by the more clear-sighted patricians; but now, when Rome was in ruins, the
                    people few and dispirited, and Veii in a flourishing condition, its buildings
                    better than even those of Rome had been, the proposal to quit the scene of
                    devastation, and remove to one of comfort, was renewed and listened to with
                    eagerness. It required all the authority of Camillus, enforced by that of the
                    senate, and strengthened by every kind of assistance and encouragement that
                    could be devised, to induce the Romans to remain, and undertake the heavy and
                    almost hopeless task of rebuilding the ruined city of their fathers.</p>
                <p>Livy informs us, that while the senate were sitting in grave and final
                    deliberation respecting the removal to Veii, or the rebuilding of Rome, the
                    people at the same time standing in clusters about the forum eagerly debating
                    the same subject, some cohorts, returning from relieving guards, chanced to pass
                    through the forum, when a centurion in the comitium called aloud,
                    “standard-bearer, plant your standard; here we shall best remain.” The
                    well-omened expression was seized upon by the senate, they rushed out,
                    exclaiming with one voice, that “they accepted the omen ;” the surrounding
                    commons applauded and re-echoed the cry; and all, with one voice and one mind,
                    agreed to abide by the will of the gods thus indicated, to raise from prostrate
                    ruin, and maintain the destinies of their everlasting city. There is little
                    doubt that Camillus planned this fortunate omen, and by his well-directed
                    efforts in this point, not less than in war, gained the glorious designation of
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">a new Romulus, father of his country, and second founder of
                    Rome.</hi> Hitherto we have been led to trace the growth of Rome from the
                    building of the thousand Romulean huts on the Palatine, till under the Etruscan
                    dynasty of its kings it had extended its power in all directions, entered into
                    treaties with transmarine nations, and raised at home structures of great
                    magnitude and imperishable durability. We have seen it sink into comparative
                    feebleness during the intestine wars by which it was tom immediately after the
                    expulsion of its tyrant monarch; yet even then have we also seen noble proofs of
                    that love of liberty, that strength of stern indomitable will, that
                    irrepressible perseverance, and that lofty confidence in their own destinies,
                    which conspired to render the proud citizens of Rome the conquerors of the
                    world. Of even more importance is it to trace the growth of constitutional law,
                    as it arose out of the struggles of one party which wished to engross and retain
                    all civic rights and privileges, and the growing wealth, intelligence, and power
                    of another, which gradually became more and more sensible of its rights, and
                    more and more determined to obtain them. Even the most careless observer of
                    these contests, and their fluctuations of success and disappointment, must have
                    marked, that whatever either party gained by unconstitutional violence, was
                    never to either a permanent gain; that any premature advance of popular liberty
                    was almost instantly followed by a recoil, proving, that not the soundness of a
                    principle, nor the truth and accuracy of a theory, but the substantial, the
                    felt, the practical necessity of the measure, is the only sure foundation of any
                    addition to, or change in, the institutions of a country; and that the natural
                    and spontaneous adjustment of existing rights and institutions, which takes
                    place wherever they are pervaded by the genial influence of a healthful
                    vitality, is productive of a far greater and more lasting amount of true
                    liberty, public and private, and of all that can promote real national welfare,
                    than could ever be obtained or secured by those impetuously philanthropic
                    legislators, who dream of creating a commonwealth in a day, as a magician would
                    produce a palace by the utterance of some all-powerful spell.</p>
                <p>To trace the growth of constitutional law as accurately as possible, we must
                    revert to the earliest period of Rome, and endeavour to extricate from their
                    fabulous en-velopements the historical truths contained in what are now admitted
                    to be poetic legends. By this process we may hope to obtain as rational and
                    intelligible a view of the city, the people, and the constitution of Rome, as
                    the preceding narrative is capable of affording. It has already been stated,
                    that the various inhabitants of that district of Italy, in which Rome was built,
                    were the Oscan, Pelasgian, and Etruscan. The Pelasgi appear to have settled
                    chiefly along the coast of Italy, from which they drove back the original
                    inhabitants, who were probably Oscans. In process of time the Oscans descended
                    again in great force from the mountains, overpowered the Pelasgians, and reduced
                    them to a species of servitude, allowing them however to remain as tillers of
                    the land, and artificers. From this intermixture arose the people subsequently
                    known by the name of Latins; combining the hardy and warlike habits of the Oscan
                    mountaineers with the superior skill and civilization of the Pelasgi. This view
                    may be regarded as confirmed by the fact, first pointed out by Niebuhr, that the
                    words which relate to agriculture and the comparatively refined arts of life, in
                    the Latin language, are closely allied to the same words in Greek, indicating
                    the Pelasgian origin of both; while the Latin words pertaining to war and the
                    chase are entirely alien from the Greek, and are in short of Oscan origin. <note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Niebuhr, vol. i. p, 83.
                    </p></note> From this it may be inferred, that during the formation of the Latin
                    language, the nation was composed of two races, the Oscan and the Pelasgian, of
                    whom the Oscan held the chief sway. The two races being both accustomed to the
                    simple patriarchal, or family form of rule, would have a natural tendency to
                    blend together so as speedily to become one people. This seems to have been the
                    condition in which they were, during the period when Rome is said to have been
                    built.</p>
                <p>Whether the traditionary founder of Rome was of Oscan or Pelasgian race, cannot
                    be ascertained. The greater part of his followers appear to have been Pelasgian;
                    and from them the settlement may have obtained its name, which was afterwards
                    given to the legendary hero himself. One of the traditionary accounts of
                    Romulus, represents him as having been sent in his youth to an Etruscan city,
                    for the purpose of receiving instruction superior to what could be obtained in
                    Latium. Were we receiving the narrative as that respecting a real person, we
                    should ascribe to his Etrurian education the attention paid by Romulus to
                    augury, and the other arts of divination, in which the Etruscans are known to
                    have excelled. The tradition may however refer to some influential Etruscan
                    leader, who may have joined the early founders of Rome, and contributed greatly
                    to mould their religious institutions. This view is supported by the statement
                    of some authors, that an Etruscan chief, named Lucumo, was an early ally of
                    Romulus, and aided him in the Sabine war, in which he was killed. The term
                    Lucumo, we know, was not a personal name, but one of rank and office common to
                    the Etruscan chiefs, who were all Lucumones. This Lucumo may have been the
                    Tuscan chief Caeles Vibenna, who is said to have settled on the Caelian hill, to
                    which he gave his name. <note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>Ibid. pp. 382, 383. </p></note> If this be admitted, and we suppose the
                    followers of this Etruscan Lucumo removed to Rome by the Roman founder, after
                    the fall of their own chief, we have a very probable account of the origin of
                    the third tribe of the Roman people, the Luceres, who, though admitted as an
                    original tribe, were in some respects subordinate to the other two, the
                    Ramnenses and Titienses, or Romans and Sabines. The Luceres may have been 01 a
                    more mixed race than the other two tribes, and on that account somewhat less
                    esteemed. It is indeed by no means improbable that the first inhabitants of Rome
                    were compos <pb break="no" facs="ht:wu.89119129625&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=387"

                    the Oscans and Pelasgians were the most numerous.</p>
                <p>With regard to the Etruscans, we are of opinion that for a very peculiar reason,
                    they could not have formed any considerable proportion of the inhabitants of
                    Rome. We are inclined to hazard the conjecture, that the name Etruscan, as
                    commonly used, is extremely deceptive, and leads almost invariably to error. The
                    true name of the peculiar people generally called Etrusci, was, according to
                    themselves, Rasena. It is constantly asserted that their language is totally
                    unknown; and yet they are said to have occupied a very large portion of Italy,
                    and to have been in constant and intimate intercourse with the nations
                    inhabiting its other divisions. It is scarcely credible that not one word of
                    confessedly a highly civilized people should have entered into the language of
                    those nations with whom they held intercourse. But, if the body of the people
                    called Etrusci were of Oscan, Umbrian, or even of Celtic origin, while the
                    Ra-sena were merely a race of skilful and intelligent foreigners, who had, by
                    force or policy, acquired the station of a ruling and a sacerdotal caste, their
                    peculiar language might never be communicated to the body of the people whom
                    they ruled, and so might perish when their power was broken and their caste
                    destroyed. <note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Niebuhr,
                    vol. i. p. 122. </p></note> The possibility that the Rasena were indeed a
                    sacerdotal caste, similar to those of Egypt, India, and other oriental nations,
                    perhaps also of the Celtic race, will scarcely be questioned by those who are
                    acquainted with the history of the Brahmins and the Druids. <note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>If this view could be
                    substantiated, it would explain many of the most difficult questions that arise
                    respecting the Etruscans. It would at once account for the want of a community
                    of interest between the Etruscan chiefs and the body of the people, which
                    prevented the growth of any regularly consolidated power among them, caused
                    those sudden transitions from strength to weakness, and led ultimately to the
                    disappearing of the ruling caste, and the complete blending of the real people
                    with the other Italian nations. For when the Rasena ceased to rule, having
                    little, if any thing, in common with the body of their subjects, not even their
                    language, they speedily ceased to have a separate existence; and the people, who
                    were correctly designated Tyrrbeni, or Tursceni, and were of Pelasgic origin,
                    very soon blended with their more kindred races, as, indeed, the Luceres had
                    done with the primitive Romans at an earlier period. </p></note></p>
                <p>Reverting to what has already been stated respecting the patriarchal form of rule
                    common to the Oscan and Pelasgian races, we are furnished with an explanation of
                    the central principle of all the Roman institutions. The form of government
                    resulting from such a principle was necessarily monarchical, but could not be
                    despotic. For, while the king ruled supremely over the nation at large, every
                    head of a family ruled over his own household with uncontrolled sway, at once as
                    its king and its priest. <note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    in order to obtain the advantages of union, the families, houses, or gentes,
                    formed themselves into bodies of <hi rend="italic">ten</hi> each, called <hi
                    rend="italic">curiae.</hi> Over each curia, one head of a House, or <hi

                    rend="italic">curio.</hi> The union often curiae formed a tribe. The union of
                    the three tribes, the Ramnenses, or Romans strictly speaking and with reference
                    to the inhabitants of the Palatine hill, the Titienses, or subjects of Titius,
                    who were Sabines, and inhabited the Quirinal and Capitoline hills, and the
                    Luceres, who were probably the original followers of the Etruscan Lucumo who
                    aided Romulus, and settled at first on the Caelian hill, augmented by
                    adventurers from neighbouring states, formed the Populus Romanus in the strict
                    sense of that term. Thus the patriarchal principle pervaded the entire body
                    politic, and gave to it all that was peculiar in its aspect and
                    institutions.</p>
                <p>We must not, however, omit to mention, that within this external and public form
                    of the body politic there was included another of a more private and personal
                    character. As a state, tribes, curiae, and houses were alone visible; but in
                    each house there were necessarily members and dependents. The <hi rend="italic">
                    members</hi> connected by blood with the head of the house, or gens, were <hi
                    rend="italic">Gentiles,</hi> or as we might term them, <hi rend="italic">
                    kinsmen,</hi> and formed the free citizens of Rome: the <hi rend="italic">
                    dependants,</hi> who were not all, nor necessarily, blood relations, were called
                    <hi rend="italic">clientes,</hi> and might, with some modifications, be
                    designated <hi rend="italic">clansmen,</hi> belonging to the clan, but beneath
                    the rank of the <hi rend="italic">duinne-wassal,</hi> or gentlemen directly
                    related to the chief. From this arose that more private οι domestic division of
                    the people into <hi rend="italic">patroni</hi> and <hi rend="italic">
                    clientes.</hi> The patrons alone were recognised as citizens by the state, in
                    their various aspects, as heads of houses, members of the curiae, and of the
                    tribes; and by them, and for them, were all laws made, with all which the
                    clients had no connexion. The relationship in which the clients could alone be
                    viewed was entirely of a private nature, subsisting exclusively between them and
                    their patrons. The power of the patrons over the clients, on the other hand,
                    would have been altogether despotic, but for the patriarchal element from which
                    it sprung, and by which it was tempered. The client was regarded by the patron
                    as to a certain extent a member of his family, owing to him indeed the most
                    implicit obedience, but having the strongest claims upon him for protection, and
                    even for some measure of paternal regard. The patron was bound to relieve the
                    distress of his clients, to appear for them in court, to expound to them the
                    law, civil and pontifical, and to allot them portions of land to cultivate and
                    build upon, which, however, they held only as tenants at will. The clients on
                    their part were bound to be obedient to their patron, to promote his honour, to
                    pay whatsoever public fines might be imposed on him, to aid him jointly with the
                    real members of his house, in bearing the public burdens of taxes, to contribute
                    to the portioning of his daughters, and to ransom him or any member of his
                    family who might fall into the hands of an enemy. If the client died without
                    heirs, the patron succeeded to his property; and if the patron failed in
                    discharging his duty to his clients, he was accounted infamous and accursed.</p>
                <p>But the union of the three Tribes belongs to a subsequent period of the history.
                    Although it seems sufficiently probable that the rudiments of the tribe called
                    the Luceres, existed in the time of the founder of Rome, yet that tribe was not
                    raised to a full equality with the other two till a later period. During the
                    reigns of the first two kings of Rome, the nation presents a strictly twofold
                    aspect, consisting of the two chief tribes, the Ramnenses and the Titienses. In
                    each tribe the arrangements were precisely similar, ten houses constituting a
                    curia, and ten curiae a tribe, of which the heads of houses formed the senate,
                    and the heads of the curiae formed the chief senators. The great national
                    council consisted thus of 200 senators, half Romans and half Sabines, or, laying
                    aside the national designations, and retaining those of the tribes alone, half
                    Ramnenses and half Titienses. The senate thus being wholly composed
                    ofheadsofhouses, its members were rightly named patres, and their order the
                    patrician; but this patrician order comprehended at first the entire people, in
                    consequence of the family-relationship, which, in fact or semblance, pervaded
                    the whole community. Every head of a house was the judge and ruler of his house,
                    both members and clients; the curia of ten houses governed the affairs of their
                    collective body; and the senate of ten curiae deliberated upon the affairs of
                    the nation. In those early days, the assemblies of the people were merely
                    assemblies of the patrician houses, who alone possessed the rights of full
                    citizenship; and these assemblies were held in the valley between the Palatine
                    and Capitoline bills, termed the Forum <pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:wu.89119129625&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=388" xml:id="kp-eb0719-0388-0378"
                    />Romanum, and said to have been the place where the comitia curiata were held
                    from the time of Romulus.</p>
                <p>At this time the body, afterwards known by the name of the plebs, or plebeians,
                    had no existence, the entire population being composed of patrician houses, with
                    their members and dependents, in other words, of patrons and clients, the
                    patrons alone being full citizens, and known as the people. In a very short time
                    a population of a different character began to appear, composed of strangers who
                    came to settle in the country, and the inhabitants of conquered states brought
                    forcibly to Rome, and obliged to unite to a certain extent with their
                    conquerors. This population had, of course, no connexion with the houses, but
                    only with the state politically. They could not become <hi rend="italic"
                    >members</hi> of the houses; they were not <hi rend="italic">dependents</hi> on
                    them; and thus they came to form a body of an entirely new character, springing
                    up in the midst of the privileged citizens. They were not permitted to
                    intermarry with the houses, who were very tenacious of purity of blood; and thus
                    they belonged to no house, no curia, and no tribe, consequently they had no
                    share in the public government nor in the public property. Their own property in
                    their native country might have been diminished, or altogether lost in that war
                    by which they had been subdued, in consequence of the law by which a third part
                    of a conquered nation’s lands was seized by the conquerors; yet what the state
                    might subsequently seize in war, even by their aid, did not become theirs,
                    because they formed no integral part of the state as such, being <hi
                    rend="italic"> in</hi> the state, but not q∕ <hi rend="superscript">,</hi> it∙
                    Such an inferior population, of a character, and occupying a position so
                    anomalous, not slaves, yet not citizens, was the element from which arose the
                    original plebs or commons of Rome. <note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>It may be added, though here we are anticipating the regular
                    course of events, that the great proportion of the Roman commons were conquered
                    Latins. Besides receiving grants of a portion of their former lands, to be held
                    by them as tenants at the will of the state, they had also the Aventine hill
                    assigned to such of them as removed to Rome. The Aventine was not included
                    within the walls of the original city, so that these half-citizens became the
                    suburban neighbours of Rome rather than its inhabitants, enjoying its
                    protection, sharing heavily in its burdens, exposed to a full proportion of all
                    its dangers, but excluded from all its political rights and privileges. From
                    such a condition no wonder that future contentions arose. </p></note></p>
                <p>The only events recorded in the legend of Tullus Hostilius, to which any degree
                    of credit can be attached, are those which refer to the Alban war and its
                    consequences. It seems to be a fact, that at some indefinitely early period in
                    the history of Rome, the honour of being head of the great confederacy of the
                    thirty towns of Latium, which had Belonged to Alba, was transferred to the
                    former city. This has been ascribed to the reign of Tullus; and as no period to
                    which it may with greater certainty be referred, can be pointed out, it may be
                    regarded as an historical truth, accounted for in no unnatural manner by a
                    national legend. The combat of the Horatii and the Curiatii appears to be
                    chiefly a poetical episode, and one of a very high and spirit-stirring
                    character, but may have had some foundation in fact. The death of Tullus is also
                    legendary and imaginative. It seems to have been partly at least an Alban lay,
                    from its indications of divine wrath falling upon Tullus on account of the
                    desolate temples and deserted gods of the Alban mount. But the most important
                    part of the narrative is that which records the reception into the state of the
                    third tribe, the Luceres. In the legend, this is said to have taken place in
                    consequence of the union of the Albans with the Roman people. There may be a
                    considerable portion of truth in this statement, and it is perfectly consistent
                    with the known facts of the case, as far as they bear upon the subject. The
                    Luceres were held to be to a certain degree inferior to the other tribes, as was
                    not unlikely to be the case with the descendants of a conquered people. All the
                    patrician houses that traced their genealogy to the Albans belonged to the
                    Luceres, such as the Julii, Quinctii, Servilii, Caelii, and several others of
                    the most distinguished Roman houses. The explanation of the name</p>
                <p>Luceres cannot be clearly given. Some derive it from the Lucumo who is said to
                    have settled on the Caelian hill, and to have given it his name. If he founded a
                    small city for his followers, and give it his official name, as he gave the hill
                    his personal, the name of the town might be Lucerum; and when the Albans were
                    located on that hill, and in that town, and raised to the condition of a tribe,
                    they might be called Luceres from their new abode, and in order to sink the
                    remembrance of Alba.</p>
                <p>The most important event recorded in the period assigned to the reign of Ancus
                    was the removal of roe conquered Latins to Rome, and the apportioning to them of
                    a settled residence on the Aventine hill. <note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>See Niebuhr, vol. i p. 355. </p></note> This may be regarded
                    as the origin of the Roman plebs, or commons, as distinguished from the
                    patrician body, who were the true and original Populus Romanus. It cannot be too
                    distinctly stated, nor too clearly and strongly remembered, that among the early
                    Romans, the populus and the plebs were wholly and in every respect different.
                    The populus was originally the whole body of the early inhabitants of Rome, both
                    those of Romulian and those of Sabine origin. This body, consisting of senators
                    or patres, curiae, and houses, with their members and dependants, was completely
                    aristocratic in its aspect, and tolerated no degrading intermixtures. The plebs
                    were originally the conquered Latins, who were in a measure incorporated into
                    the mass of the nation, by being removed to the Roman territories, placed on the
                    Aventine hill, and permitted to farm the land of the state, which latter
                    arrangement is said to have been made by Ancus. They retained their personal
                    freedom, but could neither become members of houses, nor in general would submit
                    to be dependants. They grew up, therefore, along with the populus, a free, but
                    unprivileged, and too often an oppressed population; and though both despised,
                    feared, and hated by the exclusive patrician populus, rapidly growing what they
                    ultimately became, the real strength of Rome. Had it not been for the
                    patriarchal principle pervading Rome, which caused the ties of kindred to be the
                    only legitimate method of obtaining the full privileges of a citizen, these near
                    residents might have been admitted at once, and all the subsequent fierce
                    domestic broils might not have taken place; but without these contests the
                    nation might never have been knit into such compact strength, nor have been led
                    to the formation of such a body of wise and well-digested laws.</p>
                <p>In the constitution of the Roman state, Tarquinius made at least one alteration
                    concerning the true nature of which, authors are by no means agreed. Some say
                    that he added an hundred members to the ancient senate, which till then had
                    amounted to no more than two hundred. These new senators were called fathers of
                    the lesser houses, <hi rend="italic">(patres minorum gentium;)</hi> and the old
                    senators fathers of the greater houses, <hi rend="italic">(patres mnjorum
                    gentium.)</hi> If this account were entitled to implicit credit, we should
                    regard it as referring to the admission of the Luceres into the full enjoyment
                    of the rights and honours of citizenship. Yet this seems to have taken place
                    during the reign of Hostilius, when he brought the conquered Albans to Rome.
                    Perhaps a portion of each statement may be true. The Albans and Latins may have
                    been settled on the Caelian hill, and formed into a tribe by Tullus; but not
                    raised to the senate till the accession of Tarquinius, who may have thought such
                    a step necessary in order to secure the support of a large body of the state,
                    his claims to the throne being so very question<pb break="no"

                    ><p>Niebuhr, vol. i. pp. 376, 377. </p></note> hazards another very ingenious
                    conjecture. He thinks that Tarquinius may have been himself one of the tribe of
                    the Luceres, that Priscus may have been a name belonging to him, as one of a
                    Priscan gens, or house, ana that the legend of his Etruscan conquests and
                    acknowledged sovereignity may have some connexion with the much more ancient
                    tradition of the fabulous Tuscan hero, Tarchon, to which the name Tarquinius
                    itself may allude. It is sufficiently evident, that there did exist at some
                    remote period, an intimate intercourse between Rome and the Etrusci; and there
                    appears to have been some connexion between this Etruscan influence and the
                    tribe of the Luceres. What the exact nature and extent of this Etruscan
                    intercourse and influence were, it seems a hopeless task to inquire, and it
                    would be fruitless to indulge in framing conjectures.</p>
                <p>It is stated, that Tarquinius wished to add to the centuries of the Equites,
                    established by Romulus, three new centuries, and to call them by his own name,
                    and the names of his friends. In this intention he was opposed by the augur
                    Attus Navius, who affirmed that what had been instituted with augury, could not
                    be changed without it, and that the omens forbade any change. The king, in order
                    to cast discredit on the art of the augur, asked him to divine whether what he
                    was then thinking of could be done. The augur observed the omens, and answered
                    that it could. “I was thinking,” said the king, “whether you could cut this
                    whetstone in two with a knife.” Navius instantly took the whetstone, and cut it
                    sheer asunder, to the amazement of the king. This proof of the augur’s skill
                    caused Tarquinius to desist from his intention to its full extent; and he
                    .merely added to each of the former centuries a second or latter century under
                    the same name. In this legend may be contained an account of the opposition
                    which Tarquinius experienced from the patrician body, when he purposed to raise
                    a number of the most distinguished of the free citizens to the equestrian
                    rank,—an opposition to which he was so far obliged to yield. <note

                    characteristic, while the numerical divisions of the government by tens were
                    arbitrary, so far as can be traced. Every head of a house was an integral member
                    of the state, as a free citizen; but there is no very manifest reason why houses
                    should have been aggregated into <hi rend="italic">tens,</hi> or curiae, these
                    into other <hi rend="italic">tens</hi> forming the senate, or patres, of one
                    hundred. But this division or rather aggregation having been adopted, it
                    influenced all the arrangements of the body politic, both in peace and war.
                    While there was but one people, the followers of Romulus, there was but one
                    tribe, the Ramnenses, or, as some term it, the Ramnes, and the senate amounted
                    to one hundred. Upon the junction of the Sabines, there were two tribes, the
                    Titienses or Tities being added, and consequently the senate then numbered two
                    hundred. The elevation of the third tribe, the Luceres, completed the number of
                    curiae, decuriae, tribes, and senators, till thirty and three hundred became the
                    ruling numbers in this division.</p>
                <p>It is worth remarking, that, according to the statement of ancient authors, when
                    Romulus formed the Pomoerium, including all that composed ancient Rome, his city
                    merely contained one thousand wretched huts, clustered together on the Palatine
                    hill. Now, if it could be shewn that the union of ten families formed a house,
                    ten houses a curia, and ten curiae the entire tribe, we should have the exact
                    number of the first huts erected on the Palatine, and of the primitive mansions
                    of the Roman fathers.</p>
                <p>The army followed in its construction the numerical arrangement of the people.
                    The earliest Roman legion could contain no more than the male inhabitants of
                    Rome, which would be at that time only a thousand capable of bearing arms. As
                    the senate was formed from the hundred chief men of the curiae, so there were an
                    hundred of the braves selected from the curiae to fight on horseback. Thus the
                    equites, or knights, were at first equal in number with tin senate, and equal in
                    rank, as members of the curiae, though not senators, because not the heads of
                    the curiae. Whel the senate was increased to three hundred, by the addition of
                    the other two tribes, there were also three centuriesorhundreds of knights,
                    retaining the proportion. The legion would then consist of 3000 infantry, and
                    300 cavalry; and though in later periods the numbers of the infantry were
                    increased, 300 continued to be the legitimate number of cavalry in a legion.
                    Although the name remained, the numbers fluctuated according to the dictates of
                    policy or necessity, so that when we read of a century, we are not to assume
                    that an hundred is meant, and neither more nor less.</p>
                <p>Adopting recognised terms and divisions, Servius, in his endeavours to improve
                    the constitution of Rome, divided the large body of unprivileged yet free
                    citizens, the plebs, or true commons, into thirty tribes, according to the
                    thirty curiae of the senatorial patricians. Of these thirty tribes four were
                    contained in the city itself, and the remaining twenty-six in the lands that had
                    been added to the dominions of Rome by conquest. Each tribe was under the
                    dominion of a magistrate of their own body, called a Tribunus. There were also
                    judges appointed, three for each tribe, to determine private causes among the
                    plebeian citizens. For the appointment of these official persons, and other
                    matters connected with their own interests, the plebeians were empowered to hold
                    their own meetings, called the comitia tributa. These were held on the <hi
                    rend="italic"> nundinoe,</hi> or market days, when the country people came to
                    Rome, and in the forum or market-place adjacent to the comitium, or meeting
                    place of the patricians, but quite distinct from it. These comitia tributa were
                    entirely plebeian, and at first referred only to the decision of disputes
                    respecting private rights among the plebeians themselves. They were not convoked
                    by the patricians, nor held under patrician auspices. They had nothing to do
                    with national affairs as such, but were confined entirely to the private
                    business of tile plebeian order. Neither had the patricians at first any thing
                    to do with this plebeian assembly: they formed no part of it, and had no
                    authority over it. Yet, though thus distinct from the state in its original
                    formation, it gave an organized form to the plebeian body, which soon proved its
                    importance, as the very thews and sinews of the body politic, and therefore
                    essential to its growth and strength.</p>
                <p>The institution of the comitia tributa, though at first of an entirely private
                    character with reference to the state, tended to the formation of a new
                    assembly, in which all the orders of the people were included, and arranged for
                    the discussion of public affairs. It was not possible that the plebeian body
                    could be so far organized as to have its own, magistracy, elected by itself in
                    an assembly of its own, without producing an early necessity for its admission
                    into the state; for organization both gives power, and the consciousness of
                    power, in the body politic. The most natural occasion and mode of its admission,
                    had a military origin and character, like most of the other Roman institutions.
                    Though the patricians and plebeians remained completely distinct in their civic
                    character, and in the time of peace, yet in the time of war they acted together
                    in one great body, the army. The arrangements of the army were therefore those
                    which led to their junction in another aspect, and were in <pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:wu.89119129625&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=390" xml:id="kp-eb0719-0390-0380"
                    />that new aspect retained as much as possible. As the earliest principle of the
                    structure of the Roman army was its division into centuries, so the same
                    principle gave rise to an assembly of a new character, called the comitia
                    centuriata, where the military principle predominated, and in which the whole
                    population met. So much of a military character did this assembly at its origin
                    bear, that it was not permitted to meet within the city, but in the Campus
                    Martius, and it even bore the name of <hi rend="italic">exercitus
                    urbanus.</hi></p>
                <p>Tarquinius is stated to have added, not three new centuries bearing new names, to
                    the equestrians, for that was prevented by the augur Navius, but three new
                    centuries, forming a second series, and retaining the designation of the first
                    three. These three double centuries of the Ramnenses, Titienses, and Luceres,
                    were now recognised as distinctly six privileged bodies of voters, <hi
                    rend="italic"> sex suffragia,</hi> of the new assembly. To these, which
                    contained all the members of the houses, there were added by Servius twelve new
                    centuries of knights,formed from the richest members of the plebeian community,
                    and continuing, like the centuries below them, to belong to the thirty tribes of
                    the commons. There were thus eighteen centuries of the most noble and wealthy
                    persons in the state, who enjoyed the privilege of serving in the army on
                    horseback; known in their military character as the equites, and in their civil
                    character as the equestrians, or, as we term them, the knights. Their
                    distinction as an order was however posterior to their formation as the eighteen
                    equestrian centuries in the comitia centuriata.</p>
                <p>Proceeding on the military principle, the next point was to organise the foot
                    soldiers of the state. This was done chiefly with reference to the value of the
                    armour which individuals could afford to procure and wear in battle, because in
                    the earliest ages of all nations, men armed themselves as they best could, at
                    their own expense, not that of the state, and consequently the richest were the
                    best armed. As brass was the metal of which weapons of war, either offensive or
                    defensive, were first formed, brass or copper, so many pounds weight, according
                    to an estimate of the weight and value of the armour, formed the principle by
                    which the successive classes were divided and arranged. Of these the first class
                    contained all whose property amounted to, or exceeded, one hundred thousand
                    pounds weight of copper. The soldiers of this class were required to be
                    completely armed with greaves, coat of mail, helmet and shield of brass, besides
                    the sword and the long pike. And as these were necessarily to advance in the
                    front, and bear the shock of battle, and formed the flower of the troops, so
                    their influence in the great military assembly was proportionate. They formed
                    eighty centuries; forty between the ages of fifteen and forty-five, to serve in
                    the field; and forty between forty-five and sixty, for the defence of the city.
                    To this, the first class, the eighteen centuries of knights were added, so that
                    it amounted in all to ninety-eight centuries. The second class contained those
                    whose property fell beneath 100,000 asses, or pounds of copper, and above
                    75,000. These formed twenty centuries, and were less completely and expensively
                    armed. The third class contained also twenty centuries, and its qualification
                    was properly between 75,000 and 50,000 asses, or pounds of copper. Its armour
                    was inferior to that of the preceding class. The fourth class contained those
                    whose property was not beneath 25,000 asses; it amounted to twenty centuries,
                    and its soldiers were not required to provide more than a pike and a javelin.
                    These four classes composed the main body or phalanx of the army, when it was
                    drawn up in that order of battle previous to the formation of the legion. The
                    fifth class consisted of those whose property was between 25,000 asses, and
                    12,500; it formed the slingers and archers, or light infantry of the army, and
                    was divided into thirty centuries.</p>
                <p>The poorest citizens, whose property fell short of 12,500 asses, were regarded as
                    supernumeraries in this division. Those who had above 1500 asses were still
                    regarded as taxpayers, <hi rend="italic">assidui,</hi> and were formed into two
                    centuries, called the <hi rend="italic">accensi</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >velati.</hi> They merely followed the army, and were only required to supply
                    the places of those who fell. Below these came one century of the <hi
                    rend="italic">proletarii,</hi> whose property was between 1500 and 375 asses.
                    These paid no taxes, had no military duty, and were only liable to be called on
                    in great emergencies, as extraordinary levies, when arms were furnished to them
                    at the public expense. One century more included all whose property, being less
                    than 375 asses, was not worthy of being estimated, and who were called <hi
                    rend="italic">capite censi,</hi> and not liable to military service.</p>
                <p>Three centuries of a different character completed the division, but these were
                    not rated by their property, but by their occupation. These were,—one century of
                    carpenters and smiths attached to the first class, and two of homblow-ers, <hi
                    rend="italic"> (cornicines),</hi> and trumpeters, <hi rend="italic"
                    >(tubicines),</hi> attached to the fourth class.</p>
                <p>From this brief outline of the comitia centuriata, the new national constitution
                    given to Rome by Servius Tullius, it will be seen that it was a proof of very
                    remarkable political wisdom in that legislator. The new citizens of Rome had
                    been rapidly increasing in numbers and importance. A new tribe, the Luceres, had
                    recently been raised to the possession of full political power. Three new
                    equestrian centuries had been called into existence, though still in a
                    subordinate position; and the body of the commons, the plebeian body, augmented
                    by the arrival of free citizens from recently conquered Latin states, was
                    gradually rising in importance, so as to point to the necessity of its obtaining
                    a recognised position in the state; and at the same time to give to the
                    hereditary patrician body no slight cause of alarm, lest it should soon become
                    the most powerful body at Rome. By the Servian constitution, if we may so term
                    it, the danger of any such revolution was averted by the admission of the plebs
                    into a national council, without disturbing the proportions of influence due to
                    the different bodies of which such a council was to be formed. The wealthiest
                    men of the plebs would naturally be desirous of obtaining some share of that
                    patrician dignity which they had enjoyed as Latins, before the annexation of
                    their native states to Rome; and this desire was met by the creation of twelve
                    centuries of knights, added to the equestrian order from amongst the plebeian
                    tribes. These twelve centuries constituted a <hi rend="italic">nobility,</hi>
                    but yet were so connected with the eighty centuries which formed the great body
                    of the first class, that they could not degenerate into an oligarchy. The first
                    class, again, being formed of the wealthiest persons in the state, though far
                    the least numerous, prevented the government from becoming a democracy of that
                    ultra kind, in which numbers form the <hi rend="italic">ruling element.</hi> In
                    truth, property formed the <hi rend="italic">mling element</hi> in the Servian
                    constitution; for the first class, containing ninety-eight centuries, even,
                    without the addition of the <hi rend="italic">fahri,</hi> formed the majority of
                    the comitia centuriata, so that if all the centuries of that class were agreed
                    on any point, it was carried without the votes of the other classes. The mere
                    numbers of the lower classes very greatly exceeded those of the first class; but
                    as property was assumed as the principle by which a century was to be formed, it
                    required a great number of individuals to form a century of the requisite
                    wealth. The proportion seems to have been regulated thus: the votes allotted to
                    each class bore the same proportion to the collective sum of votes, as the
                    taxable property of its members bore to the total taxable property of all the
                    five classes; while the number of the citizens contained in each, stood in an
                    inverse ratio to the numbers which designated their property. Although,
                    therefore, the plebeians were now admitted into the full rights of citizenship,
                    and to a voice in the government, still the power of deciding was vested in
                    those who possessed the chief rank, wealth, and that natu<pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:wu.89119129625&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=391" xml:id="kp-eb0719-0391-0381"
                    />ral influence which those who occupy a superior station always enjoy.</p>
                <p>Perhaps the only fault of this new constitution was its premature establishment.
                    It was in advance of the period to which it is always referred. The necessity of
                    conferring the franchise upon the plebeians had not been sufficiently felt,
                    consequently the patrician order, the ancient Roman populus, could not endure
                    the admission of a new and recently conquered people to any thing even
                    approaching an equality. Hence their enmity against Servius, and their
                    concurrence in the ambition of Tarquinius, afterwards surnamed Super-bus. On
                    their part, it was a plot to overturn the new constitution, and deprive the
                    plebeians of the rights and privileges conferred upon them by that wise and
                    patriotic monarch. The introduction of the plebeians may perhaps have been too
                    early even for their own good, as they had been too recently united to Rome to
                    have thoroughly acquired the true Roman spirit; and they needed to purchase
                    their privileges more dearly, by a lengthened and fluctuating struggle, in order
                    that they might sufficiently prize them. For men always value most what they
                    have with the greatest difficulty acquired. And, besides, the arrangement was
                    too completely military to be perfectly adapted to the more peaceful spirit and
                    structure of a purely civil economy. It was also of too sudden formation, not
                    only that the people were not ripe for it, but that it did not, by its
                    deliberate growth, tend to ripen them. In its gradual formation afterwards,
                    every sucessive stage was sharply contested, and hardly won. The principles of
                    law and justice, municipal and natural, on which they rested, were all made
                    manifest in the course of the contest; so that not only a sound civil polity was
                    at length established, but, at the same time, there was formed a code of laws
                    based on principles so profound and true, as to entitle them to be retained as
                    the foundation of all laws, to all civilized nations, from that period to the
                    present, and probably to the end of time.</p>
                <p>SECTION π.</p>
                <p>Scarcely hail the Romans succeeded in raising a portion of the city out of its
                    ashes, when they were again involved in war. The various states and nations who
                    had been reduced to subjection in previous wars, seemed to regard the humbled
                    state of Rome as affording a propitious opportunity, not only of recovering
                    their freedom, but of crushing a dangerous neighbour. The next year after the
                    burning of Rome by the Gauls, the Latins and Hernicans revolted; while the
                    Volscians declared open war, and invaded the lands of their weakened antagonist.
                    But Camillus was at the head of the state, and his military genius enabled him
                    to lead the feeble remains of the Roman armies to victory over their ungenerous
                    foes. The Aequians had themselves suffered from the march of a part of the Gauls
                    through their country into Apulia; yet they also took up arms against Rome, and
                    were defeated. Meanwhile the Etrurians assailed the Romans in another quarter;
                    and Camillus was compelled to march against them, when again victory crowned bis
                    exertions.</p>
                <p>In a short time afterwards, the Latins and Hernicans having united their forces,
                    struck such apprehension into the Romans, that as Camillus could not be spared
                    from Rome, on account of the dissensions by which the state was agitated, Cossus
                    was appointed dictator, and sent against them. He not only gained a complete
                    victory over them, but also established a colony at Satricum. The Praenestines
                    sustained a severe defeat; and on all sides the Romans repelled their
                    assailants, and even began to extend the boundaries of the republic.</p>
                <p>But while victory attended the Roman arms in these contests, the dangers arising
                    from intestine broils became more and more urgent The state of confusion in
                    public matters, caused by the destruction of all public records, rendered it
                    possible for the ruling orders to levy taxes and contributions from the plebeian
                    order beyond their due proportion. That they did so may be fairly conjectured
                    from the fact, that no accurate census was taken during fifteen years after the
                    burning of the city, while taxes were levied by rates merely conjectural, and,
                    we need scarcely add, with partiality and oppression. The building of the houses
                    being, in a great measure, a public work, was done at the public expense, and
                    the commons were, in many instances, enjoined to bear their proportion of the
                    pecuniary burden, even after their whole property had been assigned to the
                    patricians to whom they had been indebted. This necessarily plunged them deeper
                    and deeper into debt; until the dungeons in the houses of the patricians became

                    >nexi,</hi> or persons assigned to slavery for life, for the payment of their
                    debts. Censors had indeed been appointed, but no census was taken, so that the
                    oppressive effects of continuing to exact a heavy tax from people whose property
                    had already been alienated by debt, as if that property were still their own,
                    continued unabated.</p>
                <p>Manlius, the brave defender of the Capitol, took upon himself the dangerous task
                    of defending the oppressed people. His seeming patriotism was, in all
                    probability, increased by disappointed ambition, the influence of Camillus being
                    too powerful for him. He publicly sold an estate, and with the produce paid the
                    debts of a number of the oppressed plebeians. He next proposed the sale of
                    public lands for the same object; and also accused the government ofhaving
                    concealed the money said to have been recovered from the Gauls, for the purpose
                    of appropriating it to themselves. For this and similar conduct, he was accused
                    of sedition and cast into prison; but so formidable was the appearance of his
                    friends, that the senate restored him to liberty. This only encouraged Manlius
                    to persevere in his violent course; and at last availing himself of his house in
                    the Capitol he seized on that citadel, and was immediately accused of aiming at
                    kingly power. On this accusation he was condemned to be thrown from the Tarpeian
                    rock; his house in the Capitol was razed to the ground, and it was decreed that
                    no member of the Manlian house should ever afterwards bear the name of Marcus.
                    Such is the most common account given of this transaction; though there are
                    others which differ considerably, both representing the conduct of Manlius in a
                    much more favourable light, and relating his death differently. His death,
                    however, unquestionably occasioned an accession of strength to the patricians,
                    and in a corresponding degree weakened and dispirited the plebeians. Additional
                    taxes were levied for the rebuilding of the walls; and by a sad consequence,
                    additional debts were incurred by the oppressed commons, and greater numbers
                    thrown into prison, or reduced to a state of servile dependence. All the
                    privileges and rights for which the commons had so long and perseveringly
                    striven, were wrested from them one by one, and the city seemed to be on the
                    point of sinking into the wretched and powerless condition of being the abode of
                    tyrannous patrician citizens, and degraded plebeian slaves.</p>
                <p>But two men, equal to the emergency, were raised up to rescue the Roman state
                    from its danger. These were two of the tribunes of the people, Caius Licinius
                    Stolo and Lucius Sextius. In their patriotic endeavours they were aided by the
                    influence of Marcus Fabius Ambustus, whose daughter had been given in marriage
                    to Licinius. By their energetic and persevering efforts these tribunes so
                    ingratiated themselves with the commons, that year after year they were
                    re-elected tribunes, gained over their colleagues, concentrated public opinion,
                    met and counterbalanced the influence of the patricians, and after a struggle of
                    five years, carried three new laws, which may be said to have completed the
                    fabric of Roman liberty. One of these was an agrarian law, prohibiting <pb
                    break="no" facs="ht:wu.89119129625&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=392"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0719-0392-0382"/>any Roman citizen from holding more than five
                    hundred acres of national lands; and also fixing the rent of public lands at the
                    tenth of grain, and the fifth of the vintage and other fruit-produce. Another
                    law ordained that one of the consuls should be chosen from the body of the
                    commons. The third provided, that in cases of outstanding debts, all the
                    interest which had been paid should be deducted from the capital, and that the
                    remainder should be paid by equal instalments in three years. For the public
                    influence thus obtained by the commons, the patricians endeavoured to compensate
                    by the appointment of a praetor from their own body, and of curule aediles; but
                    the plebeians having obtained so much, could not any longer be prevented from
                    attaining a perfect equality in point of eligibility to all public offices. In a
                    short time afterwards, their participation in the other magisterial offices
                    followed as a matter of course; the dictatorship, b. c. 353, the censorship,
                    348, the praetorship, 334, and even the priesthood, 300.</p>
                <p>Thus at last the object of political equality between the patricians and
                    plebeians was attained; and though the difference between patrician and plebeian
                    families still subsisted, they gradually ceased to form political parties
                    distinguished by origin and descent, yet there still remained the elements of
                    strife between the wealthy and the poor, in which character all subsequent civil
                    contentions at Rome ought to be considered. This we here deem it expedient to
                    state distinctly, in order to guard the reader from the error of viewing the
                    popular contests in which the Roman people were frequently engaged, after the
                    passing of the Licinian laws, as merely a revival of the old feuds between the
                    privileged patrician populus, or exclusive citizen-nobility of Rome, and the
                    unprivileged, yet personally free commons, the growth of conquest, and forming
                    the real strength of Rome. The early feuds were caused by the endeavours of the
                    patrician populus to engross and retain all political power and privilege, and
                    of the plebeian commons to secure personal liberty, and acquire civic and
                    political equality. This was accomplished directly by, or soon in consequence
                    of, the Licinian laws. But no public law can produce equality of wealth and
                    influence: oppression may be prevented, sufferings may be mitigated, the growth
                    of exorbitant wealth and power may be checked by wise enactments; but moral laws
                    alone can prevent those inequalities of wealth and influence which must always
                    exist, from becoming injurious, and finally destructive to any state, whatever
                    be the excellence of its civil and political code.</p>
                <p>Immediately after the conclusion of these civic struggles, the Romans were again
                    engaged in hostilities against the Gauls and the Etrurians. Over both they were
                    victorious; and in one of the battles with the Gauls, Titus Manlius, son of the
                    consul, distinguished himself by slaying, in single combat, a Gaul of huge
                    stature, despoiling him, in sight of both armies, of a gold chain, which the
                    barbarian wore as an ornament, and throwing the bloody trophy around his own
                    neck. For this exploit he received the name of Torquatus. Another Roman
                    champion, Marcus Valerius, in another battle also slew' a huge Gaul in single
                    combat; in which, as tradition relates, he was assisted by a crow, and thence
                    was named Corvus, or Corvinus.</p>
                <p>But while Rome was extending her dominions, and raising her military reputation
                    in these conflicts, she was maturing her strength for struggles more formidable
                    than any in which she had previously engaged. The Samnites, a people of
                    Sabellian race, inhabiting chiefly a mountainous country·, and celebrated for
                    their courage and hardihood, made war upon the Sidicinians. They applied to the
                    Campanians for aid against the Samnites; but both united proving too feeble, the
                    Campanians applied to Rome; and the people of Capua declared themselves subject
                    to Rome, that they might secure its protection. The Samnites refused to submit
                    to the dictation of Rome, and prosecuted their hostilities against the
                    Campanians. This produced a war between the Romans and the Samnites, by which
                    the utmost strength of Rome was sternly tried. Several battles were fought,
                    without producing any decisive results, though in general victory inclined to
                    the Romans. On one occasion, the Roman army was in the utmost danger of being
                    drawn into a disadvantageous situation in a narrow pass, and there surrounded,
                    when it was rescued by the skill and courage of Decius, a military tribune, and
                    <hi rend="italic">a</hi> victory was gained over the Samnites. At length a truce
                    was concluded for a period, both nations having suffered considerable losses</p>
                <p>During the truce, the Latins continued to harass the Samnites; and when tile
                    Romans prohibited them, they declared war against Rome herself. This led to an
                    unnatural war between nations that had for some time been almost completely
                    blended. Manlius and Decius were sent against the Latins, and, in order to
                    prevent the confusion that might arise between nations similar in language,
                    arms, and discipline, the consul Manlius prohibited any Roman soldier from
                    leaving the ranks on pain of death. But a daring Latin chief having challenged
                    any Roman to single combat, the consul’s own son could not brook that the
                    haughty defiance should remain unanswered, quitted the ranks, slew his
                    antagonist, and returning, laid the spoils at the feet of his father. The stern
                    consul, though he had obtained his own name, Torquatus, from a similar gallant
                    deed, immediately commanded the youthful champion to be beheaded on the spot,
                    for breach of orders; disregarding the cries and entreaties of the soldiers,
                    when they saw their young hero bound, and in a few seconds extended a headless
                    trunk before them.</p>
                <p>A desperate engagement almost instantly took place, both armies striving at once
                    for victory and for empire. The wing commanded by the consul Decius being on the
                    point of giving way, he threw aside his armour, assumed a flowing robe of white,
                    devoted himself with due rites to the infernal deities, for the safety of Rome,
                    then mounting his horse plunged into the heart of the conflict, while his white
                    robe streamed loose around his unarmed body. He soon fell, pierced by
                    innumerable wounds; but the Romans believed that such a sacrifice necessarily
                    secured the victory, while the Latins regarded it as equally ominous to them of
                    defeat. The event was not long doubtful. The Romans were victorious in every
                    quarter, and the Latins sustained a complete defeat. This battle is remarkable
                    as being that in which the peculiar tactics of the Roman legion are first
                    described by Livy; but whether the arrangement was the invention of Manlius, is
                    not stated. The author of such a decided improvement in the art of war ought to
                    have been made known; as there can be no doubt that the peculiar qualities of
                    the Roman legion were greatly instrumental in achieving the empire of the world.
                    See article Akmy.</p>
                <p>The Romans prosecuted their success with such vigour, that in the three ensuing
                    campaigns Latium and Campania were subdued, and annexed as provinces to the
                    territories of the republic. But the conclusion of one war was to Rome the
                    beginning of another. The Samnites again took up arms, and were joined by
                    theEucanians. To resist his dangerous confederacy, the Romans mustered all their
                    power, and placed Papirius Cursor at their head as dictator. Papirius reduced
                    the enemy so much that they were glad to sue for a truce. But this was of no
                    long continuance; and the Samnite general, Pontius, succeeded in drawing the
                    Roman army into such a position that it could neither fight nor flee, being
                    completely surrounded in a narrow defile called the Caudine Forks. The Roman
                    soldiers were compelled to surrender at discretion, and were disarmed, obliged
                    to pass under the yoke, and then dismissed with disgrace. This dishonour served
                    only to rouse the indignation and the pride of Rome. Papirius was again chosen
                    dictator, and again led the Romans to victory and revenge. The hum <pb

                    xml:id="kp-eb0719-0393-0383"/>bled Samnites once more sought a peace, which was
                    soon afterwards broken.</p>
                <p>In the renewed war, the Samnites were aided by the Etrurians, the Umbrians, and
                    the Gauls. Against these confederate nations the Romans were led by consuls of
                    unusual ability; among whom the skill of Fabius Maximus, and the self-devoting
                    patriotism of Decius, rendered them conspicuous. After many gallant exploits,
                    Decius, imitating the heroic deed of his father, devoted himselfto the deities
                    of death for his country’s sake, and purchased victory at the expense of a
                    consul’s life. After numerous vicissitudes of fortune, which we cannot afford
                    space to specify, victory declared for Rome. The Samnites lost their skilful
                    general Pontius, and the Romans, under the command of Curius Dentatus, were
                    enabled to dictate terms to their subdued antagonists.</p>
                <p>The Tarentines, and other states in southern Italy, had aided the Samnites, and
                    were now afraid that Rome would take vengeance on them for their interference.
                    They procured the assistance of the Gauls, in order to avert the war from their
                    own territories. This expedient was crowned wlth but partial and temporary
                    success. The Gauls were finally vanquished by Dentatus and Fabricius; and
                    preparations were made for waging war against the Tarentines. Alarmed at the
                    near approach of that vengeance which they had thus doubly provoked, the
                    Tarentines applied for aid to the famous Pyrrhus king of Epirus. This brave and
                    skilful, but rash and impolitic warrior, being desirous of emulating Alexander
                    the Great, listened readily to the invitation of the Tarentines, cherishing a
                    secret hope of conquering all Italy, and founding a western empire. He at first
                    sent his favourite and political adviser Cineas to Tarentum, and soon afterwards
                    followed in person, at the head of a large army, bringing with him also several
                    elephants trained to war, the first time that such animals had been seen in
                    Europe.</p>
                <p>The first care of Pyrrhus was to increase his army, by the aid of as many
                    auxiliary forces as he could procure, and to train them to the same discipline
                    as his own. The Tarentines had expected him to bear all the toils and perils of
                    the war, and to allow them to enjoy the pleasures of peaceful and luxurious
                    indulgence. They soon found, however, greatly to their dissatisfaction, that
                    their protector was resolved to be also their master; but their murmurs he
                    suppressed without the slightest compunction. In the mean time P. Valerius
                    Laevinus, the consul, at the head of a strong army, began to ravage the country
                    of the Lucanians, who were in alliance with the Tarentines. This induced Pyrrhus
                    to march against him, although his Italian allies had not joined him. A battle
                    was fought on the banks of the Siris; and after an obstinate and bloody
                    struggle, Pyrrhus obtained the victory, chiefly by means of his personal daring,
                    his Thessalian cavalry, and his elephants, the Roman cavalry not being able to
                    withstand the sight of these huge animals. But so desperate was the conflict,
                    and so many of his best troops did Pyrrhus lose, that when his officers
                    congratulated him on the victory, he exclaimed, “Another sucb victory, and I am
                    undone !”</p>
                <p>Soon after this encounter, Pyrrhus devastated the territories of the countries in
                    alliance with Rome. He laid siege to Capua, surprised Fregellae, and invested
                    Praeneste, having advanced even within sight of Rome. Finding however that his
                    march was producing no impression, he avoided an engagement offered him by
                    Laevinus, and returned to Tarentum. What he had now learned of the Romans,
                    convinced him that there was little prospect of an easy conquest over them; and
                    he was very willing to enter into negotiations for a peace upon equal and
                    honourable terms, his only stipulation being for an amnesty to the Tarentines,
                    the Greek cities in Italy, and those states which had entered into an alliance
                    with him. The senate seemed at first inclined to accept of these conditions; but
                    they were dissuaded by Appius Claudius, who caused himself to be carried to the
                    senate-house, blind as he was, that he might do his utmost to prevent a peace on
                    any terms, except the immediate and unconditional departure of Pyrrhus from
                    Italy. With this answer Cineas was obliged to depart from Rome, and both parties
                    prepared for the renewal of hostilities. The consuls, P. Sulpicius and P.
                    Decius, marched into Apulia, and were met by Pyrrhus near a little town called
                    Asculum. There another battle was fought, which terminated in favour of the
                    Romans, Pyrrhus finding it expedient to retire to Tarentum, and the Romans being
                    in no condition to pursue, so obstinate had been the struggle, and so exhausted
                    were both armies.</p>
                <p>Pyrrhus, tired of a contest with such invincible foes, readily accepted an
                    invitation from the Syracusans to assist them against the Carthaginians; and he
                    passed over with a great part of his troops to Sicily. In that island he was at
                    first successful; but fortune again began to frown upon him, and he was induced
                    to relinquish his hopeless enterprise, and return to the aid of the Tarentines,
                    who were nearly overpowered by the Romans. On his arrival, he recruited his army
                    to the utmost of his power among the Samnites, Lucanians, and Bruttians, and
                    prepared for a decisive effort. Nor were the Romans slack in their preparations:
                    they sent the two consuls, Curius Dentatus and Cornelius Lentulus, at the head
                    of two consular armies, the one into Lucania, the other into Samnium. Pyrrhus
                    hastened to encounter Dentatus when separated from his colleague; and another
                    desperate engagement took place near Beneventum. Pyrrhus bad advanced
                    incautiously in the hope of surprising the consul; and failing in this attempt,
                    was obliged to risk a battle in a disadvantageous position, and where his
                    phalanx had not proper room for its ponderous evolutions. The superiority of the
                    legion over the phalanx, and of the soldier who fights for his country over the
                    mercenary, were soon apparent. The elephants were scared by torches and driven
                    back on the army of Pyrrhus; the phalanx was forced into a crowded confusion
                    where it could not act, and from which it could not extricate itself; and in'
                    spite of the utmost skill and fierce valour of Pyrrhus himself, he sustained a
                    complete rout, and fled with the wreck of his army to Tarentum. Thence he soon
                    afterwards departed for Greece, leaving under the command of Milo, a small
                    garrison in Tarentum, which shortly surrendered to the Romans. The Samnites were
                    defeated with great slaughter, soon after the departure of Pyrrhus; and the
                    Lucanians and Bruttians were also compelled to yield to the Roman arms. At the
                    conclusion of this great war, Rome had established her supremacy over all the
                    countries in Italy, from the northern frontiers of Etruria to the Sicilian
                    straits, and from the Tyrrhenian sea to the Adriatic.</p>
                <p>It cannot be doubted that the Roman arms triumphed in the Samnite, Latin,
                    Etrurian, and Tarentine wars, very greatly in consequence of that cessation of
                    civil dissensions which the Licinian laws had produced, and the corresponding
                    accession of strength thereby gained. Yet even during these wars, there remained
                    one grievance to be removed, and which was removed. The cruelty of a usurer
                    towards one of his debtors, a youth of great personal elegance, excited the
                    indignation of the people to such a degree, that the senate found it necessary
                    to repeal the laws which gave creditors power over the persons of their debtors;
                    and to enact, that thenceforth no person should be fettered and confined, except
                    after conviction of a crime, and in order to punishment; and that for money due,
                    the goods of a debtor should alone be answerable, and not his person. This
                    enactment completed the charter of personal liberty to the Roman commons; but,
                    as will afterwards be seen, it ultimately gave rise to consequences perhaps more
                    fatal to public liberty.</p>

                <p>The extensive conquests which arose out of these wars, gave occasion to the full
                    development of the leading views of Rome, respecting the political relations in
                    which it was her pleasure to place the conquered with regard to herself. The
                    chief means to which, even from the earliest times, the Romans had recourse for
                    the foundation of their dominion over the conquered, and at the same time for
                    the prevention of the too great increase of the needy classes at Rome, was the
                    establishment of colonies of their own citizens, which served also as garrisons
                    in the captured cities in which they were settled. Each colony had its own
                    internal constitution, formed generally on the model of that of the mother-city;
                    hence it naturally became an object of Roman policy to keep the colonies in
                    perfect dependence. This colonial system of the Romans, which necessarily arose
                    out of the custom of depriving the conquered of their lands and liberty, assumed
                    its main features in the Samnite war, and gradually embraced the whole of Italy.
                    But the relations subsisting between Rome and the Italian nations were extremely
                    various in kind.</p>
                <p>A few cities and nations enjoyed the full privileges of Roman citizenship; in
                    some instances, however, even these were precluded from the right of voting in
                    the comitia. These were the municipal states. The privileges of the colonies
                    were of a more restricted nature: they were indeed in possession of their own
                    civic government, but had no share whatever either in the comitia or the
                    magistracies of Rome. The other inhabitants of Italy were either federates <hi
                    rend="italic"> (socii, foedere juncti),</hi> or subjects <hi rend="italic"
                    >(dedititii).</hi> The federates preserved their own internal form of
                    government, but were obliged to furnish tribute and auxiliary troops. Their
                    further relation with Rome depended upon the specific terms of their league. The
                    most advantageous of these terms were in favour of the Latins, though each of
                    the Latin cities had its own separate league; as the rest of the Italian nations
                    had their separate treaty, <hi rend="italic">(jus Ralieum).</hi> The subjects,
                    on the other band <hi rend="italic">(dedititii),</hi> were deprived of their
                    internal constitutions, and were governed by Roman magistrates, annually
                    renewed.</p>
                <p>The internal constitution of Rome itself, now completed, bore the aspect of a
                    democracy, inasmuch as equality of rights existed both for nobles and commons.
                    Yet this democracy was modified by expedients so various and intricate; the
                    rights of the people, the senate, and the magistrates, fitted so accurately into
                    each other, and were so firmly supported by the national religion, connecting
                    every thing with determinate forms, that there seemed to be no immediate reason
                    to fear the evils of anarchy, or of military despotism; though the democratic
                    character threatened the one, and the warlike temper of the nation the other, of
                    these dangers. To obtain a right view of the constitution of Rome, thus
                    modified, a few sentences stating the main outline may be given.</p>
                <p>This constitution was not, as must already have been seen, the work of one great
                    master-mind, but was the result of long contentions, innumerable temporary
                    expedients, yielding successively as better were devised, aggressions mutually
                    made by the opposing parties in their hour of strength, and concessions in that
                    of weakness; and that steady equipoise obtained by the well-balanced action of
                    opposing principles, knit together into the firmest and closest union by
                    repeated heavings, subsidings, and conjunctions. The rights of the people
                    consisted in the legislative power, so far as fundamental national principles
                    were concerned, and in the election of the magistrates. The distinction between
                    the <hi rend="italic">comitia tributa,</hi> as independent of the senate, and
                    the <hi rend="italic">comitia centuriata,</hi> as dependent on the senate, still
                    existed as to form, but had lost all its importance, the difference between
                    patricians and plebeians being now merely nominal, and the establishment of the
                    city tribes excluding the too great influence of the mere populace upon the <hi
                    rend="italic">comitia tributa.</hi> The rights of the senate consisted in
                    administering and debating all ordinary national affairs, whether foreign
                    relations, (war and peace only excepted, in which the consent of the people was
                    necessary), financial concerns, or matters regarding domestic peace and
                    security. But the manner in which the senate was supplied and maintained must
                    have made it by far the most skilful political body at that time in the world.
                    For a considerable period magisterial power had been the exclusive privilege of
                    the patrician and senatorial order; but after the plebeians obtained equal
                    access to these offices, the highest rank and power in the state offered a
                    stimulus for exertion to the ambitious career of mental ability from every class
                    and order, thus concentrating the collected mind of the nation, and from it
                    forming a ruling body of unequalled wisdom, genius, and enterprise. The rights
                    and rank of magistrates were founded on their right to the greater or lesser
                    auspices, no public affair being undertaken without the auspices. He only,
                    therefore, who was in possession of the rights of the greater auspices, could
                    hold the highest civil and military power as dictator, consul, or praetor; such
                    was not the case with those who held only the lesser auspices. The union of the
                    highest civil and military power in the person of the same individual was not
                    without inconvenience and danger; but military despotism was in some measure
                    guarded against by the prohibition of any magistrate from possessing military
                    command within Rome itself. But perhaps the most important of all the principles
                    combined in the constitution of Rome, was the existence and recognised authority
                    of its code of laws. To the sacred voice of public national law could appeal be
                    made at all times, and on every occasion; and every civic struggle terminated by
                    the addition of some new enactment, which defined the rights and privileges of
                    the contending parties, and left a rule of conduct and a principle of appeal to
                    succeeding ages. This ideal impersonation of law formed, on the one hand, a
                    safeguard against the encroachments of the ruling power, or the deliberative
                    body; while, on the other, the intemperate fervour of popular will was equally
                    within its controlling influence. Religion and law were the ruling elements of
                    the Roman constitution; and upon their inherent truth, purity, and power, or the
                    reverse, depended the duration, or the ruin, of Roman virtue and Roman
                    dominion.</p>
                <p>Rome having now obtained the sovereignty of all Italy, was not long in finding
                    employment for her victorious arms in another country. Sicily was the new field
                    on which the strength of Rome was tried, and the Carthaginians were her new
                    antagonists. It appears that a body of Samnite, or Sabellian youth, quitting
                    their homes under the vow of a <hi rend="italic">sacred spring,</hi><note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>For an account of the <hi

                    become mercenaries to Agathocles. After his death they seized upon the city
                    Messina, in Sicily, and committed the grossest outrages upon the inhabitants.
                    Having thus made the citizens, and indeed all the inhabitants of Sicily their
                    enemies, these mercenaries (known by the name Mamertines, from the god Mamers,
                    or Mars) sought the protection of the Romans. Some of them had previously
                    applied to the Carthaginians; and while the Romans were hesitating about lending
                    assistance to such disgraceful allies, the Carthaginians, somewhat less
                    scrupulous, sent a body of troops, and took possession of the citadel of
                    Messina. There had already been such intercourse between Rome and Carthage, as
                    to make each city in some measure aware of the power and ambition of the other.
                    The Roman senate speedily perceived, that if the Carthaginians obtained
                    possession of Sicily, their own prospects of aggrandise<pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:wu.89119129625&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=395" xml:id="kp-eb0719-0395-0385"
                    />ment in that quarter would be at an end, and their formidable rival at the
                    same time would have become their immediate neighbour.</p>
                <p>An army under the command of the consul Appius Claudius was sent to the
                    assistance of the Mamertines; and notwithstanding the superior power of the
                    Carthaginians at sea, the consul found means to elude their fleet, and to take
                    possession of Messina. Several victories were soon afterwards gained by the
                    Romans; and Hiero, king of Syracuse, abandoned the Carthaginians, and formed an
                    alliance with Rome. Agrigentum fell into the hands of the Romans after the
                    defeat of a Carthaginian army, which had come to raise the siege, and the
                    greater part of the interior of the island yielded to the power of Rome, while
                    the fleets of Carthage kept possession of the sea-port towns, and thus
                    maintained an equality. It was now evident to the Romans that the contest could
                    come to no conclusion so long as their antagonists retained the supremacy of the
                    sea; and they directed their most strenuous endeavours towards the construction
                    of a fleet.</p>
                <p>Being aware of their inferiority in naval affairs, the Romans first availed
                    themselves of a large Carthaginian vessel driven ashore in a storm, as a model;
                    and to counterbalance their deficiency in skill as mariners, they invented a
                    machine called a <hi rend="italic">corvus,</hi> which served both as a
                    grappling-iron and a draw-bridge, the object of which was to enable them to come
                    to close quarters, and encounter the Carthaginians man to man. Trusting to this
                    new invention, the consul Duilius hazarded an engagement with the fleet of the
                    enemy, rushed alongside their ships, locked them fast in the grapples of the
                    corvus, and captured at the first onset, by boarding, no fewer than fifty
                    gallies. The Carthaginian commander saved the remainder of his fleet by instant
                    flight. To commemorate this their first naval victory, the Romans erected in the
                    forum a column adorned with <hi rend="italic">rostra,</hi> or beaks of ships. In
                    a second naval action, fought near the island of Lipara, the Carthaginians lost
                    eighteen vessels, of which eight were sunk and ten taken.</p>
                <p>After the war had lasted about eight years, the Romans determined to invade
                    Africa, being aware that the tyranny of Carthage had alienated many of the
                    African nations. A fleet of three hundred and thirty ships was equipped for this
                    daring attempt, and given to the consuls Regulus and Manlius. The Carthaginians
                    were again defeated with great loss, sixty-four galleys being taken, and thirty
                    destroyed. The victorious fleet was soon refitted, pursued its course, and
                    landed the army near Clypea. A rapid succession of victories led the Romans to
                    the very gates of Carthage. Tunis was taken, and the humbled enemy sought terms
                    of peace. Regulus imposed demands so harsh, that they resolved to continue the
                    war; to which they were the more encouraged, by the opportune arrival of a band
                    of Greek mercenaries under the command of Xanthippus, a Spartan of high military
                    talents. The army being entrusted to his command, he completely changed its
                    tactics, formed it on the Lacedemonian plan, and sought an engagement with the
                    Romans. A great battle was fought, the Romans were completely routed, and
                    Regulus himself taken prisoner. A Roman fleet sent to succour the army defeated
                    the Carthaginian fleet in its course; and the army, though reduced, routed the
                    Carthaginians, no longer led by the brave Spartan. Being too weak, however, to
                    remain in Africa, and distressed for want of provisions, the army embarked for
                    Italy; but a violent storm wrecked on the coast of Sicily not less than two
                    hundred and ninety ships, with all on board. A second fleet was also destroyed
                    in a storm; and the Romans for a time abandoned the sea.</p>
                <p>In Sicily Metellus defeated the Carthaginians with great slaughter; and the
                    Romans gaining the ascendency in that island, laid siege to Lilybaeum. The
                    Carthaginians, weakened and dispirited with their numerous losses, sent Regulus
                    to Rome along with their ambassadors, expecting that he would persuade the
                    senate to grant a peace. Instead of this, he dissuaded the senate, and
                    recommended war, though aware of the sufferings he would have to endure on his
                    return to Carthage. Some historians relate, that on his return he was tortured
                    to death in the most cruel manner; others say that he was merely retained in
                    close confinement, and died a natural death before the conclusion of the war.
                    Again was the contest renewed, and at first not to the advantage of Rome. One
                    fleet was worsted in battle, and another entirely destroyed off the coast of
                    Sicily. The command of the Carthaginian forces in Sicily was given to Hamilcar
                    Barcas, father of the celebrated Hannibal. By his skill and conduct the sinking
                    cause of his country was vigorously sustained, till it seemed as if Carthage
                    might yet be victorious. The Carthaginians made a last desperate effort to
                    supply him with forces, and fitted out a large fleet for that purpose. The
                    Romans had also redoubled their exertions for the same reason. The two fleets
                    met near the islands Aegates, and the fortunes of Rome prevailed. A decisive
                    battle was fought; fifty of the Carthaginian ships were sunk, and seventy taken,
                    the power of Carthage was laid prostrate, and the empire of the seas transferred
                    to Rome. Carthage was now obliged to accept whatever terms of peace Rome thought
                    proper to propose: these were, that they should evacuate all the islands in the
                    Mediterranean, restore the Roman prisoners without ransom, and pay for the
                    defraying of the expenses of the war a thousand talents of silver immediately,
                    and two thousand two hundred in the space of ten years, in equal payments.</p>
                <p>Thus ended the first Punic war, after a contest of nearly twenty-four years’
                    duration. Its vicissitudes had severely tried the strength and the resources of
                    Rome; but it extended her reputation and her political connexions very widely,
                    preparing her for a career of foreign conquest. It awoke also in both republics,
                    Rome and Carthage, an inextinguishable hatred of each other, such as could never
                    be appeased but by the ruin of the one; and it inspired Rome with a desire of
                    foreign conquest and dominion, and of the wealth to be thus gained, which
                    speedily introduced corruption into the state, along with that accumulation of
                    power in the hands of a few families, which in every country long wars
                    inevitably confer on able warriors. In this manner the seeds of Roman greatness
                    and Roman decay were sown at once, and began to grow up side by side. Their
                    further progress we shall afterwards have occasion to notice and explain.</p>
                <p>The peace which Rome enjoyed at the termination of the first Punic war was of no
                    lengthened duration. The first hostilities in which she was engaged were
                    directed against Teuta, queen of Illyricum. The Illyrians had been successful in
                    a war against the Aetolians; and in the pride of their victory, they caused
                    their fleets to scour the seas, and pillage those of every other nation without
                    distinction, ln this piratical warfare some Roman ships were taken and
                    plundered; and the Illyrians laid siege to Issa, a city which had put itself
                    under the protection of Rome. When the Roman ambassadors demanded restitution,
                    and required Teuta to restrain her subjects from such piracies, she both
                    returned a haughty answer, and procured the murder of the ambassadors. Upon this
                    the Romans declared war against the Illyrians. In the course of the war they
                    gained the naval supremacy over the Adriatic, subdued the Illyrians, and entered
                    into alliance with the various states of Greece which had suffered from the
                    depredations of the Illyrian pirates. This alliance was of the utmost importance
                    to Rome, not only in opening the way for her future interference in the affairs
                    of Greece and of Asia, but also in enabling her to divide her enemies, and
                    prevent the formation of dangerous confederacies against her, when not prepared
                    to meet them.</p>
                <p>The Illyrian war had scarcely terminated when one of a <pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:wu.89119129625&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=396" xml:id="kp-eb0719-0396-0386"
                    />more formidable character commenced with the Cisalpine Gauls. Tribes of that
                    great people had repeatedly served as mercenaries against Rome during the
                    Etruscan and Samnite wars. After the conclusion of these wars, the Romans
                    subdued the Livonian Gauls, and planted a colony in their country near Lena. A
                    new influx of the Transalpine Gauls gave courage to their countrymen to renew
                    the war, and a furious contest soon began. The Gauls were at length defeated
                    with great slaughter near Clusium; and the Romans following up their success,
                    invaded the Gallic country around the Po. The Gauls were again defeated by
                    Marcellus, and compelled to sue for peace, which the Romans granted,
                    establishing at the same time colonies at Placentia and Cremona. It seems worthy
                    of record, that the number of men capable of bearing arms throughout the Roman
                    dominions in Italy, as ascertained by the levies of that dangerous juncture,
                    amounted to 800,000.</p>
                <p>Meanwhile the Carthaginians had been making great exertions to recruittheir
                    strength for another struggle with their great rival. Being prohibited from
                    extending their influence in Sicily, they had sought compensation by attempting
                    the subjugation of Spain. The command of their armies in Spain had devolved upon
                    Hannibal, the son of that Hamilcar who had distinguished himself towards the
                    close of the former war in Sicily. The father of Hannibal had made him swear
                    perpetual hostility to Rome; and from his boyhood his mind had been continually
                    engaged in devising the ruin of that detested city. He had prosecuted his
                    conquests in Spain with the view of obtaining a veteran army, and a source of
                    auxiliary supply from the warlike nations in that country; and when his designs
                    were matured, he laid siege to Saguntum, which was understood to be under the
                    protection of Rome. Having treated with contempt the remonstrances of the Roman
                    ambassadors, he took possession of this city. The senate of Carthage having
                    approved of his conduct, war was declared, and both parties prepared for the
                    impending conflict, well knowing that its progress must be sanguinary, and the
                    result ruinous to the one or the other of the rival republics. (As this war is
                    detailed at some length in the article Carthage, we must refer to it for a more
                    particular account of the contest.)</p>
                <p>Hannibal having completed his preparations, set out from Spain, for the invasion
                    of Italy, at the head of a veteran army of 50,000 foot, and 9000 horse. He
                    rapidly traversed Gaul, crossed the Rhone, and commenced the passage of the
                    Alps, led by Insubrian guides. This almost impracticable attempt he achieved in
                    fifteen days; and, on mustering his army in the plains of Insubria, found it
                    reduced to 20,000 foot, and 6000 horse. His army was soon considerably increased
                    by the Gallic nations; and, in a comparatively slight encounter near the
                    Ticinus, he worsted the consul Scipio, and soon afterwards completely defeated
                    Sempronius near the Trebia. The victorious Carthaginian then advanced towards
                    Rome, devastating the country through which he was maiching, and making it his
                    object to irritate the impetuous spirit of the consul Flaminius. In this he was
                    completely successful, and having drawn him into an ambush at the lake
                    Thrasymenus, entirely defeated him. The consul himself fell in the battle, with
                    15,000 of his bravest troops, and a great number were taken prisoners. Such was
                    the fury of the encounter, that the combatants were insensible of the shock of
                    an earthquake which happened during the engagement.</p>
                <p>Rome was now in a state of great alarm, having suffered successive defeats in
                    Italy itself, and seeing the victor pursuing his course unchecked through the
                    land. Fabius Maximus was chosen dictator, and immediately adopted a totally
                    different plan of opposing the enemy. He studiously avoided battle, kept his
                    army on the hills, watched Hannibal, cut off his supplies, and did every thing
                    calculated to wear out an invading army, which is necessarily remote from its
                    supplies. By this skilful policy he both saved his own army, and greatly
                    harassed that of his antagonist; and from it was surnamed Cunctator, the
                    Delayer.</p>
                <p>The Romans having recovered from their consternation, raised another levy of
                    troops, augmenting their armies to 87,000 men, under the command of Terentius
                    Varro and Aemilius Paullus, of whom the former was rash and headstrong, the
                    latter a cautious imitator of Fabius. Availing himself of the impetuosity of
                    Varro, Hannibal obtained his wish in a general engagement near Cannae in Apulia,
                    where, by his superior skill, he inflicted on the Romans the most dreadful
                    overthrow they had ever sustained since the battle of Alia. The consul Aemilius,
                    and about 45,000 men, of the very flower and strength of his army, were left
                    dead on the field, and about 10,000 were taken in the pursuit. Rome seemed now
                    open to the conqueror; but his army had suffered too severely to venture on so
                    hazardous an enterprise, and he turned aside to Campania, and wintered in
                    Capua.</p>
                <p>It was manifestly Hannibal’s object to encourage the states of Southern, or Lower
                    Italy, to revolt against Rome, that he might recruit his forces from among them,
                    and so be enabled to continue the war with renewed strength. To a considerable
                    extent he was successful, especially among the Lucanians, Bruttians, Apulians,
                    and even Campanians. He sent Mago to Carthage, to urge them to transmit supplies
                    with all possible despatch, that he might follow up his blow, before Rome should
                    have recovered from her consternation. But though the Barcine party predominated
                    in the Carthaginian senate, such was the influence of the opposite faction, that
                    he obtained only a very limited number of supplies; and these were to be sent to
                    Spain, whence he might draft a corresponding number of the veteran troops
                    stationed there. This, indeed, was part of Hannibal’s original plan, that he
                    might have at least one resource beyond the caprice of faction, though greatly
                    too remote from the scene of action to be immediately or securely available.</p>
                <p>At Rome the greatest exertions were made to remedy the disastrous consequences of
                    the terrible defeat of Cannae. All ranks and every age, from the boy of
                    seventeen to the retired veteran, were enrolled; and nearly all the gold
                    ornaments worn by persons of wealth and distinction, were voluntarily given up
                    to meet the exigencies of the state. In a short time an army was raised,
                    superior in numbers to that commanded by Hannibal; and the celebrated Marcellus
                    was placed at its head. In vain had Hannibal waited at Capua for supplies from
                    Africa; none were sent, and he was obliged to prepare to contend singly against
                    Roman courage and Roman despair. He sustained a check at Nola; and not long
                    afterwards Marcellus inflicted on him a partial defeat, by which the courage of
                    the Romans was greatly restored. The tide of success began now to recede from
                    Hannibal. He was unable to prevent the Romans from besieging and taking Capua,
                    though he both attempted to storm their camp, and, failing in that, marched to
                    Rome, to call away their armies for the defence of tile city. They disregarded
                    his threatening demonstration, continued the siege, took the city, and inflicted
                    severe punishment on the Capuans.</p>
                <p>The fall of Capua was highly injurious to Hannibal, tending to discourage other
                    Italian states from joining an ally who could not protect them against the
                    fierce vengeance of' Rome. On this account he failed to obtain supplies to his
                    waning army, while the Romans speedily replaced every loss with fresh recruits.
                    These hopes being frustrated, Hannibal entered into an alliance with Philip king
                    of Macedon; but here the fortunes and the policy of Rome likewise prevailed. The
                    Illyrian war had caused the Romans to be regarded as protectors by the Grecian
                    states, who, a <pb break="no" facs="ht:wu.89119129625&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=397"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0719-0397-0387"/>the same time, were jealous of the power of
                    Philip. No sooner, therefore, did the Macedonian king manifest his disposition
                    to form a confederacy with Hannibal against Rome, than the Roman ambassadors
                    were able to excite against him such hostility among the neighbouring states of
                    Greece, as to prevent the possibility of his making a descent on Italy to aid
                    the terrible Carthaginian. This is a very striking instance of the deep policy
                    of Rome; by means of which she was always able to keep a powerful enemy in check
                    till she might have leisure to collect her strength for a decisive effort.</p>
                <p>Notwithstanding these disappointments, Hannibal continued to maintain his ground,
                    repulsing the most daring assailants, and out-manoeuvring the most skilful.
                    Marcellus, who had conquered Sicily, and again returned to Italy, and who was
                    the most gallant opponent ever Hannibal met, was at last drawn into an ambush
                    and slain. But still, without supplies, the Carthaginian army must melt away;
                    and Hannibal’s hopes of ultimate success now depended upon the army led by his
                    brother Asdrubal reaching him safely from Spain. His hopes from Sicily,
                    Macedonia, and Africa, had failed; though it was doubtless to secure them that
                    he had made Lower Italy the basis of his operations; and he now waited eagerly
                    the arrival of his brother. Asdrubal had in the mean time left Spain, crossed
                    the Pyrenees, and the Alps, and entered Cisalpine Gaul, where he was joined by
                    considerable numbers of the natives. A messenger, whom he sent to apprise
                    Hannibal of his approach, was intercepted; the consul Nero hastened to join bis
                    colleague Livius, and assailing Asdrubal on the banks of the Metaurus in a
                    disadvantageous position, they completely routed his whole army. Asdrubal
                    himself was slain, and 56,000 of his army fell with him on the fatal field. The
                    first tidings which Hannibal received of his brother’s defeat and death, was by
                    the head of that luckless brother being thrown into his camp. From that time
                    forward the contest was without hope on the part of the Carthaginians. The Roman
                    consuls were not indeed able to cope with even an enfeebled army commanded by
                    Hannibal; but the youthful Scipio, having been sent to Spain, speedily overran
                    it, and reduced the greater part of it to complete subjection, putting an end to
                    Carthaginian power in that quarter. On bis return he obtained permission,
                    against the opinion of Fabius, to transfer the war to Africa.</p>
                <p>The invasion of Africa by Scipio, so alarmed the Cartha ginians, that they
                    immediately recalled Hannibal from Italy for the defence of Cathage itself. To
                    this command Hannibal most reluctantly submitted; and quitted Italy with
                    expressions of the utmost mortification and regret. In the mean while, Scipio
                    had approached to the near vicinity of Carthage. The two armies met at Zama, to
                    decide the fate of Rome and Carthage, and, with them, of the world. The battle
                    was obstinate and bloody, but the Roman army was decidedly superior in numbers,
                    and still more so in that high hope which so often determines the day; so that,
                    in spite of the utmost exertion of his unrivalled military skill, Hannibal saw
                    his army completely overthrown. Carthage had now no resource but in peace; and
                    she was compelled to submit to the terms dictated by Scipio. These terms were
                    abundantly severe; that the Carthaginians should retain in Africa only the
                    territory annexed to their government; that they should yield up all their
                    elephants, and all their ships of war, except ten triremes; that they should pay
                    at specified times ten thousand talents of silver; that they should commence no
                    war without the consent of Rome; and that they should restore all Numidia to
                    Massinissa, and give an hundred hostages for the performance of the treaty. Thus
                    ended the second Punic war, after having shaken Rome to her centre, and
                    threatened for a time to change the destinies of western Europe, and, with that,
                    the destinies of mankind; yet the result was exactly correspondent to the
                    character and resources of the two great rival republics.</p>
                <p>Rome had now removed her mighty rival from the strife of nations, and saw the
                    sceptre of universal dominion but little removed beyond her own grasp. The Roman
                    senate had fully entered upon that course of far-sighted policy, which enabled
                    them to gratify and amuse the nation with foreign conquest, the wealth and
                    powers of which they almost wholly engrossed. Such was its aspect and aim at
                    home; while with regard to foreign nations, the constant policy pursued was to
                    grant assistance to the weaker states against the stronger, and by taking them
                    under Roman protection, to have at all times the means of provoking a contest,
                    whenever it seemed conducive to her interest. The character of Rome, as a great
                    military republic, was now completely developed, as the overbearing friend or
                    the jealous foe of overy other state.</p>
                <p>The next field of Roman warfare was Macedon. Philip, the king of that country,
                    ambitious of obtaining the sovereignty over Greece, made some aggressions on the
                    Athenians. They complained to Rome, which soon led to a declaration of war
                    against that monarch, and the sending of an army to carry hostilities into his
                    dominions. The management of the war was entrusted to T. Quintus Flaminius,
                    whose diplomatic skill was still more conspicuous than his military talents.
                    After several inferior engagements, a great battle was fought at Cynoscephalae,
                    in which the Macedonians were completely routed, and Philip compelled to submit
                    to such terms as the conqueror pleased to dictate. The chief of these were the
                    reduction of his fleet, and his abandonment of all pretensions to the
                    sovereignty of Greece, the various states of which were taken under the
                    protection of Rome. At the conclusion of this war, the politic Roman, or rather
                    the wily Italian, caused the liberty of Greece to be publicly proclaimed at the
                    Isthmian games; while the lavish expressions of gratitude uttered by the
                    thoughtless crowds were the gilding of the chains by which they were securely
                    fettered.</p>
                <p>Rome still regarded Carthage with a jealous eye, and could not feel secure so
                    long as the dreaded Hannibal influenced her councils, and might again lead her
                    armies. Fearing that his dispirited countrymen would surrender him to his
                    implacable enemies, that great man fled to the court of Antiochus, king of
                    Syria. About the same time the Aetolians, being dissatisfied with the conduct of
                    the Romans, besought the aid of Antiochus, who was already quite disposed to
                    interfere in the affairs of Greece. He accordingly seized upon Euboea, and
                    proceeded to take measures for additional aggressions on states which claimed
                    the protection of Rome. War was immediately declared against him, and an army
                    sent into Greece, under the command of the consul Glabrio, who defeated the
                    Syrians at the pass of Ther-mopylae. Next year Lucius Scipio, brother to the
                    conqueror of Carthage, Africanus, was sent against Antiochus, accompanied by his
                    brother as legate. They reduced Greece to subjection, and crossing into Asia,
                    defeated Antiochus in a great battle at Magnesia. Antiochus purchased peace, by
                    resigning all his possessions in Europe, and those in Asia north of Mount
                    Taurus, paying 15,000 Euboean talents, and promising to give up Hannibal. The
                    latter vindictive article caused the flight of Hannibal to Prusias, king of
                    Bithynia; but being still pursued by the remorseless hatred of Rome, he put an
                    end to his mortal existence by swallowing poison, which for such an emergency he
                    always carried with him.</p>
                <p>The war with Antiochus fairly introduced Rome to the beginning of her oriental
                    sovereignty; and the battle of Magnesia may be viewed as the event which
                    terminated the Grecian or Macedonian sway as a universal empire. Little absolute
                    territory was indeed gained by Rome in this preliminary war; but at its
                    conclusion she saw both Macedon <pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:wu.89119129625&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=398" xml:id="kp-eb0719-0398-0388"
                    />and Syria reduced to a state of dependence on her imperious will, with the
                    Grecian states in the condition of ready instruments in her hands of future
                    aggrandisement, whenever she might be disposed to take or make an
                    opportunity.</p>
                <p>It is even painful to state, that after the conclusion of the Antiochian war, the
                    two Scipios were accused of having received bribes from that monarch, and
                    ofhaving embezzled the public money. Africanus went into voluntary exile at
                    Liternum, where he died the same year that Hannibal fell a victim to the cruel
                    and mean revenge of Rome. Asiaticus refused to pay the fine exacted, and all his
                    property was confiscated.</p>
                <p>A new Macedonian war soon arose, caused by the imperious authority assumed and
                    exercised by the Roman ambassadors over the conduct of the king. Philip had
                    endured their control with impatience; but his son Perseus was less able to
                    suppress his dissatisfaction, and hostilities were soon commenced. The war for a
                    time was favourable to the Macedonians, who gained one considerable victory, and
                    were successful in several conflicts of smaller importance. At length the
                    command was given to Paulus Aemilius, an old and skilful general, under whose
                    care the aspect of affairs changed. A decisive battle was fought near the city
                    Pydna, remarkable as the conclusion both of the Macedonian kingdom and the
                    Macedonian phalanx. In the first shock of battle the phalanx was irresistible,
                    and bore down all opposition; but the skilful Roman general, by causing his men
                    to retire fighting, and lead the phalanx upon broken and uneven ground, obliged
                    it to open its dense array of serried pikes, when the legionary soldiers
                    immediately penetrating these openings like a wedge, rent asunder the unwieldy
                    mass, and scattered it into hopeless and irretrievable confusion and rout, like
                    the bursting of a cloud of vapour by a whirlwind. Perseus was captured soon
                    after the battle, and reserved to grace the victor’s triumph. Macedonia, Epirus,
                    and Illyricum, were reduced to the condition of provinces, and the foundation of
                    a foreign territorial empire laid, was instead of one merely of influence and
                    military power.</p>
                <p>The utter destruction of Carthage was next resolved upon, partly through the
                    vindictive remembrance of the terror which Rome had formerly felt from
                    Carthaginian prowess, partly from the instigation of the stern, haughty, and
                    implacable Cato the censor. A pretext for a war was not difficult to find,
                    though the Carthaginians endeavoured to avert their fate by even the most abject
                    submission. But when the Romans, after inducing them to yield up their weapons,
                    informed them that they must abandon their city, witness its demolition, and
                    remove to a new position remote from the sea, despair itself roused them to make
                    the fiercest resistance. They sprung at once into an attitude of the most
                    determined defiance, forged new weapons, framed new military engines, the women
                    cutting off their hair to form ropes to work their machinery; and clad in
                    glittering panoply, they manned their walls, and met the unappeasable hatred of
                    Rome with hatred not less keen and mortal. The Roman armies sustained several
                    reverses; but under the command of Scipio Aemilianus, son of Paulus Aemilius,
                    and adopted son of Scipio Africanus, victory again began to crown their efforts.
                    After a fierce and protracted struggle, the Romans forced their way into the
                    city on the side next the port, and obtained possession of the city wall. But
                    the conflict was not over though the city wall was seized. The Carthaginians
                    fought from street to street, from house to house; and the Romans gained the
                    city but by yards and inches, every house being contested from the ground floor
                    to the roof, like a separate fortress. At length all was carried but the citadel
                    and the temple of Aesculapius. These the Romans were prepared to storm, when the
                    citadel surrendered, Asdrubal, who had the command, yielding to Scipio, on
                    condition that his life should be spared. Those who had fled to the temnle, some
                    of whom were deserters from the</p>
                <p>Roman army, prepared to destroy it and themselves by fire, rather than fall into
                    the hands of the Romans. Among these was the wife of Asdrubal, who had been
                    placed in the temple before her husband yielded to Scipio. Seeing Asdrubal along
                    with the Roman general, and detesting his cowardice, she arrayed herself in her
                    richest attire, took her two children with her, and displaying herself on the
                    top of the temple, upbraided her husband, stabbed her two children before his
                    face, and threw them into the flames, which were now bursting furiously from the
                    interior. She then sprung after them into the heart of the blazing ruin. Thus
                    perished Carthage, leaving Rome to pursue unrivalled her guilty and
                    self-destroying career.</p>
                <p>While the third Punic war was still raging, hostilities again broke out in
                    Macedonia, excited by an impostor named Andriscus, who, pretending to be the son
                    of Philip, instigated the disaffected Macedonians to throw off the Roman yoke,
                    and forming an alliance with the Thracians, strove to accomplish his purpose by
                    force of arms. Metellus, after a short struggle, overpowered the insurgent
                    Macedonians, and then attempted to procure the dissolution of the Achaean
                    league. This led to the Achaean war, which terminated in the complete
                    subjugation of Greece, and its reduction to the form of a Roman province.
                    Mummius the consul, who conducted this war, sacked and burned Corinth; and after
                    having pillaged the city of its most valuable effects, its rich paintings and
                    beautiful sculptures, demolished its walls, temples, and public buildings, and
                    reduced it to a heap of blackened ruins. The plundered ornaments of Corinth were
                    sent by the consul to Rome; and it has been recorded, proving at once his care
                    and his ignorance, that he stipulated with the masters of the vessels employed
                    in transporting these matchless treasures of art, that “if they suffered any of
                    them to be lost or injured, they should furnish others in their stead.”</p>
                <p>Another enemy of still more stubborn mould continued to engage the attention of
                    Rome, and to put to the severest test the courage of her armies and the skill of
                    her generals. The wars and conquests of the Carthaginians in Spain had directed
                    the attention of the Romans to that country; and a war for the <sic>awowed</sic>
                    purpose of its subjugation was begun soon after the expulsion of the
                    Carthaginians. Partly in consequence of the defensible nature of the country,
                    abounding in mountain ridges and deep and rapid streams, and partly from the
                    brave and determined character of the inhabitants, the war was protracted,
                    obstinate, and bloody. Repeatedly did the arms of Rome sustain signal reverses;
                    and still with invincible energy of will was the contest maintained. At length
                    the Lusitanians obtained a leader under whom they seemed likely to secure their
                    possession of liberty and independence. This was Viriatus, a shepherd, a hunter,
                    a robber, and finally a military hero, almost unrivalled in fertility of
                    resources under defeat, skill in the conduct of his forces, and courage in the
                    hour of battle. Like the guerilla leaders of modern times, he knew how to avail
                    himself of the wild chivalry of his countrymen, and the almost impenetrable
                    fastnesses of his country; but, superior to them, he was equally able to guide a
                    troop and to marshall an army. Six years did he maintain the contest; and at
                    length the consul Caepio, unable to subdue him in the field, procured his
                    assassination. The Lusitanians, deprived of their brave leader, were soon
                    afterwards completely subdued.</p>
                <p>Undismayed by the overthrow of their countrymen, the Numantines still maintained
                    the unequal conflict against the collected might of Rome. Pompey was baffled;
                    his successor Mancinus shared a similar disgrace; and at length the Romans
                    raised Scipio Aemilianus, the conqueror of Carthage, to the consulship, and
                    assigned him Spain as his province, and even prolonged his command, after the
                    expiration of his year as proconsul. At the head of a large army he <pb

                    xml:id="kp-eb0719-0399-0389"/>closely invested the town, and began the siege.
                    The Numantines made the most desperate defence; and after more than six months
                    of almost incessant assault and repulse, the citizens destroyed their wives and
                    children, set lire to the city, and by the flames or mutual slaughter perished
                    to a man, leaving to Scipio to triumph, not over Numantia, but over the
                    smouldering tomb of its unconquered children.</p>
                <p>Amidst these triumphs of her arms, the policy of Rome obtained an acquisition
                    more important in some respects, but also of darker omen. Attalus, king of
                    Pergamus, at his death, bequeathed his dominions to the Roman republic; and the
                    senate, disregarding the remonstrances of Aristonicus, the natural heir,
                    immediately took possession of this valuable inheritance. By what means Attalus
                    had been induced to make this strange bequest, has never been accurately stated;
                    but thus, by some deep stroke of policy, Rome acquired possession of the largest
                    and fairest portion of Asia Minor. The extensive provinces now held by Rome
                    caused a very great and fatal alteration in part of her international policy.
                    The inhabitants of these countries were entirely subject to Rome; and the
                    administration of them was conducted by those who had enjoyed the office of
                    consuls, and by praetors, subordinate to whom were the quaestors, or collectors
                    of the revenue. Till about this time praetors were expressly appointed to each
                    province; but it now began to grow customary for the praetors who had vacated
                    office to succeed to the provinces, under the name of pro-praetors. The highest
                    military and civil powers were united in these governors; and being thus
                    prolonged in a species of self-appointed and irresponsible tenure of office, the
                    consequence was equally injurious to the provinces, in the oppression and
                    extortion inflicted on them, and to Rome, in the degeneracy thus fatally
                    introduced. From this time forward Roman virtue was little but a name; while the
                    armies and generals of the haughty and corrupt republic fought not so much for
                    fame and dominion, as for the means of gratifying licentiousness and
                    avarice.</p>
                <p>The destructive consequences of Roman corruption and degeneracy soon became but
                    too manifest in the seditions and civil broils which sprung up, and found no end
                    but in the overthrow of the republic itself. It may be expedient to devote a few
                    sentences to an explanation of the causes and the nature of the dissensions by
                    which the very existence of the state was endangered; especially, as owing to
                    the resemblance which they bear to the ancient contests between the patricians
                    and the plebeians, they are liable to be misunderstood, as if they were merely a
                    renewal of those ancient broils. <note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>See Heeren’s History of the Revolution of the Gracchi.
                    </p></note> They were, however, essentially different. The contests between the
                    patrician populus and the plebeian commons of Rome’s earlier days was for the
                    possession of the rights and privileges of citizenship, which was at first
                    enjoyed by the patrician order alone, and for an equal share in which the
                    plebeians strove. These contests had terminated soon after the passing of the
                    Licinian law, and the admission of all orders alike to an equality in rights,
                    privileges, and eligibility to all offices in the state. From that period,
                    though the designations of patricians and plebeians might still be retained, the
                    essential distinctions between them had ceased to exist; and whatever contests
                    arose, sprung from causes entirely different.</p>
                <p>Although there had long ceased to be any legal distinction between the patricians
                    and the plebeians, so that they could not accurately be regarded as different
                    orders in the state, yet there continued to subsist the great difference between
                    wealth and poverty, aggravated by the fact, that the senate wielded the entire
                    power of the republic, and in general engrossed its emoluments. In consequence
                    of this exclusive possession of power, the senators had gradually acquired the
                    almost equally exclusive possession of that portion of the lands of conquered
                    states which the laws of Rome devoted to the commonwealth. The Licinian law had
                    been passed to prevent this unjust seizure of the public lands by the
                    patricians, but was insufficient for that purpose, even its author being
                    convicted of violating it soon after its enactment. While the attention of the
                    state was almost incessantly occupied with the management of public wars, the
                    senatorial body imperceptibly gained possession of the public lands, by grants,
                    by pretended purchase, or in some instances by fair means, farming them from the
                    state, in others by forcible seizure. In this manner the patricians, though no
                    longer a peculiar order, possessing distinctive privileges in the state, became
                    a wealthy and powerful aristocracy, engrossing nearly all public influence by
                    means of their wealth, as their ancestors had done by means of their exclusive
                    citizenship.</p>
                <p>On the other hand, the great body of the citizens, deprived of their due share of
                    the public lands, and not permitted by law to engage extensively in commerce,
                    which was the privilege of the equestrian order, possessed the rights of
                    freemen, and the privilege of voting, as citizens in all public matters in the
                    comitia, notwithstanding their extreme poverty. Not obtaining their due share of
                    the public lands, and not being permitted by the wealthy patricians to farm
                    them, which they rather entrusted to their slaves, these poorer citizens were
                    reduced to the necessity of resorting to Rome, and attaching
                    <sic>themelves</sic> to one or other of the more powerful and wealthy of the
                    patricians, by whom they were supported in return for their votes in the
                    comitia. Thus the wealth of the one partly enabled them to purchase, and the
                    poverty of the other obliged them to sell, those rights of voting on all public
                    matters, which, instead of being the safeguards of freedom, became the very
                    elements of tyranny and licentiousness. This consequence seems to have been
                    foreseen, and partly guarded against, by the institution of the city tribes, for
                    the purpose of preventing the undue influence of what was truly a city rabble,
                    devoid of the means of subsistence, although voting in the public assemblies.
                    But this preventive measure was not sufficient. The immense wealth which flowed
                    into the public treasury from the tribute of conquered provinces, and into the
                    coffers of the chief senators, from their public lands, the command of armies
                    and of provinces, together with other public employments, enabled the state, as
                    such, to maintain in idleness, by donations of money and provisions, great
                    numbers of the people, whose votes they thus secured; and the wealthy families
                    to maintain great numbers more, who might be either added to the supporters of
                    the senate, or employed as the partizans of ambitious individuals. In this
                    manner did it come to pass, that the main body of the citizens of Rome had sunk
                    to the very lowest depth of poverty and venal degradation, and was ripe for any
                    sedition or the perpetration of any crime. At the same time these idle and
                    dependent citizens must have been often exposed to the real ills and sufferings
                    of poverty; and must have been often impelled to view with bitter envy the
                    excessive wealth of their more fortunate countrymen, whose equals nevertheless
                    they knew themselves to be in the eye of the law. That feelings fiercely
                    democratical should spring up in the breasts of those who were at one time
                    supported, and at another time trampled on, by a proud and avaricious
                    aristocracy, which the senate had become, was both natural and inevitable; and
                    that some measure should be framed to check the increasing disparity between the
                    wealthy and the poor, and to prevent the enormous accumulation of wealth in the
                    hands of the senate as a body, or of a few families in that body, was absolutely
                    indispensable to the permanent well-being of the republic. But such a measure
                    would have required to be framed with the most consum∙*</p>

                    failure could not but aggravate all the evils which it had been intended to
                    cure.</p>
                <p>In this crisis of affairs at Rome; when a conflict was on the eve of bursting
                    forth, not between patricians and plebeians, as distinct orders in the state,
                    but between the rich and the poor, on account of the unequal distribution of
                    property, Tiberius Sempronius Gracchus appeared on the scene, and assumed the
                    advocacy of popular rights. He was a man of great natural abilities, which had
                    received the utmost degree of cultivation, through the care of his mother, the
                    celebrated Cornelia, and the example of his relatives, the Scipios.
                    Circumstances had led him to mark the baneful practice of the wealthy families,
                    in assigning to slaves the cultivation of their lands, and thus causing the
                    removal to the city of that class of free and privileged men, who ought to have
                    been the main proprietors and tenants of the soil, which the valour of their
                    fathers and of themselves had won for Rome. The evil consequences of thus
                    forming a population of agricultural slaves, and needy citizens prepared for
                    every enormity, both by their degradation and their distress, arrested the
                    attention of Gracchus; and he resolved to exert himself for the removal of that
                    corruption which was already preying so deeply on the vitals of the
                    commonwealth. His desire was to relieve the distress of the lower orders, and to
                    prevent the danger of their relapse into an equally unfavourable condition.
                    Having been elected tribune of the people, he availed himself of his official
                    power, and proposed a better division of the public lands. At first he sought
                    merely the re-enactment of the Licinian law in a modified form, somewhat better
                    suited to the altered circumstances of the republic. In this he was strenuously
                    opposed by the senate, and also by one of his colleagues in the tribunate;
                    Octavius. The opposition, instead of inducing Gracchus to adopt more prudent
                    methods of conciliation, roused his indignation, and from a patriot, anxious
                    only to promote the public weal, converted him into a demagogue, determined to
                    effect his purpose by whatever means and at whatever hazard to his country’s
                    welfare. He brought forward a new law much more harsh in its provisions than the
                    Licinian; and being still opposed by Octavius, he procured his ejection from the
                    tribuneship, contrary to the principles of the constitution, which he thus
                    himself set the example of violating. He then carried the new law, and got
                    himself, his brother, and his father-in-law appointed as commissioners for
                    surveying the public lands, and taking steps preparatory to a new division.</p>
                <p>Had Gracchus contented himself with these enactments, and done his utmost to
                    carry them into peaceful execution, he might after all have been regarded as a
                    true patriot, and might have been the preserver of his country; but he now found
                    himself in the position, into which, sooner or later, every demagogue finds
                    himself driven. It had become necessary for him to retain popular support, even
                    for his own personal safety, if he should remain at Rome after the expiration of
                    his year of tribuneship. He therefore introduced other measures more calculated
                    to maintain his popularity, than to promote the true interests of the community.
                    He proposed a distribution of the treasures of Attalus among the people; a
                    reduction of the period of military service; and the right of appeal from the
                    sentence of the judges to the people. Measures so glaringly democratic incensed
                    the senate to the very highest degree; and as his tribune-ship was now nearly
                    expired, during which his person was inviolable, he endeavoured to procure his
                    re-election as a tribune, both that he might retain the power of pressing
                    forward his proposed enactments, and for the security of his personal safety.
                    The aristocratic party in the senate were now resolved to have recourse to any
                    method of removing such a dangerous foe. They mustered all their partizans,
                    disturbed the proceedings of the comitia, and interrupted them both by intrigues
                    and violence. At length, on the second day of the comitia, held for the election
                    of tribunes, when both parties had mustered in full force, Tiberius wishing to
                    inform the people that his life was in danger, and the tumult being too great
                    for him to be heard, raised his hand to his head; this gesture the opposite
                    party misinterpreted into a sign of his wish that the people should crown him;
                    and Scipio Nasica rushed out of the senate-house at the head of the most
                    determined of its members, loudly accusing Gracchus of a conspiracy to make
                    himself king. A fierce conflict ensued, the friends of Gracchus dispersed and
                    fled, and he was killed during the confusion of the tumult. About three hundred
                    of the democratic party fell along with their leader, and their bodies were cast
                    into the Tiber.</p>
                <p>Thus terminated the attempt of the elder Gracchus to reform the abuses which were
                    rapidly destroying the virtue of the Roman state and people; and like all
                    unsuccessful attempts, it but served to consolidate more firmly what it had
                    shaken, but not removed. The senate did not indeed venture directly to repeal
                    the Sempronian law for the division of the public land, which had superseded
                    that of Licinius, but left it to fall into desuetude like its predecessor. In
                    the contest, however, both parties had been guilty of the most glaring
                    violations of both law and justice; both parties contemned the fundamental
                    principles of the constitution; and both manifested an utter disregard for the
                    true welfare of the republic, in their eager endeavours to prosecute their
                    self-interested views. How different from the early struggles between the
                    patrician and plebeian bodies, in which no blood was shed by either party, and
                    the utmost that even the oppressed plebeians threatened, was to forsake the city
                    which denied them the rights of citizens! But the love of country had perished
                    in the sordid pursuit of wealth; and there no longer remained enough of true
                    patriotism to impel the contending parties to resort to mutual concessions for
                    the general good. A contest so begun and so waged, could have no other
                    termination than in the complete destruction of the one or the other of the
                    contending bodies, or in the overthrow of both by some designing and powerful
                    usurper, and thus in the total subversion of the constitution and the extinction
                    of Roman liberty.</p>
                <p>Within the course of a few years the contest was renewed, and with more
                    determination and energy than before, under the conduct of Caius Gracchus, the
                    younger brother of Tiberius. During the interval that elapsed between the death
                    of Tiberius and the public appearance of Caius, the tribunes of the people had
                    prosecuted their endeavours to increase their own power, especially in the
                    renewal of their tenure of official dignity. The senate managed to impede their
                    endeavours chiefly by bestowing on them such employments as required them to be
                    absent from Rome; and Caius himself was detained as quaestor in Sicily, even
                    beyond the legal term of that office. Immediately on his return he was chosen
                    tribune of the people, and forthwith resumed with double energy the enterprise
                    of his brother. His first object was to enforce the Agrarian law’s of his
                    brother, which had hitherto been kept in abeyance, and to renew the commission
                    appointed to survey the public lands. Being chosen a second time to the
                    tribuneship, he procured the enactment of a law transferring the judicial power
                    entirely from the senate to the equestrian order; and he even attempted to
                    procure the addition of three hundred knights to the senate, for the purpose of
                    overpowering their deliberations by the votes of his own partizans. Another of
                    his laws provided that the soldiers should be clothed at the expense of the
                    public, without diminution of their pay; another secured the regular
                    distribution of corn to the poor <pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:wu.89119129625&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=401" xml:id="kp-eb0719-0401-0391"
                    />citizens; and another proposed the granting of the privileges of Roman
                    citizenship to all the Italian allies, as also the formation of colonies, not
                    only in Italy, but in the provinces, and in particular at Carthage. By these
                    popular enactments he raised himself to such a height of power in the state,
                    that the senate did not venture to oppose him by direct means, but first
                    endeavoured secretly to diminish his influence with the people. Forthis purpose
                    they encouraged Livius Drusus, another tribune, to rival Gracchus in the race of
                    popularity, by producing measures of a still more democratic nature, which
                    measures the senate readily consented to pass, thinking by this deep yet base
                    policy to weaken the power of Gracchus before attempting any more direct attack
                    upon him. Such was the fickleness and venality of the democratic party, that
                    they soon began to applaud Drusus above their recent leader; and when Caius
                    stood candidate a third time for the tribuneship, he was unsuccessful. The
                    senate saw the hour of retribution at hand, Opimius, the most daring of the
                    aristocratic party, was elected consul, and the two factions prepared for a
                    final struggle.</p>
                <p>An accidental quarrel, in which Antylias, one of the consul’s lictors, was killed
                    by the friends of Gracchus, precipitated the strife. The senate conferred the
                    dictatorial power on Opimius in the usual terms. Gracchus with his followers
                    took possession of the Aventine hill, and attempted to open a negotiation with
                    the consul. This was refused, and an unconditional surrender required, which not
                    being yielded, the consul attacked the insurgents, gained the hill, and slew
                    great numbers of them; and Gracchus himself, after a fruitless endeavour to save
                    his life by flight, fell either by his own hand, or by that of a faithful slave
                    who accompanied him, and from whom he exacted this bloody proof of fidelity. Not
                    less than three thousand of the friends and followers of Gracchus fell in this
                    ill-omened struggle; and their bodies were ignominiously cast into the Tiber, as
                    those of traitors to the commonwealth, and conspirators against its laws and
                    government.</p>
                <p>These contests, known in history by the designation of “the seditions of the
                    Gracchi,” shewed but too plainly that the ancient patriotic spirit of Rome had
                    departed, never more to return. The attempt to check the growth of the already
                    exorbitant wealth and power of the nobles had utterly failed; failed, although
                    all legal and constitutional means had been exerted for its enforcement; failed
                    even partly in consequence of the violent methods pursued with a view to compel
                    its adoption; failed by being met with at least equally subtle,
                    unconstitutional, and violent opposition; and the two antagonist powers, wealth
                    and poverty, avarice and wretchedness, equally corrupt and unprincipled, sunk
                    for a time into quiescence, though unreconciled, waiting but for another
                    opportunity toburst into fiercer and more implacable hostility. The fires of the
                    feud were not extinguished by the defeat and death of the Gracchi; they were but
                    covered up with deceitful ashes, beneath which they smouldered scarcely
                    observed, but acquiring tenfold strength, and preparing for an eruption which
                    should devastate not Italy alone, but every region of the Roman world.</p>
                <p>Within a few years after the death of Caius Gracchus, the senate not only found
                    means to evade the Agrarian law, but also to procure its repeal; and even the
                    land-tax which had been introduced as an intermediate step, the produce of which
                    was to be distributed among the people, was annulled; and on the one hand, the
                    extortion and rapacity of the nobles, and on the other, the degeneracy of the
                    populace, proceeded with increased rapidity. Neither the authority of the
                    censors, nor the enactment of sumptuary laws, could retard the luxuries of the
                    wealthy; while the very means taken to support the poorer classes out of the
                    surplus riches of the state and of great families, increased their venality,
                    turbulence, and licentiousness.</p>
                <p>This universal corruption of public morals was manifested in a very striking
                    manner in the next great war into which Rome entered, which was that against
                    Jugurtha. This crafty and far-sighted Numidian had served in the Roman armies,
                    and made himself intimately acquainted with both the strength and the weakness
                    of the Roman character. Having been left joint-heir to the kingdom of Numidia,
                    along with his two cousins, the sons of Micipsa, he resolved to sieze the whole,
                    and procured the murder of the one, while the other fled for safety and redress
                    to Rome. But at Rome Jugurtha’s gold was more powerful than the appeals of the
                    wronged Adherbal; and the senate decreed that the kingdom should be divided
                    equally between the two. Scarcely had Adherbal returned to Numidia, when
                    Jugurtha, stimulated to fresh crimes by his recently experienced impunity,
                    declared war against his cousin, obtained possession of his person, and put him
                    to death in violation of the terms of his surrender. The tribune Memmius
                    constrained the senate to declare war against the usurper; which was frustrated
                    by his purchasing a peace of the consul. He was then ordered to repair to Rome,
                    under safe conduct, to answer for his guilt. Once more was the Numidian gold too
                    powerful for the course of justice, and Jugurtha would have been acquitted, had
                    he not again embrued his hands in the blood of another kinsman. He was now
                    ordered to quit Rome, return to his dominions, and there prepare either to
                    submit unconditionally, or to meet the utmost hostility of the offended and
                    outraged republic. The war was conducted for a time with little success on the
                    part of the Romans, till the command was entrusted to Metellus, a man of great
                    military skill and incorruptible integrity. When this general had almost
                    completed the conquest of Numidia, he was supplanted in the command by Caius
                    Marius, a man of the lowest extraction, but of great abilities, courage, and
                    force of character, and of at least equal perfidy, deceitfulness, and ferocity,
                    who, by his popular talents, and his intriguing spirit, had got himself raised
                    to the consulship. Marius speedily reduced Jugurtha to the necessity of taking
                    refuge with Bocchus king of Mauritania, defeated the united armies of these two
                    monarchs, and began to treat with Bocchus for the surrender, or rather betrayal
                    of Jugurtha. This, however, was accomplished by Sylla, who was at that time
                    quaestor in the army of Marius, and who so far succeeded in depriving Marius of
                    the honour arising from the capture of Jugurtha, as Marius had done Metellus.
                    This incident, in all probability, laid the foundation of that rancorous
                    animosity between those two formidable rivals, which afterwards blazed out so
                    fiercely, and spread such extensive devastation throughout the Roman dominions.
                    Jugurtha was at length brought captive to Rome, and after being exhibited in the
                    triumphant procession of Marius, was cast naked into a dungeon, and left to
                    perish in the agonies of hunger.</p>
                <p>The elevation of Marius to the consulship was an event of a very momentous
                    character, both in itself and in its con -sequences. In his previous tribuneship
                    he had shewn himself to be fully qualified to act the part of a demagogue in
                    every respect. Being himself a person of the most obscure origin, all his habits
                    and feelings were thoroughly adapted to those of the very lowest of the people;
                    and yet the consciousness of great native powers of mind, gave him a certain
                    haughtiness of bearing which could not brook control either from the senate
                    which he braved, or the people whom he at once led and governed. Upon his
                    appointment to the consulship, and previously to his departure for Numidia to
                    supersede Metellus, the senate gave him little encouragement in the raising of
                    those levies which were requisite for the vigorous prosecution of the war,being
                    probably willing to see the popularity of the new demagogue abated, though at
                    the expense of their country’s military reputation. But Marius was not a person
                    to be easily baffled. Instead of <pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:wu.89119129625&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=402" xml:id="kp-eb0719-0402-0392"
                    />confining his levies to the wealthier citizens, as had always hitherto been
                    the case, he raised it almost entirely from among the very lowest class in the
                    state, the <hi rend="italic">capite censi,</hi> the indigent, the desperate, and
                    the mercenary. An army formed of such materials was a fitting instrument for
                    accomplishing any design, inasmuch as it was utterly destitute of every moral
                    virtue and every patriotic feeling, owing no allegiance except that enforced by
                    military discipline, or purchased by occasional indulgence in military excesses.
                    This most unpropitious innovation secured for the time the ascendency of Marius
                    and the popular party; but it laid the foundation of that military despotism
                    which ultimately destroyed the last lingering remains of Roman liberty ,∙ as
                    indeed it must do sooner or later when the military spirit becomes purely
                    mercenary, the love of country expires, and the citizen is lost in the
                    soldier.</p>
                <p>This dangerous innovation might not have been so completely confirmed, had it not
                    been for a new, and most formidable foe with which the republic was at this
                    juncture threatened. The Cimbri and Teutones, two of those northern nations
                    which, occasionally bursting from their forests, overran contiguous countries,
                    exterminated the native inhabitants, and became the origin of new races and
                    nations, had penetrated into the Roman provinces, and come into contact with the
                    armies of the republic. In Styria they defeated the consul Papirius Carbo; in
                    Gaul, Junius Silanus had no better fortune; and, finally, the two consuls,
                    Manlius and Caepio, were routed with immense slaughter, eighty thousand men
                    perishing in the conflict. The tidings of this defeat caused the utmost
                    consternation at Rome; and such was the military reputation of Marius, that both
                    senate and people concurred in nominating him a second time to the consulship,
                    even before the expiration of his first year of command. He immediately levied
                    new forces; and in the extreme terror of the republic, no opposition was made to
                    his enrolment of great numbers of the city populace, by which this innovation
                    was confirmed, and the precedent established, of mustering troops from the very
                    dregs of society, and whose character was altogether base and mercenary. For a
                    time, however, the tide of the Cimbrian war rolled past, and spent its force on
                    Gaul, though still continuing to threaten Italy. During this interval, Marius
                    continued to increase his army, and to perfect the discipline of the new
                    recruits, his tenure of the consulship being prolonged for four successive
                    years, in consequence of the continuation of the same dread which had at first
                    caused his illegal reinstatement in that office. In his fourth year, the
                    Teutones having entered the Roman territories, were defeated by Marius, near
                    Aix, with immense slaughter, more than two hundred thousand of the invaders
                    having perished. Next year he was equally successful against the Cimbri, in a
                    battle fought near the Po; in which, however, his colleague Catulus, and, what
                    more annoyed him, Sylla, shared the honours of the victory.</p>
                <p>Marius had now enjoyed the consulship for the unprecedented term of five
                    successive years, and might have retired with an unrivalled reputation; but the
                    possession of power had only stimulated him with the eager desire of prolonging
                    his enjoyment of it. Soon after his return to Rome he began to intrigue with the
                    popular party, in order to obtain the consulship a sixth time, in opposition to
                    his old rival Metellus; and having formed a strict confederacy with the tribune
                    Saturnius, and the praetor Glaucias, two demagogues of the most unprincipled
                    character, partly by their aid, and partly by means of the most extensive
                    bribery, he procured bis re-election to that dignity. There was now no check to
                    the designs of the democratic faction, the people being led on by a tribune of
                    the most abandoned and reckless character, and the senate being headed by an
                    ambitious demagogue. But at length the extreme measures of Saturnius alarmed and
                    disgusted even Marius; and with his usual force of character, he resolved to
                    oppose the factious tribune. A great commotion ensued. Saturnius and Glaucias
                    seized the Capitol, but were closely besieged, their supplies of water cut off,
                    and being forced to surrender, they were condemned and executed as traitors.
                    Thus did the extreme licentiousness of the popular faction compel even their own
                    most powerful leader to interpose, and to put forth his iron strength to crush
                    them as disturbers of the public peace, and enemies of their country’.</p>
                <p>This interposition in behalf of the republic cost Marius nothing less than a
                    temporary loss of that power of which he was so ambitious. After the expiration
                    of the sixth consulship, he found himself unable to retain his influence; his
                    old antagonist Metellus was recalled from banishment; and he withdrew into Asia
                    in a species of voluntary exile. A temporary cessation from the civil broils
                    which had convulsed Rome, gave leisure for the reformation of the state from
                    some of the abuses which had been forcibly introduced, or had insensibly sprung
                    up. Some salutary laws were enacted against the systematic oppression under
                    which the provinces groaned. Another measure, also of a reforming character, led
                    to a less propitious result. This was an attempt to control the conduct of the
                    equestrian order, which had become hurtful to the community, especially since C.
                    Gracchus bestowed upon them the judicative authority. They had also obtained the
                    farming of the leases, and consequently the collection of the revenue in the
                    provinces, by which means they were enabled not only to oppose every reform that
                    was attempted in the provincial administration, being judges in their own cause,
                    but also to hold the senate itself in a state of dependence. The tribune Livius
                    Drusus procured the enactment of a law, the effect of which was to restore to
                    the senatorial body the half of the judicative power; but the means by which
                    this law was passed, and by which it came into operation, involved an
                    infringement of the constitution. Three hundred knights were added to the
                    senate; and from the body thus raised to six hundred, the judges were selected.
                    Unhappily this tended more and more to render the senate an aristocracy of
                    wealth, and thus to increase the chasm, already but too wide, between the
                    wealthy and the poor classes of the community, and to prevent the growth of a
                    middle class, one of the most fatal wants by which the republic was afflicted; a
                    want which clearly indicated, and speedily caused, the total disruption of the
                    social fabric.</p>
                <p>But the most immediately disastrous subject of contention, was that which
                    proposed the admission of all the Italian states in alliance with Rome, to the
                    privileges of citizenship. Great numbers of the citizens of these states had
                    either flocked to Rome upon losing their own property when conquered, or had
                    been allured thither during the seditions of the Gracchi, by those popular
                    leaders, with the view of strengthening their adherents, under the prospect of
                    obtaining portions of the re-divided lands, or at least an idle maintenance from
                    the gratuitous distribution of grain. To gratify these, and to procure a new
                    accession of strength, Drusus proposed to admit all the Italian allies to the
                    full rights of citizenship. This project roused the pride and the jealousy of
                    the whole body of the people, who thought they foresaw in it the overthrow of
                    all their peculiar privileges and powers, and who, however democratic at Rome,
                    wished to be the aristocracy of all the world beside. The proposal was rejected
                    by the unanimous voice of the people; and Drusus himself was soon afterwards
                    killed in a popular tuιmdt.</p>
                <p>The Italian states, however, were not disposed to relinquish so easily the hopes
                    which had been thus excited. They held private intercourse with each other,
                    interchanged hostages, and prepared deliberately for a general revolt, unless
                    their demands should be conceded. The chief states of this social alliance were
                    the Marsi, the Pelagi, the Samnites, and the Lucanians. Having assumed arms, the
                    allies sent to <pb break="no" facs="ht:wu.89119129625&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=403"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0719-0403-0393"/>Rome, to demand a participation in the privileges
                    of Roman citizens; and upon receiving a peremptory refusal, war was immediately
                    declared against Rome. The war thus commenced, commonly termed the Social war,
                    raged for the space of three years, the allies being as well disciplined and led
                    as the Romans themselves; and many very sanguinary battles were fought, in which
                    Rome sustained several severe defeats, and was for a time exposed to great
                    danger. In this war, Cato, Marius, and the elder Pompey, greatly distinguished
                    themselves; but the chief glory was unquestionably reaped by Sylla, who proved
                    himself to be possessed of abilities of the very first order, equally as a
                    politician and a warrior. The bloody struggle was at length terminated, rather
                    by Roman policy than Roman arms. The freedom of the city was first granted to
                    those states which had aided Rome; it was then offered to those who should first
                    discontinue hostilities; and finally, it was given to the whole of the Italian
                    states; so that whosoever was a citizen of any free town in Italy, became a
                    citizen of Rome, provided he lodged his claim within sixty days after; and in
                    this manner even many foreigners were subsequently admitted to Roman
                    citizenship.</p>
                <p>To counterbalance the influence of these new citizens, and to preserve to those
                    resident in Rome itself the preponderance of political power, the new citizens
                    were formed into only eight tribes, completing the number of thirty-five, of
                    which they formed but a small minority, even when joined by the six turbulent
                    city tribes. It was, however, a complete revolution, and tended to infuse a more
                    healthy vitality into the Roman constitution, which it might have prolonged, had
                    it not already been corrupt at the very core.</p>
                <p>Before the entire termination of the Social war, another arose in a different
                    quarter of the world, by which the strength of Rome was severely tried. The
                    bequest of Attalus king of Pergamus had given to the Romans extensive and
                    wealthy dominions in Asia; and had at the same time stimulated their ambition
                    and their avarice by the still more extensive regions which it placed almost
                    within theirgrasp. The Grecian,or rather Macedonian empire had sunk before the
                    growing power of Rome; and out of its ruins various monarchies arose, one of the
                    most considerable of which was that of Pontus. For a time it remained tributary
                    to its more powerful neighbours, till under Mithridates the Great, it became
                    sufficiently strong not only to reduce the adjacent kingdoms, but even to wage
                    an even-handed warfare against Rome itself for a number of years. Mithridates,
                    seeing Rome weakened by the Social war, deemed it a convenient juncture to make
                    himself master of her Asiatic dominions, and prosecuted his undertaking with
                    such vigour and success, that he had subdued the whole of Asia Minor, and all
                    the adjacent islands, with the exception of Rhodes, before the .Romans were
                    sufficiently at leisure to attend to his movements, occupied as they were with
                    civil broils and social wars. But tl&gt;.e loss of their rich Asiatic
                    territories was what the cupidity of neither senate nor people could brook; and
                    upon the termination of the Social war, all parties were equally eager to
                    commence hostilities against Mithridates, anticipating vast wea'th from the
                    pillage of these opulent regions. Marius and Sylla warmly contended for the
                    command of this important war; but the fame recently acquired by the latter in
                    the war of the allies, enabled him to triumph over his rival. Scarcely had Sylla
                    been nominated to the command, when fresh tumults arose in Rome, instigated by
                    the envy of Marius, and the daring and lawless conduct of Sulpicius, tribune of
                    the people. The object of these new tumults was to procure sufficient popular
                    influence to remove Sylla from the command to which he had been appointed; and
                    they were so far successful, that while he was yet in Campania with the army
                    destined for Asia, a decree was passed in an assembly of the people,
                    transferring the command to Marius. But Sylla’s army were too much devoted to
                    their general to submit to this capricious change. They put to death the
                    commissioners who came to deprive him of his office; and Sylla, confiding in
                    their adherence to him, marched directly on Rome, obtained possession of it, and
                    put to the sword without mercy all those who had rendered themselves conspicuous
                    by their support of his rival. Sulpicius was slain, notwithstanding the law
                    which declared the person of a tribune inviolable; and it was with the utmost
                    difficulty, and after sustaining innumerable hardships, and experiencing almost
                    incredible hair-breadth escapes, that Marius himself eluded the keen pursuit of
                    his enemies.</p>
                <p>Sylla having thus crushed the opposite faction, and proscribed Marius, his son,
                    and his chief adherents, re-established the power of the senate, and appointed
                    his friend Octavius, and his enemy Cinna, to the consulship, set out against
                    Mithridates. The relief of Greece was the first object of Sylla; and this he
                    accomplished after taking Athens by storm, and defeating the armies of
                    Mithridates in two great battles. Weakened and dispirited by these reverses, the
                    king of Pontus readily concluded a treaty with the Roman general, who, on his
                    part, was equally desirous of a peace, that he might return to Rome, where the
                    Marian taction had regained the ascendancy.</p>
                <p>Sylla had probably expected to produce a comparative equilibrium at Rome, by the
                    appointment to the consulship of one from each of the contending tactions. Here,
                    however, his policy failed, probably from being too refined, or from his not
                    taking into consideration the new element which had been introduced, by the
                    admission of the Italian states to the citizenship. He had in a great measure
                    exterminated the democratic party in Rome itself, and restored the power of the
                    senate; but Cinna perceived the means of raising a powerful body of new
                    adherents, by proposing to throw open all the tribes to the Italian states,
                    which would have given them a preponderance in every popular assembly. This the
                    other consul, Octavius, opposed; and Cinna was compelled to withdraw to the
                    country, where he soon mustered a powerful army of the disaffected allies.
                    Marius, who had fled to Africa, being informed of the turn which affairs had
                    taken at Rome, conceived hopes of recovering his power, and immediately returned
                    to Italy, joined Cinna, and at the head of an immense horde of robbers and
                    semi-barbarians, the very dregs of the populace -of all Italy, who flocked to
                    his standard from all quarters, advanced against the city. At his approach Rome
                    was thrown into consternation; and there not being any forces sufficient to
                    oppose him, the senate offered to capitulate, on condition that the lives of the
                    opposite party should be spared. During the progress of these negotiations,
                    Marius entered the city at the head of his armed and barbarous adherents,
                    secured the gates that none might escape, and gave the signal for slaughter. On
                    rushed his barbarians like wolves, sparing neither age nor sex, while Marius
                    gazed on the horrid scene with grim and savage delight. During five days and
                    five nights, the hideous massacre was continued with relentless ferocity, while
                    the streets were deluged with blood, and the heads of the mur--dered victims
                    were exhibited in the Forum, or laid before the monster himself for his peculiar
                    gratification. Atlength Cinna grew sick of the protracted butchery; hut the
                    barbarians of Marius could not be restrained till they were themselves
                    surrounded and cut to pieces by Cinna’s soldiers.</p>
                <p>Having gratified his revenge with this bloody butchery, Marius nominated himself
                    consul for the seventh time, and chose Cinna to be his colleague, This he did
                    without the formalities of a public assembly, as if to consummate his triumph
                    over the liberties of his country, thus trampled upon by an act at once of
                    violation and of insult. But a short time did he enjoy his triumph and revenge.

                    />ter of having been one of the most successful generals, and most pernicious
                    citizens of Rome.</p>
                <p>Sylla having concluded a treaty with Mithridates, returned at the head of his
                    victorious army, prepared and determined to inflict the most signal and ample
                    vengeance upon the Marian faction, whom he deemed equally foes to himself and to
                    the republic. Before his arrival in Italy, Cinna had been killed in a mutiny of
                    his own troops; and none of the other leaders possessed talent and influence
                    enough to make head against him. After a short but severe struggle, Sylla
                    prevailed, and immediately commenced his dreadful, deliberate, and systematic
                    course of retribution. All who had either taken part directly with Marius, or
                    who were suspected of attachment to the democratic party, were put to death
                    without mercy, and, what was almost more terrible, apparently without wrath.
                    Sylla even produced publicly a list of those whom he had doomed to death, and
                    offered a reward for the heads of each. He thus set the example of proscription
                    which was afterwards so fatally imitated in the various convulsions of the
                    state. His next step was to depopulate entirely several of those Italian states
                    which had joined the Marian faction, and to parcel out the lands among his own
                    veteran troops, whom he thus at once rewarded and disbanded in the only manner
                    likely to reconcile them to peaceful habits. Having thus satiated his revenge,
                    his next care was to reform and re-construct the constitution and government of
                    the state, shattered to pieces by long and fierce intestine convulsions. He
                    caused himself to be appointed dictator for an unlimited time. He restrained the
                    influence of the tribunes, by abolishing their legislative privileges, reformed
                    and regulated the magistracy, limited the authority of governors of provinces,
                    enacted police regulations for the maintenance of public tranquillity, deprived
                    several of the Italian states of their right of citizenship, and having supplied
                    the due number of the senate by additions from the equestrian order, he restored
                    to it the possession of the judicative power.</p>
                <p>Having at length completed his career as a political reformer, Sylla voluntarily
                    resigned his dictatorship, which he had held for nearly three years, declared
                    himself ready to answer any accusation that could be made against him during his
                    administration, walked unmolested in the streets as a private person, and then
                    withdrew to his villa near Cumae, where he amused himself with hunting and other
                    rural recreations. Whether his retirement might have remained long undisturbed
                    by the relatives of his numerous victims, cannot be known, as he died in the
                    year after his abdication of power, leaving, by his own direction, the following
                    characteristic inscription to be engraved on his tomb: “Here lies Sylla, who was
                    never outdone in good offices by his friend, nor in acts of hostility by his
                    enemy.”</p>
                <p>The civil wars between Marius and Sylla may be considered even more worthy the
                    careful study of the historian, than those between Pompey and Caesar, for a
                    right understanding of the circumstances which led to the destruction of Roman
                    liberty, as the latter but concluded what the former had begun. Indeed, the
                    strife between Marius and Sylla was itself the natural sequel of that contest
                    between the aristocratic and the democratic factions, if they ought not rather
                    to be termed the factions of wealth and poverty, which gave rise to the sedition
                    of the Gracchi, and which being conducted on both sides with no spirit of mutual
                    concession, none of mutual regard for the public welfare, deepened into the most
                    bitter and rancorous animosity, such as could end in nothing but mutual
                    destruction. Ofthe worst spirit of democracy, we see in Marius what may be
                    called a personification; fierce, turbulent, sanguinary, relentless; brave to
                    excess, but savagely ferocious; full of wily stratagems, in order to gain his
                    object, then dashing from him every hard-won advantage by his reckless
                    brutality. On the other hand, the aristocratic spirit had its representa tive in
                    Sylla; haughty, cautious, and determined, forming his schemes with deep
                    forethought, prosecuting them with deliberate perseverance, and abandoning them
                    with cold contempt when his object was accomplished. He held his dictatorial
                    sway till he had satiated his revenge, and re-established, as he thought, the
                    government on an aristocratical basis, then scornfully laid aside his power, and
                    yielded himself to voluptuous indulgence. By these men it was madeclearly
                    evident that Rome no longer possessed sufficient public or private virtue to
                    maintain her republican institutions; that she was tottering on the very brink
                    of a complete and final revolution, leading with fatal certainty to a military
                    despotism; and the only question was, whether her despotic ruler should be a
                    Marius or a Sylla; whether he should spring from among the democratic populace,
                    or the aristocratic nobility; a question not long to be left in doubt.</p>
                <p>Many of the laws enacted by Sylla were of a very wise and beneficial character,
                    though their general aim was too manifestly the restoration of aristocratic
                    power to the senate. What effect his personal influence, had his life been
                    prolonged, might have had in consolidating his political reforms, cannot
                    certainly be known, though it may very safely be conjectured that not even his
                    power could long have prevented new convulsions. The malady lay too deep to be
                    reached by any merely political measures of a remedial nature. It had its
                    essence in the degeneracy and moral turpitude of the entire body of the
                    republic, both nobles and people, which there was nothing in their external
                    circumstances to prevent, or in their national religion to heal. Besides, as in
                    the recent wars and revolutions, almost all property had experienced a change of
                    possessors, there were vast numbers throughout all Italy eager for a counter
                    revolution. Several young men also of abilities and ambition, were prepared to
                    emulate the career of Marius or of Sylla, which could not be done without a
                    renewal of that contest, the heavings of which had not yet wholly subsided. Of
                    these, the chief were Lepidus, Crassus, Pompey, and Sertorius, and perhaps
                    Lucullus.</p>
                <p>Very soon after tile death of Sylla, the consul Lepidus, made an attempt to
                    rescind the laws of Sylla. In this he was opposed both by his colleague Catulus,
                    and by Pompey, who was now the head of the aristocratic party, to which he had
                    attached himself before its final triumph over the Marian faction. Lepidus was
                    declared a public enemy, defeated in battle, fled to Sardinia, and there
                    died.</p>
                <p>A more dangerous and protracted contest was waged in Spain, to which country
                    Sertorius had withdrawn, and gathered around him the relics of the Marian party.
                    For six years did this virtuous and heroic republican maintain a successful
                    struggle against the whole power of Rome, defeated successive consular armies,
                    and baffled even the experience of Metellus, with the skill and energy of
                    Pompey. At length he was basely assassinated by Perpenna; and upon the loss of
                    their leader, his forces were easily subdued by Pompey, and Spain was reduced to
                    obedience.</p>
                <p>Before the termination of the Spanish war, one still more dangerous commenced in
                    the very heart of Italy. Spartacus, a celebrated gladiator, a Thracian by birth,
                    escaped from the gladiatorial training school at Capua, along with some of his
                    companions, and was soon followed by great numbers of other gladiators. Bands of
                    desperate men, slaves, murderers, robbers, pirates, flocked to him from all
                    quarters; and he soon found himself at the head of a force able to bid defiance
                    to Rome. Four consular armies were successively defeated by this daring
                    adventurer, and Rome itself was considered in imminent danger. But subordination
                    could not be maintained in an army composed of such materials. Spartacus
                    purposed to march into Gaul, invite Sertorius to join him, and then together
                    march on Rome. Had this plan been carried into effect, Rome in all proba<pb

                    xml:id="kp-eb0719-0405-0395"/>bility must have fallen into the hands of the
                    combined forces; but the tumultuous followers of Spartacus, longing for the
                    pillage of the capital, compelled their leader to abandon his intention, and
                    bend his course towards that devoted city. He was met and completely routed by
                    the praetor Crassus, who thus acquired some renown in war, in addition to the
                    influence which he possessed from his unequalled wealth. Pompey, on bis return
                    from Spain, encountered and destroyed several scattered bodies of the
                    gladiatorial army; and thus, with his usual good fortune, obta⅛ed a claim to
                    divide the honour with Crassus. From this period, these two powerful individuals
                    cherished sentiments of envious rivalry against each other, the effect of which
                    proved ruinous to the commonwealth.</p>
                <p>The enormous wealth of Crassus enabled him to purchase the support of the people,
                    by bestowing upon them large donations of money and corn. To counterbalance his
                    influence, Pompey, although attached to thearistocratic party, proposed the
                    repeal of some of Sylla’s laws, and the enactment of others of a more popular
                    character; in particular, the restoration of the powers and privileges of the
                    tribunes. By these means he so ingratiated himself with the people, that, with
                    powers never before entrusted to any general, he obtained the command of the
                    armament prepared against the pirates by which the seas were so greatly
                    infested. In this war he distinguished himself in a very remarkable manner, by
                    his skill, courage, and activity, and raised himself to a height of power and of
                    military fame, at that time beyond all rivalry.</p>
                <p>During the progress of these events in Spain and Italy, Mithridates had renewed
                    the war in Asia Minor. Lucullus, to whom the command in the Mithridatic war was
                    now given, defeated the fleet of the Pontic king, relieved Cyzicus, and
                    overthrew the combined forces of Mithridates and Tigranes in two great battles,
                    bringing the struggle to the very brink of a successful conclusion. But the
                    mutinous spirit of his own army, and the hostility which he aroused against
                    himself, by his reform of the financial administration of the provinces,
                    occasioned his recall. Pompey was next appointed to the command of the armies in
                    Asia; and thus again was he favoured by fortune to obtain the crowning glory of
                    a victory already all but won. Mithridates finding all his efforts ineffectual,
                    and being in danger of immediate captivity from the defection of his son-in-law,
                    Tigranes, and the treason of his own son, Phraates, killed himself, that he
                    might not fall into the hands of the Romans. After the conclusion of the war,
                    Pompey spent some time in Asia, settling its affairs, and arranging it into
                    different provincial districts. By the fall of Mithridates, and this settlement
                    of Asiatic affairs, the republic may be considered to have reached the highest
                    pitch of her power; but when the summit has been gained, the next step is
                    inevitably downward. The very existence of the republic, as such, now depended,
                    partly upon the caprice or the moderation of Pompey himself, partly upon the
                    judicious or the erroneous measures which Crassus might adopt, in his endeavours
                    to counterbalance the power of his mighty rival.</p>
                <p>Unfortunately for Rome, the two rivals saw no better method of maintaining each
                    his own influence in opposition to that of his antagonist, than by separately or
                    jointly courting popularity. Pompey had led the way in this injudicious
                    procedure, by his partial restoration of the tribunitian power; and this
                    restoration was completed by the joint influence of him and Crassus during their
                    united consulship. It had been found by ambitious men, that they could not
                    obtain their objects of pursuit, whether those objects were chiefly aristocratic
                    or democratic, without becoming demagogues; and therefore unhappily it was
                    considered by them necessary to re-establish in all its power an office, of
                    which the very nature pointed it out for such a pernicious abuse.</p>
                <p>But as extremes in all things meet, these very demagogues necessarily became an
                    oligarchy; and while they pretended to promote the interests of the people, such
                    men as Pompey and Crassus engrossed the whole powers and emoluments of the
                    state.</p>
                <p>Before this rivalry had reached its crisis, and during the absence of Pompey in
                    Asia, Rome was threatened with a new convulsion, and new competitors for public
                    favour began to appear on the scene. Lucius Sergius Catilina, a young man of
                    noble birth, but of desperate fortunes, and of the most depraved character,
                    formed a conspiracy to destroy the chief men of the state, seize on all public
                    property, restore the Marian faction, and, placing himself at its nead, to
                    invest himself with supreme power. Not only the profligate of the youthful
                    nobility, and the indigent of the populace, joined in this conspiracy, but even
                    Crassus and Julius Csesar were accused ofhaving been so far implicated in it.
                    After several failures and postponements, the conspiracy was partly detected,
                    and partly forced into a premature disclosure by the failure of Cataline in his
                    attempt to obtain the consulship, and the prudent preventive measures of his
                    successful rival, Cicero, who also at that time began to act a distinguished
                    part in public affairs. Not all the daring, nor all the secret attempts of
                    Cataline could overawe, or elude the energy and vigilance of Cicero; and at
                    length the desperate and baffled conspirator fled from the city, and raised the
                    standard of revolt in Etruria. His associates in Rome were seized and put to
                    death, and he was himself defeated and slain in a desperate battle, after having
                    performed deeds of the most determined valour. So highly had Cicero
                    distinguished himself by his detection and suppression of this dangerous
                    conspiracy, that the senate unanimously bestowed upon him the honourable title
                    of <hi rend="italic">Father of his Country.</hi></p>
                <p>During the progress, and in the suppression of this conspiracy, several very
                    remarkable men had come prominently forward. These were Cicero, unmatched for
                    eloquence, learning, and philosophical wisdom; Cato, a true republican of the
                    ancient mould, simple, severely virtuous, and uncompromising; and Caesar,
                    unrivalled in the versatility, extent, and power of a genius, equally fitted to
                    attain preeminence in the pursuits of literature, philosophy, politics, and war.
                    The two former adhered to the aristocratic party in the state, who were headed
                    by Pompey; the latter made the democratic party the basis of his power, although
                    he was himself descended from one of the most ancient and noble families of
                    Rome. He had the address both to extricate himself from the conspiracy of
                    Cataline, and to make himself at the same time the person to whom the survivors
                    of that party looked for protection. From that period it was evident, that
                    whatever might be the destinies of Rome, Caesar must exercise a potent influence
                    over them, for evil or for good.</p>
                <p>The return of Pompey from Asia caused a renewal of the contest for power between
                    that general and the party which sought to maintain the independence of the
                    senate. Of this party, Cato, Lucullus, and Metellus, were the chief adherents;
                    but their efforts only caused Pompey to throw his influence more into the
                    popular scale, and thus unconsciously to promote the ambitious views of Caesar.
                    That sagacious man, perceiving the necessity of acquiring both the skill and the
                    renown of a general, and having hitherto in a great measure abstained from
                    military affairs, got himself appointed to the governorship of Lusitania, where
                    he soon acquired a high reputation for warlike talents, and at the same time
                    repaired his dilapidated fortunes.</p>
                <p>During the absence of Caesar, the contest between Pompey and Crassus continued,
                    each endeavouring to weaken the influence of theother; and the independent party
                    in the senate, led by Cato, and occasionally aided by Cicero, availing
                    themselves of this struggle to diminish the undue power <pb break="no"

                    />of both. But upon the return of Caesar, this contest was brought to a
                    termination. The two rivals began to perceive that their power was in danger of
                    being equalled, if not surpassed by a third; and Caesar, to lull their jealousy
                    asleep, till his own designs should be matured, pointed out to them the risk
                    they incurred of merely ruining each other, if they did not speedily compose
                    their differences. He at first paid most court to Pompey, as his most formidable
                    rival, and affected devotion to his cause, till by his aid, seconding his own
                    rising fame, he procured the consulship. During his tenure of that office, he
                    still more increased his popularity by the enactment of several salutary laws,
                    and some of more ambiguous character. In particular, he carried an Agrarian law
                    for the distribution of large tracts of land in Campania among the indigent
                    people, and had the address, in spite of the opposition of the senate, to induce
                    both Pompey and Crassus to aid him in passing it, and to act as commissioners in
                    the distribution, thus sharing the odium of the measure, while the entire
                    popularity remained his own.</p>
                <p>The schemes of Caesar required a new element for their further development. He
                    well knew that he could not gain the supreme power without an army to support
                    his pretensions, or depend on an army without having previously made it
                    completely his own. It was therefore necessary for him to obtain the command of
                    a warlike province, and that, if possible, adjacent to Rome. Gaul was exactly
                    suited to his purpose; and he now directed his efforts to the obtaining of that
                    appointment. Neither Pompey nor Crassus seems to have penetrated his views; and
                    a secret but strict alliance was formed between these three powerful and
                    ambitious men, commonly known by the name of “the first triumvirate.” The
                    province of Gaul was allotted to Caesar for a term of five years, while Pompey
                    and Crassus remained at Rome; and the compact between Caesar and Pompey was
                    confirmed by the latter marrying the daughter of the former.</p>
                <p>To complete the triumph of the triumvirs over the independent party in the
                    senate, Cato was appointed to the government of Cyprus, and Cicero was banished
                    through the intrigues of the infamous Clodius, who had obtained permission to
                    relinquish his patrician rank, that he might be eligible for the tribuneship; an
                    example which was afterwards repeatedly followed by designing demagogues. After
                    having accomplished this object, Clodius became so troublesome even to his own
                    party, that to keep him in check, Pompey procured the recall of Cicero from
                    exile, which he could not effect without the strenuous aid of the tribune
                    Milo.</p>
                <p>In the mean time, Caesar had arrested the migration of the Helvetians, expelled
                    the Germans from Gaul, subdued the Belgae, the Aquitani, the Nervii, and other
                    warlike Gaulish nations, and had also both penetrated into Germany itself, and
                    crossed the sea to Britain, till then almost unknown to the Romans. By these
                    exploits he raised his military reputation to an equality with that of Pompey
                    himself, and formed a hardy and well-disciplined veteran army, entirely devoted
                    to his will. Nor was he inattentive to the course of events at Rome. He found
                    means to maintain his influence there to such a degree as to rouse the dormant
                    jealousy of his rivals, and almost to precipitate the struggle. A
                    reconciliation, however, took place; and he obtained a renewal of his command in
                    Gaul for another term of five years, while Crassus chose Syria for his province,
                    and Pompey Spain and Africa. Crassus appears to have chosen Syria for the
                    purpose of gratifying his passion for the acquisition of wealth; and Pompey
                    preferred those provinces which he could govern by his lieutenants, while he
                    remained at Rome to rule the republic.</p>
                <p>This new arrangement was not destined to a lengthened existence. On his arrival
                    in Asia, Crassus found himself compelled to enter into hostilities with the
                    Parthians, to whose vicinity the overthrow of Mithridates had extended the sway
                    of the republic in that continent. Even to the best of the Roman generals, the
                    Parthians would have proved a formidable foe; but Crassus was altogether
                    destitute of the military talents necessary for the conduct of such a war. His
                    army was entirely routed in Mesopotamia, and himself taken prisoner and put to
                    death soon after the battle, by the Parthian general Surena.</p>
                <p>About the same time died Caesar’s daughter, the wife of Pompey; and thus not only
                    was the triumvirate dissolved by the death of Crassus, but the alliance between
                    the two survivors was greatly weakened by the death of Julia, who had possessed
                    considerable influence over both her father and her husband. The period for the
                    termination of Caesar’s command in Gaul had nearly arrived; and all things
                    seemed to indicate the approach of a mortal crisis.</p>
                <p>Each party strove to throw on bis rival the odium of beginning the fatal contest;
                    and its actual commencement was for a time retarded by their mutual
                    machinations. At length it began by Caesar’s demanding permission to hold the
                    consulship while absent. This was strenuously opposed by Pompey, and advocated
                    by Caesar’s partizans, Curio, Marcus Antonius, and Quintus Cassius, tribunes of
                    the people. Curio succeeded in placing Pompey in what is termed, “a false
                    position,” by proposing that both he and Caesar should resign their offices and
                    retire into private life, which he averred that Caesar was willing to do.
                    Repeated but insincere offers were made by both parties for an accommodation;
                    but the senate at length passed a decree, commanding Caesar to disband his army
                    before a certain specified day, under the penalty of being declared a public
                    enemy. The two tribunes, Antony and Cassius, interposed their veto; but their
                    prerogative was violently set aside, and the decree passed by a large majority.
                    Upon this Antony and Cassius fled from the city disguised as slaves, and sought
                    refuge in the camp of Caesar, who shewed to his soldiers the tribunes thus
                    insulted by his enemies at Rome.</p>
                <p>The conduct of Caesar had hitherto appeared to be chiefly defensive, that of
                    Pompey and his party aggressive. It had now become necessary for Caesar either
                    to relinquish his long-cherished visions of ambition, or to become the
                    assailant. He had completely foreseen and anticipated the crisis. At the head of
                    but a small division of his army, not sufficient to create alarm, he had
                    approached the banks of the Rubico, the boundary of Italy proper, on the side of
                    Cisalpine Gaul, and which he could not cross in a hostile manner without avowing
                    himself a traitor to his country. His schemes were ripe for execution, his
                    enemies were thoroughly roused, concealment was no longer practicable, his
                    troops had declared their readiness to support their general and avenge the
                    wrongs of the tribunes, all things urged him to the crisis; but the dark
                    destinies of file fateful hour hung heavy upon Caesar’s spirit. <note

                    Caes. </p></note> He retired early from a supper where he had entertained some
                    of his principal officers, and paced to and fro on the banks of the Rubico, in
                    the deep silence of midnight, oppressed with thought. It probably was not the
                    ruin to himself, should he now hesitate, still less the perils of the
                    undertaking; it was the long, black, direful train of miseries that must sweep
                    remorselessly over his country and the world, all summed up, concentrated, and
                    rendered almost visibly present in the one simple and brief act of that most
                    awful hour, this it was that shook and appalled the heart of even the mighty
                    Caesar. He at length exclaimed, “the die is cast,” sprung furiously across the
                    slender stream, and spread to the morning breeze the banner of civil war.</p>

                <p>Before the close of that day Ariminum was seized by Caesar. With the speed of a
                    torrent, and the gathering strength of an Alpine avalanche, he advanced on Rome.
                    City after city opened its gates at his approach, their garrisons swelling the
                    number of his troops. Pompey and his party were paralyzed by his boldness, and
                    terror-struck by the celerity of his movements. They abandoned the city and fled
                    to Capua, leaving the public treasure behind them. Thence they fled to Greece,
                    without daring once to turn upon their swift pursuer. Corfinium alone seemed
                    disposed to make a show of resistance; but the garrison declared for Caesar, and
                    their commander, Domitius, surrendering at discretion, was treated with the
                    kindness due to an honourable foe. Caesar then retraced his course to Rome, and
                    entered it without opposition, having subdued all Italy in sixty days. He
                    assembled such members of the senate as had remained in the city; declared
                    himself driven to hostilities by the machinations of his enemies, yet still a
                    friend to the republic; seized upon the funds in the public treasury, and after
                    a short delay of six days, set out to attack Pompey’s lieutenants in Spain.</p>
                <p>In his march through Gaul he was joined by his veteran troops, at whose head he
                    had gained so much glory, and whom he had doubtless been training for that
                    enterprise in which he was now engaged. On his arrival in Spain he began a
                    series of manoeuvres surpassed by nothing in the history of war, for the purpose
                    of compelling Afranius and Petreius, not to a battle, hut to a capitulation of
                    their entire army, which he wished thus to preserve and make his ow n. This he
                    at length accomplished; and on his return through Gaul reduced Massilia, which
                    had till then held out against him. But these successes, where he commanded in
                    person, were somewhat counter-balanced by some severe defeats sustained by his
                    generals in Illyricum and Africa.</p>
                <p>Returning victorious to Rome, he was named dictator, a title which he soon
                    afterwards exchanged for that of consul; and after spending a short time in the
                    arrangement of public affairs, he prepared to sail for Greece, in order to bring
                    the struggle to a close, by encountering his great rival in person. Pompey had
                    assembled an immense army, drawn from the various Asiatic states where Roman
                    troops had been stationed; and his camp was dignified by the presence of great
                    numbers of the fugitive senate. Caesar with much difficulty and danger
                    transported his army from Brundusium to the vicinity of Dyracchium, where Pompey
                    was encamped. For some time the contest between these two great generals was a
                    war of tactics, each endeavour!ng toout-manoeuvre his antagonist, beforeputting
                    the final issue to the hazard of a decisive battle. As Pom-pey’s fleets had the
                    command of the sea, he was enabled to act on the defensive, without the danger
                    of falling short of provisions, to which Caesar was much exposed. Caesar
                    therefore used his utmost efforts to draw his adversary to a general engagement;
                    in which he had almost succeeded, when he was himself surprised, one division of
                    his army thrown into confusion, and the whole so greatly endangered, that
                    nothing but the most desperate efforts made by himself in person, prevented a
                    total rout.</p>
                <p>Soon after this hazardous encounter Caesar withdrew from Dyracchium, and marched
                    to Thessaly, where he had better access to both provisions and reinforcements.
                    He was followed by Pompey, who still abstained from battle, hoping to exhaust
                    his foe. But this wary policy of Pompey was disliked by the young nobility, who
                    longed for the fight, especially since their partial success at Dyracchium. At
                    length Pompey drew out his army on the plains of Pharsalia, and offered Caesar
                    the opportunity which he had so long sought, of deciding the empire of the
                    world. In this great battle the superior skill of Caesar was manifest. Being
                    deficient in cavalry, in which the strength of Pompey’s army lay, he altered the
                    usual form of drawing up the army in three lines, placing a fourth in reserve
                    for the support of his cavalry, with particular directions how to act. When the
                    signal was given, the troops of Caesar rushed on with their usual impetuosity;
                    those of Pompey stood still to receive the shock. The cavalry of Pompey at first
                    repulsed that of Caesar; but being unexpectedly assailed by the reserve, they
                    were thrown into confusion, and fled, leaving the flank of the main body
                    exposed, which was instantly assailed by Caesar’s victorious wing. This decided
                    the fate of the day. Pompey’s legions were thrown into irretrievable confusion,
                    driven to their camp, the entrenchments carried by storm, and the whole either
                    scattered over the country, or compelled to surrender at discretion. Caesar
                    finding the victory secure, hurried from place to place across the bloody field,
                    calling aloud to spare the Roman citizens; and all who yielded were treated with
                    the utmost clemency.</p>
                <p>Pompey, as if bereft of his usual courage and presence of mind, made no effort to
                    retrieve the fortunes of the day. He at first retired to his camp, and when its
                    entrenchments were forced, he fled in disguise from the scene not more of ruin
                    than of disgrace. He directed his course to the Aegean sea, purposing to renew
                    the war in Syria; but finding the Asiatic states not inclined to support what
                    they now deemed a falling cause, he altered his plan, and steered for Egypt,
                    having taken on board his wife Cornelia. When he drew near the Egyptian shore,
                    he found the young king besieging Pelusium, and sent intimation of his approach,
                    and of his intention of joining his forces with those of Egypt. The perfidious
                    Egyptians resolved to allure him on shore, and then put him to death, as the
                    safest mode of escaping the danger of his own resentment, if they should refuse
                    him succour, or that of his rival, if they should grant it. Achillas, the
                    commander of the Egyptian forces, and Septimius, a Roman soldier who had
                    formerly served under Pompey, proceeded in a boat to the galley to conduct him
                    to land. He left his vessel with strong forebodings of what might follow; and as
                    the boat drew near the shore, Septimius stabbed him in the back, and the others
                    falling upon him, completed the treacherous and bloody deed. The galley in which
                    he came had anchored so near the shore, that the murder of Pompey was distinctly
                    visible to those on board. The wild shriek of anguish raised by Cornelia as she
                    beheld her beloved husband fall, reached even to the shore; and on the instant,
                    the Roman galley cutting her cable, and putting to sea, escaped the pursuit of
                    the Egyptians. Thus perished Pompey the Great, a fugitive and alone on a
                    barbarian shore, after having held for many years a scarcely divided sway at
                    Rome, which he failed in making his exclusively and permanently, only because
                    his rival and antagonist was Caesar.</p>
                <p>Immediately after his victory at Pharsalia, Caesar commenced a close pursuit of
                    Pompey, knowing that the war could only end with his death or captivity. Tracing
                    the course of his defeated rival’s flight, he arrived at Alexandria, where he
                    not only received the tidings of his death, but the Egyptian messengers laid
                    before him the head and ring of Pompey. From these melancholy memorials of his
                    mighty rival Caesar turned away with strong shudderings, and with bursting tears
                    of pity; and gave orders that near Pompey’s tomb, a magnificent temple should be
                    erected to Nemesis. He next employed himself in settling the disputed claims for
                    the succession to the Egyptian throne, which he bestowed on the celebrated
                    Cleopatra, influenced more by the beauty of her person than the superiority of
                    her pretensions. While in Egypt, he was exposed to great danger, from an
                    insurrection of the dethroned king’s partisans; but the opportune arrival of his
                    forces enabled him completely to subdue it, and to establish the sovereignty of
                    Cleopatra. From Egypt he marched into Asia, against Pharnaces, son of
                    Mithridates the Great; and in the short space of thirty <pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:wu.89119129625&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=408" xml:id="kp-eb0719-0408-0398"
                    />days, completely annihilated his army, and subdued his dominions. It was in
                    giving an account of this brief war, that he used the famous words, <hi
                    rend="italic"> Veni, vidi, vici. “I</hi> came, saw, conquered.”</p>
                <p>During Caesar’s delay in Egypt, and expedition into Pontus, great disturbances
                    had broken out in Rome; to remedy which he repaired thither with his usual
                    promptitude and speed. Upon his arrival, he was again nominated dictator, and
                    strenuously applied himself to the reform of the abuses which had been committed
                    in his absence by ill-judging and intemperate partisans. No proscriptions
                    followed his arrival, no blood was shed, no injustice perpetrated; and this
                    clemency, so different from the conduct of Sylla and Ma fus, induced numbers of
                    the most distinguished men of what had been the independent party in the senate,
                    to return to Rome, and there to renew the semblance of a regular form of
                    government. He then turned his attention to Africa, where a strong body of his
                    antagonists had been drawn together by Cato and the sons of Pompey. The struggle
                    was severe, but not protracted. A decisive battle was fought at Thapsus, where
                    the Pompeian party were completely overthrown. Despair filled the hearts of the
                    routed leaders. Cato died by his own hand in Utica; Scipio, being intercepted in
                    his flight, stabbed himself and fell into the sea, while Caesar’s men were
                    boarding his galley; and Juba, king of Numidia, and his general Petreius, fell
                    by each other’s bands in single combat. The two sons of Pompey escaped and fled
                    to Spain, where they endeavoured once more to rekindle the embers of the
                    expiring war.</p>
                <p>Upon his return victorious from Africa, Caesar was received at Rome both by
                    senate and people with great adulation, and he celebrated his triumph with
                    uncommon pomp and splendour. He was again created dictator for ten years, and
                    honours were heaped on him with lavish hand. Again did he renew his acts of
                    clemency and generosity to all who had been opposed to him, thus confirming his
                    popularity and consolidating his [lower.</p>
                <p>But Pompey’s sons, Cneius and Sextus, having collected a considerable force in
                    Spain, Caesar found himself once more obliged to quit Rome. The two armies met
                    in the plains of Munda, and prepared for the final struggle with all the energy
                    of hope on the one side, and on the other of despair. So furious was the
                    conflict, that Caesar was compelled to put himself at the head of his favourite
                    tenth legion, and to fight as a common soldier, not for victory merely, but for
                    life. Victory at length declared for him; a vast number of his most eminent and
                    determined enemies fell in the battle, or in the flight, and among the latter
                    was the eldest son of Pompey. With this sanguinary conflict the war was at once
                    terminated, and Caesar returned in full triumph to Rome.</p>
                <p>Having now completed the subversion of the republic, Caesar assumed the undivided
                    sway of Rome, although he tolerated the continuation of the forms of republican
                    government. In his own person he concentrated those offices which were requisite
                    for the conduct of public affairs, such as the dictatorship, the consulate, and
                    the offices of tribune, censor, and pontifex maximus. Thus possessed of all
                    authority and power, he commenced a number of reforms, improvements, and public
                    works of utility, which did honour to his genius, his judgment, and his spirit
                    of enterprise. He reformed the calendar, and undertook to drain the Pontine
                    marshes, to deepen the channel of the Tiber, to form a capacious harbour at
                    Ostia, to cut a canal through the isthmus of Corinth, and to revenge the defeat
                    of Crassus, by an expedition against the Parthians. In the midst of these
                    schemes and undertakings he gave offence to the senate by his haughtiness, and
                    to the people by his too evident assumption of regal dignity, and almost of the
                    regal title. They could better brook the loss of liberty in reality than in
                    appearance; they retained their love of the form of the republic, when its
                    spirit was gone; they could not endure the name of king, while they were willing
                    to submit to real monarchy under the name of a perpetual dictatorship.</p>
                <p>Influenced by these feelings, a large body of the senators began to regard Caesar
                    as an usurper, and many even of the people, who had formerly supported him as
                    their leader against the aristocratic party, became also disaffected. Mark
                    Antony’s offer of a crown at the feast of the Lupercalia, put forth in all
                    probability for the purpose of ascertaining the bias of the popular mind, was
                    met by such decided disapprobation, as to cause Caesar himself to hesitate, and
                    to wait for a more propitious juncture for the completion of his designs.
                    Meanwhile, a conspiracy was formed for his destruction, and at the head of it
                    were Brutus and Cassius, who had both experienced his clemency and additional
                    marks of his favour. After having narrowly escaped detection, they resolved to
                    strike the blow in the senate-house itself, on the ides of March. No sooner had
                    he taken his seat than the conspirators crowded round him, preferring various
                    requests, and one of them, apparently in extreme urgency, seized him by the
                    robe. At this preconcerted signal, they all rushed upon him with their daggers,
                    and Caesar, perceiving resistance fruitless, muffled up his head in his mantle,
                    and fell at the base of Pompey’s statue, pierced by three-and-twenty wounds. At
                    this moment, Brutus waved aloft his bloody dagger, hailed the senate, and in
                    particular Cicero, and proclaimed aloud the recovered liberty of Rome.</p>
                <p>But instead ofjoy and gratitude, a general terror pervaded the senate and the
                    citizens. They had felt secure in the well-known clemency and the settled power
                    of Caesar; they knew not what scenes of anarchy and bloodshed might follow his
                    death, nor what might be the temper of his successor in the chief power. A dull
                    dead calm brooded over the city for some days; till, on the day of Caesar’s
                    funeral, Antony inflamed the smouldering passions of the populace to such a
                    degree, that they burst into the senate house, tore up its benches, and raised
                    an immense funeral pile for the body, sacked in their fury the houses of the
                    conspirators, and wreaked their vengeance on al I of that party whom they could
                    seize. Alarmed by these proceedings, the chief conspirators fled from the city,
                    and prepared to vindicate their deed, and defend the republic by arms.</p>
                <p>Previously to this tumult, Antony had concurred with Brutus and Cassius in
                    passing an act of amnesty, granting forgiveness to all who had been implicated
                    in any of the former proceedings. But having stirred up the populace, and being
                    joined by Octavianus, or Octavms, the grand-nephew and heir of Caesar, he now
                    entered boldly on his turbulent and ambitious career. Brutus and Cassius retired
                    to Macedonia and Syria, to which provinces they had been appointed, leaving
                    Italy in the power of Antony and Octvaius. A jealousy soon arose between these
                    two leaders of the revolutionary party; and Octavius joining the senate, Antony
                    retired into Gaul, raised an army, and came to an engagement with the two
                    consuls near Mutina, where he was defeated, but both the consuls fell in battle.
                    Antony fled to Spain, and joined Lepidus; but before renewing the war, he
                    represented to Octavius that their hostilities would only secure the triumph of
                    the senate and the conspirators. In consequence of this suggestion, Octavius,
                    Antony, and Lepidus, came to an interview in a small island in the river
                    Lavinus, not far from the modem city Bologna, and there formed a confederacy,
                    called the “second triumvirate.” In the course of their proceedings, these three
                    ruthless men drew up a list of those whom they wished to be put to death, each,
                    without compunction, permitting relation or friend to be proscribed, if required
                    by the others. This bloody proscription was followed by the murder of not less
                    than 300 senators, and 2000 of the equestrian order. Among the former was the
                    illustrious Cicero, whose death was occa<pb break="no"

                    />sioned by his invectives against the dissolute and infamous Clodius, and the
                    unprincipled and tyrannical Antony.</p>
                <p>Soon after the formation of this blood-cemented compact, Octavius and Antony
                    prepared to wage war against Brutus and Cassius, who had combined their forces,
                    and were in Macedonia. The rival armies met near Philippi; and two separate
                    battles were fought before the victory was decided. In the first, the division
                    commanded by Cassius was defeated; and he, thinking the battle lost, slew
                    himself in despair. Brutus, however, had been victorious with his division; and
                    the two antagonist armies, rallying each on its unbroken half, remained ready
                    for another trial of strength. This took place within about twenty days after
                    the first, and on nearly the same ground. The struggle was fierce, obstinate,
                    and bloody; but at length the troops of Brutus gave way, fled, and were
                    scattered in total rout and dismay. Brutus, disdaining to survive this, the last
                    convulsive effort of the republic, fell on his own sword, and died. The conduct
                    of Octavius and Antony, after their victory, bore a greater resemblance to that
                    of Sylla and Marius, than of Caesar, whose memory they would have more honoured
                    by imitating his clemency, than by a bloody revenge of his death.</p>
                <p>The utter ruin of the republican party was followed by a period of disgraceful
                    intrigues, jarrings, and contests, among the usurpers, and their corrupt friends
                    and followers. Antony traversed Greece, and part of Asia, luxuriating in the
                    pomp, the homage, the flatteries, and the voluptuousness of the East. At one
                    time he meditated a war against the Parthians, to redeem the fame of Rome, which
                    had been tarnished by the defeat of Crassus; but meeting with Cleopatra, he
                    abandoned his dreams of glory, and resigned himself to the debasing delights of
                    loose licentiousness, beneath the syren spell of this abandoned beauty.</p>
                <p>Octavius, on the other hand, returned to Italy, and prosecuted his deep-laid
                    schemes for securing the sole possession of despotic power. He was repeatedly
                    disturbed by the intrigues and the violence of Lucius, the brother, and Fulvia,
                    the wife, of Antony; but at last, the rupture having come to an open war, they
                    were defeated; their chief strength, Perusia, was taken, and Octavius secured in
                    the undisturbed command of Italy. The tidings of this contest drew Antony from
                    Egypt, and a war between him and Octavius seemed on the point of breaking out.
                    At this juncture Fulvia died; and instead of a war, a new alliance was formed
                    between the jealous triumvirs, Antony receiving in marriage Octavia, the sister
                    of Octavius. In this new division of the Roman dominions, Sextus Pompey was
                    admitted to a participation.</p>
                <p>But their hollow agreement was of no long duration. New jealousies arose between
                    Octavius and Lepidus, and new wars with Pompey. Being defeated by Octavius,
                    Sextus Pompey fled to Asia, and was there slain by one of Antony’s lieutenants.
                    Lepidus was soon afterwards deprived of his share in the triumvirate; and Antony
                    and Octavius divided the whole power between them. Little cordiality subsisted
                    between these partners, or rather rivals; but a decided quarrel was delayed in
                    consequence of their distance from each other, and the different regions in
                    which they sought for an extension of fame and dominion. Antony was still
                    desirous of triumphing over the Parthians, but he met with little success,
                    except where his troops were led by Ventidius. Octavius 'found employment for
                    his legions in Dalmatia and Pannonia, into which the arms of Rome had scarcely
                    before penetrated. At length the conduct of Antony thoroughly disgusted all his
                    friends at Rome. Octavia set out for the East, hoping to recall her husband to
                    some sense of his duty to Rome, to her, and to himself; but the infatuated man,
                    unable to break through the fascinations of Cleopatra, refused to see Octavia,
                    ordered her to return home, and even sent her a divorce. This insult Octavius
                    could not brook. Antony was deprived of his consulship by a decree of the
                    senate, and both parties prepared for another war.</p>
                <p>Mutual jealousy had long anticipated such a contest, and they were both in
                    readiness at once to rush to the arbitration of arms. The forces of Antony were
                    the more numerous; those of Octavius the better disciplined, and led by generals
                    of great skill and judgment. Their armaments, both military and naval, came
                    within sight of each other on the opposite sides of the entrance to the gulf of
                    Ambrasia in Epirus. For some time they remained comparatively inactive, watching
                    each other’s movements. At length the two hostile fleets met off the promontory
                    of Actium, that of Octavius led by Agriopa, that of Antony by himself and
                    Cleopatra. The battle began, in sight of the land forces on either side, and was
                    continued with equal courage and fortune, till Cleopatra, terrified by the
                    dreadful scene, turned her galley and fled, followed by sixty of the Egyptian
                    vessels, and soon after by Antony himself. The deserted fleet of Antony
                    maintained a brave resistance for some hours after his flight; but at length was
                    completely overpowered and destroyed, three hundred ships being sunk or taken,
                    and the whole strand covered with wrecks, and the bodies of the dead. For
                    several days the army of Antony could not believe that he had deserted them; and
                    remained in anxious expectation of his arrival, to renovate his fortunes on a
                    more stable element. When at last assured of his flight, they entered into terms
                    with the victor, who was now undisputed lord of both sea and land.</p>
                <p>After this fatal battle, Antony continued his flight to Egypt, a prey at once to
                    shame and to ungovernable rage. For some time he refused to see Cleopatra, whom
                    he accused of having caused his overthrow. But having exhausted his wrath, he
                    returned to the embrace of the ensnaring syren, and again gave himself up to the
                    excesses of voluptuous enjoyment. Meanwhile, the cautious Octavius was drawing
                    his toils closer around his victim. The defences of Egypt were taken or
                    surrendered; and in a short time Antony was reduced to such straits, that he
                    could neither fight nor fly. Hemmed in, deserted by bis own troops, suspicious
                    of the Egyptians, distracted by jealousy and rage, he lost all self-control,
                    bursting into tierce gusts of frantic passion, then sinking into the stupor of
                    despair. Even Cleopatra became alarmed with these storms of the furious madman,
                    and caused a report to be spread that she was dead. This report roused the Roman
                    in the heart of Antony; and having nothing now on earth to love, and the path of
                    ambition being closed, he threw himself on his own sword, but failed to inflict
                    a wound immediately mortal. While struggling in the agonies of death, he was
                    told that Cleopatra was still alive. Somewhat reviving at this intelligence, he
                    caused himselfto be carried into the presence of Cleopatra, where, calling for a
                    draught of wine, and fixing his eyes on the fascinating woman, for whose sake he
                    had lost the world, he expired.</p>
                <p>Octavius was now left without a rival, sole master of the Roman world. On seeing
                    the body of Antony he betrayed some emotion; but gave orders that the utmost
                    attention should be paid to Cleopatra, and especially that she should be
                    prevented from dying by her own hand, as he was anxious that she should adorn
                    his triumphat Rome. She seems to have cherished the hope of gaining the same
                    influence over him that she had enjoyed over Caesar and Antony; but the cold and
                    passionless temper of Octavius was proof against her blandishments. Disappointed
                    in this expectation, and dreading the disgrace of being led in captivity to
                    adorn the triumph <hi rend="italic">of</hi> her conqueror, she eluded the
                    vigilance of her Roman guards, and having imbibed poison, either from the bite
                    of an asp, or from the point of an envenomed needle, death rescued her from that
                    indignity.</p>
                <p>Egypt was then reduced to the form of a Roman province; and its immense wealth
                    was transported to Rome to replenish the exhausted treasury, and to pay the
                    troops by whom the conquest was thus achieved. Soon after his return to Rome,
                    Octavius received from the senate the ap<pb break="no"

                    history; and by an unanimous vote, they committed to him the entire government
                    of the state. With this vote ended the Roman republic; and from this period was

                <p>Augustus Caesar now found himself possessed of the undisputed sovereignty of

                    bestow upon him all titles, honours, and privileges which he could desire. He
                    had before him the contrasted fates of Sylla and of Caesar; the former of whom
                    died in peace after relinquishing the perpetual dictatorship, the latter was
                    slain when in its full enjoyment. For a time, it is said, he hesitated whether
                    to retire, like Sylla, into private life, or to retain imperial power; but by
                    the sage advice of the politic Maecenas, his chief favourite, he was persuaded
                    to retain it, and merely to govern under republican forms, though possessing a
                    real and absolute monarchy. In consequence of the same advice, he laid aside the
                    dictatorship, as too manifestly despotic, was annually chosen consul, and
                    finally received the consular power in perpetuity; and by being created
                    perpetual tribune, his person was rendered sacred and inviolable, which gave a
                    conventional security, at least to his life, and led to the enactment of the <hi
                    rend="italic"> judicia majestatis,</hi> or accusations of <hi rend="italic">
                    high treason.</hi> As imperator he retained the command of all the forces; and
                    by assuming the censorship and the pontificate, he became possessed of the right
                    of raising or depressing in rank, and of regulating every thing that depended
                    upon religious ceremonies.</p>
                <p>This supreme dominion, which his own power would have enabled him to seize and
                    perpetuate, he pretended to be unwilling to retain, and made an offer in the
                    senate of laying it down. This they requested him not to do; and upon their
                    urgent entreaties, he consented to retain it for a period of ten years; on the
                    expiration of which, the same form was repeated, and a similar prolongation
                    conferred. This example, followed by succeeding emperors, gave rise to the <hi
                    rend="italic"> sacra decennalia,</hi> festivals celebrated at every renewal of
                    the imperial authority. It is not necessary to imagine that this decree of the
                    senate was entirely the result of slavish submission to absolute power. Many of
                    the senators could still remember the horrors of those contentions for supremacy
                    which had taken place in the times of Marius and Sylla, and of the two
                    triumvirates, and might be really apprehensive of equal convulsions and
                    bloodshed, should he abdicate his power, and thus re-open the sources of
                    contention, anarchy, and bloodshed. The wiser of them might see, that there did
                    not now survive enough of republican virtue to render a republic any longer
                    possible, and as Augustus, after the fall of all his antagonists, had displayed
                    a great degree of mildness and clemency, they might fairly conclude, that his
                    government was the best of which Rome was then capable, and might therefore
                    desire its perpetuity, as the best method of securing the welfare of the empire.
                    On his own part, his character had begun to assume an aspect very different from
                    what it bore at the beginning of his ambitious career. At that time, its chief
                    element appeared to be cold, remorseless cruelty; now it became mild, placable,
                    benignant, alike respectful to the senate, and benevolent to the people. The
                    truest patriot might therefore be most earnest in desiring the continuance of
                    his power, however it might have been acquired.</p>
                <p>But while Augustus received equal manifestations of attachment from the senate
                    and the people, he was sufficiently “ware, that to the army he owed his
                    elevation, and that its favour must be secured. It could neither be disbanded
                    nor retained in one place and body, with due regard to safety. Following the
                    example of Sylla, he dispersed his veterans over Italy, settling them in
                    thirty-two colonies, to make room for which, the former proprietors were in many
                    instances dispossessed of their property. The settlement of one of these
                    colonies near Mantua, was the cause of Virgil’s removal to Rome. Eight entire
                    legions were posted on the Rhine, four on the Danube, three in Spain, and one in
                    Dalmatia. Eight more were stationed in Asia and Africa. The whole standing army
                    of the empire amounted to upwards of one hundred and seventy thousand men. There
                    were also quartered in Rome and its vicinity twelve cohorts, amounting to about
                    ten thousand men; nine of these, called the praetorian bands, were intended as
                    the imperial body-guard, the rest for the garrison of the city. These praetorian
                    cohorts afterwards became not the guards merely, but also the dispensers of
                    imperial power. Two powerful fleets were also maintained, the one in the
                    Adriatic sea, the other for the protection of the western Mediterranean. As
                    Augustus still allowed the senate a nominal share in the government, the
                    appointment of lieutenants for the administration of affairs in some of the
                    provinces was left to them, the others he himself retained; but as the imperial
                    provinces were those on the frontiers of the empire, where the troops were
                    stationed, the armies constituting the real power were still under his command.
                    The financial affairs of Rome he also arranged anew, taking care to cause the
                    treasures of the empire to flow chiefly into his own private and military
                    coffers. At this period, the state revenue of Rome is computed to have amounted
                    to upwards of forty millions of our money. These revenues were drawn chiefly
                    from tithes charged on conquered lands, tribute and customs from provinces,
                    crown lands, taxations amounting to a twentieth upon inheritances, and fines of
                    different kinds imposed by different laws. Of these the tributes and customs
                    from the provinces, and the rental of the crown lands, were by far the most
                    productive, directing the main stream of wealth into the imperial treasury.</p>
                <p>The internal administration of affairs being thus arranged, Augustus had leisure
                    to attend to its enlargement, by conquests on the frontier. Nor were these
                    inconsiderable. Western Gaul, and the mountainous districts in the north of
                    Spain, were completely subdued. An expedition into Armenia, if of little
                    consequence in itself, was nevertheless very gratifying to Roman pride, by being
                    the means of recovering from the Parthians the standards that had been lost in
                    the unfortunate campaign of Crassus. In Africa, the boundaries of the empire
                    were extended into very remote regions, productive however of little else but
                    empty fame. But the most important of these conquests was that of the regions
                    south of the Danube, Rhaetia, the country of the Vindelici, and Noricum, as well
                    as Pannonia, and afterwards Moesia. The arms of Augustus could not, however,
                    penetrate far into Germany, defended as it was both by the determined valour of
                    its inhabitants, and by its extensive forests and marshes. The chief successes
                    in Germany were ρb-tained by the valour and skill of Tiberius and Drusus Nero,
                    especially the latter, sons of the empress Livia by her former husband. A peace
                    being at length concluded with the Germans, and Augustus not being desirous of
                    extending his dominions beyond the territories over which he had obtained
                    complete possession, and which were comprised within well-defined boundaries,
                    the world obtained repose, and with great rejoicing, the temple of Janus was
                    formally closed, to intimate the existence of universal peace.</p>
                <p>During this period of general tranquillity, when the world was at rest, and a
                    deep calm was brooding over the nations, in this “fulness of the times,” there
                    was born at Bethlehem in Judaea, of the lineage of David, the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Prince of Peace,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">Saviour of the World,</hi> whose
                    coming thus brought with it <pb break="no"

                    />both a foretaste and earnest of what it was destined to secure, “on earth
                    peace, and good-will towards men.”</p>
                <p>But this universal calm was of brief duration. The Roman forces in Germany had
                    been entrusted to the command of Quintilius Varus, who exercised his power in a
                    harsh and oppressive manner. This the high-spirited Germans could not brook, and
                    a revolt was planned and executed under the management of Arminius (Herman), who
                    succeeded in drawing the Roman army into a position in which they could neither
                    fight nor fly. Varus himself, with three legions and six cohorts, perished on
                    the field, or in an ineffectual attempt to secure a retreat. The destruction of
                    this army preyed deeply on the spirits of Augustus, who nevertheless exerted
                    himself to remedy the disaster, by sending first Tiberius, and then Germanicus,
                    the son of Drusus, into Germany, at the head of a more numerous force. These
                    German wars were continued with more or less vigour throughout the remainder of
                    the reign of Augustus, and with more or less success, generally under the brave
                    and skilful command of Germanicus, who acquired for himself a very brilliant
                    renown, and the esteem of the whole empire.</p>
                <p>In addition to these public troubles, Augustus suffered great affliction from the
                    misconduct and the calamities of his family. Not having a son to succeed him in
                    the empire, his wife Livia engaged in the most restless intrigues to secure the
                    succession to her own children by her former husband. Augustus, on the other
                    hand, destined the empire to Marcellus, his nephew and son-in-law, to whom he
                    had given in marriage his only daughter Julia. Upon the early death of
                    Marcellus, a youth of high promise in every respect, Augustus manifested his
                    intention of leaving the empire to his grandsons, the sons of Julia by Agrippa,
                    to whom she had been married after the death of Marcellus. He gave them the
                    title of “princes of the youth ;” and this undisguised favour so much offended
                    Tiherius, that he withdrew from the court. The premature death of the two young
                    princes, not without suspicion of having been poisoned by the empress Livia, to
                    make way for her own son, cat∙ed the recall of Tiberius. Augustus bestowed upon
                    him his daughter Julia, the widow of Marcellus and Agrippa, requiring him at the
                    same time to adopt Drusus Germanicus, the son of his brother Drusus. The
                    infamously licentious conduct of Julia at length so much disgusted her father,
                    that he banished her to the island of Pandataria. Thus harassed by domestic
                    troubles, the master of the world found that imperial power could not secure
                    happiness, or lessen one of the pangs that waste the weary heart. He was seized
                    with a dangerous illness while at Naples, and becoming worse while on his
                    return, was unable to reach Rome, but expired at Nola, in the seventy-sixth year
                    of his age, after having swayed the sceptre of imperial power during forty-four
                    years.</p>
                <p>The vacant throne was now ascended by Tiberius Claudius Nero, son of Livia, and
                    latterly adopted son of Augustus. Almost the first act of Tiberius was to secure
                    the empire by causing the murder of Agrippa Posthumus, the third son of Agrippa
                    by Julia, thus completing the bloody policy by which his mother had opened his
                    way to the sovereignty. He was in his fifty-sixth year when he succeeded to the
                    empire; and though he had given evidence of the possession of by no means
                    contemptible talents in his younger days, especially in his German wars, he had
                    so long practised the arts of dissimulation and guile, that all his better mind
                    seemed to have perished, and his baser qualities alone remained, or rather to
                    have been stimulated into unnatural strength. Though now possessed of absolute
                    power, he still continued to practise the subtle wiles of a. dark and crooked
                    policy, and to seek to accomplish by deceit what he could easily have done by
                    strength. The murder of young Agrippa removed the most formidable rival; but the
                    high renown of his nephew Germanicus, then waging suc cessful war in the country
                    whence he acquired his name, excited at once his envy, his hatred, and his fear;
                    and he recalled him, on pretence of giving him the honours of a triumph. The
                    residence of Germanicus at Rome could not long be endured by Tiberius; he was
                    therefore sent into Syria, to quell the disorders of the east. Along with him
                    were sent Piso and his wife, whose secret directions may be conjectured from
                    their actual conduct, which was to harass him by every means in their power; and
                    when he died, there were not wanting pregnant causes of suspicion that his death
                    had been hastened by poison. The death of Germanicus was deplored by the whole
                    Roman people, as a great public calamity, which none seemed more to deplore than
                    Tiberius, while he inwardly rejoiced in the success of his atrocious
                    villany.</p>
                <p>In public life Tiberius was equally deceitful and cruel as he had been in
                    private, and to his own relatives. Towards the senate he professed great
                    respect, at the very time when he was depriving them of even the slender power
                    which Augustus had left. Any remains of public virtue, wdfich the senate had
                    hitherto possessed, died rapidly away; and ceasing to exercise an independent
                    authority in a free state, it became the passive instrument of the most brutal
                    tyranny. Every deceitful person is necessarily at the same time suspicious. Full
                    of guile himself, the dark-hearted emperor suspected every other man to be
                    equally guileful. Hence his encouragement of innumerable spies and informers,
                    who were ready fabricators of accusations, when they could detect no real
                    criminality. The constant terrors of the suspicious tyrant increased his natural
                    cruelty, till he ripened into a perfect monster of barbarity, delighting to glut
                    his eyes with the agonies of his tortured victims.</p>
                <p>But the most suspicious of tyrants must trust some person, were it but to have an
                    instrument to execute their crimes; and as none but abandoned persons can be
                    their instruments, they never trust without being betrayed. Tiberius reposed his
                    chief confidence on Sejanus, praefect of the praetorian guard, a man whose
                    crimes, if possible, surpassed those of the emperor himself. For eight
                    successive years did Sejanus retain an undivided influence over the mind of
                    Tiberius; and during that period he contrived to procure the death or banishment
                    of almost every person who might have checked his progress to the possession of
                    imperial power, which was the object of his treacherous ambition. The death of
                    Drusus, the emperor’s son, is attributed to Sejanus, as also the death of the
                    two eldest sons of Germanicus, and the banishment of their mother Agrippina. The
                    youngest son probably escaped in consequence of his almost constant residence
                    with' the army. But the master-stroke of policy by which Sejanus strove to
                    secure his object, was his persuading the emperor to remove from the cares and
                    dangers of Rome, and to indulge his passions in a retirement where he would have
                    none around him but his depraved ministers of vice. Tiberius retired to Capreae,
                    where he abandoned himself to the perpetration of the most disgusting and
                    unnatural vices, leaving Sejanus at Rome, in the possession of all but the name
                    of imperial power. To this base and bloody favourite the senate displayed the
                    utmost servility; the people gave him honours second only to those of the
                    emperor; and the sceptre itself seemed on the point of passing into his grasp,
                    when he was accused to Tiberius of plotting his death. The imperial dissembler
                    conferred the consulship on Sejanus; and by the messenger who conveyed this
                    honour, sent a letter to the senate, accusing him of treason. When Sejanus came
                    to the senate to receive his official dignity, he met his accusation, was
                    instantly condemned, dragged through the streets, and put to death with the
                    utmost ignominy by those who a few hours before followed him with
                    acclamations.</p>
                <p>The fall of Sejanus seemed only to increase the suspicions and the barbarous
                    cruelty of the debauched and monstrous <pb break="no"

                    />tyrant. He felt he had no friend; he knew he could not be loved; he was
                    content to be hated, provided he were feared. At length, feeling the approach of
                    death, he named as his successor Caius Caligula, the only surviving son of his
                    murdered nephew Germanicus. Still, though consciously dying, the consummate
                    dissembler strove to deceive not only his courtiers, but even his physicians.
                    Pretending to feel a restoration of health and strength, he made a sumptuous
                    feast, and continued at table, as if in the height of enjoyment, till he was
                    seized with a fainting fit which threatened to be mortal. His courtiers forsook
                    him in haste to flock to Caligula; but Tiberius reviving, they became alarmed
                    lest he should recover, and Macro, the captain of the guard, smothered the
                    helpless wretch, whose fate was thus hastened by the recoil of his own deceit
                    and cruelty.</p>
                <p>Caius Caesar Caligula (so surnamed from the common military buskins, <hi
                    rend="italic"> caligoe,</hi> which he was accustomed to wear), was joyously
                    welcomed to the throne by both the senate and the people, on account of the deep
                    love and regard still cherished for the memory of his father Germanicus. His
                    first acts served to confirm the hopes which had been entertained of him. He
                    liberated all the state prisoners, and drove from the court and senate all the
                    spies and informers whom Tiberius had employed. His voyage to the islands of
                    Pandataria and Pontia in the midst of tempestuous weather, to remove the ashes
                    of his mother and brothers, seemed also an amiable proof of a sincere filial and
                    fraternal piety. He restored some of the most equitable of the decrees of
                    Augustus, which Tiberius had repealed, and gave other proofs of his intention to
                    act in all respects for the promotion of the public welfare. But these hopeful
                    symptoms were doomed to suffer an early and a fatal blight. He had been only
                    about eight months on the throne when he was seized with a severe and dangerous
                    illness, from which he recovered, so far as bodily health was concerned; but his
                    mental sanity appears to have sustained an irremediable shock.</p>
                <p>From that time forward, animal passions of the fiercest kind domineered over him
                    uncontrolled, or, if not animal passions merely, with no more of intellect than
                    was enough to render them fearfully malevolent. To enumerate his crimes would be
                    too hideously revolting, so utterly and excessively unnatural were· the murders,
                    the incests, and the brutalities in which this insane, or demon-possessed
                    monster revelled. Murder was his daily amusement; and he took a fiendish delight
                    in witnessing the dying pangs of his victims, whose sufferings he strove to
                    protract, that they might, as he said, “feel themselves dying.” He assumed
                    divine honours, erected a temple to himself, and instituted a college of
                    priests, to superintend the worship of the new god. He likewise deified one of
                    his sisters; and on her death, it was equally dangerous to rejoice in her
                    divinity, and to mourn for her death. It was customary for him to invite his
                    favourite horse to sup with him; and he was only prevented by death from raising
                    the animal to the dignity of consul. His prodigality was equally extravagant
                    with his other crimes. In one year he expended the almost boundless wealth which
                    had been accumulated by Tiberius, in shows of the most lavish and wasteful kind.
                    One of these was a vast bridge of vessels at Puteoli, across an arm of the sea,
                    three miles and a half broad, and so formed as to resemble a street at Rome. A
                    feverish dream of military glory next seized his distempered brain; and he made
                    great preparations for an expedition against the Germans. Like all his
                    undertakings, it ended in consummate folly. Instead of conquering Germany, he
                    led his army to the sea-shore at Boulogne in France, drew out his troops in
                    order of battle, then causing them to fill their helmets with shells, which he
                    termed the spoils of the ocean, he returned to Rome, and demanded from the
                    senate the honours of a triumph for his warlike exploits.</p>
                <p>Rome at length grew sick of enduring the frantic guilt and reckless tyranny of
                    Caligula. A conspiracy was formed against him, and he was assassinated by
                    Cassius Chaerea and Cornelius Sabinus, two officers of the praetorian guards.
                    His body was allowed to lie for some time exposed to public contumely, but was
                    finally thrown into a grave, without any marks of honour or respect. His wife
                    and infant child were also slain by the conspirators, who thought thus to secure
                    themselves against the danger of future punishment.'</p>
                <p>Upon the death of Caligula, the senate began to cherish hopes of altogether
                    abolishing the imperial power, and restoring, if not a republican, at least an
                    aristocratic form of government. But the populace had too long enjoyed the
                    donations of grain, and the amusements of the amphitheatre, supplied to them by
                    dictators and emperors, to be disposed to favour a restoration of power to the
                    senate. And the praetorian cohorts, stationed on the Quirinal hill, were too
                    well aware that the continuation of their power depended upon the continuation
                    of a monarchy, to be willing to tolerate any such revolution. Numbers of the
                    conspirators, or those who were suspected to be such, were slain by the excited
                    populace and the soldiers; and when the soldiers accidentally discovered
                    Tiberius Claudius, brother of Germanicus, and uncle of the late emperor, they
                    dragged him from his hiding place, and resolved to raise him to the vacant
                    throne. The senate found it impossible to resist; and thus a person who had
                    hitherto passed his life in unregarded obscurity, despised on account of his
                    mental imbecility, was placed at the head of the empire. Thus raised to the
                    throne by the power of the praetorian guards, Claudius set the pernicious custom
                    of rewarding their deed by granting them a donative. This weak man was governed,
                    as usually happens, by worthless favourites, and abandoned women. The infamous
                    conduct of the empress Messalina has rendered her name proverbial; and her
                    cruelty and rapacity were as unbounded as her licentiousness. At her
                    instigation, it was but too common for the emperor to put to death some of the
                    most wealthy of the nobles, and to confiscate their estates, with the money
                    arising from which she pampered her numerous paramours. To such a pitch of
                    unblushing effrontery did this abandoned woman proceed, that she at length
                    openly married Silius, a noble youth, one of the partners of her crimes,
                    purposing to complete her guilt by the murder of the emperor; but Claudius
                    having received private information, gave orders for her death, and she was
                    slain in the gardens which she had so long polluted by her unequalled
                    criminality.</p>
                <p>Messalina had accompanied Claudius in an expedition to Britain, and given birth
                    to a son named Britannicus, whom he exhibited to the army as his destined
                    successor in the empire. This expedition was occasioned by the previous success
                    of one led by the praetor Aulus Plautius, and by Vespasian, who, after a
                    succession of severe battles, subdued all the country south of the Thames. After
                    the emperor’s return to Rome, Ostorius Scapula continued to conduct the war in
                    Britain with great vigour and success, extended the province to the banks of the
                    Severn, and finally succeeded in taking prisoner the celebrated Caractacus, or
                    Ca-radoc, who had so long withstood the power of Rome. The native grandeur of
                    soul displayed by this comparatively rude hero, excited in the mind of Claudius
                    so much admiration, that he ordered his fetters to be struck off, and treated
                    him with the most marked distinction.</p>
                <p>The fall of Messalina was brought about in a great measure through the
                    intervention of Narcissus, the emperor’s freedman, who, alongwith Pallas,
                    another manumitted slave, engrossed the chief favour of the weak-minded
                    sovereign of Rome. The power wielded by this race of men, was a new feature in
                    the degeneracy of the imperial court, but <pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:wu.89119129625&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=413" xml:id="kp-eb0719-0413-0403"
                    />one which thenceforward was but too common, and as baneful as it was
                    disgraceful. In men of this denomination, there was almost of necessity the most
                    complete blending of abject sycophancy to the emperor, with despotic tyranny and
                    insolence to all his subjects.</p>
                <p>Not long after the death of Messalina, Claudius married his own niece, Agrippina,
                    daughter of Germanicus, a woman of strong natural abilities, but of insatiable
                    avarice, extreme ambition, and remorseless cruelty. Her influence over the
                    feeble emperor was boundless, and was displayed in the most glaringly
                    ostentatious manner. She prevailed on him at last to set aside his own son
                    Britannicus, and to adopt her son, Domitius Ahenobarbus, by her former husband,
                    giving him the name by which he is best known, Nero, and constituting him heir
                    to the imperial throne. To secure the succession in this channel, she gained
                    over Burrhus, praefect of the praetorian bands, to whom she entrusted the charge
                    of the youthful aspirant, thus giving him a reason to maintain his fidelity to
                    one over whom he was sure to obtain influence. But Claudius having shewn some
                    disposition to change the succession, and to restore it to Britannicus,
                    Agrippina caused him to be poisoned by one of his own slavish favourites. His
                    death was concealed by the empress till she had completed all her machinations
                    for securing the throne to her son, who was then produced to receive the
                    congratulations of his subjects.</p>
                <p>Nero Claudius Caesar, through the devices of his mother, and by the support of
                    the praetorian guard, ascended the vacant throne at the early age of seventeen.
                    During the first four or five years of his reign, he acted generally under the
                    advice of his tutor, Seneca the philosopher, and Burrhus, praefect of the
                    praetorian guard, and for that period he maintained a comparatively favourable
                    character. The turbulent and ambitious conduct of his mother gave him great
                    annoyance; and the opposition which she experienced from Seneca and Burrhus,
                    together with the mortification of perceiving the rapid decline of her influence
                    over her son, served only to stimulate her to more dangerous and wicked conduct.
                    She threatened to excite a revolution in behalf of Britannicus, son of the late
                    emperor; and this was the signal for the murder of the unfortunate youth, by the
                    orders of Nero. The depravity of Nero was now beginning to shew itself. Poppaea
                    Sabina, a woman of infamous character but of great beauty, had acquired greater
                    influence over him than was possessed by either his mother or his sage
                    counsellors, Seneca and Burrhus. A hideous rivalry began between this aspiring
                    woman and Agrippina. To secure her influence, Poppaea instigated Nero to the
                    murder of his mother; and to recover her power, Agrippina began to amass wealth,
                    bribe the troops, and prepare measures for a conspiracy against the life of her
                    own son. At length Poppaea prevailed, and Nero gave orders that his mother
                    should be put to death, which was perpetrated while she lay asleep. After her
                    murder, the monster himself gazed on the dead body, and expressed his admiration
                    of her beauty.</p>
                <p>He soon afterwards divorced his wife Octavia, daughter of Claudius, and married
                    the infamous Poppaea. The death of Burrhus, which happened about the same time,
                    gave him an opportunity of raising to the command of the praetorian guards a man
                    whose disposition was more congenial to his own, Tigellinus, the corrupt and
                    bloody tool of a depraved, licentious, and cruel tyrant. In his early youth Nero
                    had paid some attention to the study of music, and even of poetry; and his
                    excessive vanity led him to be covetous of public applause as a musician. He
                    first exhibited publicly on the stage at Naples; and being extremely gratified
                    with the vehement applause that followed his performance, he frequently
                    afterwards appeared in the theatres, and played on his lute, in the guise of a
                    common musician. In a tour through Greece he received such unbounded applause,
                    conveyed in such flattering terms by the polished natives, that he declared none
                    but Greeks were worthy to hear him play and sing. Yet from these skilful
                    flatterers he exacted the most oppressive contributions, for the supply of his
                    lavish prodigalities.</p>
                <p>During his reign the war in Britain was renewed, under the command of the brave
                    and skilful Suetonius Paulinus. This politic commander, perceiving the influence
                    which the Druids exercised over their countrymen, determined to put to death the
                    whole druidical order, and to extirpate their religion. For this purpose he
                    seized upon and devastated the isle of Mona, or Anglesey, their chief seat, cut
                    down the sacred groves, and burned numbers of the Druids on their own
                    blood-stained altars, and with their own homicidal fires. While he was thus
                    engaged, a general insurrection of the conquered province broke out in
                    consequence of the barbarous outrages inflicted on Boadicea, queen of the Iceni.
                    Instigated by her wrongs, the natives everywhere flew to arms, destroyed several
                    Roman stations, and among others the considerable colony of Verulamium (St.
                    Alban’s). Not less than 70,00( persons are said to have fallen victims to their
                    vengeance Suetonius hastened back to the support of his countrymen, and defeated
                    the insurgent Britons with terrible slaughter. He was soon afterwards recalled
                    by Nero, and the war in Britain was for a time suffered to languish.</p>
                <p>In the tenth or eleventh year of Nero’s reign, Rome was: visited by a vast and
                    dreadful conflagration, which continued for six successive days, and laid waste
                    the greater part of the city. Nero himself gazed on the progress of the
                    devouring element with a strange and wild delight, reciting aloud in a
                    theatrical manner some verses descriptive of the destruction of Troy. Great
                    numbers of the people, and immense treasures perished in this conflagration,
                    which, partly from his conduct at the time, and partly from some expressions
                    which fell from him a short time before, Nero himself was suspected of having
                    caused. To remove the odium of this dreadful suspicion, Nero not only began to
                    rebuild the city in greater splendour than before, maintaining meanwhile the
                    homeless inhabitants at his own expense, but also caused the Christians, who
                    were now become numerous, to be accused of having set the city on fire. This
                    false accusation caused the first persecution of the Christians, in which great
                    numbers were put to death with tortures of unprecedented cruelty. The details of
                    this bloody persecution come, however, more properly within the province of the
                    ecclesiastical historian. Availing himself of the space left unoccupied by the
                    devastations of the flames, Nero indulged his extravagant disposition in the
                    erection of his celebrated golden palace, of which the dimensions were
                    prodigious, and the materials so costly as to drain the wealth of an empire. To
                    replenish his treasury, he exacted the most oppressive tribute from the
                    provinces, and thus excited a spirit of strong disaffection, which at no distant
                    period threatened almost the dissolution of the empire.</p>
                <p>In the mean time a conspiracy at Rome, headed by Piso, was detected before it was
                    ripe for execution. This gave occasion to Nero to display the worst qualities of
                    his ferocious mind. Not only all who were really implicated in the conspiracy
                    were put to death without mercy, and their effects confiscated to the use of the
                    emperor, but great numbers were doomed to similar destruction for no other
                    apparent cause than because they were wealthy, or in some manner had incurred
                    the dislike of the tyrant. In this wholesale butchery perished the philosopher
                    Seneca, and the poet Lucan, with many others of the best and noblest men of
                    Rome.</p>
                <p>Notwithstanding these horrible barbarities, Nero was almost a favourite with the
                    corrupt and mercenary populace. A very large proportion of the inhabitants of
                    Rome had been accustomed, even from the turbulent days of the Gracchi, to be
                    supported almost solely by the donations and <pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:wu.89119129625&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=414" xml:id="kp-eb0719-0414-0404"
                    />distributions of corn, bestowed upon them by designing demagogues. Marius set
                    the example of composing armies out of this degenerate city rabble; and even
                    when this example was not followed, it was still found necessary to continue the
                    distributions of corn, together with the public shows of gladiators and wild
                    beasts in the amphitheatre. To these Nero had added supplies of wine and animal
                    food <hi rend="italic">(congiaria et viscerationes);</hi> so that the populace
                    was both amused and fed at the public expense, while the weight of the tyranny
                    was chiefly borne by the most distinguished class of citizens, the senate, and
                    the nobility; and heaviest by the most illustrious. To such a state of affairs
                    the degenerate populace had little to object; but men of rank and merit groaned
                    beneath an oppression no longer to be endured.</p>
                <p>The provinces, however, were the first to make an attempt to throw off the
                    intolerable yoke. Julius Vindex raised the standard of revolt in western Gaul.
                    The army in Spain proclaimed their general, Galba, emperor; and they were joined
                    by the troops in Lusitania, commanded by Otho. The intelligence of these revolts
                    filled Nero with consternation; from which he was somewhat relieved by the
                    tidings of the defeat of Vindex by Virginius, who had maintained his allegiance.
                    This joy was of short duration; for Nym-phidius, colleague of Tigellinus in the
                    command of the praetorian guards, found means to persuade these troops to
                    declare for Galba. The ruin of the emperor was now inevitable. Bereft of
                    friends, of courage, and of presence of mind, he fled in trepidation disguised
                    from the city, found a temporary refuge in the house of his freedman, Phaon, and
                    hearing the trampling of horsemen who had been sent in pursuit of him, stabbed
                    himself in the throat with a dagger, and miserably ended his miserable life.</p>
                <p>Servius Sulpitius Galba was universally received as emperor after the death of
                    Nero; although Nymphidius attempted to take advantage of his slow progress
                    towards Rome from Spain, and to get himself raised to the throne by the
                    praetorian guards. Virginius Rufus, who had defeated Vindex, voluntarily
                    submitted to Galba, as did also the armies in other parts of the empire.
                    Strengthened by this ready reception, Galba endeavoured to abridge the dangerous
                    power of the praetorian guards. Habituated to the rigid discipline of the camp,
                    he exerted himself to restore somewhat of the ancient and hardy virtues of the
                    republic, discountenanced sloth, idleness, and luxury, and even exhibited a
                    penurious meanness of temper, unbecoming his exalted station, giving colour to
                    the accusations of avarice which were made against him. The legions stationed in
                    upper Germany, who had been somewhat tardy in acknowledging his elevation to the
                    throne, began to be more disaffected, and to threaten to raise their own
                    general, Vitellius, to the possession of imperial power. With a view to
                    strengthen his tenure of empire, Galba appointed Licinius Piso, a youth of high
                    promise, to be his successor. To this Otho had aspired, and immediately plotted
                    the death of Galba. He readily secured the favour of the praetorian guards, who
                    equally feared and hated the rigid discipline of the emperor. A revolt speedily
                    ensued; Galba prepared to defend his power; and a contest taking place in the
                    forum, the aged emperor was thrown down and trampled to death, after a reign of
                    only seven months.</p>
                <p>Scarcely had Otho seized upon the sceptre, when he found himself engaged in a
                    contest with Vitellius, who had been proclaimed emperor by his soldiers. The new
                    competitor for imperial sway was joined by Valens and Caecina, and began his
                    march towards Italy at the head of a power-ful army. Otho marched to oppose him.
                    The antagonists met at a little village called Bedriacum, near the banks of the
                    Po, and a severe and bloody engagement took place. Victory was for some time
                    doubtful; but the superior discipline of Vitellius’s army prevailed, and Otho
                    was defeat ed with great slaughter. Seeing his prospects desperate, Otho gave up
                    the contest, thanked his troops for their fidelity, and put an end to his own
                    life, after a brief reign of about three months.</p>
                <p>Vitellius began his reign by endeavouring to conciliate the favour of the
                    populace and the troops by large donations and expensive amusements. He then
                    gave a loose rein to his own debasing appetites, of which the chief was absolute
                    gluttony of the very grossest kind. It is almost incredible, though stated by
                    historians, that in less than four months he expended on the mere luxuries of
                    the table a sum equal to about seven millions sterling. This bloated and
                    pampered ruler was soon regarded by all his subjects with contempt and disgust.
                    The unrestrained licentiousness of the soldiery tended equally to make his reign
                    hated and feared by all w ho were exposed to the insults and outrages in which
                    they indulged. To supply the funds necessary for the maintenance of his
                    excessive luxury, he resorted to the too prevalent custom of listening to the
                    accusations of spies, and putting to death all such accused persons, that he
                    might seize upon their property.</p>
                <p>While thus wallowing in the indulgence of the most debasing appetites, Vitellius
                    was startled by tidings of a very alarming nature. During the reign of Nero an
                    insurrection had broken out in Judea, and Vespasian had been sent to take the
                    command of the army in Syria. The Jews made a desperate resistance, disputing,
                    with almost invincible hardihood and indomitable bravery, every inch of their
                    sacred territory. But this resistance, while it detained Vespasian in that
                    country at the head of a powerful army, served only to mature their own fate. He
                    had sent his own son, Titus, to offer his allegiance to Galba; but before his
                    arrival ∙Galba was dead, and Otho and Vitellius were contending for the empire.
                    Titus returned to his father for instructions; and though Vespasian appeared
                    ready to acknowledge Vitellius, his own troops were eager to raise him to the
                    sovereignty. Mucianus, governor of Syria, and all the tributary eastern
                    monarchs, urged him to comply with the wishes of his army, and his reluctance,
                    real or feigned, yielded to their joint remonstrances. No sooner had he
                    commenced his march towards Europe, than the Illyrian and Pannonian armies
                    declared in his favour; and that of Illyricum, under the command of Antonius
                    Primus, crossed the Alps and marched towards Rome to dethrone Vitellius. The
                    Vitellian army, commanded by Caecina, encountered that of Antonins near Cremona,
                    byt was defeated with great loss, and the city was taken. Antonius continued to
                    advance on Rome, and crossed the passes of theAppen-nines while the emperor was
                    hastening to secure them. Vitellius fled to Rome, which was soon invested by the
                    victorious army of Antonius. An insurrectionary tumult arose in the city itself,
                    during which the Capitol was burned to the ground, and Sabinus, the brother of
                    Vespasian, was killed. The troops of Antonius at length forced an entrance into
                    the city, stormed the quarters of the praetorian guards, and put those turbulent
                    bands to the sword. Vitellius endeavoured to conceal himself, but was
                    discovered, dragged through the streets to the place of punishment for common
                    malefactors, put to death in the most ignominious manner, and his mangled
                    carcass cast into the Tiber amidst the execrations of the multitude. Eight
                    months and five days had this despicable wretch seemed to sway the sceptre of
                    supreme dominion, when thus ovet taken by the due reward of his debauchery and
                    crimes.</p>
                <p>Flavius Vespasian obtained possession of the throne in his fifty-ninth year, and
                    became the founder of a dynasty which gave three emperors to Rome. He was a man
                    of rare and excellent virtues, thoroughly matured by a life spent in the
                    exercise of public duties, and with no object superior to that of promoting the
                    public welfare. Being well aware of the glaring abuses which had long been
                    per<pb break="no" facs="ht:wu.89119129625&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=415"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0719-0415-0405"/>petrated with impunity in all branches of the
                    administration, he set himself vigorously to the dangerous task of effecting a
                    thorough reform. He restored the privileges of the senate, and gave it once more
                    an actual power in the government. The courts of law were also subjected to a
                    most salutary reform, and rendered again, what they had long ceased to be,
                    courts of justice. The insubordination of the army, which had been the main
                    cause of so many bloody revolutions, he repressed with a firm and steady hand;
                    and restored in a great measure the discipline which had made it so powerful in
                    its better days. He directed his attention also to the treasury, which had been
                    quite exhausted by the corrupt and prodigal expenditure of his predecessors; and
                    in order to replenish its coffers, he regulated anew the tribute and custom-dues
                    of the provinces, and imposed a number of taxes; by which means, though he was
                    accused of avarice, he placed once more the revenues of the empire on a stable
                    basis, and restored them to a flourishing condition. The large sums thus raised
                    Vespasian did not expend in revelry, neither did he hoard up in useless masses.
                    He rebuilt the temple of Jupiter Capitolinus, which had been destroyed during
                    the tumults that accompanied the fall of Vitellius; and adorned the city with
                    many other public buildings of great elegance and splendour, thus evincing, that
                    though rigorous and exact in his methods of amassing treasure, he knew, on
                    proper occasions, how to use it with no parsimonious hand. Under him the empire
                    began to breathe with fresh life, and to exhibit signs of prosperity and
                    happiness, such as it had not known since the reign of Augustus. His son Titus
                    being raised to the dignity of Caesar, by which name the successor to the throne
                    was designated, the peace and welfare of the empire seemed secured on a stable
                    basis.</p>
                <p>During the reign of Vespasian the arms of Rome were prosperous in various parts
                    of the world. Several states bordering-on the Roman dominions were reduced by
                    his generals to the condition of provinces. But the most celebrated, though not
                    the most formidable war which distinguished his reign, was that in which he was
                    engaged when he was called to the throne, the war against the Jews. This was
                    conducted by his son Titus, after his departure to Rome to enter on the
                    possession of imperial power. The events of this memorable war are so well known
                    that they need not here be detailed. Suffice it to state, that after Jerusalem
                    had been closely invested, the Jews refused all terms of capitulation, blindly
                    trusted in some terrible interposition of divine power to save them and consume
                    their enemies, butchered each other with inconceivable barbarity during every
                    temporary cessation of warfare, endured the wildest extremes of famine, and
                    after suffering every form and kind of misery, to a degree unparalleled in the
                    world’s history, their city was taken, and together with their celebrated
                    temple, was reduced to heaps of shapeless ruins; and such of them as survived
                    these awful calamities were scattered over the face of the earth, and rendered a
                    mockery, a proverb, and a reproach among nations. In consequence of this victory
                    over the Jews, Titus and the emperor enjoyed together the honours of a splendid
                    triumph, while the rich vessels of the temple of Jerusalem were in gorgeous
                    procession borne in the train of the conquerors.</p>
                <p>Soon after this triumph the Batavian war broke out, caused by the civil wars for
                    the empire, and threatening Rome with the loss of a province. It was at length
                    brought to a propitious conclusion by Cerealis, after several sharp encounters,
                    and by a treaty rather than a conquest. The Roman arms were more successful in
                    Britain, during the reign of Vespasian and his immediate successors, than they
                    had previously been. In his younger days, the emperor had himself been engaged
                    in British wars; and being desirous of reducing the island completely under the
                    Roman yoke, he gave the command to Cneius Julius Agricoa, a man of extraordinary
                    merit, a general and a statesman worthy of the best days of Rome. Not only the
                    southern division of the island was subdued by this distinguished commander, but
                    even the more remote regions of Caledonia, hitherto impervious to the Roman
                    legions, were laid open. The gallant resistance of the brave Caledonians, under
                    their leader Galgacus, was ineffectual; their untaught valour could not
                    withstand the steady discipline of the Roman army, and they sustained a severe
                    overthrow at the base of the Grampians. The Roman fleet coasting along the
                    shore, ascertained the insular character of Britain; but so formidable were the
                    mountain fastnesses of Caledonia, that Agricoa did not attempt to penetrate
                    farther into the country, contenting himself with constructing a chain of forts
                    between the Friths of Clyde and Forth, to defend the southern districts, and to
                    restrain the recoil and assaults of the unconquered Caledonians.</p>
                <p>Thus glorious abroad, and beloved at home, Vespasian’s life began to draw near
                    its termination. Feeling the effects of age and weakness, he retired to
                    Campania, to enjoy the benefits of a purer air than that of Rome, together with
                    some relaxation from the cares of state. There he was seized with a malady which
                    his own sensations told him would speedily prove mortal. His anticipations
                    proved true; and he expired in the arms of his attendants, in the seventieth
                    year of his age, and the tenth of his reign. It is worthy of remark, that
                    Vespasian was the second of the Roman emperors that died a natural death, and
                    the first that was succeeded by his son.</p>
                <p>Titus Flavius Vespasian, the conqueror of Jerusalem, ascended in peace the
                    peaceful throne of his father. The very first acts of his reign gave promise of
                    a period of unexam-pledfelicity. Previously to that time he had indulged
                    slightly in pleasures of a somewhat licentious character. From that hour he
                    discarded all the ministers of his looser days, and being resolved to reform the
                    state of public morals, began by reforming himself. Although strongly attached
                    to the beautiful Berenice, daughter of Agrippa, the last king of Judea, he
                    relinquished her society entirely, because he knew that such a connexion was
                    disagreeable to the Roman senate and people. He abolished also the law of
                    treason, under the sanction of which so many acts of tyranny had been committed;
                    and he not only discountenanced, but severely punished, all spies and informers.
                    His whole time was devoted to the duties of his high station; his chief pleasure
                    consisted in rendering services and kindnesses to his friends and to his people.
                    His courtesy and benevolence would doubtless find ample scope; yet it is
                    recorded of him, that one evening recalling to mind the events of the day, and
                    not finding that he had done any thing during its course beneficial to mankind,
                    he exclaimed in accents of regret, “My friends, I have lost a day !” This
                    well-known exclamation, and the course of benevolent deeds by which it was
                    accredited, procured for him the truly glorious title of <hi rend="italic">The
                    delight of mankind.</hi></p>
                <p>Yet the reign of that gentle-hearted and benignant emperor was signalised by some
                    remarkable public calamities. In its first year Campania was laid waste by the
                    most dreadful eruption of Vesuvius ever recorded. It devastated the surrounding
                    country for many miles, overwhelming several cities, of which Herculaneum and
                    Pompeii were the chief. The remains of these cities, excavated in modern times,
                    have supplied inestimable stores to the antiquarian, and thrown great light upon
                    the habits and customs of the Romans in domestic life/ Pliny, the celebrated
                    naturalist and philosopher, lost his life in this eruption, being suffocated in
                    consequence of allowing his curiosity to attract him too near the fearful and
                    dangerous scene. This calamitous convulsion of nature was followed by a
                    destructive conflagration at Rome, which raged for three days, and destroyed a
                    great number of edifices, both public and private. Titus exerted <pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:wu.89119129625&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=416" xml:id="kp-eb0719-0416-0406"
                    />himself to the utmost to alleviate these visitations of suffering; and while
                    so engaged, his sympathies were called forth afresh by a dreadful plague which
                    carried away vast multitudes at Rome. These disastrous events deeply grieved the
                    benignant heart of Titus, and he strove incessantly to lighten the weighty
                    calamities which pressed so heavily upon the empire. In the midst of these
                    exertions and anxieties, he was seized with fever, against the fatal effects of
                    which neither the skill of physicians nor the strength of his constitution could
                    avail. After a short reign of two years ten months and a few days, he died in
                    the forty-second year of his age, leaving behind him the reputation of being, if
                    not the happiest, at least the best of monarchs.</p>
                <p>Flavius Domitian, the younger brother of Titus, now ascended the vacant throne
                    without opposition. On his first accession to imperial power, he seemed desirous
                    of emulating the conduct of his brother. He paid the strictest attention to
                    justice, bestowing a large portion of his time in hearing causes that had been
                    appealed, and shewing himself ready to reverse every inequitable sentence.
                    Pretending great disregard for wealth, he refused to accept the property
                    bequeathed to him, distributing it among the natural heirs. To prevent his chief
                    officers of state from receiving bribes, he bestowed upon them large sums, that
                    they might be raised above the reach of temptation. He was, at the same time,
                    remarkably liberal in granting donations, and providing the most expensive shows
                    and amusements to the people. He confirmed all the grants made by his
                    predecessors to the soldiers, and increased their pay, thus securing their
                    favour and support. All the public buildings which Titus had begun he caused to
                    be finished, sparing no expenditure to have them completed in the most splendid
                    manner.</p>
                <p>Having by these popular displays and manifestations secured the favour of the
                    army and the populace, Domitian began to throw aside the mask which he had for a
                    short time uneasily worn. Vanity and timidity seemed to be the leading elements
                    of his character. The first led him to be inordinately desirous of obtaining
                    popular applause, or even private flattery, however gross; the second rendered
                    him incapable of performing any noble exploit, constantly afraid of public
                    danger or private conspiracies, and consequently cruel to excess, when his
                    victims were completely in his power. For it is an obvious truth, that cowardice
                    and cruelty are inseparably allied; and the opposite is equally true, that the
                    bravest man is also the most merciful. The vanity of Domitian made him desirous
                    of a military triumph; and in order to obtain it he made an expedition into
                    Gaul, against the Catti, a warlike German tribe which had invaded the province.
                    Without having even seen the enemy, he demanded a triumph; and the servile
                    senate granted the request of their weak and inglorious sovereign.</p>
                <p>The intelligence of the really glorious exploits of Agricoa in Britain, excited
                    the envy of Domitian; and he recalled that celebrated general, under a pretence
                    of appointing him to the government of Syria. Agricoa was too prudent to require
                    a triumph, and retired into private life, which, however, he did not long enjoy,
                    his death being hastened, as some suspect, by the guile of the emperor. He was
                    soon afterwards involved in a more formidable war, in consequence of an
                    irruption of the Daci and Getae, who, under the command of their brave king
                    Decebalus, crossed the Roman frontiers, and defeated the armies sent to oppose
                    them. Domitian had now an opportunity of acquiring the renown of a warrior, but
                    he wanted a warrior’s heart. He did indeed march against the invader in person,
                    taking care to turn his course so as to encounter the less-dreaded Marcomanni,
                    by whom he was nevertheless defeated. Not daring to come to an engagement with
                    the Daci, he actually purchased a peace, agreeing to pay Decebalus an annual sum
                    of money, provided he would withdraw from the Roman dominions. This war is
                    memorable, as being the first in which the northern barbarians attacked the
                    empire not only with impunity, but with success; the pernicious precedent being
                    thus established of purchasing peace, not with steel, but gold, in direct
                    contrast to the old Roman usage.</p>
                <p>In proportion as Domitian became truly despicable, did be increase in the most
                    absurd and proposterous vanity. He now deified himself, and commanded his own
                    statue to be worshipped as a god, at the very time that his mind was agitated
                    with constant dread of plots against his life. Surrounded with spies and
                    informers, he became more and more cruel, reviving the law of treason, and
                    putting into terrific force al 1 its bloody provisions. An unsuccessful revolt
                    of the army in Upper Germany gave an opportunity to the timid yet sanguinary
                    tyrant to indulge his ferocity, by putting to death all whom he suspected of
                    disaffection. About the same time, a persecution was commenced against the
                    Christians, partly because they refused to worship the statue of the emperor,
                    and partly because his ignorant and superstitious mind had formed some vague
                    notion of their connexion with the Jews, coupled with the dread, not yet either
                    extinct or understood, of the appearance of a person born in Judea, who was to
                    obtain the empire of the world. In this persecution several persons of
                    illustrious birth and station perished, among whom was Flavius Clemens, a
                    relation of the emperor; which shews that Christianity was beginning to make
                    progress among the higher ranks of society.</p>
                <p>But the end of this weak, vain, and cruel tyrant drew near. In order to secure
                    the support of the army, he had augmented the pay of the troops one-fourth; and
                    in order to meet the increased expense, he increased the number of those
                    judicial murders, by the law of treason, which caused the property of the
                    victims to be confiscated and become his own. He was in the habit of inscribing
                    on a roll the names of those persons whom he designed to put to death, and kept
                    it carefully in his own possession, treating them, in the meanwhile, with the
                    most flattering attention. This fatal roll was one day taken from under the
                    cushion on which he was reclining asleep, by a child who was playing about the
                    apartment, and who carried it to the empress. She was struck with astonishment
                    and alarm at finding her own name on the dark record, together with the names of
                    others apparently highest in his favour. To them she communicated the knowledge
                    of their danger; and they immediately resolved to preserve their own lives by
                    destroying that of Domitian. This was accordingly done, notwithstanding all the
                    precautions which cowardice and cunning could suggest; and, with the connivance
                    of the praetorian prefect, Domitian perished by the daggers of Stephanus and
                    Parthenius, officers of his own household.</p>
                <p>He was the last of the emperors commonly described as “the twelve Caesars;”
                    although, in reality, the Caesarean family terminated with Nero, and even
                    previously its continuation had been only in the female line. Marcus Cocceius
                    Nerva was chosen by an unanimous vote of the senate, on the very day of
                    Domitian’s death, that they might anticipate any attempt of the praetorian guard
                    to make an emperor. He was of foreign extraction, though a naturalized citizen
                    and senator of Rome, and owed his elevation to the throne solely to his
                    stainless reputation. He commenced his reign by punishing informers, redressing
                    grievances, repealing iniquitous statutes, enacting good laws, and dispensing
                    favours with boundless liberality. He had made a resolution that no senator
                    should be put to death by his command; but this, together with proofs of equal
                    unwillingness to inflict punishment, encouraged the turbulent to indulge in
                    their evil practices. An insurrection broke out in the praetorian guard, and to
                    appease it Nerva was obliged to yield up the murderers of Domitian to their
                    vengeance. Feeling his inability to control these seditious troops, he resolved
                    to adopt as his colleague and successor in the empire Marcus Ulpius Trajan, by
                    whose firmness and decision they might <pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:wu.89119129625&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=417" xml:id="kp-eb0719-0417-0407"
                    />be kept in awe. The effect proved the wisdom of Nerva’s choice. So high was
                    the character of Trajan, that no person could be named equally worthy of the
                    empire; and even the seditious praetorian bands submitted without a murmur.
                    This, as it was the best, was almost the last act of Nerva’s short reign. He was
                    soon after seized with a fever,of which he died, having reigned only one year
                    four months and nine days.</p>
                <p>The peaceful and virtuous reign of Nerva was the harbinger of happy days to the
                    Roman empire. The selection of Trajan prevented any contests for imperial power
                    at the death of Nerva; so that the new emperor entered without the necessity of
                    bloodshed upon the discharge of his high functions. He was by birth a Spaniard,
                    though of Italian extraction; and had been early inured to the discipline of the
                    army under his father, a commander of considerable reputation. When he himself
                    became a general, he continued to practise the simple habits of a soldier,
                    excelling his troops not in personal indulgences, but in courage and virtue. On
                    the throne he continued to exhibit the same excellencies, only enhanced by the
                    acquisition of a wider scope for their full development. Being superior to fear,
                    it was natural that he should also be above harbouring suspicion. He therefore
                    abolished the law of treason, <hi rend="italic">(judicia majestatis,)</hi> and
                    prepared to restore as much of the free Roman constitution as was compatible
                    with the existence of a monarchy. He restored the elective power to the <hi
                    rend="italic">comitia,</hi> complete liberty of speech to the senate, and to the
                    magistrates their former authority; and yet he ruled the empire with unrivalled
                    firmness, holding the reins of power with a strong and steady hand. Of him it
                    has been said, not in the language <hi rend="italic"> of</hi> panegyric, but of
                    simple sincerity, that he was equally great as a ruler, a general, and a man:
                    and only such a man could with safety, as emperor, have used the remarkable
                    words, when giving a sword to the prefect of the praetorian guards, “Take this
                    sword, and use it, if I have merit, for me; if otherwise, against me.”</p>
                <p>Soon after the accession of Trajan, the Dacian monarch, Decebalus, sent to demand
                    the tribute with which Domitian had purchased a disgraceful peace. This Trajan
                    indignantly refused; and levying an army, marched against the Dacians, who had
                    already resumed their predatory incursions. The hostile armies soon came to an
                    engagement, for both were equally eager; and after a desperate struggle the
                    Dacians were routed with dreadful carnage. But so great was the loss of the
                    Romans, that for some time they were not able to follow up their victory. It was
                    however decisive; and the Dacians were compelled not only to forego their
                    demands, but even to become tributaries to Rome. But unaccustomed to servitude,
                    and led by their gallant king Decebalus, they mustered fresh forces as soon as
                    they had somewhat recovered from their overthrow, and prepared for another
                    contest. The warlike emperor was equally ready for the shock of arms. Not
                    satisfied with expelling the invaders, he now determined to carry the war into
                    the country of the enemy. For this purpose he erected a stupendous bridge over
                    the Danube, with a strong fortification at each end, defeated the Dacians in
                    every battle, marched into the heart of their country, and made himself master
                    of the capital. Decebalus, despairing of success, killed himself, and Dacia was
                    reduced to a Roman province, and secured in subjection by several colonies and
                    standing camps. On his return from the Dacian war, the emperor was honoured with
                    a triumph which lasted for the unprecedented period of 120 days.</p>
                <p>The deepest stain which rests on the memory of Trajan is the sanction which he
                    gave to the persecution of the Christians. This persecution raged chiefly in the
                    Asiati cprovinces, where Christianity was most prevalent; and when Pliny the
                    younger, at that time proconsul of Bithynia, wrote to Trajan for instructions
                    respecting a matter which was causing the death of so many men who could not be
                    convicted of any public crimes, the emperor returned an ambiguous answer, the
                    purport of which was, “that the Christians should not be sought for, nor
                    indicted on anonymous information, but that on conviction they ought to be
                    punished.” Such an answer was contrary to every principle of justice; for if
                    criminal, they ought to be sought for, if not criminal, they ought not to be
                    punished. The persecution being somewhat discouraged, was gradually suffered to
                    abate.</p>
                <p>Trajan’s passion for military fame had been but excited, not satiated, by his
                    Dacian conquests. He next directed his attention to the East, and resolved to
                    wrest from the Parthians, the most dreaded foes of Rome, the empire of central
                    Asia. The first scene of his glory was Armenia, which he speedily reduced to a
                    Roman province. Hence he advanced into Mesopotamia, throwing across the rapid
                    Tigris a bridge not less remarkable than that which spanned the Danube. The
                    greater part of what had been the Assyrian empire was overrun by his conquering
                    arms. Selucia yielded to his might; Ctesiphon, the capital of the Parthian
                    kingdom, could not resist his prowess; all opposition appeared fruitless, and
                    victory seemed the companion of his march. Following the course of the Tigris,
                    he arrived at the head of the Persian gulf, where he fitted out a fleet, and
                    sailed to the entrance of the Indian ocean. Having thus traced the steps of
                    Alexander the Great, emulating his conquering career, and with almost equal
                    celerity, he began to retrace his course, returned to Ctesiphon, and placed a
                    new sovereign on the throne of Parthia.</p>
                <p>Age had now' somewhat tamed his ambitious spirit, and seriously diminished the
                    vigour of his hardy but overworn frame. He began to make preparations for his
                    return to Rome, which he intended to be celebrated in a manner that should far
                    outshine the most glorious triumphs of any of his imperial predecessors. But
                    this triumph he was not destined to see. He had only reached Cilicia when he was
                    seized with an illness which proved fatal, after a few days of paralytic stupor.
                    During this period of comparative insensibility, the empress Plotina, who had
                    accompanied him, contrived to procure Trajan’s signature to a will nominating as
                    his successor in the empire P. Aelius Adrian, his cousin, who was at that time
                    with the army.</p>
                <p>Adrian having been declared emperor by the soldiers, immediately communicated to
                    the senate the intelligence of Trajan’s death, and of his own accession,
                    excusing his not having waited till their sentiments should be made known, by
                    pleading the impatient impetuosity of his troops. The senate were but too happy
                    that the army had made no worse choice, and gave their ready concurrence. Adrian
                    not having either the ambition or the military talents of Trajan, was more
                    desirous of securing peace than of extending the empire: he therefore abandoned
                    all the conquests of his predecessor, broke down the bridge across the Tigris,
                    and reduced the empire within the boundaries marked out by Augustus, with the
                    exception of Dacia. On his return to Rome the senate offered him a triumph,
                    which he declined on his own account; but as great preparations had already been
                    made, the triumph was celebrated, the statue of Trajan occupying the most
                    conspicuous position. The ashes of that imperial warrior were afterwards placed
                    in a golden urn on the summit of a magnificent column, 140 feet high, erected in
                    the Forum Trajani to commemorate his victories, and still known by the name of
                    Trajan’s pillar.</p>
                <p>But though Adrian was of a pacific disposition, he well knew what was required
                    for the protection of the empire. He therefore restored the discipline of the
                    army, and kept it in complete subordination. He also effected a general and
                    vigorous reform in the internal administration of affairs, and displayed great
                    personal aptitude for the study of comprehensive politics. To him the
                    jurisprudence of Rome was <pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:wu.89119129625&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=418" xml:id="kp-eb0719-0418-0408"
                    />deeply indebted, for the systematic order to which he reduced it. Being aware
                    that little reliance could be placed on the accounts received from the distant
                    provinces, and stimulated by the curiosity of an active temperament, he resolved
                    to visit every province in the empire. In his visit to Britain, he followed the
                    same policy which he had shewn with regard to the East; and instead of
                    attempting a further reduction of Caledonia, relinquished a portion of Agricoa’s
                    conquests, and erected a new wall, as a boundary-line of defence, from the
                    Solway Firth to the Tyne, near Newcastle. He traversed Gaul and Germany, and
                    revisited Asia, where he allayed some commotions that had arisen during his
                    absence. Africa was also honoured by his presence. He spent a winter at Athens,
                    again traversed the eastern provinces and Egypt, and then gratified his learning
                    and his taste by another temporary residence in Greece. He was passionately fond
                    of literature and the fine arts, and possessed of no inconsiderable attainments;
                    and by his patronage of the productions of genius, he called forth another
                    Augustan age, though not of equal brilliancy.</p>
                <p>During his reign, the persecutions of the Christians were renewed with great
                    barbarity; and the emperor scarcely seemed to think it worth his ½dfile to
                    protect that most unoffending class of his subjects. To the Jews he shewed
                    nothing but insulting cruelty. He gave orders that a Roman colony should be
                    established at Jerusalem, and changed its name to Aelia Capitolina. These
                    indignities led to a fierce insurrection of the Jews, headed by an impostor who
                    pretended to be the Messiah, and assumed the name of Barco-hab, (the son of a
                    star). A furious and sanguinary war, of nearly three years duration, almost
                    entirely destroyed the very name and nation of the Jews, and it was decreed a
                    capital crime if any Jew should again come within Judea.</p>
                <p>After his return to Rome, he adopted Commodus Verus as his successor, and on his
                    death, Titus Antoninus. He was soon afterwards seized with dropsy, and the
                    sufferings he endured made him almost frantic. Neither the attention of his
                    physicians, nor the company of philosophers and poets could sooth him. Death at
                    length terminated his sufferings at Baiae, in the sixty-third year of his age,
                    and after a reign of twenty-one years.</p>
                <p>T. Aurelius Antoninus, the adopted son and successor of Adrian, next ascended the
                    throne. The first care of his reign was to prevent the senate from dishonouring
                    the name of Adrian, by whose somewhat peevish and cruel conduct during his last
                    illness, they had been offended. Not only did he succeed in this attempt, but
                    the amiable anxiety which he displayed to protect the memory of his predecessor,
                    earned for him the honourable designation of <hi rend="italic">the pious;</hi>
                    hence the name Antoninus Pius, by which he is best known in history. It had been
                    arranged by Adrian, not only that Antoninus should succeed him, but also that
                    Antoninus should adopt both Marcus Aurelius as his immediate successor, and
                    Cesonius Commodus Verus, the son of that Verus whom he had first adopted. This
                    arrangement Antoninus Pius immediately ratified, by giving his daughter Faustina
                    in marriage to Aurelius, while he tolerated the profligate conduct of Verus,
                    solely out of regard to the memory of Adrian.</p>
                <p>The reign of Antoninus Pius furnishes few materials for the historian, passing
                    away like a placid dream in the midst of universal tranquillity. It was
                    undoubtedly the most peaceful and happy period that ever Rome knew, whether as a
                    republic or an empire. It seemed to realise the ideal speculations of those
                    philosophical politicians who looked for good government or rational happiness
                    then, and then only, when philosophers should be kings, or kings philosophers.
                    It is no mcan portion of his praise, that he put an end to the persecution of
                    the Christians throughout the empire. Few and slight were the wars of this
                    reign. Of these, perhaps the most memorable was that waged in</p>
                <p>Britain by Lollius Urbicus, who not only repressed the incursions of the
                    Caledonians, but recovered the district between the wall of Adrian, and the line
                    of forts erected by Agricoa. By the directions of the emperor, the newly
                    acquired territory was secured by a complete wall, consisting of ditch and
                    rampart, along the line traced by Agricoa, and since known as the wall of
                    Antoninus, or Graham’s dike.</p>
                <p>But the character of Antoninus was a more powerful protection to the Roman
                    dominions than armies and military ramparts: so highly were his virtues
                    respected through the world, that contending princes referred their
                    disagreements to his arbitration, rather than to the fierce decision of the
                    sword. The administration of all public affairs was conducted with the same
                    spirit as if under the eye of the emperor, because every instance of
                    malversation was immediately checked by removal from office, every instance of
                    fidelity and judgment rewarded by the perpetuation of official rank. While the
                    financial department was managed with the utmost frugality, no expenditure was
                    spared which was evidently beneficial to the welfare of the community, in the
                    foundation or improvement of useful institutions, such as the erection of public
                    schools, and the maintenance of teachers. A liberal and enlightened
                    encouragement was also given to commerce, with the view of rendering Rome the
                    mistress of arts, as well as of arms, the centre of an empire acquired by the
                    sword, but consolidated by civilization.</p>
                <p>. Thus peaceful, happy, and beloved, Antoninus Pius reigned for a period of about
                    twenty-three years, and died of a fever at one of his villas, universally
                    regretted, and leaving to his own family nothing but his private property, and
                    the inestimable heritage of a name, against which not even calumny had dared to
                    insinuate a charge.</p>
                <p>Marcus Aurelius, called also Antoninus from having been adopted by his
                    predecessor, and the Philosopher, from his proficiency in learning and his
                    attachment to the opinions of the Stoics, succeeded to the throne, with the
                    cordial approbation of both senate and people. According to the arrangement of
                    Adrian, Aurelius associated with himself in the empire Lucius Verus, a person of
                    a very dissimilar character, to whom he gave his daughter in marriage. This
                    dissimilarity however rendering any thing like rivalry impossible was perhaps
                    the cause of the cordial harmony which subsisted between the colleagues during
                    the course of their common reign. Verus took the command of the army which was
                    sent against the Parthians, over whom, by the skill and valour of his generals,
                    he obtained several considerable victories, and captured several towns, while he
                    was himself revelling in debaucheries at Antioch. At the conclusion of this war,
                    Verus returned to enjoy the honours of a triumph which he had no share in
                    obtaining. Unfortunately, the eastern army brought with it to Rome the
                    infliction of a pestilential disease which was then raging in Asia, and which
                    soon spread its ravages throughout almost the whole of the Roman empire. A
                    dreadful inundation of the Tiber about the same time laid a large part of the
                    city under water, and swept away immense quantities of graih from the fields and
                    the public storehouses. This was followed by a famine which consumed great
                    numbers, in spite of the utmost exertions of the emperor.</p>
                <p>While thus weakened by pestilence and famine, the empire was assailed by a most
                    formidable confederacy of the Germanic nations. The Marcomanni, and other tribes
                    of similar origin, began to press forward with great force upon the Dacian
                    province. The two emperors left Rome to take the field in person against these
                    dangerous antagonists. Verus died, however, soon after the beginning of the war,
                    leaving Aurelius to take the sole command, and to exchange his philosophic
                    studies for the din of arras. He proved himself not unequal to the task,
                    although the war was protracted and chequered by various vicissitudes, vic∙</p>

                <p>tory not always inclining to the side of Rome. During this war there occurred an
                    event which has engaged the pens of several controversial writers. The Roman
                    army happening to be reduced to great straits, blocked up by the Quadi, and in
                    want of water, were relieved, and their enemies entirely discomfitted by a
                    sudden storm of rain, accompanied with thunder and lightning, which flashing
                    fiercely in the faces of the barbarians, filled them with terror, and scattered
                    them into headlong flight. This event was considered as miraculous, and it is
                    said to have been immediately preceded by the prayers of the twelfth legion,
                    which was composed of Christians, and which afterwards received the name of <hi
                    rend="italic"> the thundering legion.</hi></p>
                <p>A peace, or rather a cessation of hostilities, followed the victory thus
                    obtained, and the emperor having returned to Rome, triumphed along with his son
                    Commodus. An insurrection which had broken out in Syria, probably hastened his
                    return; but Aurelius was not required to march against the rebel Avidius
                    Cassius, who was killed by his own soldiers. The emperor treated the insurgents
                    with great clemency, and took the family of Cassius under his protection,
                    forbidding the senate to doom to death any who were suspected of being
                    implicated in the rebellion.</p>
                <p>Notwithstanding the general mildness of the personal character and the
                    administration of Marcus Aurelius Antoninus, his memory is greatly disgraced by
                    the systematic persecution against the Christians which he encouraged. It was
                    not now merely the consequence of tumultuary violence, arising out of the
                    intolerance of the idolatrous pagans, but was deliberately resolved upon, for
                    reasons of state; the philosophic emperor, although despising all religion in
                    his stoic pride, yet strictly prohibiting all change from the religions and
                    customs of former times. Among the most illustrious victims of imperial
                    intolerance was Justin Martyr, celebrated for his writings in defence of
                    Christianity.</p>
                <p>The war against the German nations was soon renewed, and assumed the most
                    formidable aspect. Not merely the tribes on the frontiers of the empire took up
                    arms, but throughout the interior of all the northern nations there was a
                    general commotion, a wide upheaving and unsettling of whole races, and a
                    pressing forward of a living tide, which threatened to overwhelm every thing in
                    its progress. This was in fact the first symptom of the great migration of
                    nations, then beginning, and which ceased not till it completely subverted the
                    Roman empire, filling it with a new population, whose descendants constitute the
                    kingdoms of modern Europe.</p>
                <p>In order to stem, if possible, the progress of this barbarian innundation,
                    Aurelius again left Rome, and marched to Germany. His first efforts were crowned
                    with success; but before he could follow them up, he was seized with a dangerous
                    ill-’ness, which terminated his life, in the fifty-ninth yearofhisage. With
                    Aurelius, the glory and the happiness of the Roman empire may be said to have
                    expired, and that not uncharacteristically, in the reign of an emperor who was
                    distinguished by considerable acquirements in learning, taste, philosophy, and
                    by external respect for all religions, but real regard for none.</p>
                <p>The commencement of the reign of Commodus, son of the late emperor, was rendered
                    disgraceful by a treaty which he formed wdth the Marcomanni, and which he
                    obtained chiefly through the influence of money. Notwithstanding the care which
                    M. A. Antoninus had bestowed upon his education, he was ignorant to an extreme
                    degree, having neither abilities nor inclination for profiting by the imperial
                    example and instruction. On his return to Rome he speedily shewed the bias of
                    his natural disposition, giving himself up to the most unrestrained indulgence
                    in the grossest vices. That he might do so without impediment, he entrusted all
                    power to Perennis, praefect of the praetorian guard, a man of stern and cruel
                    temper, who was at last slain by his sol diers for his severity. A conspiracy
                    against the life of Corn-modus failed, and was followed by a long succession of
                    judicial murders, to gratify the vengeance of the cowardly and vindictive
                    tyrant. He was next threatened by a new danger of a very peculiar character. It
                    had become customary for the licentious soldiery to desert in considerable
                    numbers, especially in Gaul, and to roam about the country as bands of robbers
                    and freebooters. A common soldier, named Maternus, put himself at the head of
                    these banditti, and excited such terror, that he became an object of attention
                    to considerable armies. Being surrounded, and in danger of ruin, Maternus formed
                    the bold project of killing the emperor in the heart of his capital, and seizing
                    the throne. Dispersing his adherents, they all hastened to Rome, individually or
                    in small parties, and had nearly filled the city, when they were detected, and
                    Maternus was put to death.</p>
                <p>The cruelty and rapacity of Cleander, the freedman and new favourite of Commodus,
                    excited a new insurrection, which nothing could allay, the praetorian cavalry
                    being defeated in the streets by the populace, till the headof Cleander was, by
                    the emperor’s command, thrown to the insurgents. In the mean time, Commodus was
                    indulging his base tastes and appetites, not only by gross sensuality, but by
                    endeavouring to rival the gladiators in their savage occupation. Being a very
                    skilfid archer, and of great personal strength, he delighted in killing wild
                    beasts in the amphitheatre, and thus pretending to rival Hercules, In the
                    gladiatorial contests, he publicly engaged so often, that he was the conqueror
                    in 735 combats. Within the palace itself, a conspiracy was at length formed by
                    Marcia, one of the emperor’s concubines, his chamberlain, and the praefect of
                    the praetorian guards. Poison was administered by Marcia, in a cup of wine; and
                    while under the influence of the deadly draught, he was assailed and strangled
                    by a common wrestler, who had been prepared for that purpose.</p>
                <p>Immediately upon the death of Commodus being known to the senate, they elected
                    Publius Helvius Pertinax to the vacant throne; a man of obscure birth, but of
                    great personal merit, by which he had raised himself to a distinguished rank in
                    the state, and in the estimation of all virtuous men. The undesired power thus
                    offered to him, he reluctantly accepted; but prepared to use it for the general
                    good of the empire. In order to accomplish this most desirable object, Pertinax
                    was obliged to begin his reign by checking the lavish expenditure by which
                    Commodus had sought to secure the support of the guards, and to introduce
                    discipline and subordination into this turbulent band. This necessary reform was
                    immediately followed by an insurrection, in which Pertinax was killed, after a
                    brief reign of sixty-six days.</p>
                <p>"During this scene of contest and blood, the citizens abstained as much as
                    possible from all interference, though strongly attached to Pertinax; and after
                    his death they remained quiet in their houses, waiting the new master whom the
                    praetorian guards might nominate. These seditious troops having fortified their
                    quarters, waited also to see what the senate would do; but finding themselves
                    left in possession of imperial power, they issued a proclamation, offering the
                    empire for sale to the highest bidder. Didius Julianus bccame the purchaser, and
                    thus disgracefully acquired the throne. But the intelligence of these base and
                    lawless transactions excited the indignation of the armies in the provinces, who
                    considered themselves better entitled to appoint an emperor, than a factious
                    band of only about ten thousand men. The army of Illyricum proclaimed their
                    general, Septimius Severus; thatofSyria,Pescennius Niger; and that of Britain,
                    Clodius Albinus. A bloody civil war was the inevitable consequence of so many
                    competitors for the sovereignty. In the mean time, the wretched Didius was still
                    the nominal emperor. But the rapid advance of Severus towards Rome alarmed the
                    senate, who passed a <pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:wu.89119129625&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=420" xml:id="kp-eb0719-0420-0410"
                    />decree for his dethronement and death, which was almost instantly executed,
                    thus depriving Didius of the enjoyment of his ill-purchased honours in the short
                    space of two months.</p>
                <p>Severus began his reign by accomplishing what Pertinax was murdered for
                    attempting. He disarmed and disbanded the praetorian guards, and banished them
                    to a distance of one hundred miles from Rome, death being the penalty of a
                    nearer approach. The murderers of Pertinax were executed without mercy, and some
                    degree of order and subordination restored. But Severus, accustomed to military
                    sway, knew no other method of maintaining his authority except by force of arms.
                    Though he punished the late praetorian guards, he replaced them with a chosen
                    body of his own troops greatly more numerous; not reflecting that the enjoyment
                    of similar leisure, and the possession of similar favour, would soon render them
                    equally licentious and turbulent.</p>
                <p>Having thus seized the sceptre, it was necessary to defend it against those
                    rivals who were eager to wrench it from his grasp. As he was most apprehensive
                    of danger from Pescennius Niger, he wrote deceptive letters to Clodius Albinus,
                    styling him Caesar, and thus lulling him to inaction. He then marched against
                    Niger, whom, after several contests, he finally defeated in a great battle near
                    the Issus. Niger was soon afterwards slain; and Severus put to death, without
                    remorse, all “horn he suspected of being favourable to the cause of his
                    competitor. He next attempted to compass the death of Albinus by assassination;
                    but the plot being detected, Albinus prepared to defend himself by dethroning
                    his enemy. Severus hastened towards Britain, and Albinus crossed from thence to
                    Gaul. The two rivals met near Lyons; and a very bloody battle was fought between
                    two disciplined and numerous Roman armies, which ended in Severus gaining a
                    complete victory. When he saw that his hopes were destroyed, Albinus fell by his
                    own hand; and Severus, after insulting the dead body of his antagonist, again
                    displayed the innate ferocity of his heart, by murdering in cold blood all his
                    friends and adherents. A second Parthian war demanded the presence of Severus in
                    the East, where he was again victorious, and where his exploits almost rivalled
                    those of Trajan.</p>
                <p>The avarice and insolence of Plautianus, commander of the praetorian guard,
                    produced great oppression and suffering, till he was killed by Caracalla, the
                    son of Severus, in the very presence of the emperor. Severus next turned his
                    attention to Britain, where the Romans had been losing ground, partly in
                    consequence of Albinus having withdrawn a great portion of the army in his
                    attempt to elevate himself to the throne. The emperor being at the head of a
                    very powerful army speedily drove back the independent natives of Caledonia, and
                    regained the country south of the wall of Antoninus, but lost so many troops in
                    the successive battles which he was obliged to fight, that he did not think
                    proper to push his conquests beyond that boundary. Feeling at length his end
                    approaching, he retired to Eboracum (York), where he appointed his two sons,
                    Caracalla and Geta, to succeed him and reign conjointly, and soon afterwards
                    expired, in the eighteenth year of his reign.</p>
                <p>The two brothers, Caracalla and Geta, had scarcely begun their reign, when they
                    also began their dissensions. After their return to Rome, the utter
                    impossibility of any permanent reconciliation taking place between them, led to
                    a proposal by mutual friends that they should divide the empire. To this neither
                    would agree; and soon afterwards Geta was murdered in the arms of his mother by
                    the hand of the furious and savage Caracalla.</p>
                <p>Having now obtained the undivided possession of a throne stained with the blood
                    of his brother, he prosecuted his murderous course, exhibiting the tiger-like
                    propensities of his savage nature, by destroying almost indiscriminately men and
                    women, young and old, wealthy and humble. He lavished presents, treasures, and
                    amusements among the soldiery with an unsparing hand, trusting by their means to
                    maintain his power, and setting at defiance the hatred of senate and people. He
                    traversed the provinces along the Danube, partly in a hostile, partly in a
                    friendly manner; thence passed into Asia, where, by treachery, he obtained some
                    advantages over the Parthians; thence to Egypt, where, being enraged against the
                    Alexandrians, who had ridiculed his pretensions to be regarded as another
                    Alexander, he almost depopulated the city by a dreadful massacre. Vengeance at
                    length overtook the sanguinary tyrant; and he was murdered by the orders of
                    Macrinus commander of the praetorian guards.</p>
                <p>Marcus Opelius Macrinus was next placed at the head of the empire, by the
                    soldiers, who were not aware that he had been accessory to the death of
                    Caracalla. The new emperor was soon engaged in a war against the Parthians,
                    where he gained no laurels, being obliged to purchase peace on terms highly
                    disadvantageous to Rome. Some attempts which he made to restrain the extreme
                    licentiousness of the soldiery excited a spirit of disaffection, of which Maesa,
                    maternal aunt of the late emperor, availed herself to procure the empire to her
                    grandson, a youth of fourteen, said to be the son of Caracalla, and a priest in
                    the temple of the Sun at Emesa in Syria. This youth, named Heliogabalus, was
                    proclaimed emperor by the legionary forces, on account of their attachment to
                    the memory of his reputed father, Caracalla. Macrinus was defeated in an attempt
                    to crush this rebellion, and fell while endeavouring to escape by flight. His
                    son, Diadumenus, whom he had associated in the empire, shared his fate.</p>
                <p>Heliogabalus, thus raised to the throne, repaired to Rome, and began a course of
                    licentiousness unparalleled in the annals of depravity. He was, in short, the
                    most infamous wretch that ever disgraced a throne; his very existence seemed a
                    stain upon human nature. To form some check to his shameless conduct, his
                    grandmother caused him to assume his cousin, Alexander Severus, as his partner
                    in the empire; but the abandoned and brutal boy attempted to procure his
                    assassination, an attempt which soon proved fatal to himself. The praetorian
                    guards, disgusted with the effeminate, licentious, and cruel tyrant, mutinied,
                    and discovering him in a loathsome hiding place, a cloaca, dragged him through
                    the streets, put him to death in the most ignominious manner, and threw his body
                    into the river, loaded with weights, that it might not be found and buried.</p>
                <p>The new emperor, Alexander Severus, was of a character diametrically opposite to
                    that of his predecessor. Among the first acts of his sovereignty, he banished
                    all the guilty and abandoned creatures of Heliogabalus, restored the authority
                    of the senate, and chose his counsellors and ministers of state of the best
                    members of that body, and revoked all the persecuting edicts that had been
                    issued by his predecessor against the Christians. This just and merciful
                    procedure is thought to have been adopted by the advice of his mother, Mammaea,
                    who maintained an intercourse with some of the most distinguished Christians,
                    among others the celebrated Origen, and who was perhaps herself a convert. She
                    was unquestionably a woman of great virtue, wisdom, and amiability of character;
                    and as Alexander paid the utmost deference to her opinions and wishes, to her
                    may be ascribed much of what was meritorious in the conduct of this young and
                    excellent monarch.</p>
                <p>But however desirous of peace, that he might prosecute his schemes of reform,
                    Alexander was soon called to encounter the perils and toils of war. A revolution
                    in the east, which began in the fourth year of his reign, was productive of
                    consequences deeply important to all Asia. Ar-deshir Babegan, or Artaxerxes, who
                    pretended to be descended from the imperial race of ancient Persia, raised a <pb

                    xml:id="kp-eb0719-0421-0411"/>rebellion against the Parthian monarchs, the
                    Arsacidae. The Parthian dynasty was overturned, and the ancient Persian
                    restored; and with its restoration was renewed its claims to the sovereignty of
                    all Asia, which it had formerly possessed. This claim gave rise to a war against
                    the Romans, and Alexander led his troops to the East to maintain their imperial
                    sway over the disputed territories. In the army he displayed the high qualities
                    of a warrior, and gained a great victory over the Persians, but was prevented
                    from following up his success in consequence of a pestilence breaking out among
                    his troops. The Persians, however, were willing to renounce hostilities for a
                    time, and the emperor returned to Rome in triumph.</p>
                <p>Scarcely had Alexander tasted repose from his Persian war, when he received
                    intelligence that the Germans had crossed the Rhine, and were invading Gaul. He
                    at once set out to oppose this new enemy, but he encountered another still more
                    formidable. The armies in Gaul had sunk into a great relaxation of the rigid
                    discipline necessary for even their own preservation. Alexander began to restore
                    the ancient military rules, to enforce discipline, and to reorganise such an
                    army as might be able to keep the barbarians in check. The demoralised soldiery
                    could not endure the change. A conspiracy was formed against him, and the
                    youthful emperor was murdered in his tent, in his twenty-ninth year, after a
                    short but glorious reign of thirteen years.</p>
                <p>The sceptre was now seized by the chief instigator of the mutiny, Caius Julius
                    Maximinus, by birth a Thracian peasant. He was a man of gigantic stature and
                    strength, indefatigable hardihood, and great personal daring; but to the wily
                    cunning added the savage ferocity ofan ignorant barbarian. He began his reign by
                    murdering all the friends of the late emperor, and sent orders to the senate to
                    ratify his bloody deeds. Having thus, as he thought, fixed himself firmly on the
                    throne, he prosecuted the war against the Germans with great success, routed
                    them in several battles, and devastated an immense extent of the country,
                    selling the inhabitants for slaves. He next marched against the Sarmatians and
                    the Dacians, over whom he gained several victories; and elated with success he
                    was resolved to subdue their country, till he should reach the northern ocean.
                    But an insurrection arose in Africa, caused by his insatiable avarice, and
                    Gordian, proconsul of Africa, was proclaimed emperor. On receiving this
                    intelligence, Maximinus quitted Sirmium and began his march towards Italy,
                    resolved to glut his savage heart with vengeance. In the meantime, Gordian was
                    defeated and slain by Maximinus’s lieutenant; but the senate, knowing it in vain
                    to expect mercy, chose as emperors, Balbinus and Pupienus, who, to gratify the
                    people, gave the title of Caesar to the youthful Gordian, a boy of twelve years
                    old. Maximinus had by this time entered Italy, and laid siege to Aquileia. He
                    met with a gallant resistance; and his own troops suffering excessively during
                    the siege, mutinied, and slew him while he lay asleep in his tent.</p>
                <p>The death of Maximinus left the throne in the possession of the youthful Gordian,
                    and prevented the horrors of a civil war. But the empire continued to be
                    assailed by the restless hordes of barbarians, the Carpi, who had crossed the
                    Danube, ravaging the province of Moesia, while the Persians were invading the
                    eastern dominions. In this emergency, Gordian was ably supported by his
                    father-in-law, Misitheus, praefect of the praetorian guards, who possessed at
                    once the qualities of a statesman and a general. Sapor, the second prince of the
                    new Persian dynasty, the Sassanides, had made some daring and successful inroads
                    upon the Roman dominions; but the emperor, aided by the skilful support of
                    Misitheus, drove back the invaders, defeating them in every encounter, and
                    penetrating to the very heart of their territories. These successes were dearly
                    purchased by the death of the wise and brave Misitheus, to whom they are chiefly
                    ascribed. Gordian appointed Philip the</p>
                <p>Arabian to the station vacant by the death of Misitheus; and prosecuted the war
                    with undaunted courage and undiminished success. But Philip found means to raise
                    in the army such a mutiny as could not be subdued, without his elevation to an
                    equality with Gordian in the empire. This success in guilt stimulated Philip to
                    additional crimes for the promotion of his lawless ambition, and he rested not
                    till he procured the murder of this young emperor, who was giving such proofs of
                    ability, and such promise of future excellence.</p>
                <p>Philip, to secure his tenure of power, concluded a peace with the Persians, and
                    hastened to Rome, where he endeavoured to persuade the senate that the death of
                    Gordian was caused by disease. He did not long enjoy his sovereignty
                    undisturbed. Insurrections of a formidable character broke out in different
                    parts of the empire, especially in Pannonia. Trajanus Decius, whom Philip had
                    sent to suppress this insurrection, had scarcely reached his army when he was
                    compelled to assume the imperial diadem. Philip marched against his unwilling
                    antagonist, but was defeated and slain near Verona. In the reign of Philip the
                    secular games were celebrated, in what was computed to be the one thousandth
                    year from the foundation of the city.</p>
                <p>The reign of Trajanus Decius is memorable on two accounts. Its annals are stained
                    by one of the most sanguinary persecutions that ever tried the sincerity and
                    zeal of the Christian church. Almost innumerable multitudes of Christians were
                    banished, imprisoned, or tortured to death with the most relentless cruelty. The
                    revolution in Persia, which established the dynasty of the Sassanides, restored
                    the worship and the tenets inculcated by the followers of Zoroaster; and caused
                    the retreat of the Asiatic Christians into the dominions of the Romans, at that
                    time more tolerant. But these Asiatic Christians brought with them many of the
                    notions peculiar to the East, and thus gave rise to dissensions among the
                    Christians themselves. Decius, a man of stern and unaccommodating temper,
                    determined to put an end to all such discussions, by completely suppressing
                    Christianity itself; and he published a bloody edict, prohibiting all
                    innovations in religion, and strictly enjoining compliance with the ancient
                    idolatrous worship of Greece and Rome. The horrors occasioned by this cruel
                    edict could not be enumerated, and it is not our province to make the attempt.
                    But it ought to be mentioned that the ascetic and mystic notions prevalent in
                    the East, when driven to excess by this persecution, induced numbers to betake
                    themselves to wild and desert solitudes to seek for safety; and from this
                    excessive development of the ascetic spirit at length arose the monastic, that
                    fertile source of so many errors and abuses.</p>
                <p>The other memorable event in the reign of Decius, is the first appearance of the
                    Goths among the contending nations by whom the Roman empire now began to be
                    regarded as a common enemy, or rather perhaps as a common prey. The origin of
                    this mighty people is involved in deep obscurity, which the utmost researches of
                    learned men have not been able entirely to remove. The most probable opinion,
                    however, appears to be, that which regards them as a powerful branch of the
                    great lndo-Teu-tonic race, by which both northern Asia and northern Europe were
                    peopled, at some indefinitely remote period, before which the southern districts
                    had already been inhabited, very probably by the Pelasgian race. After having
                    been settled for ages in Scandinavia, they appear to have resolved on a southern
                    migration, passed along the lower shore of the Baltic, followed the course of
                    the Borysthenes, (Dnieper,) and the Tanais, (Don,) and took possession of the
                    Ukraine. Thence they afterwards directed their course south-west, ravaged the
                    province of Dacia, and crossing the Danube, appeared in great strength in
                    Moesia. When information respecting these new and formidable invaders was
                    carried to Rome, Decius immediately marched against <pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:wu.89119129625&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=422" xml:id="kp-eb0719-0422-0412"
                    />them. Hewasworsted in the first engagement, and the Goths succeeded in
                    takingPhilippopolis; but Decius having recruited his forces, defeated them, and
                    reduced them to the utmost distress. It was his aim to inflict upon them such an
                    overthrow as should deter them from renewing their invasions of the empire. A
                    battle was fought, in which the Goths, animated with the terrible energy and
                    courage of despair, and being skilfully posted on the edge of a morass, resisted
                    all the efforts of the Roman forces to break them; and young Decius having
                    fallen, the emperor, eager to revenge the death of his son, plunged furiously
                    into the morass, sunk struggling into its absorbing depth, and disappeared. The
                    Roman army suffered an immense loss, but the Goths were in no condition to
                    prosecute their victory.</p>
                <p>Gallus was proclaimed emperor by the surviving army, andhaving immediately
                    concluded adishonourable peace with the Goths, hastened to Rome to enjoy the
                    gratifications of unrestrained indulgence. His son Voluscan he created Caesar,
                    and contrived to get the son of Decius into his power, and put him to death. His
                    conduct excited a general indignation against him; and at length Aemilianus,
                    commander of the forces in Moesia, raised the standard of revolt against him. A
                    battle was fought, in which Gallus was defeated and slain, his son sharing his
                    fate. In three months, Aemilianus himself was deposed and killed, the army
                    declaring in favour of Valerianus, general of the army stationed in Gaul.</p>
                <p>Of Valerian, who had been distinguished by his virtues while in a private
                    station, great expectations were formed. Having appointed his son Gallienus to
                    be his associate in the empire, he left; him to defend it against the incursions
                    of the Goths and Germans, and marched to the East to oppose the Persian king
                    Sapor, or Shah Pur. Valerian was defeated and taken prisoner by the Persians,
                    who treated him with great and contemptuous cruelty. His degenerate son
                    Gallienus made no effort to obtain his release, being apparently more satisfied
                    to reign alone.</p>
                <p>The captivity of Valerian, and the accession of the feeble Gallienus, seemed to
                    be the signal for a universal assault upon the defenceless empire. It was
                    invaded on all sides by the hostile barbarians, who seemed to vie with each
                    other in striving for the honour of being the destroyers of Rome. Several
                    victories over the Germans were gained by the generals of Gallienus; but each
                    army resolving to make its own general emperor, a period of hopeless and
                    helpless anarchy ensued, which threatened the immediate disruption of the
                    empire. The host of competitors which thus sprung up in all quarters, is known
                    by the designation of “the thirty tyrants,” though not actually amounting to so
                    many. The very number of these contending rivals impeded the success of any, no
                    one being possessed of sufficient power to strike a decisive blow. At length
                    Gallienus was killed while besieging Aureolus, one of the usurpers, in
                    Milan.</p>
                <p>He was succeeded by Marcus Aurelius Claudius, a man of great courage, skill, and
                    virtue, capable of upholding the tottering state of the empire. He soon defeated
                    Aureolus, then overcame the Germans, and next routed the Goths in a great battle
                    at Nissa. His attention was next directed to the affairs of the East; but while
                    making preparations for his march thither, he was seized by a pestilential
                    disease, of which he died at Sirmium, after having reigned two years.</p>
                <p>A feeble attempt to obtain the imperial power was made by the brother of
                    Claudius, which terminated after the lapse of seventeen days, by the unfortunate
                    victim of ambition becoming his own executioner. The army now made choice of
                    Aurelian, a native of Sirmium, the son of a peasant of that country, and raised
                    to high military rank and fame by his own surpassing merits. It was reserved for
                    this distinguished man to show what could be accomplished by an imperial hero.
                    The hopes of the Goths had revived on the death of</p>
                <p>Claudius, and they had renewed their invasion. They were met by Aurelian, and a
                    bloody battle was fought, to which night, not victory on either side, gave a
                    temporary suspension. Wearied with mutual slaughter, both parties were averse
                    from renewing the undecided combat, and a treaty was formed, by which Aurelian
                    consented to relinquish that part of Dacia which lay beyond the Danube, and to
                    make the river the boundary of his empire in that direction. The Goths furnished
                    a body of cavalry as auxiliaries to the Romans, and engaged to abstain from
                    future invasion. By this treaty, Aurelian strengthened the Roman empire in that
                    quarter, obtaining a well-defined boundary, and leaving to the enemy a
                    devastated region, no longer worth defending.</p>
                <p>The Alemanni, in the mean time, had entered the Roman dominions, and laid waste
                    the country along the Po. Aurelian marched rapidly against them, inflicted on
                    them several sanguinary defeats, and freed Italy from the terrors of the
                    barbarian invaders. The Vandals also sunk before his matchless valour and
                    conduct; and having now secured the western part of the empire, he directed his
                    arms against the east, to encounter a female antagonist.</p>
                <p>This was the justly celebrated Zenobia (Zeinab) queen of Palmyra, widow of
                    Odenathus, who had been one of the numerous claimants of imperial honours during
                    the reign of Gallienus, and to whom that easy monarch had been willing to grant
                    the title of his colleague. Palmyra, or Tad-mor, is stated in the Bible to have
                    been built by Solomon. The situation of that beautiful spot, a green island in
                    the midst of a sandy ocean, and almost equidistant between the Euphrates and the
                    Phoenician coast, pointed it out to the wisest of kings as a suitable place for
                    commercial enterprise, and admirably adapted to promote his great idea of
                    changing the line of intercourse between the east and the west, from the Red Sea
                    to the Euphrates, and rendering Palestine, not Egypt, the great emporium of
                    nations. After the decline of the kingdom of Israel, this idea seems to have
                    been relinquished; but still Palmyra continued to form an excellent intermediate
                    station between the Euphrates and Asia Minor, for the caravans employed in the
                    Indian and Arabian trade. It thus grew in wealth, if not in political power or
                    importance, yielding ready obedience to the great dominant empires, each in its
                    turn, and seeking nothing from them but protection. From the Parthians it seems
                    to have suffered no injury; but the revolution which gave central Asia to the
                    Sasanide dynasty, involved Palmyra in the general warfare. Odenathus, said by
                    some to have been an Arab Emir, was one of the most considerable of the
                    inhabitants of Palmyra. Irritated by the insults of the Persians, and instigated
                    by his high-spirited wife, Zenobia, he headed his countrymen in their resistance
                    to the plundering bands of the Persian king, successively defeated them, and
                    acquired sufficient power not only to rescue Palmyra, but even to carry the war
                    into the enemy’s country, and to advance to the gates of Ctesiphon. In a short
                    time all Mesopotamia and Syria owned his sway, and he was acknowledged as
                    colleague by Gallienus. Odenathus having been cut off by private treachery, the
                    falling sceptre of Palmyra was immediately seized by Zenobia, who wielded it
                    with no timid or feeble hand. For the space of six years did she maintain her
                    sway, and even added Egypt to her dominions, justifying the proud title she had
                    assumed, Queen of the East. Such was the woman against whom Aurelian thought it
                    no disgrace to lead in person his Roman legions.</p>
                <p>The result was what might have been anticipated. Zenobia was defeated in two
                    successive and bravely-contested battles; Palmyra was besieged, and after a
                    gallant resistance, its own resources being exhausted, it was compelled to
                    capitulate, and Zenobia was taken prisoner while attempting to make her escape
                    into Persia. Scarcely had <pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:wu.89119129625&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=423" xml:id="kp-eb0719-0423-0413"
                    />Aurelian withdrawn his forces, when the Palmyrenians again revolted; and the
                    angry conqueror having again made himself master of this city of romance,
                    reduced it to ruins, of which the extent, beauty, and magnificence still amaze
                    the traveller. Among the victims of the emperor’s wrath was Longinus, the
                    secretary of Zenobia, and the reputed author of an admirable treatise on the
                    sublime. Having thus reduced and destroyed Palmyra, he suppressed an
                    insurrection in Egypt, and returned to Rome, where he celebrated his victories
                    and conquest by a triumph the most remarkable that the city had ever witnessed.
                    Zenobia, who had been compelled to grace this triumph, by walking on foot in the
                    train of her conqueror, received afterwards from him a small estate at Tibur,
                    where she spent in tranquillity the remainder of her life as a Roman matron,
                    leaving a family which was not extinct in the fifth century.</p>
                <p>A violent sedition soon afterwards arose at Rome, in consequence of an attempt by
                    Aurelian to debase the coinage. It was followed by so much bloodshed, and gave
                    so much offence to the emperor, that his native sternness, and the pitiless
                    decision of a warrior, degenerated into harshness and cruelty. Being again
                    obliged to lead his army against the Persians, he left the city, and sought the
                    more congenial pursuits of war; but was afterwards assassinated at the
                    instigation of his private secretary Mnestheus. The murderers were torn to
                    pieces by the enraged soldiery, who almost adored their warlike emperor.</p>
                <p>Nothing can better prove the effect of the masculine government of Aurelian, and
                    the regulated subordination which it had given to the troops, than the fact that
                    the army actually allowed six months to pass in tranquillity, while they awaited
                    the election of an emperor by the senate. That body at length elected Marcus
                    Claudius Tacitus, an aged senator of high character, and a descendant of the
                    celebrated historian of that name. He had scarcely begun to prove the wisdom of
                    their choice, by the enactment of some salutary laws, when he was compelled to
                    march against the Alani, a Scythian tribe, who were devastating Asia Minor. He
                    was successful in the war; but the fatigues and anxieties of the campaign were
                    too severe for a frame already enfeebled by age, and he died in Cappadocia.</p>
                <p>The imperial diadem was immediately assumed by Flori-anus, brother of the late
                    emperor; but the Syrian army chose Marcus Aurelius Probus, a general of great
                    and varied merit, ro be the successor to the throne. Florian finding himself
                    opposed by a man against whom he could not hope for success, put an end to his
                    own life, and thus left the empire to his rival.</p>
                <p>Closely resembling Aurelian in personal bravery, and, like him, also a native of
                    Sirmium, Probus began a reign scarcely less warlike and glorious than that of
                    his great countryman. He defeated the Germans in several battles, and drove them
                    beyond the Rhine and Danube, which were now considered the natural limits of the
                    empire. To complete the boundary-line in that quarter, he constructed a strong
                    wall from the Danube to the Rhine. Passing along the northern frontier of the
                    empire, he reduced the Goths to quiescence, entered Asia, and led his army
                    against Varames (Bahram) king of Persia. That monarch not daring to encounter
                    the hardy veterans of Probus, consented to a peace of which the terms were
                    dictated by the emperor. Three competitors next fell before his power, and he
                    now seemed at leisure to cultivate the arts of peace, for which he had a strong
                    natural predilection. He accordingly employed his legions in draining
                    pestilential fens, planting vineyards, and improving instead of devastating the
                    face of the country. This restoration of the ancient and wise military
                    discipline of earlier and more virtuous days, gave offence to the licentious
                    soldiery; who mutinied and slew the brave and good emperor.</p>
                <p>Reverting to the custom formerly so prevalent, the army proclaimed as emperor
                    Carus, prefect of the praetorian guards, and the senate reluctantly ratified
                    their choice. In the hope of promoting tranquillity, and securing the
                    inheritance of the imperial dignity in his own family, Carus gave the title of
                    Caesar to his two sons, Carinus and Nu-merianus, who were thus his appointed
                    successors. He led his army against the Goths, who had renewed their predatory
                    incursions, and defeated them; but was prevented from following up his victory
                    in consequence of a new invasion of the Persians. Leaving Carinus to protect the
                    western provinces, and taking Numerianus along with him, he marched into Asia,
                    and gave the Persians a complete overthrow. Pursuing the defeated enemy, he
                    entered their own country, advanced to Ctesiphon, and began the siege, when he
                    was killed in his tent, some authors say by a flash of lightning, more probably
                    by some secret conspiracy.</p>
                <p>Numerianus was acknowledged by the army as his successor; but his gentle and
                    pacific disposition exposed him to the ambition of Aper, praefect of the
                    praetorian guards, by whom he was privately murdered, and his death was
                    concealed till the traitor might have time to secure his own elevation. But the
                    bloody deed being discovered, a tumult arose in the army, in the midst of which
                    Diocletian slew Aper, and was proclaimed emperor in his stead. He did not,
                    however, at once obtain undisputed possession; for Carinus, hearing of his
                    brother’s death, assembled a powerful army, and began his march against the
                    usurpers. On his way he encountered and defeated another rival, Julianus, and
                    advancing into Moesia, was met and opposed by Diocletian. The troops of
                    Diocletian, however, were unable to contend with the hardy veterans of Carinus,
                    who gained the victory, but was slain in the moment of his success by a tribune,
                    to avenge the violated honour of his wife; and thus, though defeated, Diocletian
                    remained in possession of the diadem.</p>
                <p>The reign of Diocletian is one of much historical importance. It was rendered
                    conspicuous by the introduction of a new system of imperial government, and by
                    the last and greatest persecution of the Christians. Very soon after his
                    accession to the throne, Diocletian, feeling the weight of the imperial
                    government greater than he was disposed to bear alone, chose as his colleague
                    Maximianus, who had been his companion in arms, and to whom he was willing to
                    delegate the chief part of the military cares. Maximian had soon an opportunity
                    of using his power and displaying his courage, in consequence of an insurrection
                    in Gaul. This insurrection he speedily suppressed, and obtained some victories
                    over the German invaders of the province. In the mean time, Diocletian had been
                    equally successful against the Sarmatians and the Persians. But scarcely had
                    they obtained these victories, when new disturbances and new invasions broke out
                    in every part of the wide empire, the wandering nations pressing inwards from
                    all quarters, and threatening to crush the entire Roman power. To make head
                    against so many invading armies seemed impossible, without a further division of
                    power. For Diocletian seems to have entertained the opinion, that to entrust
                    large armies to experienced commanders was only to put it in their power to
                    become aspirants for the throne; and that the only way to secure their fidelity
                    was to give them such a share in the imperial government as should engage their
                    own interest in its preservation.</p>
                <p>In pursuance of this scheme, he induced his colleague Maximian to name as his
                    Caesar and successor Constantius Chlorus; while he himself chose Maximinus
                    Galerius. In this choice Diocletian was apparently guided by the same <pb
                    break="no" facs="ht:wu.89119129625&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=424"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0719-0424-0414"/>principle which had led to his selection of
                    Maximian as his own colleague, the principle of dissimilitude. A man
                    comparatively peaceful himself, he chose to be associated with Maximian, a rough
                    warrior: to this rugged Augustus, or emperor, he assigned a peaceful and mild
                    Caesar, Constantius, again choosing for his own Caesar the warlike and fierce
                    Galerius. A new division of the empire followed. Diocletian took the eastern
                    provinces; Galerius was appointed to Thrace and Illyricum; Maximian received
                    Italy and Africa; and Gaul, Spain, and Britain, were entrusted to Constantius.
                    Each of the Caesars, although they differed in their dispositions, was a man of
                    courage and military experience; and for a time the arrangement seemed
                    productive of the very best consequences, but it ultimately tended to hasten the
                    dismemberment of the empire and its consequent overthrow.</p>
                <p>Constantius, to whom Britain had been assigned, had to begin his tenure of power
                    by a war for its possession. The usurper Carausius had several years before
                    raised himself to the chief command in Britain, which he retained in spite of
                    the efforts of the imperial generals. He was slain by Allectus, a new usurper,
                    just as Constantius was preparing to cross from Gaul against him. Constantius
                    speedily defeated Allectus, and gained the complete possession of his province,
                    which he maintained with equal valour and moderation, governing with such
                    justice as to make himself equally beloved by hie army and the native
                    inhabitants. In the mean time, Galerius was equally successful on the Danube,
                    where he defeated the invaders; Maximian in Africa, and Diocletian in Egypt; so
                    that this division of power seemed to secure the defence of the empire, by
                    enabling its rulers to oppose every new assailant. A war against the Persians
                    threatened more disastrous consequences. Diocletian had sent for Galerius to
                    conduct this war; but in the first battle the Persians gained the victory, and
                    inflicted on the Romans a very severe defeat. Next year Galerius, at the head of
                    a more powerful army again invaded Persia; but profiting by experience, he kept
                    his forces on the hilly regions of Armenia, where the Persian cavalry could not
                    act, and watching his time, rushed like a mountain torrent on the Persians, and
                    gave them a terrible overthrow. The rout was complete and irrecoverable, and so
                    greatly were the Persians dispirited, that they were glad to yield to the
                    conditions of peace offered by the conqueror. The province of Mesopotamia was
                    ceded to the Romans, and the Tigris again became the eastern boundary of the
                    empire.</p>
                <p>These successful wars might have been followed by a period of peace and
                    prosperity; they ushered in scenes of unparalleled atrocity. Diocletian had made
                    the city of Nicoedia the seat of his residence; and there he maintained a court
                    of eastern splendour, to which he invited men of learningand philosophy. But the
                    philosophers who frequented his court being all animated with extreme hatred
                    against Christianity, exerted themselves in instigating the emperor to extirpate
                    a religion too pure and lofty to suit their polluted minds. Galerius is said
                    also to have stimulated Diocletian to undertake the destruction of a religion,
                    the gentle and peaceful spirit of which he could neither understand nor
                    appreciate. Three imperial edicts were successively published, requiring the
                    books of the Christians to be everywhere sought for and burned, forbidding them
                    to meet together for the purpose of religious worship on pain of death,
                    inflicting punishments of every kind, imprisonment, slavery, infamy, and death
                    upon all the dignitaries of the church, and sanctioning the employment of every
                    possible method to produce, enforce, or compel apostacy, and a return to the
                    established idolatry of the empire. The barbarities which followed upon the
                    issuing of these edicts were utterly inconceivable. Malicious ingenuity was
                    racked to the utmost to devise tortures for the persecuted followers of Jesus.
                    For the space of ten years did this persecution rage with scarcely mitigated
                    horrors; and such multitudes were massacred in all parts of the empire, that at
                    last the imperial murderers ventured to erect a triumphal column, bearing the
                    barbarously boastful, yet false inscription, that they had extinguished the
                    Christian name and superstition, and restored the worship of the gods to its
                    former purity and splendour.</p>
                <p>The scheme of this great and bloody persecution was devised by the emperor
                    Diocletian and his Caesar Galerius, during a winter residence in the palace of
                    Nicoedia. Soon after the issuing of the persecuting edicts, Diocletian repaired
                    to Rome, and there, along with his colleague Maximian, enjoyed the honours of a
                    triumph for the various victories which had been gained in their joint
                    sovereignty. This was remarkable as the last triumph that ever entered the proud
                    gates of Rome. Diocletian had already set the example of a residence in the
                    provinces; and other causes soon conspired to render this example both common
                    and expedient, so that Rome ceased to be the capital of even the Roman world.
                    Wearied with the cares of government, offended with the rude freedoms of the
                    citizens of Rome, and feeling the effects of advancing age, Diocletian began to
                    entertain serious intentions of abdicating the imperial power. These intentions
                    were confirmed by a severe illness under which he laboured, after his return to
                    Nicoedia; and at length he prevailed on his reluctant colleague Maximian to
                    accompany him in his abdication, as he had in his assumption of the toils and
                    the honours of sovereign dominion. Accordingly, the two emperors formally
                    relinquished the imperial station, power, and titles; and were succeeded by
                    Galerius and Constantius, who now from being Caesars, became each an Augustus. A
                    new division of the empire necessarily followed, of which Galerius seized the
                    lion’s share, without however provoking any hostile opposition from Constantius.
                    Galerius retained all the eastern provinces, together with Italy and Africa;
                    Constantius was satisfied with tile possession of Spain, Gaul, and Britain.
                    Galerius appointed two Caesars, Severus, to whom he consigned Italy and Africa,
                    and Maximin, to whom he entrusted the Asiatic provinces. Diocletian survived his
                    abdication about nine years, which he spent in tranquillity, ease, and luxurious
                    retirement at Salona (Spalatro), amusing himself in the erection of a
                    magnificent palace, and the calm pleasures of rural and horticultural pursuits,
                    resisting every attempt to induce him to return to the paths of ambition, and
                    declaring that he had never known the true enjoyment of life till after his
                    resignation of power.</p>
                <p>Constantine, son of Constantius, was detained for some time by Galerius, who was
                    apprehensive of danger from the talents of that young prince; but he contrived
                    to escape, and by a rapid flight secured his safety, and joined his father in
                    Britain, who was preparing to march against the Scots and Picts, as the
                    inhabitants of the northern regions of that island now began to be called. While
                    Constantius was on his march northwards, he was seized with a mortal illness,
                    and died at York, having nominated as successor, his son Constantine, who was
                    accordingly saluted Augustus by his army. Galerius refused to ratify this
                    elevation to the imperial dignity of a prince whom he at once hated and feared;
                    but sanctioned his being termed a Caesar, bestowing the now vacant rank of
                    Augustus upon Severus, one of his own Caesars. This dignity had been expected by
                    Maxentius, son of the abdicated emperor Maximian. Indignant at his
                    disappointment, Maxentius caused himself to be proclaimed emperor by his army;
                    and to colour this usurpation, he induced his father to leave his retreat, and
                    resume the imperial title. A scene of contention followed, scarcely paralleled
                    in the annals of Rome. Severus march <pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:wu.89119129625&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=425" xml:id="kp-eb0719-0425-0415"
                    />ed against the two usurpers; but was abandoned by his own troops, yielded, and
                    was slain. Galerius levied a great army, and marched into Italy against Maximian
                    and Maxentius; who, dreading his power, retired to Gaul, and endeavoured to
                    procure the support of Constantine. This politic prince did not consider it
                    expedient to provoke a war at that time, and for no better cause; and Galerius
                    having withdrawn from Italy, and returned to the east, Maximian and Maxentius
                    returned to Rome. To aid him in the struggle, Galerius conferred the title of
                    emperor on his friend Licinius; and thus there were at once six pretenders to
                    the sovereignty of the empire, namely, Galerius and Licinius, Maximian and his
                    son Maxentius, Maximin, who had been nominated Caesar by Galerius, and
                    Constantine, the son and successor of Constantius. Among these rivals,
                    Constantine possessed a decided superiority in prudence and abilities, both
                    military and political.</p>
                <p>The harsh temper of Maximian soon led to a quarrel between him and his son
                    Maxentius; and finding himself unable to obtain an ascendancy over one who was
                    no less intractable than himself, he quitted Rome, and went to Gaul to
                    Constantine. There also he found himself disappointed of that power which he so
                    greatly longed to possess, and began to plot against the life of Constantine,
                    his son-in-law. But being detected, he was condemned to death, the only favour
                    shewn to his age and former dignity being permission to choose in what manner he
                    should die. Thus perished one competitor for the throne. Nor did Galerius long
                    survive him. A loathsome disease, contracted by excessive indulgence in habits
                    of sensuality, brought his turbulent life to its termination, leaving his power
                    to be divided between his Caesars, Maximin and Licinius. There were now four
                    rivals contending for the empire, Constantine, Maxentius, Maximian, and
                    Licinius. Maxentius speedily provoked open hostilities with Constantine, who
                    marched at the head of a powerful army towards Rome.</p>
                <p>It was while Constantine was proceeding on this momentous expedition, that he
                    made an open and public declaration in favour of Christianity. Before that time,
                    the persecuting edicts of Diocletian had been much mitigated by the forbearance
                    and leniency of Constantius; and Constantine not only followed his father’s
                    example, in being merciful to the persecuted Christians, but even shewed them
                    some marks of positive favour. Very considerable numbers of them, in
                    consequence, flocked to his standards, and swelled the ranks of his army. Their
                    peaceful, orderly, and faithful conduct, contrasting most favourably with the
                    turbulent and dissolute behaviour of those who formed the mass of common armies,
                    won his entire confidence. To what extent this led Constantine to form a
                    favourable opinion of Christianity, or inclined him to view with esteem and
                    respect tenets which had produced such results, cannot be ascertained. How far
                    his avowed reception of Christianity was influenced by the prudence of the
                    politician, how far by the convictions of the convert, it is impossible to
                    determine. The accounts of his dream, and his vision, which united to enforce
                    his trust in Christianity, bear too much the aspect of fiction, or of having
                    been the illusive consequences of mental anxiety, brooding intensely on the
                    possible results of a great religious revolution, to be woven into the narrative
                    of sober history. This, at least, is certain, Constantine caused the <hi
                    rend="italic"> cross</hi> to be employed as the imperial standard, and advanced
                    with it to promised victory. <note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>It is not necessary to attempt nny explanation of the
                    celebrated dream and vision of Constantine, which have so much engaged the
                    attention of both ecclesiastical and infidel historians. The circumstances,
                    according to the be3t authorities, were the following. While he was marching
                    towards Rome against Maxentius, at the head of his army, on a sudden there
                    appeared in the air, about noon-day, a luminous cross, bearing the following
                    inscription: Έ, <hi rend="italic">∏irf risu,</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">By this
                    Conquer. During the ensuing night, he was directed in a dream, to frame a
                    standard resembling the vision he had seen, and to inscribe on it, and on the
                    shields of his soldiers, the</hi><hi rend="italic">labarum,</hi> or monogram of
                    the sacred name of Christ. That such a standard was at that time used, and that
                    Constantine conquered, are historical facts beyond dispute; for the reality of
                    the dream and the vision, we must refer to the testimony of the emperor himself,
                    and of contemporaneous historians. </p></note></p>
                <p>After the armies of Maxentius, led by his generals, had sustained two successive
                    defeats, he found it imperatively necessary to rouse himself from his sensual
                    and inactive life at Rome, and to advance against his formidable assailant. He
                    accordingly mustered a very numerous army, put himself at its head, marched out
                    of Rome, and met the host of Constantine near the little river Cremera, about
                    nine miles from the city. A dreadful encounter took place, both parties being
                    stimulated by every motive that could animate men to erect the utmost energies
                    of mind and body. It was not merely a battle of emperors; it seemed also a
                    strife of religions. At length the troops of Maxentius gave way, wavered, broke,
                    and fled in headlong and irretrievable confusion; Maxentius himself,
                    endeavouring to enter the city by the Milvian bridge, amidst the crowd of
                    fugitives, was precipitated into the Tiber, and perished, partly weighed down by
                    his armour, and partly encumbered and overwhelmed among numbers of struggling
                    wretches, whose dying gripes knew not to respect the purple.</p>
                <p>Constantine entered Rome victorious, restored to the senate their authority,
                    disbanded the praetorian guards, and destroyed their fortified camp, from which
                    they had so long awed the city and given rulers to the empire. After a brief
                    stay in Rome, he proceeded towards Illyricum to meet Licinius, with whom he had
                    formed a secret alliance before marching against Maxentius. The two emperors met
                    at Milan, where their alliance was ratified by the marriage of Licinius to
                    Constantine’s daughter. During this calm interview, Constantine prevailed upon
                    Licinius to consent to the repeal of the persecuting edicts of Diocletian, and
                    to the issuing of a new edict, by which not only the sanguinary enactments of
                    the former emperor were revoked, but Christianity was encouraged, its religious
                    teachers were honoured, and its adherents advanced to places of trust and
                    influence in the state.</p>
                <p>This placid and beneficial intercourse between the emperors, was speedily
                    interrupted by an irruption of the Franks into Gaul, to which they afterwards
                    gave their name. Constantine hastened to oppose them. Anxious to take advantage
                    of this opportunity to crush separately the two emperors, whom united he could
                    not match, Maximin made a very rapid march against Licinius, and almost
                    succeeded in overpowering him unawares. Licinius however, kept his enemy at bay
                    till he had mu-lcred sufficient force, and then gave him a total overthrow near
                    Adrianople. Maximin fled almost alone to Nicoedia, and there died, either of
                    poison or of mortified rage and despair.</p>
                <p>The peace, which had seemed to be established on so firm a foundation between
                    Constantine and Licinius, was soon interrupted. A war, conducted with great
                    skill and courage on both sides, arose for the sole supremacy of the empire. But
                    the activity, talents, and enterprise of Constantine prevailed. Licinius was
                    defeated in a bloody battle near Sirmium; but though defeated, he was not
                    overpowered. He speedily rallied the remains of his beaten army, mustered fresh
                    forces, and again met his rival in the field, again to sustain another and a
                    more complete discomfiture. Through the intervention of Constantine’s daugh<pb
                    break="no" facs="ht:wu.89119129625&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=426"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0719-0426-0416"/>ter, an agreement soon afterwards took place, by
                    which the provinces south of the Danube were ceded to the conqueror, and the
                    dominions of Licinius limited to the Asiatic regions. For about eight years a
                    sort of uneasy peace continued between the two rival emperors, Licinius feeling,
                    and hating to feel, the natural superiority of Constantine. Another open rupture
                    was unavoidable; and both parties now made preparations for a contest, the issue
                    of which should be final. Thetwo hostile armies met on thebanksof the Hebrus,
                    near Adrianople. Licinius had taken up a strong and advantageous position, in
                    which he waited the attack of his adversary. For some days the two armies lay
                    and watched each other’s evolutions. At last Constantine with great skill drew
                    his enemy from his position, and forced him to an encounter on equal terms. The
                    battle was fierce, obstinate, and sanguinary; but the commanding genius, and
                    heroic courage of Constantine secured him a complete victory. The spirit of
                    Licinius was still unbroken. The siege of Byzantium detained Constantine, and
                    allowed his antagonist to muster all his remaining strength, in order to strike
                    one more blow for life and empire. Chrysopolis was the scene of the decisive
                    conflict. But the raw levies of Licinius could not withstand the conquering
                    veterans of Constantine; the struggle produced rather a carnage than a battle,
                    and the utter annihilation of his last army left to Licinius no resource but
                    unconditional submission. He was deprived of his imperia, honours, and permitted
                    to retire to Thessalonica, there to pass the remainder of his days in obscurity
                    and inglorious ease. But the life of a dethroned monarch is not usually long. He
                    was accused of tampering with the barbarians, and conspiring with their aid to
                    rekindle the flames of war. Such an accusation was of itself enough to cause
                    sentence of death to be pronounced; it was immediately put in execution, and the
                    empire was once more transmitted to the sway of a single emperor.</p>
                <p>Constantine, thus possessed of supreme power, immediately put in force some of
                    those important purposes which had long engaged his thoughts. He issued several
                    edicts for the suppression of idolatry; and at the same time restored to the
                    Christians both the churches and the property of which they had been deprived
                    during the last persecution. We have not sufficient information to enable us to
                    judge accurately respecting the intentions of Constantine, or respecting the
                    power of circumstances in obliging him to modify his own schemes, so as to adapt
                    them to certain events which he could not altogether mould. But it is scarcely
                    possible to ascribe too much to the deep policy of this emperor. He was well
                    aware of the characters of the two conflicting religions, Christianity and
                    Paganism. He had also marked with discriminating eye the deep degeneracy of Rome
                    and its inhabitants. Neither had the consequences of the partition of the empire
                    by Diocletian escaped his politic observation; and if the hope of preventing its
                    final dissolution was to be cherished, he saw it to be indispensably necessary
                    to attempt a reconstruction of the empire, upon an arrangement entirely new. The
                    whole fabric of the ancient constitution of republican Rome had been pervaded by
                    its religious worship and institutions. It was natural for him to determine that
                    the new constitution of the renovated empire, should be pervaded by the worship
                    and the institutions of Christianity. And as these had already attained a
                    considerable degree of maturity, he adopted them as they were, partly perhaps
                    because he durst not venture to offend the Christians by any attempted
                    reformation, or reconstruction; partly because the state of his own religious
                    knowledge, so far as we have any means of judging, was very inadequate and
                    imperfect.</p>
                <p>Being resolved to give a new constitution to the Roman empire, and to make
                    Christianity its basis and ruling principle; being at the same time aware of the
                    inveterate force of the associations connecting every thing in Rome with its
                    ancient idolatrous worship, enhancing immensely the difficulty of making any
                    immediate and thorough change there; and having before him the example of
                    Diocletian, Constantine resolved to change the seat of empire, in order to
                    facilitate his change of the imperial constitution. The most formidable enemies
                    of the empire had for a considerable time been the Goths and the Persians; and
                    the necessity of being nearer to the scene of danger, may have led to the idea
                    of selecting an eastern situation for the new seat of government. The siege of
                    Byzantium, which Constantine had formerly conducted in person, probably directed
                    his attention to that city, as the most eligible situation; and it must be owned
                    that it possesses advantages almost unequalled, as the seat of an empire both
                    European and Asiatic. On it accordingly the emperor fixed his choice; and
                    receiving from him immense additions and embellishments, together with a new
                    name, it became <hi rend="italic">Constantinople,</hi> the new imperial
                    city.</p>
                <p>Previously, however, to this great change in the seat of government, there had
                    been held a general council of the Christian teachers at Nice, for the purpose
                    of determining the Arian controversy, which the emperor attended in person; and
                    where he obtained the opportunity of making such enactments respecting the civil
                    constitution of the church, as he either deemed it expedient, or found himself
                    enabled to make. But the controversies which at that time, and for a long period
                    afterwards, divided the church, furnished unhappily the means, and set the
                    precedent, of persecutions conducted by one body of Christians against another;
                    and in which both were too ready to sacrifice their spiritual independence, for
                    the purpose of obtaining the aid of the civil power in crushing their
                    antagonists.</p>
                <p>In the arrangements of his new imperial constitution, Constantine adopted much of
                    the pomp and ceremony of an Asiatic court. A complete disjunction between civil
                    and military authorities took place; and all the great officers of state were
                    modelled anew, with new titles suited to tile new arrangements, as officers of
                    the court, of the army, and of the civil department. The officers of the court
                    and of state, were chiefly the lords or counts of the bed-chamber and the palace
                    <hi rend="italic">(comites cubiculi, et palatii),</hi> and the ministers of the
                    interior, of the finances, of justice, of the crown-treasury, and of the
                    household troops, or body guards. The officers of the army were the
                    general-in-chief, and the generals of cavalry and of infantry; the next class
                    were the counts and dukes <hi rend="italic">(comites ct duces)</hi> of the army.
                    The civil department was divided into four great <hi rend="italic"
                    >prefectures,</hi> each had its <hi rend="italic">diocese,</hi> and each diocese
                    its <hi rend="italic">province,</hi> administered by <hi rend="italic"> profecti
                    proctorio, vicarii,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">rectores provinciarum,</hi> which
                    officers had no military authority, as the military and state officers had no
                    civil power. A new system of taxation was also established, consisting chiefly
                    of a land-tax, a tax upon trade, and the obligatory enforcement of what had
                    formerly been a free gift to the emperor upon extraordinary occasions. Such is a
                    very brief outline of the new constitution given by Constantine to the empire,
                    obviously more Oriental than European or Roman in its character.</p>
                <p>Notwithstanding the Asiatic aspect thus imparted to his government, Constantine
                    retained hisability and readiness for war, when enemies dared to insult his
                    dominions. Several defeats repressed the hostile invasions of the Sarmatians and
                    Goths, who had renewed their attempts upon Thrace; and the Persian monarch did
                    not venture to provoke the power of an emperor equally renowned for his military
                    and for his civil virtues. Disease atlength assailed a frame that had been long
                    and severely tried by the toils, cares, and indulgences of imperial state; and
                    after being openly admitted by baptism into that church of which he had been so
                    long an <pb break="no" facs="ht:wu.89119129625&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=427"

                    of his reign.</p>
                <p>The three sons of Constantine had been named Caesars by their father, and on his
                    death they divided the empire among them. Constantine obtained Gaul, Spain, and
                    Britain; Constantius, the Asiatic provinces, with the capital, Constantinople;
                    and Constans, Italy and Africa. The late emperor had assigned provinces to his
                    two nephews, Dalmatius and Hannibilianus; but the three new emperors, on the
                    ground of a false accusation, barbarously murdered their uncles, cousins, and
                    every member of the imperial house, except two cousins, Gallus and Julian, one
                    suffering under a hopeless malady, the other a mere child. This bloody deed did
                    not long secure to the brothers the quiet possession of their dominions. A
                    dangerous war arose in the East, where Constantius was unable to resist the
                    growing power of the Persians, but suffered several heavy defeats, and was in
                    danger of losing the whole of Mesopotamia, when the Persians were obliged to
                    offer a peace, in consequence of their own dominions being assailed by the nomad
                    tribes beyond the Oxus.</p>
                <p>In the mean time, ambition had kindled a war between the other two imperial
                    brothers, Constantine and Constans. Not satisfied with his portion of the
                    empire, Constantine first seized upon Africa, and then attempted to wrest Italy
                    from Constans. He crossed the Alps, and began to ravage the country round
                    Aquileia; when falling into an ambuscade he was slain, together with the greater
                    part of his troops. Constans immediately took possession of his fallen brother’s
                    dominions, and thus became the sovereign of two-thirds of the empire. Satisfied,
                    apparently, with this great acquisition, he plunged into the most dissolute
                    indulgences, refused to cede any portion to Constantius, and even allowed that
                    prince to wage an unequal war against the Persians, refusing to lend him any
                    assistance. At length his general, Magnentius, raised the standard of revolt.
                    Constans fled towards Spain, but was overtaken and killed near the Pyrenees.</p>
                <p>While Constantius was preparing to avenge the death of hisbrother,anew revolt
                    broke out in ∏lyricum. The army of that province compelled their general,
                    Vetranio, to assume the purple; and Constantina, sister of the emperor,
                    encouraged him to the deed, and even urged him to form an alliance with the
                    usurper Magnentius, who had so recently slam her brother Constans. Not deeming
                    it prudent to engage in a war of such magnitude without providing for the
                    administration of affairs during his absence, Constantius placed his cousin
                    Gallus in the rank of Caesar, and advanced to Constantinople, which Vetranio had
                    seized while the emperor was engaged in the Persian war. Pretending to be
                    willing to admit Vetranio to an equal share of power with himself, he obtained
                    permission to enter the imperial city; and immediately roused the feeling of the
                    army and the people so far, that they declared him sole emperor. Vetranio
                    quietly submitted, his life was spared, and he retired to Prusa, where he spent
                    the remainder of his life in calm seclusion. Maxentius, fully determined to
                    maintain his usurped power, marched at the head of a strong army into Pannonia
                    to meet Constantius. The hostile forces came to an encounter on the plains of
                    Mursa, and a furious combat ensued. It terminated in favour of Constantius, but
                    the victory was purchased by the loss of his bravest troops; a loss which the
                    exhausted state of the population could not adequately supply. Next summer
                    Constantius gained possession of Italy; and Maxentius having fled to Gaul,
                    sustained there another defeat, and seeing further resistance in vain, put an
                    end to his own life.</p>
                <p>Constantius was not long permitted to enjoy his triumph in tranquillity. His
                    cousin Gallus, whom he had created Caesar, instigated by the ambitious
                    Constantina, and being himself of a morose and haughty disposition, caused so
                    much dissatisfaction in the provinces of the East, that Constantius was obliged
                    first to recall him, and soon afterwards to put him to death. Of the race of
                    Constantine the Great, there now remained only Julian, the cousin of the present
                    emperor; and he escaped the fate of his brother Gallus, partly in consequence of
                    the intercession of the empress Eusebia, partly because he had hitherto
                    preferred a scholar’s life to the dangerous eminence of military fame. He was
                    permitted to prosecute his studies among the philosophers of Athens, from whom
                    he imbibed that love of the mythology of ancient Greece, which led to his
                    subsequent apostacy from Christianity.</p>
                <p>Having thus once more arranged the affairs of the empire, Constantine paid a
                    visit to Rome, where he was received with demonstrations of the most flattering
                    character. But he was again called away, in consequence of the Germanic tribes
                    assailing the western, and the Persians the eastern provinces of the empire. He
                    sent Julian to command the armies in Gaul, and to oppose the Germans, while he
                    himself endeavoured to maintain the eastern provinces. In his campaigns he
                    obtained but little success; and was even compelled to abandon the siege of
                    Bezade, which the Persians had taken. Mean while, Julian was distinguishing
                    himself in a very remarkable manner in Gaul. Instead of a mere scholar, ignorant
                    of every thing but the jargon of the sophists, as Constantius had thought him,
                    he appeared at once, when in command of the army, an intrepid soldier, and a
                    consummate general. The Franks he completely overthrew in several engagements,
                    gained by his personal courage and his skilful conduct, even though the generals
                    had secret orders rather to thwart than second his efforts. Having repelled the
                    Germanic tribes, he crossed the Rhine, plunged through the morasses, penetrated
                    the forests, and traversed the plains of Germany, spreading havoc and dismay
                    among these ancient enemies of the empire. Constantius, envious of his renown,
                    and jealous of his rising power, demanded from him the best legions of his army,
                    on the pretext that their services were required in the Persian war. The legions
                    refused to obey, and proclaimed Julian emperor. Both parties prepared for a war,
                    to decide their pretensions to the imperial diadem; but while Constantius was
                    exerting himself to the utmost, and while his mind was filled with rage and
                    apprehension, he was seized with a fatal illness, and left the throne to his
                    rival without bloodshed.</p>
                <p>The high reputation of Julian, which had preceded him, procured tor him a
                    triumphant reception at Constantinople. Immediately on his arrival, he began a
                    rigorous reform in the whole administration; banished the corrupt and servile
                    ministers of his predecessor; dismissed those whose sole employment had been to
                    gratify the sensual and luxurious habits of the court; appointed men of talent
                    and activity to administer the affairs of the empire; and revived in
                    Constantinople some of the forms of the ancient Roman constitution, particularly
                    the senate and the consular title. But along with these reforms, he had planned
                    a change of a much more extensive nature, nothing less than the subversion of
                    Christianity, and the establishment of a somewhat reformed paganism in its
                    stead. Trained as he was, in the philosophic lore of Greece, he imagined that he
                    saw the deep mysteries of a true natural religion concealed beneath the fables
                    of the heathen mythology; and though he did not imagine the popular mind
                    capableof understanding the deeper meaning, he purposed to remove some of the
                    grossest parts of the external mythic rites, give these, so reformed, to the
                    people, and retain the secret mysteries for the learned. All this, he was well
                    aware, could not be accomplished at once. But he adopted the most subtle methods
                    to promote his ulterior designs. He revoked all the edicts against idolatry;
                    discouraged Christianity, by removing Christians from all places of public
                    honour and influence, and prohibiting them from teaching in the public schools,
                    with the evident design <pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:wu.89119129625&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=428" xml:id="kp-eb0719-0428-0418"
                    />of preventing them from being taught, that they might sink into
                    insignificance.</p>
                <p>His attempt to rebuild the temple of Jerusalem was one of the most remarkable of
                    his systematic endeavours to overthrow Christianity. He was sufficiently
                    acquainted with the scriptures to know, that the final desolation of Jerusalem
                    and dispersion of the Jews had been predicted, and was a standing miracle
                    testifying to the truth of Christianity. This he endeavoured to refute, and turn
                    against the cause, by rebuilding the temple in more than its original splendour,
                    and restoring the Jews to their long-lost capital. But in this daring attempt he
                    was signally defeated. If we may credit the testimony of contemporaneous
                    historians, the workmen were driven from the attempt by thunders, whirlwinds,
                    and flames bursting from the foundations which they were vainly endeavouring to
                    lay, till terrified by these supernatural events, they were compelled to abandon
                    the enter-prize.</p>
                <p>From these fruitless endeavours for the subversion of Christianity, Julian was
                    called to take the field against the Persians, who had renewed their
                    aggressions. Though peculiarly desirous of literary and philosophic fame, Julian
                    was by no means destitute of military ambition. He returned a very haughty
                    answer to the Persian ambassadors who had come to treat with him; and set out at
                    the head of a powerful army of skilful veterans, determined to humble the pride
                    and the power of the Persian monarch. For some time his expedition was one
                    continued series of brilliant achievements, till bearing down all opposition, he
                    reached the walls of Ctesiphon. But there he found himself too far from his
                    resources to be able to continue his operations in the siege of a place which
                    promised no speedy conquest. To advance was impossible, to retreat highly
                    dangerous, to remain destruction. Reluctantly he commenced a disastrous retreat,
                    through sandy deserts, oppressed with intolerable heat, deficient in provisions
                    for his troops, and surrounded by clouds of swift Arabian cavalry. Several sharp
                    encounters took place, in which the Roman forces gained the advantage whenever
                    the enemy came to close combat, but suffered dreadfully from the light
                    skirmishing warfare which they generally waged. At length a Persian arrow
                    pierced the unguarded breast of Julian, inflicting a wound of which he died in a
                    few hours, after an active reign of about twenty months.</p>
                <p>The distressed army could not be without a leader; and after a short consultation
                    Jovian, the <hi rend="italic">first of the domestics,</hi> a title which
                    conferred senatorial dignity, and a rank equal to that of the military <hi
                    rend="italic">duces,</hi> was proclaimed emperor; and after some severe
                    conflicts with the Persians, was obliged to conclude a treaty neither
                    advantageous nor honourable to the empire, except that it was necessary for the
                    preservation of the wreck of the army. Returning to his own dominions, he
                    immediately revoked all the decrees issued by Julian against Christianity, and
                    in favour of paganism, thus restoring the former to the supremacy which it had
                    enjoyed since the time of Constantine. Before he reached Constantinople, to
                    which he was directing his course, Jovian was found dead in his bed, having been
                    suffocated, as was supposed, by charcoal.</p>
                <p>After a period of ten days spent in consultation and debate, Valentinian was
                    chosen by the imperial ministers and generals, and the army cordially ratified
                    the choice. Soon after his elevation, Valentinian raised his brother Valens to
                    the dignity of Augustus, and divided with him the empire, giving to Valens the
                    eastern territories, and retaining to himself Illyricum, Italy, Gaul, Spain,
                    Britain, and Africa. Thus were the Roman dominions once more divided into the
                    eastern and western empires; and from the time of Valentinian, they were never
                    again thoroughly united. Valentinian established his court, not at Rome, but at
                    Milan, being nearer the centre of his dominions; and he was almost im mediately
                    engaged in hostilities with the restless and warlike tribes of the Germanic
                    race. He made the most energetic efforts to drive back these invaders, and to
                    maintain the extent of the empire undiminished; a task every year more and more
                    difficult, from the increasing torrent of invaders, and the sinking strength of
                    the exhausted empire. Not only were the German tribes in motion, pressing into
                    Gaul, but the tribes bordering on the Baltic were beginning those piratical
                    depredations which made them so long the terror of the adjacent maritime
                    countries. In Britain the Scots and Picts were overpowering the Roman province,
                    so that in every quarter of the western empire, nothing was to be seen but the
                    march and countermarch of contending armies. Theodosius, the Roman general in
                    Britain, succeeded in defending that province from its assailants, and thus
                    gained the friendship of the emperor. To give the appearance of greater
                    stability to his throne, Valentinian raised his son Gratian to the rank of
                    Caesar, and caused him to be received by the army as his successor.</p>
                <p>In the mean time a dangerous war arose in Africa, where the avarice and cruelty
                    of Count Romanus, the military governor, had excited general dissatisfaction.
                    The complaints of the injured Africans having been guilefully misrepresented to
                    Valentinian, he punished the complainers. Despairing of redress, the people
                    revolted, and chose Firmus, the son of a man of great wealth and influence in
                    the country, for their leader. Romanus was quite unable to suppress this
                    rebellion; but Valentinian despatched the warlike Theodosius with a strong
                    force, to reduce them to subjection. Immediately on his arrival, the aspect of
                    affairs was changed. Firmus was defeated with great loss, and fled to a friendly
                    tribe in the interior; but fearing to be betrayed, he committed suicide, to
                    avoid falling into the hands of the conqueror. Valentinian himself had in the
                    mean time been engaged in conducting an expedition against the Quadi, and other
                    nations on the Danube, in. which he was successful; but died suddenly of
                    apoplexy, near the modern city of Guntz in Hungary.</p>
                <p>Gratian, the eldest son of Valentinian, succeeded his <hi rend="superscript"
                    >,</hi> father in the western empire, and immediately associated with himself
                    his brother Valentinian II., at that time only a youth of five years old,
                    assigning to him Italy and Illyricum. Among the first and the worst acts of his
                    reign, was the sanctioning the execution of Theodosius, whose brave and skilful
                    conduct had preserved Britain, and recovered Africa. To this he was instigated
                    by the calumnious insinuations of envious courtiers, who both hated and feared
                    the rising merit of that gallant warrior. The reign of Valentinian, though
                    filled with wars, had been so prosperous that it had secured for his sons a
                    period of comparative tranquillity, more suited to their youth and inexperience.
                    But the eastern empire had neither enjoyed equal prosperity, nor was enjoying
                    the prospect of equal tranquillity.</p>
                <p>Almost at the very commencement of his reign, Valens, the eastern emperor, was
                    compelled to make preparations for a new Persian war; and, in the midst of these
                    preparations, was alarmed by a dangerous rebellion. This was raised by
                    Procopius, a distant relation of Julian, whose pretensions to the throne were
                    founded partly on his consanguinity to the former emperor, and partly on a
                    rumour that Julian had himself secretly invested him with the purple. Procopius
                    was at first successful; but his haughty and cruel temper disgusting his own
                    supporters, he was deserted by them, taken by the emperor, and put to de3th. The
                    Persian war proceeded favourably, Sapor receiving a severe defeat, which was
                    soon followed by a peace. But a more important event occurred, formidable not
                    only to Valens, but also to the whole of the western world. This was the
                    appearance of a new moving nation of barbarians, called Huns. Respecting the
                    origin of this people, there are va<pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:wu.89119129625&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=429" xml:id="kp-eb0719-0429-0419"
                    />rious opinions, of which the most commonly received is tl at which represents
                    them as sprung from the great family of the Mongolian Tartars, and in some way
                    connected with those tribes called by the Chinese, Hioung-Nou. But there was
                    also among them a manifest mixture of various nomad tribes, of which the
                    predominant were probably the Finnish. It would indeed be absurd to imagine that
                    a mighty migration of nomad tribes, sweeping onwards from the wilds of Mongolia
                    to the Tanais (Don) and the Palus Maeotis (Sea of Azov), could be other than a
                    mingled mass of all the various tribes whom they had conquered and absorbed in
                    their tide-like course. Crossing the Tanais, the Huns drove before them the
                    nations north of the Danube; and these uprooted nations in their turn threw
                    themselves headlong upon the Roman provinces, both impelled and supported by the
                    countless hordes that continued to press resistlessly behind. The Goths, unable
                    to repel these terrible barbarians, sought and obtained permission to settle in
                    the waste lands of Thrace, which formed part of the Roman province of Moesia.
                    Unfortunately for both themselves and the empire, the Goths had been taught
                    Arianism, and as a very violent hatred subsisted between the Arians and the
                    orthodox Christians, the Goths neither were well received by the Romans, nor
                    entertained sentiments of much friendship towards them. And not less
                    unfortunately, the officers whom Valens appointed to superintend the new
                    settlements of the Goths were men of the most depraved and abandoned characters,
                    and treated them with the utmost perfidy and cruelty. At length Lupicinus, the
                    chief of these officers, attempted at a feast to murder Fritigern and the other
                    Gothic leaders; but the plot being prematurely discovered, the Gothic chiefs
                    escaped, and arming their followers, massacred the greater part of the Roman
                    troops in the province. In the mean time, the Huns advancing on their
                    devastating career, drove the Ostrogoths before them into the territories
                    possessed by the Visigoths; and thus mightily swelled the strength of the
                    infuriated Goths. Uniting themselves under Fritigern, the Goths laid waste
                    Thrace, Macedon, and Thessaly, and approached to the very walls of
                    Constantinople.</p>
                <p>In this state of affairs, Valens, assailed by a strong and vengeful foe, applied
                    to Gratian, the young emperor of the west, for aid. He had been engaged in
                    warring successfully against the Germans, and was at that time in the field; but
                    seeing the urgent necessity of saving the eastern empire, he immediately marched
                    to the assistance of his uncle. Before his arrival, the Gothic chief, Fritigern,
                    thinking it lawful to use deceit against a deceitful foe, found means to draw
                    Valens into a situation in which he was almost compelled to fight, without
                    waiting for the arrival of succour. A decisive battle was fought near
                    Adrianople; Valens himself was killed on the field, and nearly two-thirds of the
                    Roman army were cut to pieces. Not even on the dreadful field of Cannae had the
                    Romans sustained a more fatal overthrow; and the stern unconquerable spirit of
                    the republic being no more, the fate of the eastern empire seemed to be
                    inevitable. But what direct force might not have been able to accomplish, was
                    effected by a rare combination of wisdom, valour, and probity. In consequence of
                    his wars with the invaders of his own dominions, Gratian was unable to undertake
                    the conduct of the war against the Goths; but he called to his aid Theodosius,
                    son of that Theodosius whom he had unjustly put to death, and whose death he had
                    bitterly repented. Him he now raised to the dignity of emperor, and gave him at
                    once the eastern empire, with the addition of the province of Illyricum.
                    Theodosius thus raised to the purple, speedily showed himself worthy of the high
                    trust committed to him, that of restoring the fortunes of a falling empire. The
                    courage of the Romans had been so much shaken by their late defeat, that
                    Theodosius did not think it prudent to hazard a general engagement with the
                    Goths; but, like another Fabius, he saved his own forces, harassed the enemy,
                    taught his men that the Goths were not invincible, and gradually restored to
                    them their courage, perfected by improved discipline and temperate caution. At
                    length Fritigern died; and the Goths having no longer a leader capable of
                    controlling the haughty chiefs of their ill-compacted confederacy, became
                    disunited, and one by one submitted to the superior skill, policy, and authority
                    of Theodosius. Great numbers of them received the pay, and were incorporated
                    into the armies of that empire which they had so recently been on the brink of
                    destroying, and the remainder voluntarily engaged to defend the Danube against
                    the Huns. Thus, in about four years, the eastern empire was rescued from the
                    most formidable danger by which it had ever been assailed, and seemed once more
                    in a state of security.</p>
                <p>While Theodosius was thus employed, another calamity befel the western empire.
                    The character and conduct of Gratian had defrauded the fair expectations formed
                    of him on his accession, and exposed him to the contempt of the more warlike
                    part of his subjects. Maximus, who held the chief command in Britain, revolted
                    against him, passed into Gaul, and prepared to dethrone the feeble emperor. The
                    army violated its allegiance, and Gratian having fled towards Italy, was
                    overtaken and killed at Lyons. The death of this prince left his young brother
                    Valentinian II. nominal emperor of the west, though the usurper Maximus assumed
                    that title. Theodosius was obliged to conceal his resentment against the
                    murderer of his benefactor, not being yet in a condition to quit his own
                    dominions; and he even entered into a treaty with him, leaving him in the
                    undisturbed possession of Gaul and Britain. But Maximus, encouraged by the
                    success with which his rebellion had been followed, resolved to deprive
                    Valentinian of even the nominal power which he enjoyed in Italy. Unable to
                    defend his territories, he fled to Theodosius, and besought his aid. Theodosius
                    having completed the pacification of his own dominions, immediately marched
                    against the usurper, defeated him in two successive engagements, and his own
                    troops having yielded him up, put him to death. Valentinian II. was thus
                    restored to the throne of the western empire; a throne which his weak character
                    did not enable him to fill and to defend.</p>
                <p>Theodosius, after his triumph over Maximus, resolved to visit Rome, and aid his
                    imperial pupil in reforming the abuses prevalent in that city. This visit is
                    memorable on account of the decrees published by Theodosius for the complete
                    suppression of idolatrous worship in Rome. All sacrifices were prohibited under
                    heavy penalties, the idols were defaced, and the temples of the gods abandoned
                    to ruin and contempt. These decrees met but a feeble resistance, and from that
                    time may be dated the complete and final overthrow-of pagan idolatry in Rome. It
                    would be an easy though an unpleasant task, to show how the ill-judging teachers
                    of Christianity, in their zeal to make converts, in order to make the transition
                    more easy to the pagan multitude, adopted many of the rites and festivals of the
                    ancient idolatry, assigning merely to some saint what had been ascribed to some
                    subordinate deity, and thus introduced much of the ill-disguised heathenism
                    which forms so large a proportion of papal superstition: but this we leave to
                    the pen of the ecclesiastical historian. Having thus completed the triumph of
                    Christianity over paganism, Theodosius returned to the east, and employed
                    himself in the kindred task of putting an end to the heresies of the church,
                    establishing the predominancy of the orthodox over the Arian party.</p>
                <p>Valentinian II. had but a short time recovered possession of the empire of the
                    west, when he was murdered by Ar-bogastes, a Frank of a bold and warlike
                    character, who had obtained a great ascendancy over him. Arbogastes did <pb
                    break="no" facs="ht:wu.89119129625&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=430"

                    Eugenius, deeming it more safe to possess the power than the name of emperor.
                    Theodosius once more prepared to avenge the murder of an emperor. He raised a
                    powerful army, forced the passes of the Alps, encountered the army of the
                    usurper, and inflicted on him a decisive overthrow. Eugenius was killed by his
                    own defeated troops, and Arbogastes, fearing the just resentment of the victor,
                    died by his own hand.</p>
                <p>The whole Roman empire might have been once more reunited under one imperial
                    sovereign, had Theodosius been ambitious of that sole dominion. But being
                    perfectly persuaded of the necessity of an emperor in each of the imperial
                    cities, he assigned to his younger son Honorius the sceptre of the western
                    empire, and associated Arcadius, the elder, with himself in that of the east.
                    Scarcely had he completed this arrangement, when his constitution, which had
                    always been feeble, overtasked with the exertions of this campaign and the cares
                    of state, yielded to the shock, and he expired, to the universal regret of the
                    empire, which beheld the splendour of the Roman name passing away with him its
                    last great emperor.</p>
                <p>The Roman world now presented the miserable spectacle of two emperors of such
                    imbecility as to be incapable of conducting the administration of public
                    affairs, in a time of such peril and alarm as would have required the prudence
                    of an Augustus joined to the martial skill and talents of a Caesar. That
                    Theodosius was not unaware of the feebleness of his two sons, may be conjectured
                    from the fact of his assigning the care of at least the western empire to
                    Stilicho, the master-general of the army. This able general seems to have been a
                    Vandal by origin, but had by his courage and his great abilities raised himself
                    to the highest military fame and station before the death of Theodosius; and to
                    him that prudent emperor entrusted the guardianship of the empire. In the east,
                    the crafty and avaricious Rufinus enjoyed similar influence over the feeble
                    Arcadius, but without equal merit to sanction his possession of that power.
                    Stilicho governed by the inherent right of commanding genius; Rufinus by the
                    dark intrigues of a guileful and selfish nature. Stilicho seemed to regard
                    himself as entitled to the supreme care of both empires; and Rufinus endeavoured
                    to secure his authority in the east by persuading Arcadius to marry his
                    daughter. He was however frustrated by the eunuch Eutropius, a person still more
                    crafty than himself, who induced the young emperor to share his throne with the
                    beautiful and accomplished Eudoxia. In a short time afterwards, Rufinus was
                    killed by the leader of a body of Gothic troops in the confidence of Stilicho,
                    who did not however obtain the ascendancy over Arcadius, being supplanted by the
                    intrigues of Eutropius.</p>
                <p>In the mean while, a dangerous war broke out in Africa, under the command of
                    Gildo, brother of Firmus, who had been the leader of the last revolt. To
                    suppress this insurrection, Stilicho sent Mascezel, the brother and deadly foe
                    of Gildo. The Romans obtained the victory almost without bloodshed; and Gildo
                    terminated his days by his own act, in a dungeon into which he had been cast.
                    Mascezel did not long enjoy his victory, having been drowned either by accident,
                    or, as some allege, by the contrivance of Stilicho.</p>
                <p>But the fiercest storm that had ever assailed the empire was now ready to burst
                    upon it in its hour of weakness. The Goths had yielded to the arms, and
                    especially to the policy of Theodosius. After the death of Fritigern and of
                    Athan-ric, they had been for some time without a leader able to to combine them
                    into one body. A leader of equal craft and courage now appeared in the famous
                    Alaric, who having succeeded in establishing his authority over his countrymen,
                    only waited for a fair pretext, and a favourable opportunity to put in practice
                    a scheme of greater magnitude and daring than had entered into the mind of any
                    of Rome’s assailants since the time of Hannibal. The corrupt and avaricious
                    ministers of Arcadius soon afforded him a pretext sufficiently plausible, by
                    withholding the subsidy paid to the Goths since the agreement with Theodosius.
                    Not deeming the lands of Thrace worth his while, Alaric led his forces into
                    Greece, passed the straits of Thermopylas without opposition, devastated its
                    fairest lands, and plundered Athens, Corinth, Argos, and Sparta. The unwarlike
                    emperor of the east and his effeminate courtiers did not dare to meet the
                    warlike barbarian; and Stilicho marched against them to rescue Greece from her
                    rude plundererg. The great military genius of Stilicho was soon apparent in the
                    advantage he obtained over the Goths, whom he at length succeeded in driving
                    into a straitened position in Elis, whence it seemed impossible for them to
                    escape. Taking advantage of the relaxation which' security had produced in his
                    antagonists, Alaric forced the lines of circumvallation, crossed the narrow
                    strait at the mouth of the gulph of Lepanto, and resumed his ravages in Epirus.
                    Before Stilicho could again reach his enemy, he received information that the
                    emperor of the east had concluded a peace with Alaric, and had even made him
                    master-general of Illyricum.</p>
                <p>Stilicho yielded to the unwise policy of Arcadius, and returned to Italy; but was
                    very speedily recalled to march against his baffled but unvanquished foe.
                    Resolved if possible to make himself master of the western empire, Alaric
                    crossed the Julian Alps, and marched rapidly towards Milan, where Honorius held
                    his court. Stilicho hastened to recruit his army and to defend the empire; but
                    before his preparations were complete, the swift march of Alaric compelled
                    Honorius to fly from Milan. In his flight he was almost surrounded by the Goths,
                    and took refuge in Asta, where he was immediately besieged. Stilicho hastened to
                    the rescue of the emperor; and gained a great, but not decisive victory over
                    Alaric at Pollentia. Rallying the remains of his shattered army, Alaric quitted
                    the scene of his defeat, and marched furiously to Rome, determined to wreak his
                    vengeance on that proud city, or to perish at its gates. But Stilicho at the
                    head of a chosen body of his army hastened with scarcely less swiftness to the
                    relief of the threatened capital, and arrived in time to protect it from the
                    rage of Alaric. He did not however deem it safe to force hi» antagonist to a
                    battle, dreading perhaps the almost invincible energies of a brave enemy’s
                    resolute despair; and thought it preferable to purchase his retreat, though at
                    the expense of a very large sum of money.</p>
                <p>Though frustrated in this attempt, Alaric did not relinquish his intention of
                    making himself master of the western empire. He retreated towards Gaul, and
                    attempted to seize Verona, intending to retain it as an open door by which to
                    invade Italy when he should be supported by the strength of Gaul. Stilicho being
                    apprised of his intention, followed, beset, and brought him to an engagement at
                    Verona, and inflicted on him a second great overthrow, but could not prevent his
                    escape, with a spirit undismayed, and a resolution only confirmed of implacable
                    hostility to Rome. After this deliverance, Honorius went to Rome to enjoy the
                    honours of a triumph; but this timid prince was not satisfied with a residence
                    in any city which was exposed to the dangers of invasion. He therefore withdrew
                    to Ravenna, a small fortified town on the banks of one of the mouths of the Po,
                    deemed inpregnable from its situation; and here he determined to fix his
                    imperial residence.</p>
                <p>Another enemy now appeared to summon forth afresh the energies of the brave and
                    indefatigable Stilicho. This was another combined host of roving nations,
                    chiefly Vandals, Alani, Suevi, and Burgundians, under the command of Radagaisus.
                    On their march a large body of this moving mass separated, and entered Gaul;
                    while the rest under their chief entered Italy and laid siege to Florence.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="ht:wu.89119129625&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=431"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0719-0431-0421"/>
                <p>Again did Stilicho by his superior tactics save his own army, and overthrow that
                    of the enemy, enclosing them within such entrenched lines as they could not
                    force, and reducing them to such distress that they were compelled to surrender
                    at discretion. Radagaisus was put to death; and the greater part of his army
                    sold as slaves. Of this fresh tide of migrating barbarians, the portion which
                    turned towards Gaul was more successful. They devastated the whole of that
                    country, crossed the Pyrenees, and formed a settlement in Andalusia.</p>
                <p>Stilicho was now suspected of a secret intercourse with Alaric, whom he had
                    several times defeated, but always suffered to escape. A correspondence
                    certainly existed between them; and Stilicho even attempted to persuade Honorius
                    to frame a treaty with Alaric, and to give him the province of Illyricum. In the
                    midst of these political intrigues, Olympius found means to gain the confidence
                    of Honorius, and procured the murder of the brave and able Stilicho, the
                    deliverer of Italy. As if to prove the infatuation of guilt, Olympius next
                    procured the murder of the wives and children of the barbarians throughout
                    Italy, which, instead of weakening their power, strengthened it by the just
                    resentment which so atrocious a deed awoke in their fierce, yet human bosoms.
                    They immediately invited Alaric to head them in avenging the slaughter of their
                    families; and thus about thirty thousand brave and disciplined men were by one
                    bloody and treacherous deed converted from auxiliaries into the most implacable
                    foes, while the death of Stilicho encouraged Alaric to invade a country no
                    longer defended by that renowned warrior, before whom his own martial genius had
                    stood rebuked.</p>
                <p>Delighted to see his great scheme so nearly within his reach, Alaric once more
                    entered Italy and marched directly against Rome. <note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The state of Rome at that eventful period
                    cannot be better described than in the language of Gibbon. “It had attracted the
                    vices of the universe, and the manners of the most opposite nations. The
                    intemperance of the Gauls, the cunning and levity of the Greeks, the savage
                    obstinacy of the Egyptians and Jews, the servile temper of the Asiatics, and the
                    dissolute, effeminate prostitution of the Syrians, were mingled in the various
                    multitude; which, under the proud and false denomination of Romans, presumed to
                    despise their fellow-subjects, and even their sovereigns, who dwelt bevond the
                    urecincts of the <hi rend="smallcaps"> Eteknal City.”</hi></p></note> By a
                    skilful arrangement of his forces, he cut off all supplies, and the devoted city
                    was soon subjected to the aggravated horrors of war, famine, and pestilence.
                    Safe in his retreat at Ravenna, the emperor made no effort to save his capital;
                    and after suffering the most dreadful miseries, the senate purchased a cessation
                    of hostilities and the retreat of the besieging army, by the payment of an
                    enormous ransom. Alaric withdrew to Tuscany, and waited the ratification of this
                    treaty by the emperor, being unwilling to come to extremities, under the hope of
                    yet obtaining such an alliance with Honorius as should raise him to the command
                    of the armies of the whole western empire, which he might govern in the name of
                    the emperor, as Stilicho had done. Honorius refused to ratify the treaty; and
                    Alaric once more invested Rome. In this second siege Alaric took measures to
                    secure a more speedy triumph. He seized upon the harbour of Ostia, which
                    contained the granaries for supplying the city; and the Romans were compelled at
                    once to capitulate. Still the conqueror modified his triumph, contenting himself
                    with raising Attalus, praefect of the city, to the empire. Notwithstanding this
                    virtual dethronement of Honorius, Alaric continued to negotiate with that feeble
                    monarch, whose name bore a higher dignity than that of Attalus. Having again
                    failed to obtain his wishes, he deposed Attalus, and marched against Rome,
                    resolved no longer to control the strong impulse which had long urged him to the
                    sack of Rome. The barbarian army once more approached the walls. During the
                    darkness of night the Gothic slaves within the city seized one of the gates, and
                    threw it open to their countrymen, setting fire to some adjacent houses to light
                    their entrance and to begin the work of devastation, spoil, and carnage. For six
                    successive days of horror the Goths were allowed to glut their furious appetites
                    in the sack of the prostrate queen of the world, restrained only by their own
                    respect for the churches, where numbers of the trembling inhabitants found a
                    sanctuary.</p>
                <p>It was not the intention of Alaric to destroy Rome, but rather tomake himself
                    itssovereign. After he had attempted this by policy and intrigue, he
                    accomplished it by force. His ambition now expanded with his success; and he
                    resolved to subjugate all Italy, pass into Sicily and add it to his conquest,
                    thence into Africa, and annex it to his dominions, and thus to make himself the
                    sovereign of the whole western empire. But while on his march through southern
                    Italy for the accomplishment of these vast designs, he was suddenly smitten with
                    a mortal malady, and died near Consentia. Before his death he gave orders that
                    he should be interred in the channel of the small river Busentinus. The river
                    was turned aside by the labour of captives, the royal sepulchre dug in the
                    vacant bed, the body, richly adorned with the spoils and trophies of Rome, was
                    deposited, the waters were restored to their channel, and the prisoners who had
                    executed the work were murdered, that it might not be known where he lay, and
                    that the hand of man might never insult the ashes, and the foot of man never
                    tread upon the grave, of Alaric the Goth, the conqueror of Rome.</p>
                <p>After the death of Alaric, the command of the Gothic army devolved upon his
                    brother Adolph, who, though not destitute of talents, possessed neither the
                    tierce passions nor the high ambition of Alaric. He concluded a peace with
                    Honorius, consenting to quit Italy upon condition of the princess Flacidia being
                    given to him in marriage. This being done, he acted as a Roman general, led his
                    forces into Gaul, and reconquered that country for the emperor. Thence he passed
                    into Spain, and began a fierce war against the other barbarian nations by whom
                    that country had been invaded; but was murdered in the midst of his victorious
                    career. His successor Wallia continued the war with equal vigour and success,
                    till he subdued nearly all Spain, and founded the Gothic monarchy. Placidia was
                    sent back to her brother Honorius, on the remonstrances of the emperor’s
                    victorious general Constantius, at the head of a powerful army; and she «’as
                    afterwards given in marriage to the brave leader by whom she was thus
                    recovered.</p>
                <p>Constantius did not long enjoy his dignity; and upon his death Placidia sought a
                    retreat in the court of Theodosius, taking with her to Constantinople her two
                    infant children Valentinian and Honoria. Within a few months after this event,
                    which renewed the intercourse between the imperial families of the East and of
                    the West, the emperor Honorius died of dropsy. The throne was immediately siezed
                    by John, the Primicerius, or principal secretary of the late emperor. Thedosius
                    II. who had succeeded his father Arcadius in the empire of the East, prepared to
                    place his cousin on the throne of Rome. The eastern army took Aquileia, and
                    obtaining possession of Ravenna, where the usurper then was, put him to death,
                    and secured the Italian crown. After some little delay, the son of Honorius, an
                    infant only six years old, was raised to the throne, by the name and title of
                    Valentinian III., emperor of the West; the administration of affairs being
                    conducted by his mother Placidia. It is worthy of remark, that both divisions of
                    the Roman empire <pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:wu.89119129625&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=432" xml:id="kp-eb0719-0432-0422"
                    />were at this juncture governed by females; the East by Pulcheria, in the name
                    of her brother Theodosius II., and the West by Placidia, in the name of her son
                    Valentinian III.</p>
                <p>While Rome was assailed on all sides by fierce barbarian nations, it was
                    extremely necessary that either the sceptre should be swayed by a warlike
                    monarch, or that men of military talents should occupy the chief places of trust
                    and influence. The western empire was governed by a woman in the name of an
                    infant; but there were two men at the head of its armies equal to the burden of
                    its support and defence, had they not been rendered foes by jealousy and
                    intrigue. These were Bonifacius in Africa, and Aetius in Italy, both men of
                    great abilities, but the latter envious and designing. In order to ruin his less
                    cunning rival, Aetius wrote to Bonifacius to inform him that the empress
                    Placidia wished his death, and meant to recall him from Africa for that purpose;
                    and at the same time he persuaded Placidia that Bonifacius meant to rebel, and
                    advised her to recall him for the purpose of proving his obedience. When the
                    order reached Bonifacius, it confirmed the fallacious statement of Aetius, and
                    he refused to return; this refusal convinced Placidia of his traitorous design,
                    and she caused him to be proclaimed a traitor, thus driving him into rebellion.
                    Bonifacius was well aware that he could not hope to contend successfully against
                    the veteran troops of Rome, led by Aetius; and he therefore had recourse to the
                    aid of Genseric, king of the Vandals, at that time settled in Spain. This
                    ambitious and daring barbarian immediately crossed the straits of Gibraltar,
                    entered Africa, and commenced ε course of dreadful devastation. Bonifacius
                    learned, when too late, how he had been deceived; and he then attempted, but in
                    vain, to check the progress of the savage invaders. He was defeated, the cities
                    that opposed the Vandals were taken, and Africa was wrested from the power of
                    Rome, and completely overrun by the barbarians.</p>
                <p>As the innocence of Bonifacius had been proved by the deceitful letters of
                    Aetius, he was received on his return to Italy, with marks of favour by the
                    empress. This roused the utmost wrath of Aetius, and a sort of civil war arose
                    between the two rivals, in which Bonifacius was slain; but the empress, who was
                    now thoroughly acquainted with the treachery of Aetius, proclaimed him a
                    traitor, and he fled to the Huns, with whom he had maintained a secret alliance.
                    In a short time afterwards he returned to Italy, requesting re-admission to the
                    councils of the empire, and supported in his requests by an army of sixty
                    thousand barbarians. Placidia was obliged to accept his proffered assistance, to
                    raise him to the dignity of a patrician, and to the command of the imperial
                    armies, and consequently to the government of the empire.</p>
                <p>No sooner had Aetius secured this object of his ambition, than he resolved to
                    recover the lost province of Africa; and for this purpose, availing himself of
                    the indignation which .he cruel and barbarous treatment of his sister by
                    Genseric had excited in the mind of Theodoric, king of the Visigoths, he
                    endeavoured to frame such a treaty with that monarch as should induce him to aid
                    the Romans against the common foe. This politic design was however discovered by
                    the crafty barbarian, Genseric, who defeated it by inducing the terrible Attila,
                    king of the Huns, to invade the empire. For some time this powerful barbarian
                    had ruled with despotic sway over the whole nation of the Huns, and kept both
                    the courts of Rome and Constantinople in terror, levying a tribute from each, as
                    the price of his temporary forbearance. The death of Theodosius II., and the
                    accession of Marcian, the nominal husband of Pulcheria, infused a more
                    determined spirit into the councils of the eastern empire; and the fury of
                    Attila might have been directed against it, rather than the west, had it not
                    been for the intrigues of Genseric, who induced the fierce king of the</p>
                <p>Huns to bend his course westward, and pour the torrent of his almost countless
                    multitudes through Germany into Gaul. The haughty barbarian had also another
                    pretext. The princess Honoria, daughter of Valentinian, is said to have offered
                    him her hand; and Attila, availing himself of the proffer, demanded her in
                    marriage, together with a portion of the empire as her dowry, and advanced at
                    the head of an immense army to enforce his demands. All opposition was in vain,
                    till he reached Orleans in Gaul, which sustained a siege for some time, in the
                    hope of succour from the confiderate forces of Aetius and Theodoric. At length
                    the allied army appeared, when the Huns were actually forcing their way into the
                    town, and Attila called them back, and retired into the plains around Chalons,
                    <hi rend="italic">(in campis Cαtα∙ launicis,)</hi> to obtain space for the
                    evolutions of his mighty army. After a battle, fierce, varied, obstinate, and
                    bloody, in which the nations from the Wolga to the Atlantic were engaged, Attila
                    was beaten back to his camp, and the field, covered with the dead bodies of
                    162,000 slain, remained in the possession of Aetius, Theodoric having fallen in
                    the battle. Attila retreated into Germany, still too formidable to be more than
                    harassed on his march.</p>
                <p>During the following spring, he renewed his attempt, but now directed his course
                    into Italy itself, and laid siege to Aquileia, which he took after a protracted
                    and desperate resistance. Aetius could not induce the Visigoths to render him
                    any assistance, and his own forces were unable to meet the vast armies of the
                    Huns; yet he continued to keep the field, and to impede the progress of the
                    dreadful invader. His march was now to be directed against Rome, when he was
                    prevented, partly by the offers of an embassy sent to him from the timid
                    Valentinian, and partly in consequence of a superstitious feeling of
                    apprehension for his own life, both friends and foes reminding him that Alaric
                    had not long survived the taking of Rome. He consented to accept a large ransom
                    and the princess Honoria, threatening to return filled with implacable
                    vengeance, should the stipulations of the treaty not be fulfilled. Soon after
                    his return to his almost imperial village, he fell a victim to intemperance, and
                    died by the bursting of a blood-vessel, on the night after a feast held in
                    honour of his own nuptial engagement with the fair Ildico Thus perished the
                    terrible Attila, a man of matchless energy of character, a barbarian surpassing
                    all in the barbaric pride and cruelty in which he delighted; who directed his
                    ambassadors to say to the two emperors of Constantinople and Rome, “Attila, <hi
                    rend="italic">my</hi> lord, and <hi rend="italic">thy</hi> lord, commands thee
                    to provide a palace for his immediate reception ;” who delighted in uttering the
                    ferocious boast, that the grass never more grew on the spot once trodden by his
                    horse; and who actually adopted the appellation given to him by a trembling
                    enemy, <hi rend="italic"> Attila, the scourge of God</hi></p>
                <p>Upon the death of Attila, the kingdom of the Huns was tom to pieces among his
                    followers; and Rome might have enjoyed safety, had not the jealousy and
                    ingratitude of Valentinian led him to murder with his own hand the brave Aetius,
                    the only person capable of protecting the empire. Not long afterwards,
                    Valentinian himself was killed by the patrician Maximus, whose wife the weak and
                    dissolute tyrant had violated, and who ascended the throne thus rendered
                    vacant.</p>
                <p>Soon after his assumption of the imperial dignity, the wife of Maximus died; and
                    wishing to obtain a sanction for his elevation, he married Eudoxia, the widow of
                    Valentinian, and sister of the eastern emperor. In some moment of strange
                    imprudence, he told the empress that he had caused the murder of her first
                    husband Valentinian; and to revenge the deed, she privately invited Genseric,
                    the Vandal conqueror of Africa, to invade Italy, and dethrone the usurper.
                    Genseric had built and equipped a powerful fleet, which rendered him master of
                    the sea, and put it in his <pb break="no"

                    />power to devastate the maritime countries around the Mediterranean. His answer
                    to Eudoxia was the speedy appearance of a Vandal fleet in the Tiber. The terror
                    of the Roman citizens vented itself on Maximus, who was put to death in a tumult
                    of popular indignation; but Genseric landed and took possession of the city,
                    which immediately became a scene of horrors, surpassing those caused by the
                    storm and pillage of Alaric and his Goths. For the space of fourteen days and
                    nights did the savage Vandals indulge their rapacious appetite for plunder, by
                    seizing upon all the public and private wealth which had escaped the Goths, or
                    been accumulated since their departure. Eudoxia herself was despoiled of her
                    jewels, and compelled, along with her two daughters, to embark on board the
                    vessels of the barbarous plunderer. Great numbers of the Roman citizens were
                    carried away to Africa as slaves, the only mitigation of their sufferings being
                    w hat was purchased from the Vandals by Deogratias, bishop of Carthage.</p>
                <p>Before the death of Maximus, he had appointed a noble Gaul, named Avitus, to the
                    command of the troops in that country. When the death of Maximus left the empire
                    without a sovereign, the army proclaimed Avitus; and the friendship of
                    Theodoric, the king of the Visigoths, induced him the more readily to accept the
                    dangerous honour. But he enjoyed his elevation a short time. Ricimer, commander
                    of the barbarian mercenaries in the armies of the empire, descended of the royal
                    race of the Visigoths by the mother’s side, and of the nation of the Suevi by
                    the father’s, having defeated the Vandals in a naval action, and been hailed
                    “deliverer of Italy,” found himself strong enough on his return, to depose
                    Avitus, who was allowed to become bishop of Placentia, but he did not live to
                    enjoy his ecclesiastical preferment.</p>
                <p>For a short time Ricimer continued to govern the empire without the appointment
                    of an imperial ruler; but at length he raised to that position Majorianus, a man
                    of courage and merit, who had been trained under the care of Aetius, and was
                    equally skilled in the arts of the field and the cabinet. His first attempt was
                    to check the growing degeneracy of Rome, by amending the laws, making a new
                    distribution and arrangement of the taxes, restoring and reforming the
                    magistracies, preventing the destruction of public edifices, and especially by
                    such a vigorous resumption of the ancient discipline of the armies, as should
                    render them able to meet their enemies with their former certainty of victory.
                    He levied troops, repelled an invasion of the Vandals, constructed a fleet, and
                    prepared to carry the war into Africa, for the recovery of that province, which
                    had long been the very granary of Rome. But it was not the policy of Ricimer to
                    allow a truly able and heroic monarch to occupy the imperial throne, lest he
                    might rouse the Romans from their deep degeneracy. He fomented a sedition in the
                    army, in consequence of which Majorianus was compelled to abdi-, cate; and five
                    days after his abdication he died, as was reported, of a dysentery, more
                    probably of treachery. In him perished the hopes and the prospects of Rome, of
                    ever again obtaining deliverance from the degradation of barba rian sway.</p>
                <p>At the command of Ricimer, the senate named as emperor Libius Severus, an
                    obsequious dependant of the imperious barbarian, who continued to hold the
                    nominal dignity of emperor for a period of six years, during which the whole
                    power was so completely retained by Ricimer, that the name of Severus is
                    scarcely ever mentioned by the historians of the time. At length the growing
                    power of the Vandals in Africa, and their incessant depredations on the coast of
                    Italy, compelled Ricimer, who had no naval force to oppose them, to apply for
                    aid to the emperor of the east, and to offer him the appointment of a western
                    emperor as an inducement. The opportune death of Severus enabled Ricimer to make
                    this offer freely, if indeed he had not caused that death; and Leo, the eastern
                    sovereign, nominated Anthemius to that ill-omened station. A combined armament
                    was prepared by the Constantinopoli-tan and Roman emperors, and sent against the
                    Vandals; but the superior conduct of Genseric prevailed, and the confederate
                    force was almost totally destroyed. Bereft of his eastern support, Anthemius was
                    unable to maintain himself against the powerful and ambitious Ricimer, who first
                    withdrew from Rome to Milan, and there held a separate and independent court,
                    and then marched toward Rome in open rehellion against the emperor. For some
                    months Anthemius defended the city; but at length it was carried by storm, and
                    the unhappy emperor being dragged from concealment, was murdered by the command
                    of Ricimer.</p>
                <p>Anycius Olybrius, the son-in-law of Valentinian III. was next placed on the
                    throne, by this daring and successful setter-up and puller-down of emperors.
                    Within about a month after this exploit, Ricimer himself followed his imperial
                    victims to the grave, being cut off by a painful disease; and before other two
                    months had elapsed, Olybrius died a natural though an early death.</p>
                <p>Even ambition could not rouse the sluggish court of the east to activity,
                    although the death of Ricimer rendered it probable that the nomination of a new
                    emperor would meet with little opposition. At length Leo named to that dignity
                    Julius Nepos, who had married a relation of the empress, and had previously held
                    the government of Dalmatia. In the meantime, Gundobald, the Burgundian prince,
                    and nephew of Ricimer, had raised to the throne an obscure soldier named
                    Glycerius; but upon the approach of Nepos, supported by the troops of Leo,
                    Glycerius fled, the Burgundians not thinking proper to engage in a war for his
                    defence, and he is said to have consulted his safety in the new character of
                    bishop of Salona.</p>
                <p>Nepos enjoyed the sovereignty but a very short time. The barbarian confederates,
                    or auxiliary troops, broke out into a violent sedition, and marched, under the
                    command of their general, Orestes, a native of Pannonia, of high descent,
                    against Ravenna, where Nepos had his court. Instead of confiding in the strength
                    of the fortress, and hazarding the contest, Nepos fled across the Adriatic to
                    his former Dalmatian province, and lived in obscurity till he was murdered by
                    the instigation of his former rival Glycerius.</p>
                <p>Orestes did not himself think proper to assume the purple, but gave it to his son
                    Romulus, or, as corrupted by the half-barbarian half-Greek pronunciation of
                    Pannonia, Mo-myllus, to whom, as raised to the imperial dignity, was also given
                    the name of Augustus, afterwards changed into Aug-ustulus; in whom thus met, by
                    a strange combination, the names of the founders of the city, and of the empire.
                    But Orestes soon found that it was easier to usurp than to retain supreme power.
                    The barbarian mercenaries, headed by Odoacer, a bold and enterprizing chief of
                    the Heruli, demanded a partition of the lands of Italy among them, to at least a
                    third; and upon the refusal of Orestes, they flew to arms, mustering from all
                    quarters, besieged and took Pavia into which Orestes had thrown himself, and put
                    him to death. Odoacer next directed his march to Rome, and was met by
                    Augustulus, who voluntarily abandoned the insignia of imperial sway, and
                    appealed to the clemency of the conqueror. His life was spared, and he was
                    allowed to retire to the villa which had belonged to Lucullus, where he was
                    allowed a sum of money for his support. Odoacer retaining the entire
                    sovereignty, contented himself with the title of king, and thus put an end to
                    the Roman Empire of the West, in the 1229th year from the foundation of
                    Rome.</p>

                    xml:id="kp-eb0719-0434-0424"/>
                <p>Though this was the actual termination of the Roman Empire, yet it ought to be
                    added, that Odoacer never assumed the purple and diadem, or the title of king of
                    Italy, being satisfied with the regal title alone, without any local
                    application; and that after a comparatively peaceful, prosperous, and prudent
                    reign of fourteen years, his fortunes sunk before the superior genius of
                    Theodoric, the king of the Ostrogoths, a prince alike capable of founding or
                    reconstructing a monarchy, under whose sway all vestiges of the imperial
                    government were swept away, or remodelled, and Italy was formed into a
                    kingdom.</p>
                <p>There is no portion of profane history more pregnant with important instruction,
                    than that which relates to the rise, the growth, the fluctuations, and the fall
                    of Rome. It equally demands the studious attention of the scholar, the
                    statesman, the philosopher, and the Christian. In its literature, the scholar
                    will find treasures second only to those of Greece; in its political struggles
                    and changes, the statesman will find much to guide him in his endeavours to
                    mould the constitution of his own country; in its peculiar mental aspect and
                    character, the philosopher will find a full development of one of the most
                    vigorous and striking phases of mind that have ever been displayed in the
                    history of humanity; and in its resistance to the pure and simple truths of the
                    gospel, the Christian will be led humbly to ponder on the deep depravity of man,
                    and the danger of rejecting that system of religion which can alone elevate the
                    character of individuals, and promote the security and happiness of communities.
                    To point out the full application of these views would require a dissertation
                    far beyond our limits; and we must therefore leave the intelligent and
                    inquisitive reader to trace them for himself, “ell assured that the labour will
                    amply prove its own reward.</p>
