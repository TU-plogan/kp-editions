                <p><label type="entry">RHODE</label> Island, one of the United States of North
                    America, is bounded on the north and east by Massachusetts, on the south by the
                    Atlantic Ocean, and on the west by Connecticut. It is forty-nine miles in length
                    by twenty-nine in breadth, and contains an area of one thousand three hundred
                    and fifty square miles, which lie between 4L 22. and 42. 3. of north latitude,
                    and longitude 71. 6. and 71. 38. west from Greenwich. This portion of country
                    includes what was formerly known by the name of Rhode Island and Providence
                    Plantations, originally constituting two plantations or provinces. Compared with
                    its limited extent, Rhode Island is a very diversified state. In the north-west
                    part the country is hilly and broken, but it becomes gradually level towards the
                    Atlantic Ocean. The state may be divided into three natural sections: the first,
                    constituting four fifths of the whole, is a pretty hilly parallelogram, lying
                    west from Narragansett Bay; the second consists of the delightful islands of
                    Narragansett Bay; and the third section is a small irregular slip lying along
                    Massachusetts, and east from Narragansett This bay extends from north to south
                    through nearly the whole length of the state, and embosoms a number of islands,
                    of which the most important are Rhode Island, Connecticut, Prudence, Patience,
                    Hope, Dyer’s, and Hog Islands. Block Island, in the Atlantic, lying south of the
                    state, is the most southerly land belonging to it. These islands, and the
                    country bordering on the bay, are of great fertility, and are celebrated for
                    their fine cattle, their numerous flocks of sheep, and the abundance and
                    excellence of their butter and cheese. The state generally is better adapted to
                    grazing than tillage. A large portion of the western and northwestern part of it
                    has a thin and lean soil, which affords small crops of New England productions.
                    Cider is made for exportation. Corn, rye, barley, oats, and in some places
                    wheat, are produced in quantities sufficient for home consumption; and the
                    various kinds of grasses, fruits, culinary roots and plants, are in great
                    abundance and perfection. In some parts iron is found in large quantities;
                    copper is also met with; and the state abounds in limestone, particularly the
                    county of Providence. Anthracite coal is wrought on the island which gives name
                    to the state, but itis not held in high estimation. There are several rivers in
                    this state, but their courses are short: the principal are called Pawtucket,
                    Providence, Pawtuxet, Pawcatuc, and Wood Rivers. These, and also the bays, swarm
                    with many varieties of excellent fish. The climate is as salubrious as that of
                    any other part of America, and more temperate than that of the other New England
                    states, particularly on the islands where the ocean breezes have the usual
                    effect of tempering the heat of summer and moderating the cold of winter.</p>
                <p>The island called Rhode Island, situated in the bay of Narragansett, and which
                    gives name to the state, is about fifteen miles in length from north to south,
                    and three and a half in breadth. It is divided into three townshlps, Newport,
                    Portsmouth, and Middletown. This island is highly celebrated for its salubrity,
                    and here numbers of invalids resort from southern climates. It is also of great
                    fertility, and noted for its breeds of sheep, neat cattle, and horses. The whole
                    is under high cultivation, and in some months of the year presents so delightful
                    an appearance as to have obtained for it the name of the Eden of America. Long.

                <p>In no state in the Union is so large a proportion of the population and capital
                    employed in manufactures as in Rhode Island. The principal article is cotton
                    goods, for the manufacture of which there are above one hundred mills, many of
                    them extensive establishments. For the year ending September 1836, there were
                    eighty sets of machinery in operation for the manufacture of other kinds of
                    goods, including broad cloths, satinets, jeans, linseys, and the like. The
                    quantity of wool produced was 265,261 pounds, valued at 133,957 dollars. Iron,
                    ardent spirits, and some other articles, are likewise amongst the manufactures
                    of Rhode Island. The exports consist chiefly of flax-seed, lumber, horses,
                    cattle, beef, pork, fish, poultry, and cotton and linen goods. For the year
                    ending September 1836, the exports of domestic produce were to the amount of
                    212,297 dollars, and of foreign produce 16,123 dollars; the total value of
                    exports being 228,420 dollars, which appears to be considerably less than in
                    some previous years. The value of the imports for the same period was 555,199
                    dollars. The amount of shipping of this state may be reckoned at about fifty
                    thousand tons; but so rapidly have commerce and manufactures extended, that a
                    period of only a couple of years is sufficient to produce an increase in these
                    branches of industry which could not have been looked for in such a limited
                    space of time. In 1837 the banks were sixty-two in number, having specie to the
                    amount of 243,482 dollars, a circulation of 1,864,132 dollars, and a capital of
                    9,837,171 dollars.</p>
                <p>Amongst the institutions of Rhode Island is Brown University, at Providence, a
                    flourishing seminary. Academies are established in all the principal towns, and
                    the state pays ten thousand dollars per annum for the support of free schools.
                    The most numerous religious sect is that of the Baptists, who have about
                    eighteen churches. There are, besides, the usual religious diversities which
                    characterise a North American state, including many Friends.</p>
                <p>Among the public works of this state may be mentioned the New York, Providence,
                    and Boston Railway, extending from Stonington in Connecticut to Providence in
                    Rhode Island. About forty miles of it lie in the latter state. It is connected
                    with another railroad, and forms part of a line from Boston to New York. Other
                    works of the kind are in progress.</p>
                <p>The population of Rhode Island in 1839 may be estimated as amounting to at least
                    125,000. The capital of the state is Providence, an account of which will be
                    found under that head.</p>

                <p>Newport, which shares metropolitan honours with the capital, being the seat of
                    government every alternate session, is beautifully situated on the south-west
                    end of the island of Rhode Island, five miles from the sea, and in latitude 4L
                    29. north, and longitude 71. 21. west. The town lies north and south, upon a
                    gradual ascent east from the water, and exhibits a beautiful view from the
                    harbour and the neighbouring hills. The principal street is more than a mile in
                    length. The harbour, which spreads westward in front of the town, is one of the
                    finest in the world, and spacious enough to allow a large fleet to anchor and
                    ride in perfect security. The entrance is safe and easy, and it is defended by
                    three strong forts. Newport contains a state-house, a jail, several banks and
                    insurance offices, a valuable public library, and houses of worship for most of
                    the religious denominations that are found in New England. A very elegant
                    building is appropriated to the library. This town is famous for the salubrity
                    of its climate, and more noted than any other American town for the variety and
                    excellence of its fresh fish. Newport was first settled in 1636, and before the
                    American revolution had attained to considerable commercial importance. During
                    that war it suffered severely, being for a long time occupied by the British. It
                    maintains some trade with the East Indies, Europe, and Cuba; but the most
                    important branch of its commerce is the coasting trade with the middle and
                    southern states. Its fisheries are very valuable. The population of Newport in
                    1839 may be estimated at about 10,000.</p>
                <p>Pawtucket is a flourishing town, partly situated in that part of this state
                    called North Providence, partly in Massachusetts. It is noted for the number and
                    extent of its manufactories, which are situated near a fine cascade on the river
                    Pawtucket. This town contains several public buildings, two or three banks, more
                    than twelve cotton factories, and as many others of different kinds. This is
                    reckoned one of the most flourishing manufacturing villages in the United
                    States. The population may be about 5000. Bristol is a neat commercial town,
                    situated on the east side of Narragansett Bay. It has a safe and commodious
                    harbour, owns a good deal of shipping, and is a place of considerable trade. The
                    population at present ( 1839) may be about 4000. Warren, South Kingston, East
                    Greenwich, Smithfield, Portsmouth, and Warwick, are the only other places of any
                    note. The last-named town contains above 6000 inhabitants.</p>
                <p>The settlement of this state was commenced at Providence in the year 1636, by
                    Roger Williams, a person of some celebrity in the annals of America. He was
                    banished from Massachusetts on account of the religious doctrines which he
                    preached. Two years afterwards the settlement of the island of Rhode Island was
                    begun. In 1643 Williams went to England, and in the following year obtained a
                    charter by which Rhode Island and Providence Plantations were united under one
                    government. This writ continued in force till 1663, when a new charter was
                    granted by Charles II., and this document has ever since formed the basis of the
                    government. This state is the only one in the Union which is without a written
                    constitution, according to the American form of these things. The legislative
                    power is vested in a general assembly, consisting of a senate and a house of
                    representatives. The latter consists of seventy-two members, six from Newport,
                    four from each of the towns of Providence, Portsmouth, and Warwick, and two from
                    each of the other towns in the state. They are elected semi-annually in April
                    and August. The senate consists of ten members, who are elected annually in
                    April. The executive power is vested in a governor; and a lieutenant-governor is
                    elected along with him, on whom the duties of the executive devolve in case of
                    the office of governor being vacated. The other officers of government are a
                    secretary of state, a treasurer, and an attorney-general. The general assembly
                    meets four times a year; at Newport on the first Wednesday in May, at the same
                    place in June; at Providence and South Kingston alternately in October; and in
                    January at East Greenwich, Bristol, or Providence. The judiciary power is vested
                    in a supreme court, and a court of common pleas for each of the five counties.
                    AU the judges are appointed annually by the general assembly. A chief justice
                    and two associate justices preside in the supreme court. Each of the courts of
                    common pleas comprises five judges. Rhode Island has a well-constituted militia
                    force, which is called out for duty twice a year. (r. r. r.)</p>
