                <p><label type="entry">RUSSELL</label> William, a very popular historian, the eldest
                    son of Alexander Russell and Christian Ballantyne, was born in the year 1741 at
                    Windydoors, a farm-house in the parish of Stowe and county of Selkirk. Most of
                    the parish is within the limits of the county of Edinburgh. At an early age he
                    was sent to school in the neighbouring village of Inverleithen, well known as a
                    delightful place of summer resort. Here he acquired an elementary knowledge of
                    the Greek and Latin languages; and private study afterwards enabled him to
                    supply many of the deficiencies of his early education. In 1756 he was removed
                    to Edinburgh, in order to be instructed in writing and arithmetic; and after
                    having attended to these branches for about ten months, he was bound an
                    apprentice to the bookselling and printing business for the term of five years.
                    While engaged in this occupation, he discovered the utmost ardour in literary
                    pursuits; nor was his situation unfavourable to the acquisition of useful and
                    elegant knowledge.</p>
                <p>After the completion of his apprenticeship, he published a select collection of
                    modern poems, which was favourably received. The first edition we have not seen;
                    the second bears the subsequent title: “The select Poems of our most celebrated
                    contemporary British Poets: viz. Dr Akenside, Mr Gray, Mr Mason, W. Shenstone,
                    Esq. Mr W. Collins, Lord Lyttelton, Mess. Wartons, Mr Blacklock, Mr Beattie, Mr
                    Ogilvie, etc. Vol.I. Second edition, with additions.” Edinb. 1764, 12mo. He
                    afterwards congratulated himself on having contributed to extend the popularity
                    of Gray and Shenstone in the northern part of the kingdom. It may be mentioned
                    as a proof of his classical taste, that at this early period of life he
                    entertained the highest admiration for the sublime odes of Gray, which he was
                    accustomed to recite in a wild and enthusiastic manner. In the year 1763, while
                    employed as a journeyman printer, he became a member of a literary association,
                    denominated the Miscellaneous Society, which was composed of students and other
                    young men anxious to exercise their talents and to improve their taste. This
                    juvenile society included other individuals who afterwards rose to distinction.
                    Among these we find Sir Robert Liston, who was employed in several important
                    embassies, and Mr Dalzel, who became professor of Greek in this university.</p>
                <p>About the same period he made an attempt to adapt Crebillon’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Rhadamisthe el Zenobie</hi> to the English stage. The manuscript was submitted
                    to the inspection of his two friends Liston and Dalzel; who, after a very
                    careful perusal, stated not a few objections to particular passages, though they
                    do not appear to have condemned the entire performance. This tragedy was at
                    length offered to Garrick: but Murphy’s Zenobia was at that time in rehearsal;
                    and if the merit of Russell’s play had been more conspicuous, it probably would
                    not have been accepted. In 1764, he issued proposals for publishing a second
                    volume of his collection of poems, which however did not make its appearance.
                    With the view of arranging his materials, he now retired to the country, and
                    about this period of his life he maintained an epistolary correspondence with
                    Lord Elibank, Dr Ogilvie, and Mr Dalzel, by all of whom he seems to have been
                    regarded as a young man of promising talents. In the course of the ensuing year,
                    Lord Elibank, who was himself a man of literature, invited him to his seat in
                    the county of Haddington, where he spent the greater part of the autumn, and had
                    an opportunity of conversing with many distinguished individuals. To this
                    nobleman he seems to have looked for favour and protection. The hope of
                    obtaining preferment through his influence, had induced him to relinquish his
                    original employment; and in the mean time he continued to prosecute his studies,
                    particularly in the departments of history and polite literature.</p>
                <p>Having resided with his father till the month of May 1767, he proceeded to London
                    in quest of honour and emolument. But his high hopes were speedily blasted; and
                    after having in vain waited for advancement through the influence of Mr Hume,
                    Lord Elibank, General Murray, and Governor Johnstone, he was under the necessity
                    of contracting his views, and engaging himself as a corrector of the press in
                    the great office of William Strahan, afterwards printer to his majesty. To find
                    himself thus placed in a situation so inadequate to his expectations, must have
                    cast a temporary gloom over his mind; but the freshness of youth, added to the
                    natural vivacity of his mind, would have enabled him to support even greater
                    disappointments. In some brief notices found among his papers after his death,
                    he mentions his expectations of preferment through the interest of these
                    individuals; but he does not aver that his hopes were founded on their promises.
                    The disappointments of human life may very frequently be traced to the
                    unreasonableness of our expectations.</p>
                <p>In the year 1769 he quitted the employment of Mr Strahan, and was engaged as
                    overseer of the printing office of Brown and Adlard. During the same year he
                    published an “Ode to Fortitude,” which was immediately reprinted at Edinburgh by
                    his former masters, Martin and Wotherspoon. His “Sentimental Tales” appeared in
                    1770; and from this time he contributed to the periodical publications many
                    essays in prose as well as verse. In 1772 he published a collection of “Fables,
                    Moral and Sentimental,” and “An Essay on the Character, Manners, and Genius of
                    Women, from the French of M. Thomas.” In 1774 he produced an octavo volume under
                    the title of “Julia, a Poetical Romance.” Of this work, which is founded on the
                    <hi rend="italic">Nouvelle Heloise</hi> of Rousseau, neither the plan nor the
                    execution can be commended. In the estimate of his literary character Russell
                    dissented from the public opinion: his historical works, which have met with a
                    very favourable reception, he considered as greatly inferior to his poetical
                    works, which have been totally neglected. But his friends certainly had no
                    reason to regret that the collective edition of his poems, which he long
                    meditated, never made its appearance. On the death of Hume he produced an elegy
                    which occasioned a sarcastic effusion from another poet. Mickle, who abhorred
                    the scepticism of Hume, and who believed himself to have been materially injured
                    by Smith, concludes his verses with this stanza:</p>
                <p>For him shall Russell rant and rave</p>
                <p>In hobbling rumbling lays;</p>
                <p>And Smith in barbarous sleepy prose</p>
                <p>Shall grunt and croak his praise.</p>
                <p>Russell is the author of the verses on the death of Dr Armstrong, subscribed W.
                    R. and dated from Gray’s Inn, Sept. 10, 1779, which are commonly printed with
                    the poems of that classical writer. Before this period he had apparently
                    relinquished his connexion with the printing-office, and had entirely devoted
                    himself to the pursuits of literature. His “History of America,” published in
                    numbers, was completed in the course of the same year. This work was received
                    with some degree of favour; hut the splendid merit of Dr Robertson’s history
                    precluded all competition. During the same year, 1779, he likewise published, in
                    octavo, the first two volumes of“The History of Modern Europe; with an account
                    of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, and a View of the Progress of
                    Society from the fifth to the eighteenth century. In a Series of Letters from a
                    Nobleman to his Son.” Their reception was so favourable as to exceed his most
                    sanguine expectations. His studies experienced a temporary interruption in 1780,
                    when he embarked for Jamaica in order to recover some money, due to him as the
                    heir of his brother James, who, after a residence of several years, had died in
                    that island. He after<pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:wu.89119129625&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=538" xml:id="kp-eb0719-0538-0526"
                    />wards resumed his historical labours, which were occasionally interrupted by
                    his love of poetry. In the year 1783 he published “The Tragic Muse,” a poem
                    addressed to Mrs Siddons. To address verses to a player has been considered as
                    beneath the dignity of the literary character. It would be a crime, said a
                    periodical writer, to sacrifice genius on such an uninteresting occasion: we
                    have more dignified subjects for the poetic Muse than an individual whose
                    excellence is only a dazzling meteor, and must be forgotten in a few years at
                    most. Players have sometimes been extravagantly extolled, particularly by
                    grateful or aspiring poets who have written for the stage, and it will doubtless
                    be granted that a poet may easily find a more dignified theme: but supreme
                    excellence in any ingenious art seems to be no improper subject of panegyric;
                    and so rare and difficult are the fleeting attainments of a great actor, that it
                    may be considered as a generous exertion of poetic talent to rescue them from
                    oblivion.</p>
                <p>The three volumes which completed the History of Modern Europe made their
                    appearance in 1784. From the manuscript notices to which we have already
                    referred, it appears that in the composition of each of these five volumes he
                    spent about twelve months. This work, which is the chief foundation of his
                    reputation, possesses great merit as a popular view of a very extensive period
                    of history. The author displays no inconsiderable judgment in the selection of
                    his leading incidents, and in the general arrangement of his materials; and he
                    seems to have studied the philosophy of history with assiduity and success. His
                    narrative is always free from languor; and his reflections are conveyed in a
                    lively and elegant style. It is however to be regretted that he should have
                    adopted the useless expedient of exhibiting his work as a series of letters from
                    a nobleman to his son: every reader is sufficiently aware that Dr Russell did
                    not belong to the order of nobility; and the frequent recurrence of “my dear
                    Philip,” is too apt to remind us of Lord Chesterfield. This work has very often
                    been reprinted, and it still continues to maintain its original popularity.
                    Russell closes his history with the peace of Paris in 1763. A continuation,
                    extending to two volumes, was added by the late Dr Coote; and another writer has
                    continued the narrative to the death of William the Fourth.</p>
                <p>In the year 1787 he married Isabella Scott, a lady of Eskdale, to whom he had
                    long been attached, and in whom he found a pleasant and intelligent companion.
                    He now entered upon the occupation of a comfortable farm at Knottyholm, in the
                    parish of Canonby and county of Dumfries. He fixed his residence in an elegant
                    cottage, delightfully placed on the brink of the Esk, and at the distance of
                    about five miles from the town of Langholm. This may well be described as “a
                    land of brooks of water, of fountains and depths that spring out of valleys and
                    hills.” A more beautiful tract of pastoral country than that which extends for
                    about twelve miles along the banks of the river, it would not perhaps be very
                    easy to mention. Here he spent the remainder of his days. In this neighbourhood
                    there were several intelligent individuals, with whom he lived in habits of
                    intimacy. Of these the most conspicuous was the late Mr Maxwell, who was
                    eminently distinguished for his scientific skill in music. <note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>John Maxwell, Esq. of Broomholm was born in
                    the year 1726. In July 1754 he succeeded to an estate which has now belonged to
                    the family for more than two centuries. His father was William Maxwell, his
                    mother was a daughter of Scott of Wool in Selkirkshire. By his wife, Wilhelmina
                    Malcolm, he had nine sons, of whom only one now survives. Her father was
                    minister of Ewes, and the grandfather of the late Sir John Malcolm. Mr Maxwell
                    was for many years a justice of the peace and a deputy lieutenant of the county
                    of Dumfries. He was a remarkably handsome man, about six feet high, and
                    possessing a pleasing address. Broomholm, two miles from Langholm, and three
                    from Dr Russell’s place of residence, stands in a delightful valley near the
                    junction of the Esk and Tarras, and is surrounded by extensive and lofty woods.
                    He published, but without his name, “An Essay upon Tune; being an Attempt to
                    free the Scale of Music, and the Tune of Instruments, from Imperfection.” Edinb.
                    1781, 8vo. Pp. 290. The ingenious author died in the month of March 1806, at the
                    age of seventy-nine years and ten months. He had a brother named Walter and a
                    sister named Mary. She was the wife of Mr John Little of Langholm, and the
                    mother of the late Colonel Little, so highly distinguished in the wars of India.
                    </p></note></p>
                <p>He had now acquired the reputation of a very popular historian; and in 1792 the
                    university of St Andrews conferred upon him the degree of LL. D. Academical
                    honours have sometimes been more unworthily bestowed. The very favourable
                    reception of his last publication had induced him to retrace his steps; and
                    during the following year he published at London, in two volumes octavo, “The
                    History of Ancient Europe; with a View of the Revolutions in Asia and Africa. In
                    a Series of Letters to a young Nobleman.” In the composition of this work, he
                    professes to have been peculiarly studious to found his facts on original
                    authorities, and to clear the narrative of unimportant events. He seems however
                    to have allotted too many of his pages to the poetical details of the Trojan
                    war. This production partakes of the peculiar merits of his modern history; but
                    as the author did not live to complete his design, it never attained to the same
                    popularity. Of these two volumes, the greater proportion relates to the history
                    of Greece; and the same ground has recently been trodden by Dr Gillies and Mr
                    Mitford. Dr Coote, having afterwards been induced to supply what he had left
                    deficient, published “The History of Ancient Europe; in a Series of Letters from
                    a Gentleman to his Son: intended as an accompaniment to Dr Russell’s History of
                    Modern Europe.” Lond. 1815, 3 vols. 8vo.</p>
                <p>Dr Russell did not long survive the publication of his last work. A stroke of
                    palsy suddenly terminated his life, on the 25th of December 1793, after he had
                    completed the fifty-second year of his age. His remains were interred in
                    Westerkirk churchyard, where a plain mural stone distinguishes his grave. He
                    left a widow, who died a few years ago, and an only child, a daughter, who still
                    survives, and continues to reside at Knottyholm.</p>
                <p>He had engaged in various projects which he did not live to execute. Besides two
                    complete tragedies, entitled Zenobia and Pyrrhus, he left in manuscript “An
                    Analysis of Bryant’s Ancient Mythology,” and the following unfinished
                    productions. 1. The Earl of Strafford, a tragedy. 2. Modern Life, a comedy. 3.
                    The Love-Marriage, an opera. 4. Human Happiness, a poem, intended to have been
                    completed in four books. 5. An Historical and Philosophical View of the Progress
                    of Mankind in the Knowledge of the Terraqueous Globe. 6. The History of Modern
                    Europe, part iii. from the peace of Paris in 1763, to the general pacification
                    in 1783, including an Account of the American War, and of the European
