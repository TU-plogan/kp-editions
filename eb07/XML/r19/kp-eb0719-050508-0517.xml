                    significant corrections to the OCR text, predominantly in cases of confusing "c"

                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra
                    space around the <gi>pb</gi> tag. Where a word is hyphenated at a <gi>pb</gi>,

                <p><label type="entry">ROTTERDAM</label> a city of the kingdom of Holland, and the
                    capital of the circle of its own name. It is situated on the right bank of the
                    river Maese, which here receives the waters of the river Rotte. It is a
                    well-built city, in an antique style, with abundance of fine and large houses,
                    many of them five or six stories in height. The Boomjee, a row of houses facing
                    the river, with a broad quay between, planted with trees, is perhaps one of the
                    finest promenades in Europe. The city is intersected with canals, and by means
                    of them the goods from ships are brought to the warehouses of the merchants,
                    which are at the backs of their houses; and by the same means the productions
                    intended for exportation are brought to the several places of deposit.</p>
                <p>The markets also are supplied from the country by means of these canals; and on
                    the market-days, instead of the roads being filled with carts and waggons, the
                    canals are crowded with country barges. These barges are drawn . more by men
                    than horses, and indeed horses are rarely seen in the streets. Many of the
                    public buildings are of a magnificent appearance. Amongst these, that of the
                    defunct East India Company, now added to the customhouse, may be viewed with
                    admiration. The house of the assembly of the ancient states of Zealand was built
                    at an early period of the establishment of the independence of the United
                    States. It is spacious, being in the most sumptuous style of the architecture of
                    that age; and when Bonaparte assumed the sovereignty of the country, it was
                    decorated and furnished for his residence at the expense of the city. The
                    ancient stadthouse has been appropriated to other than its original purpose;
                    atad a new modern building has been erected, whose portico although massive, is
                    elegant, as far as regards the pillars that support it. The ecclesiastical
                    buildings belonging to the Calvinists are the most ancient and the largest,
                    particularly the church of St Lawrence. It has an organ, lately erected, of the
                    greatest power of any in existence, and said to contain eight hundred pipes more
                    than the celebrated organ of Harlem. The Lutheran church is a large and fine
                    building. There are three churches where the service is in English; one for the
                    Episcopalian, one for the Kirk of Scotland, and one for Independents, in the
                    latter of which the celebrated Hugh Peters once officiated.</p>
                <p>The trade of Rotterdam is very extensive. That to the West Indies, has declined
                    of late years, but that to the East Indies, chiefly to Batavia, has been
                    recently very beneficial; and its commerce for the last fifteen years has
                    increased more rapidly than that of any town in the kingdom. The fishery is an
                    extensive source of employment and wealth. The trade with the Baltic employs
                    much shipping, and affords moderate-priced corn for the distillers of gin. The
                    business of ship-building employs many persons, both in the government arsenal
                    and in the private docks; and the vessels now built are admirably constructed
                    and equipped. The supply of colonial produce to the interior of Germany by the
                    Rhine is very beneficial. The population of the city amounted in 1832 to 72,294.
