                <p><label type="entry">RASK</label> Erasmus, an eminent scholar and philologist, was
                    born at Brendekild, in the island of Even, in the year 1784. He studied at the
                    university of Copenhagen, and early distinguished himself by his singular talent
                    for the acquisition of languages. In the year 1808, he was appointed assistant
                    keeper of the University Library, and some years afterwards made professor of
                    Literary History. In 1811, he published, in the Danish language, his
                    Introduction to the Grammar of the Icelandic and other Ancient Northern
                    Languages, the materials of which were entirely derived from the immense mass of
                    manuscript and printed works which had been accumulated by his predecessors in
                    the same field of research. This grammar appears to have given a fresh impulse
                    to the study of the ancient northern languages, even in Germany. The reputation
                    which Rask acquired by it recommended him to the Arna-Magnaean Institution, by
                    which he was employed as editor of the Icelandic Lexico of Biorne Haldorsen,</p>

                <p>which had long remained in manuscript To this work, which appeared in 1814,
                    Bishop Miiller contributed a preface, in which he pronounces a just eulogium on
                    the talents and the spirit of research displayed by the youthful editor. About
                    the same time, Rask, who had never been in Iceland, paid a visit to that
                    country, where he remained from 1813 to 1815, during which time he made himself
                    completely master of the language, and familiarized himself with the literature,
                    manners, and customs of the natives. To the interest with which they inspired
                    him, may probably be attributed the establishment at Copenhagen, early in 1816,
                    of the Icelandic Literary Society, which was mainly instituted by his exertions,
                    and of which he had the honour to be the first president.</p>
                <p>Whilst thus employed, however, he was about to enter upon a more ample field pf
                    enterprise. In October 1816, he left Denmark on a literary expedition, which had
                    been fitted out for the double purpose of prosecuting inquiries into the
                    languages of the East, and collecting manuscripts for the University Library at
                    Copenhagen. The king of Denmark having liberally provided him with the requisite
                    means, he proceeded first to Sweden, where he remained two years, in the course
                    of which he made an excursion into Finland, for the purpose of studying the
                    language of that country. Here he published, in Swedish, his Anglo-Saxon
                    Grammar, in 1817; and during the same year there appeared at Copenhagen, in
                    Danish, an Essay on the Origin of the Ancient Scandinavian or Icelandic Tongue,
                    in which he traced the affinity of that remarkable idiom to the other European
                    languages, particularly to the Latin and the Greek. In 1818, he published a
                    second edition, very much improved, of his Icelandic Grammar, translated by
                    himself into Swedish; and in the course of the same year he also brought out the
                    first complete editions of Snorro’s Edda, and Saemund’s Edda, in the original
                    text, along with Swedish translations of both Ed-das, the originals and the
                    versions occupying each two volumes. From Stockholm he proceeded, in 1819, to St
                    Petersburg, where he wrote in German an interesting paper on the Languages and
                    Litcrature of Norway, Iceland, Sweden, and Finland, which was published in the
                    sixth number of the ViennaJahrbucher. From Russia, which he traversed, he
                    proceeded through Tartary into Persia, and resided for some time at Tauris,
                    Teheran, Persepolis, and Shiraz. It may be mentioned here, as an instance of his
                    remarkable facility in acquiring languages, that, in about six weeks, he made
                    himself sufficiently master of the Persian to be able to converse freely in that
                    language with the natives. In 1820, he embarked at Abuschekr, in the Persian
                    Gulf; for Bombay, which he reached in safety; and during his residence there he
                    wrote, in English, a Dissertation on the Authenticity of the Zend Language,
                    which he addressed to the governor, the Hon. Mountstuart Elphinstone, and which
                    was afterwards published in the third volume of the Transactions of the Literary
                    Society of Bombay. The same production, with corrections and additions, was
                    afterwards deemed worthy of insertion in the Transactions of the Royal Asiatic
                    Society. From Bombay he proceeded through India to Ceylon, where he arrived in
                    1822, and soon afterwards wrote, in English, a Dissertation respecting the best
                    Method of expressing the Sounds of the Indian Languages in European Characters,
                    which was printed in the Transactions of the Literary and Agricultural Society
                    of Colombo. Professor Rask, having at length completed his researches on the
                    scale prescribed, set out for Europe, and reached Copenhagen in the beginning of
                    May 1823, after an absence of nearly seven years. He brought home with him a
                    considerable collection of rare and curious oriental manuscripts, Persian, Zend,
                    Pali, Cingalese, and others, which now enrich the university and royal libraries
                    of the Danish capital.</p>
                <p>Notwithstanding all his labours and exertions, this indefatigable scholar
                    scarcely allowed himself an interval of re-</p>
                <p>VOL. xix.</p>
                <p>pose. Between the period of his return from the East and that of his death, which
                    occurred far too soon for the interests of philology, Professor Rask published
                    in his native language a Spanish Grammar in 1824, an Italian Grammar and a
                    Frisic Grammar in 1825, a Treatise respecting the Ancient Egyptian Chronology in
                    1827, the Ancient Jewish Chronology previous to Moses in 1828, and an Essay on
                    Danish Orthography in the same year. He likewise edited an edition of
                    Schneider’s Danish Grammar for the use of Englishmen in 1829, and superintended
                    the English translation of his Anglo-Saxon Grammar in 1830. This last work
                    supplies what had long been a desideratum in English literature. Before its
                    appearance, persons whose taste might dispose them to investigate our early
                    vernacular remains, had no guides to direct them, and each had to form for
                    himself a Grammar and a Dictionary of the Saxon. Hickes’ was full of blunders,
                    and in these Elstob, Lye, Manning, and others had religiously followed him,
                    superadding their own contingents respectively. By the publication of Rask’s
                    Saxon Grammar, however, we were to a certain degree freed from this lamentable
                    state of things, and facilities were affordedfor the acquisition of the
                    language, which previously had no existence. The attentive student will at once
                    perceive the important light which he has thrown upon its principles, by what he
                    has advanced regarding accentuation, in all which the soundness of his views is
                    fully supported by the manuscripts. He has divided nouns into simple and
                    complex, and adjectives into definite and indefinite; a division which is new to
                    us in this country, and, by its simplicity of arrangement, forms a striking
                    contrast to the endless subdivisions, exceptions, and annotations of Hickes. But
                    it is in the investigation of the verbs that Rask appears to the greatest
                    advantage. His classification of them is simple and obvious; nor can there be a
                    better proof of his accuracy than the perfect order and regularity which it
                    enables us to detect in numerous formations previously considered as irregular.
                    His observations on prefixes and postfixes are written with less care, and he
                    has also treated the important branch of syntax in too slight and perfunctory a
                    manner; omissions which excite some surprise, in a scholar possessing such an
                    entire mastery over the Anglo-Saxon.</p>
                <p>We must return to the author himself, however, one of whose last literary efforts
                    we have thus incidentally noticed. In private life the character of Professor
                    Rask was such as to command admiration and respect. His manners, though somewhat
                    retiring, were mild and gentle, and his morals unimpeachable. His mode of living
                    was simple in the extreme, and his temperance that of an anchoret. The habits of
                    Study and application which he had acquired in his youth were never laid aside.
                    In company he was diffident, and always expressed himself with modesty; but when
                    the subject involved any thing relative to his own history or pursuits, he
                    evinced a reluctance to converse, which seemed to grow upon him with years, and
                    almost amounted to a morbid sensibility. His facility in the acquisition of
                    languages was extraordinary; he appeared to gain a knowledge of them by a sort
                    of intuition, and his mind seemed to recollect rather than to learn. In 1822, he
                    was master of no less than twenty-five languages and dialects. His knowledge of
                    English was extensive and correct. He spoke and wrote it with such fluency and
                    precision, that Englishmen to whom he was introduced were accustomed to ask him
                    how long he had been in England, considering that such an acquaintance could
                    only be gained by a residence in the country where it was spoken. Risk, in his
                    personal appearance, was thin and spare, but well made; his habits of
                    temperance, regularity, and exercise, had contributed to give him all the
                    appearance of a healthy man, and he seemed destined to attain a ripe old age. He
                    was capable of enduring much fatigue, and even the privation of necessary rest;
                    changes of climate seemed to produce no impression upon his constitution;</p>

                <p>the scorching sun of India, and the biting frosts of Iceland, were equally braved
                    and disregarded. But, with all this apparent superiority to ordinary
                    infirmities, he fell a victim to consumption, brought on, it is believed, by
                    those habits of intense application, and abstinence from proper nutriment, to
                    which we have already alluded; and he died at that period of life (forty-eight)
                    when the faculties of the human mind have little more than attained their
                    maturity, leaving behind him a name that will not soon be forgotten.</p>
                <p>The acquirements of Professor Rask were multifarious and extraordinary, and such
                    as justly entitled him to our respect and admiration. There never perhaps
                    existed any scholar whose study of language had been directed to a wider circle,
                    and assuredly none who had made the structure of language so much an object of
                    attention. He was the great comparative anatomist of philology; not building up
                    theories out of scattered fragments, collected as it were by accident, but
                    drawing his conclusions from the most profound and elaborate research, and, by
                    comparison, comprehension, and exhaustion, initiating us into those curious
                    inquiries which have for the most part been perfunctorily handled by the
                    majority of critics. Not that Rask’s writings have enabled the world to form an
                    accurate estimate of his extraordinary learning. To have written the best
                    Icelandic, and the bes t Anglo-Saxon Grammar; to have tracked, through Hebrew or
                    Kieroglyphical records, the chronology of the Egyptian kings; to have edited
                    Eddas or Sagas, and carried oft' prizes for essays on this or the other limited
                    inquiry; all these constituted little compared to what this extraordinary man
                    was capable of effecting, had it pleased God to prolong his life. He was one of
                    the few men qualified to write on philology, with a sufficient knowledge of the
                    subject in all its bearings; who had seen with his own eyes, and heard with his
                    own ears, the tribes and the tongues which overspread the surface of the globe;
                    who, if he had not girdled the whole earth, had at least explored those tracts
                    in which so many nations were cradled; and who, travelling throughout the East
                    in quest of philological knowledge, carried with him a mind so well trained, and
                    exercised, and cultivated, that nothing could be wasted upon it of this we have
                    ample evidence furnished to us at every stage in his protracted expedition. His
                    progress was like that of Fame in Virgil, continually gaining fresh accessions
                    of knowledge, and increasing in intellectual stature, but, unlike the
                    impersonation of the poet, never raising aloft his head so as to plunge it into
                    the region of the clouds. His primary object was the collection of sufficient
                    materials to serve as the basis of a most enlarged induction; his next was to
                    employ analysis or resolution in decomposing, separating, and classifying these
                    materials, so as to render them disposable for the purposes of general
                    investigation; and his last by synthetical reasoning, to lay a solid foundation
                    for the science of philology, and to deduce those general laws of connection,
                    resemblance, or filiation, which may be discovered in every branch of the great
                    family of languages. He lived to accomplish the first, and he had even entered
                    upon his analytical labours, when exhausted nature sunk under the toil, and the
                    grave swallowed up the fruits of all his researches. Rask was no theorist; and,
                    if his life had happily been prolonged, he would have finally settled the
                    question, which has long been agitated, viz. whether induction be really
                    applicable as an instrument of investigation and discovery in the science of
                    philology, (a.)</p>
