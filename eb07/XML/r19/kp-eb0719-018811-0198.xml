                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra

                <p><label type="entry">RETICULATION</label>. Of all the devices which man has
                    invented wherewithal to secure to himself the “dominion over the fish of the sea
                    and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle,” few can plead greater
                    antiquity than reticulation; none has retained its place as an essential item in
                    the catalogue of useful engines so permanently, through all ages and changes, as
                    the net. Other weapons and instruments have either fallen into total disuse
                    before the gigantic strides of improvement, or now only minister to our
                    recreation; but the net, to this hour, forms an indispensable part of the
                    apparatus used by many of the industrious classes of society. As a means of
                    supplying us with a variety of wholesome food, and of enabling us to carry on an
                    extensive commerce with other nations, net-making becomes an art of some
                    importance; and, as an agreeable occupation to the amateur, it may be reckoned
                    among the chief in point of domestic utility; and therefore is not in either
                    case to be placed “next to mere idleness in the scale of insignificance.”
                    Fishing-net making is decidedly now the most extensive branch of reticulation,
                    how serviceable soever it may be for other purposes. To say nothing of the
                    shapes of the various engines of this kind used in our fisheries, their texture
                    is the best that human ingenuity has been able to conceive; for, when wet, they
                    are easily dried, when torn, easily mended; they offer little resistance when
                    drawn out of the water, whereby the labour of hauling them is greatly
                    diminished; the risk of their being overthrown or carried away by tides,
                    currents, or storms, is lessened; and the more shy fish are not so easily scared
                    away as they otherwise would be by toils more densely wrought; the sand, the
                    mud, the young fry and spawn, the small insects and other animals inhabiting the
                    waters, find a free passage through the meshes, and thus much wanton destruction
                    of animal life is prevented, whilst a larger abundance and a more regular supply
                    of fish is obtained than by any other mode. Such are some of the advantages
                    which principally <pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:wu.89119129625&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=199" xml:id="kp-eb0719-0199-0189"
                    />result from the delicacy of texture and rarity which, comparatively speaking,
                    all nets exhibit, when fairly used, and no contrivances adopted for abusively
                    increasing the take. The forms of nets vary according to the manner in which
                    they are intended to act, and this is either by entangling the fish in their
                    complicated folds, as in the <hi rend="italic">trammel,</hi> receiving them into
                    pockets, as in the <hi rend="italic">trawl,</hi> suspending them by the body in
                    the meshes, as in the <hi rend="italic">mackerel-net,</hi> imprisoning them
                    within their labyrinth-like <hi rend="italic">chambers,</hi> as in the <hi
                    rend="italic">stake-net,</hi> or drawing them to shore, as in the <hi
                    rend="italic">seine.</hi> It is somewhat extraordinary that it was not until the
                    year 1685 that nets were introduced into Norway, by one Claus Niels Sti-ningen.
                    The fishermen set up a general outcry against so <hi rend="italic">pernicious an
                    innovation,</hi> and, after much disputing, the question was decided by an
                    appeal to the law, and experience has confirmed the verdict, that nets are not
                    only not prejudicial, but highly conducive to the prosperity of the fishing
                    trade. Of the antiquity of the art of net-making it will not be necessary to
                    enter into any detail; that nets were invented at a very early period, and have
                    been universally adopted all over the world, and were, and have been ever since,
                    put to an infinite variety of uses, requires no farther proof than can be
                    afforded by a reference to the works of the most ancient authors, both sacred
                    and profane, by whom constant allusion is made to network; and modern travellers
                    have found it to be in vogue amongst the most rude as well as the most polished
                    nations. For much curious information on this head we must refer the reader to
                    <hi rend="italic">Beckmann.</hi><note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    use of the net, however, though known to the ancients, and long since adopted in
                    Italy and other hot climates, has only quite recently, and hitherto but
                    partially, been recognised in this country. It deserves notice, not solely on
                    account of its exhibiting a curious phenomenon in the habits of certain insects
                    highly interesting to the naturalist, but, for the sake of humanity, it is
                    worthy also of the attention of the philanthropist. It has been found by careful
                    experiments that a net made of the finest thread, of any colour, and with meshes
                    of one inch and a quarter square, effectually keeps out the house-fly from the
                    apartments across the open windows of which it is spread. <note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See the Transactions of the Entomological
                    Society of London, vol. ii. </p></note> We must leave it to others to speculate
                    upon the causes which operate on the imagination of the gnat and house-fly, so
                    as to prevent them venturing through the “capacious breadth of these divisions.”
                    It has been suggested with much probability, that an optical delusion in the
                    eyes of these insects produces this wonderful effect. The fact having been so
                    well ascertained, what is there, except prejudice, to prevent our taking
                    advantage of it, as affording, at a very trifling expense, and with very little
                    trouble, a material comfort, not only to “the whole,” but to “the sick ?” How
                    refreshing will it prove to many a poor helpless sufferer to feel that he can
                    enjoy in hot weather the luxury of fresh air, free from the irksome attacks of
                    these persevering, buzzing, biting disturbers of his peace, at a time when he
                    most needs repose, and every palliative that art can suggest! But our limits
                    warn us to commence our practical directions relating to our subject. 1. <hi
                    rend="italic">Tools and terms used by net-makers ;— Accrues, false meshes,</hi>
                    or <hi rend="italic">quarterings,</hi> are loops inserted in any given row, by
                    which the number of meshes is increased. To <hi rend="italic">bread</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">breathe</hi> a net, is to make a net. <hi rend="italic">Dead</hi>
                    netting is a piece without either <hi rend="italic">accrues,</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">stole</hi> (stolen) meshes, which last means that a mesh is taken
                    away by netting into two meshes of the preceding row at once, thereby
                    diminishing the net at any part. The <hi rend="italic">head</hi> of a net is the
                    upper margin, along which the corks are strung upon a rope called the <hi
                    rend="italic">head-rope.</hi> The <hi rend="italic">foot</hi> of a net is the
                    opposite or lower margin, which carries the <hi rend="italic">foot-rope,</hi> on
                    which, in many cases, leaden plummets are made fast. <hi rend="italic">Over</hi>
                    means wide, as a <hi rend="italic">day-net</hi> is three fathoms long, and one
                    <hi rend="italic">over</hi> or wide. The <hi rend="italic">lever</hi> is the
                    first row of a net. <hi rend="italic">Meslws</hi> are the squares composing the
                    net. A <hi rend="italic">needle</hi> is the instrument used for holding and
                    netting the material to be netted; it is made with an <hi rend="italic">eye</hi>
                    E, a <hi rend="italic">tongue</hi> T, and <hi rend="italic">a. fork</hi> F, fig.
                    1, Plate CCCCXXXV. The twine is wound on it by being passed alternately between
                    the <hi rend="italic">fork</hi> and round the <hi rend="italic">tongue,</hi> so
                    that the turns of the string lie parallel to the length of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >needle,</hi> and are kept on by the <hi rend="italic">tongue</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">fork.</hi> A short <hi rend="italic">needle,</hi> about four
                    inches long, should be set apart for <hi rend="italic">mending.</hi> A <hi
                    rend="italic">spool</hi> or <hi rend="italic">rnesh-pin</hi> is a round (fig. 2)
                    or a flat (fig. 3) piece of wood, on which the <hi rend="italic">loops</hi> are
                    formed; the circumference of the <hi rend="italic">spool</hi> determining the
                    size of the <hi rend="italic">loops.</hi> Each <hi rend="italic">loop</hi>
                    contains two sides of the square mesh; therefore, supposing that it be required
                    to make a mesh one inch square, that is, measuring one inch from knot to knot, a
                    <hi rend="italic">spool</hi> two inches circumference must he used. Large meshes
                    may be formed by giving the twine two or more turns round the <hi rend="italic"
                    >spool,</hi> as occasion may require, or the <hi rend="italic">spool</hi> may be
                    made flat, and of a sufficient width, having a portion cut away to admit the
                    finger and thumb to grasp it conveniently (fig. 3). A pair of <hi rend="italic"
                    >round-pointed scissors,</hi> so as to be carried conveniently in the pocket,
                    and a <hi rend="italic">knife,</hi> are likewise indispensable. To <hi
                    rend="italic">return on your work</hi> is, when, in <hi rend="italic"
                    >breading</hi> a cylindrical net, you stop at any given point, turn your work
                    and net back again, instead of going on round and round, as in forming the <hi
                    rend="italic">regard</hi> of the <hi rend="italic">hoop</hi> net; which is a
                    slit made in that engine, through which the fisherman introduces his hand to
                    extract the fish caught therein, when he goes to <hi rend="italic">look
                    (regarder,</hi> French) what success he has had. <hi rend="italic">Taught,</hi>
                    tight; the twine is pulled <hi rend="italic">taught</hi> when a knot is made. 2.
                    <hi rend="italic">How to make the loop or stitch in netting.</hi> Being so
                    generally understood that any neighbour can in a few minutes teach the
                    uninitiated, we shall not describe the process; a little careful observation
                    will show more than any written description can, however minute. 3. The same may
                    be said <hi rend="italic">of making accrues.</hi> It will be easily understood
                    how a very simple manoeuvre, when put in practice, becomes apparently
                    complicated when described in words. It would be idle were we, under the plea of
                    rendering this article complete, to encumber it with laboured explanations, if
                    they can be called such, which leave the reader more in the dark than he was
                    before. 4. The <hi rend="italic">bend-knot</hi> is constantly required for
                    uniting two ends of twine together, &amp;c., and is thus performed. See fig. 4,
                    in which A and B are to be joined. 5. <hi rend="italic">The art of mending</hi>
                    is of great importance; for, if the fisherman cannot mend an occasional rent, he
                    will soon be obliged to have a new net. Two or three damaged meshes will, if
                    neglected, speedily become a yawning hole; whereas the engine will last a long
                    time by taking care to replace injured parts properly, and without delay. By
                    amateur netters and gamekeepers this part of the art of reticulation is
                    generally unheeded, and a bungling confusion of threads, drawn together any how,
                    serving rather to increase the mischief, is substituted for a neat and efficient
                    repair. In order to explain, as clearly as may be, the method to be pursued, we
                    must request the reader to suppose that a net (fig. 5) has an injury in the
                    middle of the space indicated by the dotted lines. We must begin by <hi
                    rend="italic">cutting</hi> the net, that is, the hole must be enlarged, not only
                    by removing that portion which is actually torn, but by cutting into the sound
                    parts. This operation is represented in fig. 5. The parts to be cut away are
                    marked by the transverse lines <hi rend="italic">baa a, cba a ad,</hi> below the
                    knots of the original net. It will be observed that, whereas at <hi
                    rend="italic">a a a c, α a a d,</hi> two sides of the meshes are cut,</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="ht:wu.89119129625&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=200"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0719-0200-0190"/>
                <p><hi rend="italic">one</hi> only is removed at <hi rend="italic">b b.</hi> In
                    performing this manoeuvre the workman must be careful to have his net hung
                    before him in its proper position, viz. in the order in which the rows were
                    netted, as in fig. 5. This requires attention, because, if either of the sides
                    <hi rend="italic">c</hi> or <hi rend="italic">d</hi> were uppermost, the
                    mischief would be increased when he came to cut away according to the above
                    instructions. The next thing to be done is to unpick the knots of the old
                    meshes, α, a, a, <hi rend="italic">a, a, a;</hi> but the lateral knots <hi
                    rend="italic">c, d,</hi> must <hi rend="italic">not</hi> be unpicked, for that
                    would destroy the adjoining sound meshes; for the same reason, only <hi
                    rend="italic">one</hi> side of the meshes ό, <hi rend="italic">b</hi> is cut. We
                    must Suppose, then, that the meshes represented by the dotted fines are entirely
                    removed; the next thing to be done is to replace them. It is evident that this
                    cannot be properly accomplished unless the inserted meshes resemble as
                    accurately as possible those that have been removed. A practised hand will
                    effect this without a spool, but some skilful workmen think that it is
                    infinitely less troublesome, and that the required regularity of the meshes is
                    better insured, if a spool be used suitable to the meshes of the old net. Having
                    filled a <hi rend="italic">small</hi> needle with twine, make fast the end above
                    the knot at K (fig. S), hold the spool and needle in the usual way, and take up
                    the loops L, M, N, as in common netting; when at N, lay aside the spool, and
                    make the side NO. This is done by means of the <hi rend="italic">bend-knob</hi>
                    the angle P being the <hi rend="italic">bend</hi> or loop of the knot. The
                    second row is now to be netted in the same way as the first, and so on with the
                    rest, the single side at the end of each row being managed as at NO, and leading
                    down to the row beneath. We have supposed the workman to have begun and ended
                    this first row, netting from left to right; to work back the second row, he has
                    simply to get on the other side of his net, or to turn the latter over, as may
                    be most convenient, and thus to net on as usual from left to right, changing at
                    the end of each row either the position of his net or of his own person. We
                    shall next suppose that the required number of rows, save one, is completed; we
                    must insert a <hi rend="italic">junction</hi> row between the row QRST, and that
                    of the old net VWXY. This is done without a spool, by making the side TV fast at
                    V with a <hi rend="italic">bend-knot</hi> round the loop of the <hi
                    rend="italic">old</hi> net at V; then the side VS with a <hi rend="italic"
                    >bend-knot</hi> at S, round the loop of the <hi rend="italic">new</hi> piece at
                    S; then the sides SW, WR, RX, XQ, QY, in the same manner. Care must be taken
                    that these sides be of the same length as the sides of the other meshes. At the
                    beginning K and the end Y of your work, leave ends <hi rend="italic">e e,</hi>
                    to prevent the knot slipping. In fig. 5 three rows have been removed, and it
                    will be seen that those loops which have only <hi rend="italic">one</hi> side
                    removed, are diagonally opposite to each other, and thus it is when an <hi
                    rend="italic">uneven</hi> number of rows is to be cut away; but when an <hi
                    rend="italic">even</hi> number is removed, those loops of which only one side is
                    cut are at opposite angles of the orifice, but on the same side of the square.
                    6. <hi rend="italic">Oblong and square netting.</hi> If it be required to have
                    the net with meshes setting in squares with their sides, accurately at right
                    angles with each other, like the squares in a sash-window-frame, the following
                    method is to be pursued. Net one loop for the first row, draw the spool out and
                    net two loops for the second row, the additional loop being obtained by taking
                    up that one loop which formed your first row twice, or, as it is technically
                    termed, <hi rend="italic">by setting in a false mesh.</hi> Your second row will
                    thus consist of two loops. Remove the spool, begin the third row, which is to
                    consist of three loops, the additional one being gained as before. Continue thus
                    adding a loop at the <hi rend="italic">end of</hi> each row until you have made
                    your half square as large as you require; the two <hi rend="italic"
                    >selvages</hi> on each side of your netting forming two sides of your square;
                    then, before you begin to form the other two sides of your square, net one row
                    of <hi rend="italic">dead</hi> netting, i. e. do not increase or diminish
                    anywhere; but at the <hi rend="italic">end</hi> of the following rows set in a
                    <hi rend="italic">stole</hi> mesh, i. e. take up the two last loops of the row
                    together. Your net will at last be reduced to one loop again, and will, when
                    stretched out, form a complete square, and all the meshes will stand square with
                    each other. But, supposing you want your net to be longer than it is wide, and
                    yet the meshes composing it to be square, as in the other, you are to proceed as
                    follows: Form half a square as before, the length of one side of which will
                    determine the width of the oblong to be made. When this is done, you must set in
                    a <hi rend="italic">false mesh</hi> at the <hi rend="italic">end</hi> of one
                    row, and a <hi rend="italic">stole</hi> mesh at the <hi rend="italic">end</hi>
                    of the other row. Continue thus adding and diminishing <hi rend="italic"
                    >alternately,</hi> until your oblong is of the required length, aad this is
                    ascertained by measuring the long side of the netting from α to <hi
                    rend="italic">b</hi> (fig. 6), from the corner at <hi rend="italic">a</hi> to
                    the last knot at <hi rend="italic">b.</hi> Finish off so as to net the part
                    expressed by dotted lines in fig. 6, as you did in the case of the square net,
                    viz. by taking two loops up at once at the <hi rend="italic">end of each</hi>
                    row. In the <hi rend="italic">oblong</hi> you need not net a row of plain loops
                    before you begin to finish off, as was done in the <hi rend="italic">square
                    net.</hi> Oblong and square nets, when worked as now directed, will, when
                    finished, appear in the shape of a lozenge, and so will all the meshes of which
                    they are composed; but when stretched out with the sides at right angles, each
                    to the other, the whole net will assume its proper shape. It adds to the
                    finished appearance of the net, if, in making the last single loop of the net,
                    the spool be withdrawn before the knot is <hi rend="italic">taught,</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">then</hi> draw the twine up; the last loop is thus, as it were,
                    <hi rend="italic">absorbed,</hi> instead of remaining there to spoil the
                    neatness of the work. The single loop, too, with which the net was begun, may
                    have its knot sufficiently loosened to enable the workman to tighten up the loop
                    and make it <hi rend="italic">vanish,</hi> as he did at the other end. A little
                    practice will demonstrate this clearly.</p>
                <p>Many net-makers consider it a great saving both of time and twine to make their
                    <hi rend="italic">hay-nets,</hi> and the like, after this manner; besides which,
                    the <hi rend="italic">selvage</hi> thus formed along each side of the net
                    affords sufficient strength without any additional cord to border it. 7. <hi
                    rend="italic">How to net a round or cylindrical net without having to join.</hi>
                    Net any given number of loops, and, when you come to the end of the row, instead
                    of turning the net over to net a second, keep the spool in the last loop, and
                    with the needle pick up the <hi rend="italic">first</hi> loop of the row just
                    finished, and net into it in the usual manner; thus the row will be united.
                    Continue to take up each loop on your right hand in succession, as in ordinary
                    netting, and thus go on netting round and round until you have obtained the
                    required length. The rows will resemble the turns of a spiral spring descending
                    from the top to the bottom. 8. <hi rend="italic">How to make a bag-net from a
                    square.</hi> Net a piece of <hi rend="italic">dead netting</hi> containing any
                    given number of loops in the row, observing always an <hi rend="italic">odd</hi>
                    number, as 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, according to the proposed size of the bag; net double
                    the number of rows that there are loops in the row save one, as 5, 9, 13, 17,
                    21. This done, draw the foundation string, viz. the string on which you netted
                    the <hi rend="italic">lever,</hi> and fix it in the middle of your square, then
                    net round and round it. The corner loops must be carefully worked for the first
                    few rounds, to make them set even. It is always in the workman’s power to
                    increase the circumference of his bag as he proceeds from the bottom to the
                    mouth, by setting in <hi rend="italic">false meshes.</hi> In doing this,
                    however, he must observe regularity, and take care to insert his <hi
                    rend="italic">quarterings</hi> at equal distances, else the net will be
                    lop-sided, and distorted. 9. <hi rend="italic">Of joining two nets
                    together.</hi> Apply one net on the other, supposing each to contain the same
                    number of meshes in the rows to be united, and that the meshes are of the same
                    size; then, with a spool a full quarter less in size than that on which the nets
                    were <hi rend="italic">breaded,</hi> net one row along the margins to be joined,
                    taking up two loops on the needle, i. <hi rend="italic">e.</hi> one mesh of each
                    net together; or, if the object be to join the first with the last row of the
                    same net,</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="ht:wu.89119129625&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=201"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0719-0201-0191"/>
                <p>the two rows must be accurately placed one upon the other, by folding the net
                    over on itself; then proceed as before. Sea-nets, such as those for herrings and
                    mackerel, which are made in <hi rend="italic">rands</hi> or breadths, are joined
                    rand to rand lengthways, or along the <hi rend="italic">selvages.</hi> The
                    former are composed of three breadths, each thirty-two yards long by fifty loops
                    deep, on a spool three inches in circumference. At the close of each year the
                    lowest rand, which goes deepest into the sea, is removed, and a new one joined
                    on at the top of the net; so that the rand which was uppermost now becomes
                    second, and that which was second is now the lowest. This latter is removed at
                    the end of the next season, when the same rule is observed in replacing it, and
                    so on every year; thus the whole of the original net is renewed every three
                    years. This operation is called by net-makers, giving the net a <hi
                    rend="italic">new jacket.</hi> Another mode of joining, and when performed
                    carefully it is the neatest, is by uniting the two nets, or the two margins of
                    one net, in the same way as the last row of the new piece is joined to the
                    meshes of the old net in <hi rend="italic">mending.</hi> The first-made side of
                    the <hi rend="italic">inserted</hi> or <hi rend="italic">joining work</hi> must
                    be twice as long as the rest, as also the last side of the suture; for they, in
                    fact, are equivalent to <hi rend="italic">two</hi> sides of a mesh. The
                    following description of specific nets will serve to furnish examples of the
                    foregoing rules, and of the mode of <hi rend="italic">mounting</hi> nets, which
                    yet remains to be noticed.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">The casting-net</hi> (fig. 7) is netted round and round (see
                    No. 7 in this article); the number of the loops for the <hi rend="italic"
                    >lever</hi> vary, as well as their size, according as it is intended for <hi
                    rend="italic">gudgeons,</hi> &amp;c. or <hi rend="italic">minnows;</hi> in
                    either case, it would be a great loss of labour if the whole net were made on
                    one spool so small as it is necessary the lower part of this engine should be.
                    Spools therefore of different circumferences are used, diminishing gradually
                    from the largest for the top, to the smallest for the <hi rend="italic"
                    >tuck.</hi> The following will form a good-sized net for <hi rend="italic"
                    >gudgeons</hi> and larger fish. Fill the needle with double twine, net four
                    rounds with a spool two inches and a half circumference, on a <hi rend="italic"
                    >lever</hi> of thirty-six loops; then use single twine, and in the fifth row set
                    in twelve <hi rend="italic">false meshes;</hi> net two rounds dead netting, and
                    then set i <hi rend="italic">n false meshes</hi> in the same line with the
                    others, having taken care to set in the <hi rend="italic">quarterings</hi> of
                    the fifth row so as to divide the circle into equal parts. Net two feet down on
                    the first spool, then one foot down on each of seven other spools, each spool
                    being an eighth of an inch less than the preceding one. Continue to set in <hi
                    rend="italic">quarterings</hi> in their proper places, and at the commencement
                    of the <hi rend="italic">eighth foot</hi> set m four additional <hi

                    >accrues</hi> until you have netted a foot and a half more, having taken to your
                    <hi rend="italic">eighth spool</hi> at the beginning of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >ninth foot;</hi> then net four rows <hi rend="italic">dead</hi> netting in <hi
                    rend="italic">double</hi> twine; take your <hi rend="italic">ninth spool,</hi>
                    and net two feet six inches of <hi rend="italic">dead</hi> netting for the <hi

                    twine. Have a stout line with leaden bullets threaded on it, and sew this line,
                    with running stitches, through each mesh, along the lowest row of the net, the
                    interval between each <hi rend="italic">lead</hi> being two inches. This
                    weighted margin is then turned upwards and inwards, and made fast to the <hi
                    rend="italic">double twine-work above the tuck,</hi> at about every foot of the
                    circumference, by means of ratlines three inches long. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >lead-line</hi> should be about a foot less in length than the row of the <hi
                    rend="italic">tuck</hi> to which it is sewn. The leads are made fast to the line
                    by being tied at each end to prevent slipping, and the holes should be bored as
                    near the size of the line as possible. In fig. 7, the lines <hi rend="italic">a,
                    a, a,</hi> show the seams formed by the <hi rend="italic">accrues</hi> running
                    down tile net; <hi rend="italic">d, d, d, d,</hi> are the <hi rend="italic"
                    >ratlines</hi> by which the tuck is suspended from the rows of <hi rend="italic"
                    >double</hi> meshes, marked by dots; <hi rend="italic">be, be,</hi> indicate the

                    continuous pocket, inside the net, into which the fish fall. Fig. 7* shows a

                    passing over the bullet, being threaded through the loops which extend along the
                    length of the bullet. The <hi rend="italic">trammel</hi> consists of three
                    separate layers of nettings, and derives its name from its conformation ( <hi
                    rend="italic">trois mailles,</hi> French), because it ensnares by <hi
                    rend="italic">threefold meshes.</hi> The three parts consist of two <hi

                    is suspended loosely between the two former, it being made twice their length
                    and twice their depth. The two <hi rend="italic">out-wallings</hi> are to be of
                    the same size.</p>
                <p>The length and depth of this engine varies according to the service it is
                    intended to perform, either in fishing or fowling; the same may be said of the
                    size of the meshes; those of the <hi rend="italic">out-wallings,</hi> however,
                    are generally five times larger from knot to knot than those of the <hi
                    rend="italic">lint.</hi> All the parts should be netted <hi rend="italic">four
                    square</hi> (as <hi rend="italic">oblong</hi> and <hi rend="italic">square</hi>
                    netting is sometimes called, see No. 6 in this article), the <hi rend="italic"
                    >lint</hi> in twine as fine as may be consistent with the required strength, and
                    the <hi rend="italic">out-wallings</hi> with much stouter material in
                    proportion. These, when finished, are to be <hi rend="italic">mounted.</hi> Fix
                    each of the four corners of one <hi rend="italic">out-walling</hi> to four pegs
                    driven into the ground, which should be cleared of rubbish, &amp;c. The <hi
                    rend="italic">out-walling</hi> is to be stretched tight. Pass all round the <hi
                    rend="italic">lint,</hi> through each mesh, a stout line of twine, as thick as
                    that of which the <hi rend="italic">out-wallings are</hi> made. This line, and
                    likewise the <hi rend="italic">lint</hi> at its four corners, is made fast to
                    the four pegs; the former is drawn tight from peg to peg, but the latter, being
                    longer and wider, hangs loosely. The meshes of the <hi rend="italic">lint</hi>
                    should be as equally distributed along the line as is possible. Over the <hi
                    rend="italic">lint</hi> is applied the other <hi rend="italic">out-walling,</hi>
                    the four corners of which are to be fastened to the four pegs. If the engine is
                    intended for fishing, a stout cord must be threaded with round flat corks two
                    inches diameter, and half an inch thick, more or less. This cord is to be fixed
                    along the <hi rend="italic">head</hi> of the net by means of pieces of twine
                    whipped two or three times round, and embracing the line of the <hi
                    rend="italic">lint</hi> , the margins of each out <hi rend="italic">-</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">walling,</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">cord</hi> itself. The
                    twine is tied into a firm knot at those points where the cord meets the angles
                    of the <hi rend="italic">out-walling's</hi> meshes. The floats are placed about
                    six inches apart, and are pierced, so as to embrace the <hi rend="italic"
                    >heud-rope</hi> firmly. This last is made fast down <hi rend="italic">each side
                    of</hi> the net, at the angles of the meshes of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >out-wallings;</hi> but it has here no floats; it is extended along the bottom
                    of the net, where it is called the <hi rend="italic">foot-rope,</hi> and is
                    weighted with small plates of lead rolled and beaten round it with a hammer, as
                    a tag is fixed round a boot-lace, at about every three inches.</p>
                <p>The cord that thus surrounds the net must be bent into a loop at each end of the
                    top of the net, for to these is to be made fast a <hi rend="italic"
                    >draw-rope</hi> when the net is <hi rend="italic">shot.</hi> Some net-makers
                    also tie the three layers of net together at each angle of the meshes of the <hi
                    rend="italic">out-wallings</hi> throughout the area of the net, to give
                    additional strength, and to prevent the <hi rend="italic">lint</hi> getting <hi
                    rend="italic">huddled</hi> together at the bottom when suspended in the water or
                    drawn along the ground. This engine acts thus: The fish or fowl passes through
                    the large mesh <hi rend="italic">of</hi> the out-walling, strikes against the
                    <hi rend="italic">lint,</hi> which, hanging loosely, yields, and protrudes
                    through the corresponding mesh of the other <hi rend="italic">out-walling,</hi>
                    and thus forms a <hi rend="italic">coecum,</hi> into which the animal falls, and
                    is entangled. The <hi rend="italic">hoop-net</hi> consists of two parts; the <hi
                    rend="italic">body,</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">valve, funnel,</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">gullet,</hi> which are united in the manner hereafter to be
                    described. Begin with the <hi rend="italic">body</hi> at its lower or pointed
                    end (see fig. 8), and work up to its entrance, thus: Net thirty-seven loops
                    round on a spool four inches circumference, one row. Take a spool two inches
                    circumference and net twenty rows of <hi rend="italic">dead</hi> netting. In the
                    next row set in five</p>

                <p><hi rend="italic">false meshes</hi> equidistantly, then twenty rows of <hi
                    rend="italic">dead</hi> netting, then a row with five <hi rend="italic">false
                    meshes;</hi> repeat this manoeuvre; then net thirty-six rows of <hi
                    rend="italic">dead</hi> netting, and the next row in <hi rend="italic"
                    >double</hi> twine; thus you have an upper and a lower row, as shown in fig. 5,
                    the dotted lines representing the lower row. Cut off the thread which has worked
                    the <hi rend="italic">upper</hi> row, leaving an end; empty your needle, and
                    wind on it the thread that proceeds from the <hi rend="italic">lower</hi> row,
                    and work on with the single twine as follows, taking care, however, to pick up
                    only the loops of the <hi rend="italic">lower</hi> row as you go round. Net on
                    the same spool fourteen rows of <hi rend="italic">dead</hi> netting, then at
                    equal distances in the circumference of the fifteenth row set in eight <hi
                    rend="italic">stole</hi> meshes, then net two rows of <hi rend="italic"
                    >dead</hi> netting, in the next row eight stole meshes in a line with the
                    others; repeat this action three times more. After you have for the fifth time
                    set in your <hi rend="italic">stole</hi> meshes, net a row of plain netting; lay
                    aside the two-inch spool, and take a twelve-inch and net one row. The <hi
                    rend="italic">valve</hi> is now finished, and must be reflected inwards to gain
                    its right position. You now take your needle, charged with single twine, and
                    join on to that end which was left at the upper row where the valve issued from
                    the <hi rend="italic">body</hi> of the engine; with the two-inch spool net
                    eleven rows of dead netting. In the next row set in five <hi rend="italic">false
                    meshes</hi> at equal distances each from the other, and continue to set in these
                    at every third row eleven times in the same line. This done, make seven rows of
                    <hi rend="italic">dead</hi> netting, then one row on a four-inch spool in <hi
                    rend="italic">double</hi> twine. Through this last row a pliant stick is passed,
                    about six feet long, and bent into a <hi rend="italic">bow</hi> (BBB, fig. S); a
                    piece of cord keeps the extremities in place, answering to the string of the
                    archer’s bow; the lower meshes of the net’s mouth are strung on this cord, see
                    fig. 8. A weight is generally attached to the <hi rend="italic">bow</hi> at its
                    extremities, somewhere towards BB. Four hoops are lashed round the net at HHHH,
                    to prevent its collapsing; these are larger as they proceed from the point to
                    the mouth, and are made of slighter wood than the bow, the smallest being about
                    one foot three inches diameter, and the largest two feet.</p>
                <p>Some <hi rend="italic">hoop-nets</hi> have more tnan one <hi rend="italic"
                    >valve.</hi> In that case the hoops must always be placed at the entrance of the
                    <hi rend="italic">valves,</hi> and many netters make a row of <hi rend="italic"
                    >double</hi> twine at those parts, to give additional strength where there is
                    most strain on the netting. The large loops at the bottom of the <hi
                    rend="italic">funnel</hi> are tied together, in <hi rend="italic">fasces</hi> of
                    equal number of loops, to four lines, and these are made fast to another line
                    which is threaded through the last row of meshes belonging to the point of the
                    <hi rend="italic">body,</hi> and which, being drawn tight, closes up the
                    entrance at that part. All the lines are then tied to a support at P, and thus
                    the net is kept extended. The principle of this engine is analogous to that of
                    the common mouse-trap. When there is only one valve (as in fig. 8, V), the
                    fisherman withdraws the fish by loosing the line that closes the body of the
                    engine at P; but when there are more than one valve, he makes a <hi
                    rend="italic">regard</hi> in the <hi rend="italic">body</hi> between each hoop.
                    A <hi rend="italic">regard</hi> is thus made: Net round and round, and when
                    arrived at the part wherein you wish to put a <hi rend="italic">regard, return
                    on your worh;</hi> and when you again come to the place where you altered your
                    mode of netting, return again; and thus continue until you have made the <hi
                    rend="italic">regard</hi> of sufficient length, then work round and round as
                    before.</p>
                <p>A <hi rend="italic">tunnel</hi> for partridges is made like the hoop-net, but
                    without valves.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">trawl</hi> is a very large and rapacious net, and much
                    discussion has been held as to whether it should be permitted. It would seem,
                    however, upon a careful examination of evidence, that, under proper
                    restrictions, it is not detrimental to the fisheries. This engine is composed of
                    two separate pieces, called the <hi rend="italic">upper</hi> and the <hi
                    rend="italic">lower leaf;</hi> the meshes are about two inches square. For the
                    <hi rend="italic">under leaf</hi> or <hi rend="italic">blade,</hi> net 160 loops
                    in <hi rend="italic">double</hi> twine, two rows, then with single twine net a
                    plain row; in the next, set in a <hi rend="italic">stole</hi> mesh at about the
                    sixth mesh from the beginning, and another at about the sixth mesh from the end
                    of the row; net three rows of <hi rend="italic">dead</hi> netting, then set in
                    <hi rend="italic">stole</hi> meshes as before; repeat this once again,
                    afterwards go on setting in <hi rend="italic">stole meshes</hi> less frequently,
                    t. <hi rend="italic">e.</hi> leave five rows of dead netting between, until the
                    width of the <hi rend="italic">blade</hi> is reduced to thirty-six meshes, then
                    net about five feet for the <hi rend="italic">hose</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >tail</hi> H, fig. 9. The <hi rend="italic">wings</hi> are now to be set on to
                    this <hi rend="italic">leaf.</hi> For this purpose you must begin working at the
                    other extremity, or top of the <hi rend="italic">leaf,</hi> as at T or <hi
                    rend="italic">t;</hi> net fifty-six loops and stop; return on your work; net
                    again to the end of your row (the third), and here, quite at the extremity, set
                    in a <hi rend="italic">false</hi> mesh; but when, in the course of netting row
                    after row, you come to the <hi rend="italic">false</hi> meshes, do <hi
                    rend="italic">not</hi> take them up, but let them <hi rend="italic">hang,</hi>
                    as is shown in fig. 9 at B and B of the <hi rend="italic">wings</hi> W and W. At
                    the <hi rend="italic">commencement</hi> of every row which alternates with those
                    to which you add a <hi rend="italic">false</hi> mesh, at about three loops from
                    the beginning, set in a <hi rend="italic">stole</hi> mesh; thus <hi
                    rend="italic">the false</hi> meshes will always be on one side, and the <hi
                    rend="italic">stole</hi> meshes on the other side of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >wing,</hi> which will thus be diminished at last to eighteen meshes. When this
                    is effected, net two rows in <hi rend="italic">double</hi> twine, not adding or
                    diminishing. Thus one <hi rend="italic">wing</hi> is done; net the other in the
                    same way, and take care that the one is exactly the same as the other. The <hi
                    rend="italic">under</hi> leaf being now finished, we pass on to the structure of
                    the <hi rend="italic">upper blade,</hi> fig. 10. Net 180 <hi rend="italic"
                    >loops</hi> in <hi rend="italic">double</hi> twine, two rows; then with single
                    twine forty rows of <hi rend="italic">dead</hi> netting; diminish evenly and
                    gradually from 180 to 160 meshes, taking notice that this reduction must be made
                    before you come to a level with the <hi rend="italic">double</hi> rows whence
                    the <hi rend="italic">wings</hi> rose in the other <hi rend="italic">blade.</hi>
                    Diminish from 160 to thirty-six, as you did when working down the <hi
                    rend="italic">lower leaf,</hi> making the <hi rend="italic">hose</hi> as before.
                    The <hi rend="italic">blades</hi> being now finished, must be joined together
                    down their sides, as the sides of a sack are; and a rope, acting as a binding
                    along the seams, is sewn on, in the same way as the <hi rend="italic"
                    >head-rope</hi> of the <hi rend="italic">trammel.</hi> Round the top of the <hi
                    rend="italic">upper blade</hi> a rope is strung through the meshes, and carried
                    round the <hi rend="italic">bosom</hi> BBB, fig. 9, being sewn to, and not
                    threaded through, the <hi rend="italic">hanging false loops</hi> of the <hi
                    rend="italic">wings</hi> W, W. The two blades are then sewn together at certain
                    parts to form <hi rend="italic">pockets,</hi> in the direction of A, A, A, A, A,
                    A; <hi rend="italic">oooooo,</hi> being the orifice of the pockets. At L, L,
                    loops of rope are bent, to which lines are hitched for hauling the net out of
                    the sea into the boat. The two <hi rend="italic">blades</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">leaves</hi> must be <hi rend="italic">exactly</hi> of the same
                    length; for, when joined, the top row of the <hi rend="italic">wings</hi> must
                    be even with the top row of the back of the net or <hi rend="italic">upper
                    blade,</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">hose</hi> should meet no less accurately
                    at the bottom. When the <hi rend="italic">trawl</hi> is in the sea, a long beam
                    of about thirty feet in length and seven inches in circumference is lashed to
                    the top of the net, keeping the <hi rend="italic">wings</hi> and back extended
                    from point to point. This beam is let into irons, called <hi rend="italic"
                    >trawl-heads,</hi> at each extremity, which serve to sink it. A heavy rope,
                    usually made of old netting, tightly twisted and bound round with strong twine,
                    is lashed along the bosom of the net. Thus <hi rend="italic">mounted,</hi> the
                    engine is lowered into the sea, being <hi rend="italic">trailed</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">trawled</hi> along the bottom by means of a rope attached to the
                    boat’s mast, and communicating with each end of the <hi rend="italic">beam</hi>
                    by a <hi rend="italic">bridle.</hi> The <hi rend="italic">bosom</hi> touches the
                    ground, and the <hi rend="italic">upper blade</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >beam</hi> floats over it; the <hi rend="italic">bosom’s</hi> rope disturbs the
                    fish at the bottom; they are, however, stopped from escaping, by striking
                    against the <hi rend="italic">upper blade,</hi> which extends over the <hi
                    rend="italic">bosom,</hi> so they swim down the <hi rend="italic">trawl</hi> to
                    the hose; but this is tied up, so they next attempt to return towards the mouth
                    of the net; but in their way they fall into the pockets, which only open inwards
                    towards the <hi rend="italic">hose,</hi> and thus are secured. <hi rend="italic"
                    >A</hi><hi rend="italic">day-net</hi> is used for catching larks from 14th
                    September to 14th November; after that, until 25th February, the <hi
                    rend="italic">trammel.</hi> The reason of this is, that during the latter
                    division of <pb break="no" facs="ht:wu.89119129625&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=203"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0719-0203-0193"/>the season the weather usually is cloudy, and the
                    <hi rend="italic">doring-glass</hi> of the <hi rend="italic">day-net</hi> cannot
                    act. The structure of this net is very simple, and is represented in fig. 11.
                    The thread should be very fine, as also that used for the <hi rend="italic"
                    >trammels;</hi> the meshes three quarters of an inch from knot to knot; two
                    pieces of <hi rend="italic">oblong</hi> netting, measuring three fathoms by one,
                    are extended to their full width, by being lashed to light staves of the
                    required length, one at each end (see fig. 11, A, A). These two leaves are to be
                    laid on the ground exactly opposite each other, so accurately, that when they
                    are drawn over, the two margins <hi rend="italic">m, m</hi> shall touch each
                    other. Each leaf is to be staked down with pegs at the lower corners, at G, G,
                    G, G. A line By and By is to be stretched from the top of the stakes B, B, and
                    fastened firmly to the ground by the pegs <hi rend="italic">g, g.</hi> Another
                    line is to be stretched from the head of the stakes <hi rend="italic">b</hi> and
                    <hi rend="italic">b,</hi> in the direction of <hi rend="italic">bC, bC,</hi> and
                    fixed to the ground by a peg C and C. Another line F and F is to proceed from
                    the head of each stake <hi rend="italic">b, b,</hi> and is to be joined at H to
                    the <hi rend="italic">main line,</hi> which draws the leaves over; F, F should
                    each be at least a fathom long. In the centre D is to be placed the
                    doring-glass, whence proceeds a line E. The fowler retires to his ambuscade, and
                    with his left hand he plays the doring-glass with the line E, and holds the <hi
                    rend="italic">main line</hi> H in his right; when the birds are seen playing
                    around the glass, and within reach of the net, he pulls the leaves over with a
                    quick jerk, and thus secures them. The <hi rend="italic">doring-glass</hi> is
                    thus made: Take a piece of wood (AC, fig. 12) nine inches long and one and a
                    half thick, cut out in the shape of an arch, and the edges at the top bevelled
                    off so as to make it a six-sided figure. This bow is to be painted red, and
                    covered with pieces of looking-glass along the sides and at each end; a wooden
                    peg B, six inches long and three fourths of an inch in circumference, a little
                    pointed at the end, with a hole at I, through which the line E (fig. 11) is
                    threaded, must be fixed to the under surface of the arch, at the centre. Take
                    another piece of wood six inches thick and one foot long (fig. 13), sharpened at
                    the end in order to fix it in the ground; cut out a mortise in it two inches
                    high, and one inch and three fourths deep; bore a hole at N and O, large enough
                    to receive the peg B (fig. 12). This device is made to act by winding up the
                    string round the peg several turns, and then pulling it; then letting it wind
                    itself up again, and then jerking it again; thus making the glass revolve
                    briskly, as children do their toy windmills.</p>
                <p>The object we have had in view is that of embodying, in plain and simple
                    language, a few practical hints on the subject of net-making, so that they may
                    be conveniently consulted by all classes requiring that kind of information. The
                    various engines described may be modified, altered, and combined, as occasion
                    requires. It would be endless to enter into these minutiae, or to give a
                    catalogue of the different nets used, with the technical name for each in
                    different parts of the kingdom. We shall therefore conclude with a few <hi
                    rend="italic">general observations.</hi> 1. In all cases use twine as fine as
                    circumstances will permit, and make your meshes as large as is consistent with
                    the object in view; for the nets will be thereby more easily dried, lighter, and
                    more efficient. 2. In filling your needle <hi rend="italic">double,</hi> draw
                    the twine from separate balls. 3. Take greatcare to dry your nets thoroughly,
                    and hang them up away from walls, where rats and mice cannot get at them. 4.
                    Mend them immediately. 5. Keep them well tanned, or immersed in Kyan’s Patent as
                    often as may be necessary; but never use tar and oil. This mixture has been
                    proved to be inefficient as a preservative, and to be so offensive to the fish
                    as to drive many away from the nets thus prepared, and to impart an unpleasant
                    flavour to those that are caught in them. 6. If you wish to <hi rend="italic"
                    >dye</hi> your nets green, russet, yellow, &amp;c. for fowling or other
                    purposes, send them to the nearest dyer or tanner, as the cheapest and best mode
                    of treatment. (b. k.)</p>
