                    immortalized by his Romance of <hi rend="italic">Gargantua and Pantagruel,</hi>
                    was born at Chinon, a little town of Touraine, in 1483. His father, Thomas
                    Rabelais, is generally understood to have been an apothecary of that town, and
                    proprietor of the farm of La Devi-nière in the neighbourhood, where, it is said,
                    a great part of the romance was written. According to some biographers, however,
                    he was a vintner in Chinon, and kept a cabaret there at the sign of the Lamprey.
                    The probability is, that he combined both occupations, dealing in drugs and
                    spices, “and other things of great price ;” and also disposing of the wine
                    produced upon his own property, a traffic very different in its nature from that
                    suggested by the modern ideas of an apothecary and keeper of a cabaret. He was
                    unquestionably a man of substance, and able to procure for his son an education
                    of as high a character as was then to be obtained. He sent him to be educated by
                    the monks of Seville, an abbey not far from Chinon, but the boy’s progress under
                    their care was so unpromising, as to occasion his removal to the University of
                    Angers, where he studied for some time at tile convent of La Baumette, but
                    apparently with no greater proficiency than before. It was at this esta<pb

                    xml:id="kp-eb0719-0012-0002"/>blishment that he made the acquaintance of the
                    brothers Du Bellay, one of them afterwards the celebrated Cardinal, a connexion
                    which lasted through life, and ultimately proved of the greatest service to him.
                    After passing through the usual preparatory studies, Rabelais was admitted into
                    the order of Cordeliers at the convent of Fontenay-le-Compte in Poitou, where he
                    assumed the religious habit. Here he prosecuted his studies with such zeal, as
                    to retrieve any loss of time which indifference or injudicious tutors might
                    previously have occasioned. Striking out of the usual routine of scholastic
                    study, which then held undivided sway in the monastic houses, he applied
                    himself, with unusual industry and research, to the cultivation of the sciences
                    It was his aim, says Niceron, to become a grammarian, poet, philosopher,
                    physician, jurisconsult, and astronomer, and his works bear ample testimony to
                    his success. He possessed a peculiar aptitude for the acquisition of the
                    languages; an aptitude which afterwards showed itself in his command of Italian,
                    Spanish, German, English, Hebrew, and Arabic. At this period, in fact, he was a
                    perfect master of the Latin and Greek tongues, the latter of which had for some
                    time been engaging the attention of the most enlightened spirits of the age.
                    Within the walls of Fontenay-le-Compte, however, a Greek book was looked upon as
                    no better than a work of magic, and the man who commanded the key to its secrets
                    passed for a trafficker in “the arts inhibited ;” and it appears, by a letter
                    from Budaeus to a friend, that Rabelais’ attachment to the Greek writers drew
                    upon him the hatred and persecution of his fellow monks. His independence of
                    spirit, and generous ardour in the pursuit of learning, which could not but be
                    felt as a reproach to their own resolute ignorance, pedantry, and sloth, was
                    continually furnishing fresh incentives to their rancour, and they omitted no
                    opportunity of subjecting him to annoyance. Worn out by repeated aggressions, he
                    followed the advice of his friends, and resolved to quit a society where he
                    found so little that was congenial to his own disposition. It has been alleged,
                    that the true cause of this step was his own profligacy; but this is only the
                    first of the many groundless charges against him, engendered either by the
                    malice of his enemies, or originating in a misapprehension of his character as
                    seen in his writings, namely, that of a man whose whole life was a noisy jest, a
                    soulless round of sensual indulgences. Had such really been his character, as
                    has been pertinently remarked by Père</p>
                <p>Niceron, “these were not the days, when, for such a cause, he needed to have left
                    his monastery; he might have given free rein to his propensities there, and yet
                    not have been going out of the ordinary course.” The authority of a churchman on
                    such a point is conclusive.</p>
                <p>In 1523, a brief was obtained from Pope Clement VII., allowing him to pass from
                    the order of St. Francis into that of St. Benedict, and leaving this “pack of
                    capuchins, monks, who forbade the use of beans, that is, Pantagrueline books,”
                    to borrow a phrase from the prologue to the fifth book of his Romance, he
                    entered the monastery of Maillezais in Poitou, where he remained during several
                    years. But he appears to have found himself little better off in his present
                    situation, than in that which he had left. It did not present him, it is said,
                    with such resources as he desired for extending the limits of his knowledge,
                    more especially as regarded medical science. His motives for this step were
                    doubtless of a mingled nature, of which it is but reasonable to suppose the
                    chief was a disgust at the torpor and profitless seclusion of a monastic life,
                    by escaping from which he could alone hope to find opportunities for exercising
                    his stirring and strongly practical intellect in a field of action, observation,
                    and experience, sufficiently ample for its desires. However this may be, he laid
                    down the regular habit for that of a secular priest, and quitted Maillezais
                    without the sanction of his superior, a breach of ecclesiastical discipline
                    which exposed him to its severest censures. After rambling about for some time
                    in the diligent pursuit of medical knowledge, as he says himself in his petition
                    to Pope' Paul III. praying for absolution from the penalties incurred by his
                    unauthorised retirement from Maillezais, he settled at Montpellier, after taking
                    his physician’s degree at its university, and practised the medical profession
                    there with credit and success. It appears by the dedication to Godefroy
                    D’Estissac, bishop of Maillezais, of an edition of Hippocrates’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Aphorisms,</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Ars Parva</hi> of Galen,
                    published by Rabelais in 1532, at Lyons, and highly esteemed by the medical and
                    literary men of the time, that his lectures on physic at the university of that
                    place had attracted considerable attention. Such, indeed, was the distinction he
                    attained, that he was selected by tile university as their deputy to procure a
                    restitution of the privileges of which one of its colleges had been denuded by
                    the chancellor Du Prat. The means employed by Rabelais for obtaining access to
                    the chancellor have formed the subject of a story to be found in all his
                    biographies; but it is too obviously a fabrication from an incident in his own
                    Romance, (the introduction of Panurge to Pantagruel, book ii. c. ix.) to be
                    worth a place here. He succeeded in the object of his mission, and his services
                    to the university were perpetuated in a custom, still, according to the <hi
                    rend="italic">Biographie Universelle,</hi> in existence, by which every
                    candidate is required to put on Rabelais’ gown upon receiving his physician’s
                    degree.</p>
                <p>In 1533, we find him established at Lyons, where he was hospital physician, and
                    taught and practised for several years. At the commencement of the year 1534,
                    his old schoolfellow and friend, Jean du Bellay, then bishop of Paris, having
                    <sic>occcasion</sic> to pass through Lyons on his way to the papal court,
                    regarding the divorce of Henry VIII. of England, took Rabelais along with him in
                    the capacity of his physician; thus enabling him to realise, what had long been
                    his passionate wish, a personal acquaintance with Italy and the Eternal City.
                    For, to use the words of his dedication to Du Bellay of an edition of Marliani’s
                    <hi rend="italic">Typographia Antiquae Romoe,</hi> published, under Rabelais’
                    superintendence, by Gryphius, at Lyons, in 1534, “from the first moment that I
                    was able to appreciate the worth of polite learning, it was amongst the foremost
                    of my desires to travel throughout Italy, and visit the capital of the Roman
                    world.” The opportunity for gratifying the popular conceptions of his character,
                    afforded by this visit of the great satirist of the abuses of the Romish church
                    to the court of its supreme head, has not been let slip by the anecdote-mongers;
                    and several absurd stories of his conduct have accordingly been handed down from
                    biographer to biographer, till they seem almost to have acquired the authority
                    of undoubted truths. One specimen of these will be sufficient. When the Cardinal
                    Du Bellay was presented to the Pope, he, as ambassador of Francis I., went
                    through the usual ceremony of kissing his holiness’s slipper. His suite followed
                    his example, all except Rabelais, who remained leaning against a pillar, and
                    exclaimed loud enough to be heard, That if his master, who was a great lord in
                    France, were unworthy to kiss the pope’s feet, his holiness might untruss, and
                    possibly, after reasonable abstersion, a part might be found, where an humble
                    follower like himself might presume to apply his lips. The improbability, that
                    Rabelais should have expressed himself in these terms, filling the situation
                    which he did, and when, too, he was on the eve of supplicating a release from
                    this very pope from the ecclesiastical penalties he had incurred by his
                    unauthorised desertion of the monastery of Maillezais, speaks sufficiently for
                    the worthlessness of this story. But its real source is obvious enough, and may
                    be found in book iv. c. 48. of his Romance. It needed but a poor invention to
                    construct such a tale out of the extravagant devotion of the worthies that
                    greeted Pantagruel and his band, on their arrival at the Island of Papimany.
                    That, however, which, as told by Rabelais himself, is a stroke of the most
                    caustic satire,</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="ht:wu.89119129625&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=13"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0719-0013-0003"/>
                <p>makes but a sorry jest in the hands of those who first built up a theory of his
                    character according to an idea of their own, and then fabricated anecdotes to
                    support and illustrate it. Rabelais’ judgment, it is certain, was quite as
                    powerful as his wit; and he knew too well when to discharge his bolt with
                    effect, ever to let it fly where detriment to the archer himself could alone be
                    the result. The veil of extravagance, which he has thrown over his great
                    satirical work, is the best possible proof how unlikely he was to be guilty of
                    any such piece of superfluous imprudence. At the same time, it is to be remarked
                    further, in confutation of this particular Story, that it was to Clement VII.
                    and not to Paul III., that Du Bellay must have been introduced in the capacity
                    of ambassador on the occasion alluded to; but, as invention and historical truth
                    are two distinct things, this discrepancy in fact is not greatly to be wondered
                    at.</p>
                <p>Rabelais seems to have gone back to Lyons for a time, as his Epistle Dedicatory
                    to Du Bellay of his edition of Marhanfs <hi rend="italic">Antiquitates Romoe
                    Antiquoe</hi> is dated from that city on the 3lst of August 1534. He returned
                    shortly afterwards to Rome, and rejoined Du Bellay, who had been created
                    Cardinal on the 21st of May 1535. His letters to Godefroy D’Estissac, whose
                    favour he had won during his residence at his Abbey of Maillezais, and continued
                    ever afterwards to retain, are dated from Rome during the two following years.
                    Availing himself of the opportunity which his presence on the spot afforded, he
                    petitioned Pope Paul III. to be absolved from the penalties incurred by the
                    abandonment of his order. Rabelais’ merits had secured him the esteem of
                    Cardinals de Genutiis and Simonetta, and they combined with Du Bellay and the
                    Bishop of Mascon, in forwarding his petition. By their exertions a bull in his
                    favour was obtained gratis, contrary to the usual practice. It was granted on
                    the 17th of January 1536, in terms of his request, allowing him to return into
                    any house of the Benedictine order that would receive him, and to practise
                    physic upon condition of his doing so without hope of fee or reward. This
                    release from the ecclesiastical disabilities consequent upon his transgression
                    of the church’s rules enabled the Cardinal Du Bellay to assign him a place in
                    his Abbey of St. Maur des Fossez, near Paris. Here he remained until the year
                    1542, when he was appointed by the same friend to the cure of Meu-don; and he
                    continued in the zealous discharge of the duties of this station down to the
                    time of his death. “Ever mindful,” says Niceron, “to instruct his people, he
                    made it part of his care to give their children a knowledge of church music, of
                    which he was himself a thorough master. His house was ever open to the poor and
                    wretched, whom he assisted to the utmost of his means; and he was in the habit
                    of drawing men of learning and science about him, to discourse with them upon
                    their several pursuits. Against women, however, his gates were barred, and his
                    reputation on this score is wholly without blemish. This,” he adds, “is the
                    uniform testimony of contemporary biographers; and Antony Le Roi, who wrote a
                    life of him in 1649, avers that such was then the prevailing tradition at
                    Meudon. His knowledge of medicine rendered him doubly useful to his
                    parishioners, who invariably found him ready to minister to their wants both
                    corporal and spiritual.” He died in Paris, in 1553, in the Rue des Jardins,
                    parish of St. Paul, and was buried in the cemetery of that church.</p>
                <p>His death-bed has not escaped profanation by the caterers for the jest-books; and
                    there are few stories more common, than his calling for his domino, when he felt
                    his end approaching, with the words, “Beati qui in Domino moriuntur.” Another
                    anecdote, even more detrimental to his character, is in every-day circulation,
                    by which he is reported to have replied to a page sent by Du Bellay to inquire
                    after his health, “Tell your master the state you find me in; I am going in
                    quest of a Great Perhaps. He is up in the jay’s nest· Bid him keep where he is;
                    and for you, you will never be anything but a fool. Draw the curtain; the farce
                    is ended.” Those who have read Rabelais’ spirit aright need no confutation of
                    this slanderous fabrication of monkish malice, the miserable patchwork from some
                    half-dozen threadbare facetiae. The simple fact recorded by Du Verdier, is worth
                    a thousand such tales; and it determines, if, indeed, such evidence were
                    necessary, Rabelais’ opinion as to the momentous doctrine which he is here
                    represented to have viewed as no more than “a great perhaps." In a copy of
                    Galen, annotated throughout in the handwriting of Rabelais, that had come into
                    the Bishop of Evreux’s possession, opposite a passage in which Galen argues for
                    the mortality of the soul, Rabelais had written, “Hic vero Galenus se plumbeum
                    ostendit.” Du Vertlier also states, whilst at the same time he retracts what he
                    had formerly been led, in accordance with the popular voice, to say against
                    Rabelais in his <hi rend="italic">Bibliothèque Française,</hi> that “the manner
                    of his death compels us to form a judgment of him totally at variance with that
                    which is currently received.” The particular circumstances of this event are not
                    now known, but they were doubtless such as became a pious and eminently
                    thoughtful man.</p>
                <p>One cannot help regretting, with Coleridge, “that no friend of Rabelais, and
                    surely friend he must have had, has left an account of him.” Had any such
                    account existed, it would unquestionably have conveyed an impression of his
                    personal character very different from that which the current anecdotes of him
                    are calculated to produce. It is the peculiar misfortune of distinguished
                    humourists to have the paternity of such jests as are tossing unclaimed about
                    the world laid to their charge. They become a sort of Foundling Hospitals for
                    Wit; and Rabelais has had more than his share of this abandoned progeny thrust
                    upon him. His reputation as a man has suffered accordingly, and this for an
                    obvious reason; for just in the degree that a great man’s mind is marked by
                    features, which puzzle the finest sagacity to discriminate and reconcile, are
                    people disposed to pronounce an authoritative judgment regarding him. In all
                    such cases, a lively anecdote, or sparkling witticism, is too cheap and pleasant
                    a method of settling a doubtful character, not to be generally adopted. They
                    commonly fall in with the conclusion that lies nearest the surface, and, being
                    thus most easily come at, they are eagerly caught up and borne along from mouth
                    to mouth, till their mere repetition sanctifies the delusion out of which they
                    sprung. One common character runs throughout all the anecdotes of which Rabelais
                    is the hero. They show a mind without gravity or depth, giving head to its most
                    wayward sallies, neglectful of self-respect, and reckless of present
                    circumstances, or of possible results. Such is just the character which a
                    superficial observer is likely to form of him from his own romance. The
                    rhodomantade, the coarseness, the downright nonsense, the reckless exuberance of
                    humour, are easily noted; whilst the vein of deep and earnest thought that ever
                    and anon shows itself amid the surrounding extravagance, the infinite good
                    sense, the high-toned and enlightened philanthropy, and the great moral purpose
                    which the author had in view, escape the careless and unpenetrating eye. The
                    vices, which he has laid bare with such masterly tact, have been set down as his
                    own, and he is charged with having been a profligate, a debauchee, and a
                    buffoon, destitute alike of self-respect, and reverence for whatsoever is sacred
                    or noble. But every thing that is known of his life, as well as what may be
                    inferred from a study of his works, goes to discountenance such a conclusion, He
                    was beloved and respected by many of the most illustrious and virtuous prelates
                    of his time, admitted into their most private councils, and charged with the
                    most important trusts. All his works, except his romance, which, being a
                    reflection of the time, must needs carry its grossness and licentiousness upon
                    its front, are conceived in a uniformly grave and learned spirit; and in <pb
                    break="no" facs="ht:wu.89119129625&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=14"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0719-0014-0004"/>his letters, where certainly a light or ribald
                    mind was most likely to have shown itself, there is nothing to be found unworthy
                    of the scholar and the churchman. These facts are utterly inconsistent with the
                    charges of buffoonery, immorality, and irreligion, which are usually coupled
                    with his name; and who can doubt, that, had his life given any warrant for such
                    charges, there were jealous enemies enough to have placed the fact beyond the
                    uncertainty of mere assertion?</p>
                <p>In common with the other great assailants of religious abuses, Rabelais was
                    branded with the names of heretic and atheist, and the Dedication of the Fourth
                    Book of his Romance makes an indignant allusion to the circumstance. Epithets
                    like these, however, he could well afford to share with such men as Erasmus,
                    Luther, and Melancthon. Had he escaped them, indeed, there would have heen some
                    cause for wonder; for, assuredly, the severest blow ever levelled against the
                    Roman Catholic church was the publication of the <hi rend="italic">Chronicle of
                    the Wondrous Deeds of Gargantua and Pantagruel.</hi> The popularity of its form
                    secured it attention, where a formal censure would have been disregarded; and it
                    was read on every hand with unexampled avidity. Calvin spoke of part of it with
                    asperity, but others of the reformers, penetrating its real spirit, gave it
                    their warmest approval, and Beza’s well-known epigram has long graced every
                    edition of the book.</p>

                <p>“Beyond a doubt,” says Coleridge, “he was among the deepest as well as boldest
                    thinkers of his age. His buffoonery was not merely Brutus’ rough stick, which
                    contained a rod of gold; it was necessary as an amulet against the monks and
                    bigots. Never was there a more plausible, and seldom, I am persuaded, a less
                    appropriate line, than the thousand times quoted</p>

                <p>of Mr. Pope. The caricature of his filth and zanyism proves how fully he both
                    knew and felt the danger in which he stood. I could write a treatise in praise
                    of the moral elevation of Rabelais’ work, which would make the church stare, and
                    the conventicle groan, and yet would be the truth, and nothing but the truth. I
                    class Rabelais with the great creative minds of the world, [Homer,] Shakspeare,
                    Dante, Cervantes, &amp;c.” The prevalent coarseness, though this even is not
                    always without its meaning, of Rabelais’ great work, makes it repulsive to the
                    mass of readers; and this it is, probably, which has enabled modern writers to
                    appropriate its thoughts and witticisms with impunity. But the richness of
                    invention, the dramatic force of the characters, the originality and vigour of
                    thought, the wit, the learning, the satire, poignant yet without cynicism, the
                    wise philosophy, and the atmosphere of triumphant joyousness that invests the
                    whole, justify the praises of Coleridge, and will secure its fame, as long as
                    vice remains to be lashed, and folly to be ridiculed, or the love of genial
                    humour, and far-sighted wisdom is not utterly extinct.</p>
                <p>It is impossible not to admire the robust and healthy nature of the mind of
                    Rabelais, which, at a time when earnestness was constantly running into
                    extravagant excesses in the persons of the other great reformers of the period,
                    maintained its equipoise, without losing any of its intensity in seizing and
                    grappling with the predominant abuses. Nor is its moral culture less
                    conspicuous, which, in an age when the face of society presented so much to
                    impress a conviction of the farce and hollowness of the world, preserved him, in
                    despite of his acute sense of the absurd, the false, and the contemptible, as
                    well as of his strong satirical bias, from becoming a morbid and misanthropical
                    reviler of mankind. “I ask not,” says Coleridge, “the genius of a Machiavel, a
                    Tacitus, ora Swift; it needs only a worldly experience, and an observing mind,
                    to convince a man of forty, that there is no medium between the creed of
                    misanthropy and that of the gospel.” Which of these, then, was Rabelais? Most
                    certainly the latter. He hates cant in all its shapes, hypocrisy under all its
                    disguises; tyranny, intolerance, villainy, selfishness, and all its brood of
                    tyrant vices, are hisabhorrence; mere folly he makes his sport, and he dallies
                    with absurdity with a very wantonness. But he never forgets, that he, the
                    satirist, is himself come of the stock of Adam, or libels heaven, by flying in
                    the face of that nature, which, good or bad, is all that himself and his
                    fellow-men have got to struggle through the world with. He takes life as.it is;
                    he would fain see it better, and lends a helping hand to make it so. Like his
                    great countryman Beranger.</p>

                </lg>
                <p>He detests the evil that is in the world, but he never abandons his faith in the
                    good. His satire is not the angry yelping of a currish nature, the overflow of
                    sour secretions and accumulated bile. Where it is grave, it is the commanding
                    voice of honest indignation; where jovial, there is a kindliness of tone with
                    it, that makes you like the man, whilst you admire his genius. He is essentially
                    good-natured even in his severest moods; and this is apparent in the very form
                    of his satire. Its most caustic strokes are given with a merry voice and
                    laughing eye; and yet, whilst apparently revelling in the most unrestrained
                    ebullitions of mere animal spirits, and licentious fancy, he is covertly
                    stripping sensualism of its enticements, and enforcing the strongest lessons of
                    humility. He possessed, in short, the wisdom of love, which is “the creed of the
                    gospel,” and this his book testifies in a hundred places. At the same time, its
                    defects are great and manifold, and these cannot be better summed up than in the
                    words of La Bruyère. “Rabelais is inexcusable in having scattered mere filth
                    throughout his writings. His book is a chimera. It is the face of a beautiful
                    woman with the tail of a serpent, or of some other still more unsightly monster.
                    It is a monstrous jumble of a fine and delicately wrought moral, and of the most
                    offensive grossness. Where it is bad, it is as bad as can be,— the very scum of
                    the world might batten on it; where it is good, nothing can be more choice or
                    excellent; it <hi rend="italic">can</hi> furnish most dainty fare.”</p>
                <p>For bibliographical details as to the works of Rabelais, see <hi rend="italic"
                    >Biographie Universelle,</hi> tome xxxvi. A careful memoir of him will be found
                    in Niceron’s <hi rend="italic">Mémoires des Hommes Illustres,</hi> and also in
                    Chauffepié’s Supplement to Bayle. Rabelais has been naturalised amongst
                    ourselves, more successfully, perhaps, than any Other foreign writer, by Sir T.
                    Urqu-hart and Motteux’s admirable version of his romance. (B. F.)</p>
