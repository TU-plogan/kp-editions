                <p><label type="entry">RALEIGH</label> Sir Walter, fourth son of Mr Walter Raleigh
                    of Fardel, in the parish of Cornw-bod, in Devonshire, was born in 1552, at
                    Hayes, in the parish of Budley, a farm belonging to his father. About the year
                    1568 he was sent to Oriel College in Oxford, where he continued but a short
                    time; for he became one of the hundred volunteers, commanded by Henry
                    Champernon, who, with other English troops, were sent by Queen Elizabeth to
                    assist the queen of Navaire in defending the Protestants. He has described some
                    of the great battles in which he was engaged, in his History of the World. In
                    1577 or 1578 he proceeded to the Low Countries with the troops sent by the queen
                    to assist the Dutch against the Spaniards, and probably shared the glory of the
                    decisive victory obtained over Don John of Austria in 1578. On his return to
                    England, a new enterprise engaged his attention. His half-brother, Sir Humphrey
                    Gilbert, having obtained a patent to plant and inhabit some parts of North
                    America, Raleigh embarked in this adventure; but meeting with a Spanish fleet,
                    after a smart engagement they returned, without success, in 1579.</p>
                <p>The following year the king of Spain, in conjunction with the pope, having
                    projected a total conquest of the English dominions, sent troops to Ireland to
                    assist the Desmonds in the Munster rebellion. Raleigh obtained a captain’s
                    commission under Lord Grey of Wilton, then deputy of Ireland, and embarked for
                    that kingdom, where he greatly distinguished himself both for bravery and for
                    skill. He returned to England, and attracted the notice of Queen Elizabeth,
                    owing, as we are told in Naunton <hi rend="superscript">1</hi> S <hi
                    rend="italic">Fragmenta Regalia,</hi> to the following accidental piece of
                    gallantry. The queen, as she was one day taking a walk, being stopped by a <hi
                    rend="italic">splashy</hi> place in the road, Raleigh immediately took off his
                    new-plush mantle, and spread it on the ground. Her majesty trod gently over the
                    soft foot-cloth. Surprised and pleased with the adventure, and much struck by
                    the noble appearance of the young soldier, she admitted him to her court, and
                    employed him first as an attendant on the French ambassador Simier upon his
                    return home, and afterwards to escort the Duke of Anjou to Antwerp. During this
                    excursion he became personally known to the Prince of Orange; from whom, at his
                    return, he brought especial acknowledgments to the queen, who now frequently
                    conversed with him. But the inactive life of a courtier did not suit the
                    enterprising spirit of Raleigh. He took advantage of his favour with the queen
                    to obtain, in 1584, a patent empowering him to possess such countries as he
                    should discover on the continent of North America. Accordingly he fitted out, at
                    his own expense, two ships, which sailed in the month of April, and returned to
                    England about the middle of September, reporting that they had discovered and
                    taken possession of a fine country, to which the queen gave the name of <hi
                    rend="italic">Virginia.</hi> About this time he was elected knight of the shire
                    for the county of Devon, and soon afterwards received the honour of knighthood;
                    and, to enable him to carry on his designs abroad, the queen granted him a
                    patent for licensing the venders of wine throughout the kingdom. In 1585 he sent
                    a new expedition to Virginia, commanded by his relation Sir Richard Greenville,
                    who left a colony at Roanah of 107 persons, under the government of Mr Lane; and
                    by the establishment of this colony he was enabled to import tobacco into
                    England. In the same year Sir Walter Rideigh obtained a grant of twelve thousand
                    acres of the forfeited lands in the county of Cork in Ireland. About the same
                    time he was made seneschal of the duchy of Cornwall, and warden of the
                    Stanneries.</p>
                <p>In the year 1587 he sent another colony to Virginia; but his various undertakings
                    and offices obliged him to assign his patent to a company, and the plan of
                    colonizing was by them speedily relinquished, so that the unfortunate colonists
                    were left to their fate. About this time we find our knight distinguished by the
                    titles of “Captain of the Queen’s Guards,” and “Lieutenant-General of Cornwall.”
                    From this period to the year 1594, he was continually engaged in projecting new
                    expeditions, defending the kingdom from the insults of the Spaniards, and
                    transacting parliamentary business with equal ability and resolution. Sir Walter
                    fell under the queen’s displeasure on account of an alleged intrigue with the
                    daughter of Sir Nicholas Throgmorton, one of the maids of honour; however, he
                    married the lady, and lived with her in great conjugal harmony. During his
                    disgrace at court he projected the conquest of Guiana in South America, and in
                    1595 sailed for that country, in the vain hope of discovering the golden region
                    of <hi rend="italic">El Dorado,</hi> supposed <pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:wu.89119129625&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=74" xml:id="kp-eb0719-0074-0064"
                    />to be situated in the depths of Guiana. He returned to England the same year,
                    and soon afterwards published an account of his expedition. In the following
                    year he was one of the admirals in the successful expedition against Cadiz,
                    under the command of Howard and the Earl of Essex: and in 1597 he sailed with
                    the same commanders against the /Yzores. Soon after these expeditions we find
                    him assiduously engaged in parliamentary business. His speeches evince a
                    knowledge of political economy far superior to any man of his time. In 1600 he
                    was sent on a joint embassy with Lord Cobham to Flanders, and on his return made
                    governor of Jersey.</p>
                <p>Queen Elizabeth died in the beginning of the year 1603; and with her Raleigh’s
                    glory and felicity sunk, never to rise again. Upon the accession of James, Sir
                    Walter lost his interest at court, was stripped of his preferments, and accused
                    of a plot against the king. He was arraigned at Winchester, and, on his trial,
                    insulted with the most shocking brutality by the famous Coke, attorney-general,
                    who influenced the jury to convict him without any legal proof of his guilt.
                    After a month’s imprisonment, however, in daily expectation of his execution, he
                    was reprieved and sent to the Tower; and his estates were given to Car, earl of
                    Somerset, the king’s favourite. During this confinement he wrote many of his
                    most valuable pieces, particularly his History of the World. In March 1615,
                    after sixteen years’ imprisonment, he obtained his liberty, and immediately
                    began to prepare for another voyage to Guiana, which proved equally abortive and
                    ruinous. In the year 1618, he returned from this fatal voyage to England, where
                    he was soon afterwards seized, imprisoned, and beheaded. He was sacrificed by
                    the pusillanimous monarch to appease the Spaniards, who, whilst Raleigh lived,
                    thought every part of their dominions in danger. He was executed in Old Palace
                    Yard, and buried in St Margaret’s adjoining, in the sixty-sixth year of his age.
                    His behaviour on the scaffold was manly, unaffected, cheerful, and easy. Being
                    asked by the executioner which way he would lay his head, he answered, “So the
                    heart be right, it is no matter which way the head lies.” He was a man of
                    admirable parts, extensive knowledge, undaunted resolution, and perhaps the best
                    prose writer of his age. His great work, the History of the World, is a truly
                    remarkable performance, both for matter and for style. It has often been
                    reprinted in folio. An edition of his whole works was published at Oxford in
                    1829, in eight volumes octavo.</p>
