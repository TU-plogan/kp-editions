                <p><label type="entry">RHINE</label> one of the circles of which the present kingdom
                    of Bavaria is composed, and what till the treaty of Vienna in 1815 formed the
                    French department of Mont Tonnere, and parts of the departments of the Lower
                    Rhine and the Saar. It is situated on the left bank of the river from which it
                    takes the name, and is bounded on the northwest by the Prussian territory; on
                    the north by Hesse Darmstadt; on the east by the river Rhine, which divides it
                    from Baden, and by France; and on the west by the Prussian province of
                    Saarbruche. It extends over 2155 square miles, and in 1834 contained 554,932
                    inhabitants, living in forty-four cities and towns, and in 665 villages. The
                    number of the Catholics and Protestants is nearly equal. The province is
                    divided, according to the former system introduced by France, into four
                    departments or districts, and these are subdivided into cantons and communes.
                    The face of the country is generally mountainous, with valleys between of
                    considerable fertility; but none of the elevations exceeds 2200 feet. A large
                    portion of the circle is covered with woods. Sufficient corn for the consumption
                    is produced. Much wine is made; but little care being devoted to that article,
                    it is almost wholly applied to internal consumption. There are some large mining
                    operations in iron, and coals are found in abundance. Some mines of silver are
                    now at work on a small scale; and several of quicksilver, copper, lead, and
                    cobalt. Pot and pearl ashes are made extensively; and there are numerous
                    saw-mills in operation. There are considerable manufactures of woollen, and also
                    of hardware; and linen and cotton are manufactured to a small extent.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Rhine,</hi><hi rend="italic">Lower,</hi> a department of
                    France, formed out of the German dominion of Alsace, and the territories of the
                    former princes who were sovereigns of the several subdivisions. It is situated
                    between 48.12. and 49.8. of north latitude, and between 6. 49. and 8. 9. of east
                    longitude. It is bounded on the north by the department of the Moselle, and by
                    the Bavarian province of the Rhine, from which it is separated by the river
                    Lauter. On the east the Rhine is the boundary which divides it from the duchy of
                    Baden. On the south it joins the department of the Upper Rhine, and on the west
                    that of the Vosges and of the Meurthe. It extends over 1,161,862 acres, equal to
                    1831 square miles; and it contains 561,859 inhabitants of German origin, and the
                    greater part of whom speak only that language. Though the majority adhere to the
                    Catholic Church, the two sects of Protestants are numerous; the Lutherans being
                    estimated at 160,000, and the Calvinists at 28,000. The eastern part is a rich
                    level plain extending along the side of the Rhine, and watered by small streams
                    issuing from the hills in the western part, and emptying themselves into that
                    stream, after fertilizing the soil. The state of culture is good; and the land,
                    cultivated like a garden, produces most abundant crops. In proceeding westward
                    from the river, the ground rises gradually from hills 300 feet in height to
                    mountains between 2500 and 4000 feet of elevation. In this mountainous district
                    the soil is stony or sandy, and of ungrateful kind; but it abounds with
                    extensive and valuable woods, whilst in the valleys some rich pasture-land is
                    found. In the lower districts the chief bread-corn grown is wheat or winter
                    barley, on the hilly parts rye and oats; but the whole department has a surplus
                    of grain to aid the districts around them with one twelfth of its produce. On
                    the levels great crops are raised of hemp, flax, tobacco, mustard, aniseed,
                    hops, coriander seeds, poppy and other oil plants, and abundance of madder
                    scarcely inferior to that of Holland. The hills afford fuel and timber, and
                    their sides are covered with vineyards yielding abundance of wine of various
                    kinds, and some very highly esteemed. Apples, pears, and plums, are abundant
                    everywhere. Wine and fruit are considerable branches of the export trade. The
                    mineral productions are insignificant, and confined to small portions of iron
                    and some coals. There are various manufactories carried on in other parts of the
                    district, but the chief are in and about Strasburg. They are ironmongery and
                    firearms (including cannon), linen-weaving, spinning and weaving cottons,
                    tanning leather, making paper, and some porcelain, and several minuter
                    commodities. The Rhine facilitates commerce with Germany, with Holland, and with
                    Switzerland, all of which branches are on the increase. The department elects
                    four deputies to the legislative chamber. It contains four arrondissements,
                    thirty-three cantons, and 554 communes. Strasburg is the capital, with a
                    population in 1836 of 57,885.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Rhine,</hi><hi rend="italic">Upper,</hi> a department in the
                    south-east of France, formed out of Upper Alsace, the Sundgau, and the territory
                    of Mulhausen. It is situated between 47. 27. and 48. 14. of north latitude, and
                    between 6. 41. and 7. 27. of cast longitude. It extends over 1586 square miles,
                    and comprehends three arrondissements, twenty-nine cantons, and 489 communes.
                    The population amounts to 447,019. They are generally of the German race, and
                    speak a corrupt dialect of that language, very little differing from that spoken
                    in Switzerland. They are for the most part of the Romish religion; but there are
                    40,000 Calvinists, 16,000 Lutherans, 3000 Menonites, and about 10,000 Jews, all
                    equally recognised by the government. It is bounded on the north by the
                    department of the Lower Rhine, on the east that river divides it from Baden, on
                    the south it touches on Switzerland and on the Doubs, and the departments of the
                    Upper Saone and of the Vosges bound it on the west. It is generally a hilly, in
                    some parts a mountainous district, especially on the western side, where the
                    range of the Vosges enters and approaches the Jura Mountains. The chief rivers
                    are the Rhine and the llle, both of which are navigable. There are several small
                    internal lakes, some of them in very elevated situations, especially the Black
                    and the White Lakes, the former of which is three miles in circuit, and the
                    latter said to be 1000 feet <pb break="no"

                    />in depth. There are also many small canals, some to facilitate conveyance, and
                    others to promote irrigation. The agriculture is conducted with a rigid
                    adherence to old customs. The corn does not suffice for the consumption. Wheat
                    is only grown in a few favoured spots; the greater portion of bread-corn is rye,
                    and potatoes are extensively cultivated as a substitute for grain. The valleys
                    afford good fattening and dairy land; but the black cattle are for the most part
                    brought from Germany when young, and on the pastures here yield good butter,
                    cheese, and meat The breed of sheep has been much neglected. The horses are a
                    small race, and not numerous. The hills have extensive vineyards, and produce
                    abundance of wine, some of which is good, and forms an article of considerable
                    export trade. The best sorts are those furnished in the vicinity of Colmar,
                    Turkheim, and Befort. There are a great number of fruit-trees, but especially of
                    cherries, from which a distillation is made; and the spirit called ki <hi
                    rend="italic">rchenwasser</hi> is highly valued in Switzerland. This is a mining
                    district, which formerly produced silver, copper, and lead; but the operations
                    are now chiefly directed to obtaining iron and coal. These are the foundations
                    of the chief manufactures, which employ a great number of hands in making cast
                    and hammered iron, and ironmongery goods of various descriptions. There are
                    several paper-mills, and many for spinning both cotton and flax. There are also
                    manufactures of wool and hosiery. Much potash is also made, and some porcelain
                    and glass. These are the basis of what trade exists. The capital of the
                    department is the city of Colmar, with 15,958 inhabitants in 1836.</p>
