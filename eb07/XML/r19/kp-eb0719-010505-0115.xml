                <p><label type="entry">REID</label> Dr Thomas, a distinguished philosopher, and in
                    some measure the founder of a school, was the son of Lewis Reid, minister of the
                    parish of Strachan, in the county of Kincardine, Scotland. His mother, the
                    daughter of Mr Gregory of Kinnairdie, in Banffshire, was one of twenty-nine
                    children, and sister to David, James, and Charles Gregory, who were at the same
                    period professors of astronomy or mathematics in the universities of Oxford,
                    Edinburgh, and St Andrews.</p>
                <p>Dr Reid was born at the parsonage-house of Strachan in April 1710, and received
                    the elementary parts of his education at the parish-school of Kincardine O’Neil.
                    The parochial schools of Scotland are said to have been much superior at that
                    period to what they are at present, and young men went from them well furnished
                    with philological learning to the different universities. The early progress of
                    young Reid must have been very extraordinary,</p>
                <p>VOL. xix.</p>
                <p>since he was qualified to profit by the lectures of the professors at the age of
                    twelve. He soon gave very striking' proofs that he inherited the genius of his
                    mother’s family, and was conspicuous amongst the students of mathematics, in a
                    college where that science has always been cultivated with zeal and success. He
                    continued longer at the university than the usual term of years, having been
                    appointed to the office of librarian, a situation which was every way agreeable
                    to him, as it gave him ample opportunities of gratifying his passion for study.
                    About this time he became intimately attached to John Stewart, afterwards
                    professor of mathematics in Marischal College, a connection which greatly
                    strengthened his predilection for mathematical studies.</p>
                <p>He resigned the office of librarian in the year 1736, and accompanied Mr Stewart
                    to England, when they paid a visit to London, Oxford, and Cambridge, and were
                    introduced to several persons of the first literary distinction. On account of
                    his relation to Dr David Gregory, he had ready access to the celebrated Martin
                    Folkes, whose house might be said to contain many of the most interesting
                    objects to be met with in the metropolis. He saw Dr Bentley at Cambridge, with
                    whose erudition he was much delighted, as well as amused with his vanity; and he
                    also conversed frequently with Saunderson, the blind mathematician. Dr Reid in
                    his philosophical speculations refers to this gentleman’s blindness, as a
                    singular phenomenon in the history of the human mind.</p>
                <p>Dr Reid maintained an uninterrupted friendship with the learned and amiable Mr
                    Stewart until the year 1766, at which time the latter was carried off by a
                    malignant fever. The circumstances attending the death of this excellent man
                    deeply wounded the sensibility of Dr Reid; for his wife and daughter were
                    carried ofl' by the same disorder, and buried with him in the same grave.</p>
                <p>The King’s College of Aberdeen presented Dr Reid to the living of New Machar in
                    the year 1737; but such was the zeal of the people against the law of patronage
                    at that time, that he not only met with violent opposition, but was also exposed
                    to personal danger. But his attention to the duties of his office was so
                    exemplary, his temper so mild and forbearing, and his spirit of humanity so
                    active, that in a short time he subdued their prejudices; and when at last
                    called in the course of Providence to a different situation, the very people who
                    had been guilty of gross and indecent outrages against him followed him, on his
                    departure, with their benedictions and tears.</p>
                <p>In the year 1740, he married Elizabeth, daughter of his uncle, Dr George Reid,
                    physician in London, after which his popularity at New Machar very much
                    increased. Her manners were so accommodating, and so numerous were her kind
                    offices to the sick and the indigent, that the departure of the family from the
                    neighbourhood was looked upon as a general misfortune. The manner in which
                    several old men were accustomed to speak upon the subject is worthy of being
                    kept in remembrance. “We fought,” said they, “against Dr Reid when he came, and
                    we would have fought for him when he went away.”</p>
                <p>The greater part of his time during his residence at New Machar was devoted to
                    the most intense study, particularly directing his attention to the laws of
                    external perception, and of the other principles which constitute the basis of
                    human knowledge. He unbended his mind by the amusements of gardening and botany,
                    of which he was extremely fond, even in old age.</p>
                <p>The professors of King’s College, in the year 1752, made choice of Dr Reid to be
                    professor of philosophy, originating wholly from the high opinion they were led
                    to entertain of his talents and erudition. We are not acquainted with the
                    particular plan which he adopted and pursued in the course of his lectures; but
                    his department at that period comprehended mathematics and physic, logic and o

                    xml:id="kp-eb0719-0116-0106"/>ethics; a practice then followed in the other
                    universities of Scotland, instead of appointing a professor for each distinct
                    branch.</p>
                <p>Dr Reid had not been long in Aberdeen, till, in conjunction with Dr John
                    Gregorj', he projected a literarj’ society, which continued for a number of
                    years, and met once a week. The writings of Reid, Gregory, Campbell, Beattie,
                    and Gerard, evince the numerous advantages which the members derived from this
                    institution, as they were in the habit of subjecting such works as they intended
                    for publication, to the test of friendly criticism.</p>
                <p>It is perhaps not too much to assert, that of all the publications which appeared
                    about this time, the Inquiry into the Human Mind by Dr Reid discovered by far
                    the greatest originality and profound thinking. It appears that he had conceived
                    the plan, and deeply meditated upon it, long before its publication; yet,
                    without the applause of his literary associates, it is more than probable that
                    his native modesty would have prevented him from giving it to the world.</p>
                <p>The publication of Mr Hume’s Treatise of Human Nature, in 1739, led him to
                    question the principles commonly received with regard to the human
                    understanding. He admitted, when a youth, but without any attentive examination,
                    the opinions on which Mr Hume’s scepticism was raised; but when he carefully
                    adverted to the consequences which these principles appeared to involve, he
                    instantly began to suspect their truth. To subvert the sceptical theory of Mr
                    Hume was the grand object of Dr Reid’s Inquiry, which he submitted to the
                    examination of Mr Hume himself. That philosopher, even after he had seen some
                    parts of the work, discovers not a little of the Jewish spirit of unbelief that
                    any good thing should come out of Nazareth; and considering his antagonist as a
                    clergyman, and belonging to an order of men from whom prejudice would not allow
                    him to expect any soundness of reasoning in matters of science, he betrays more
                    than want of good humour, as Dr Reid’s biographer expresses himself, when he
                    says, in no very courteous language, in a letter to Dr Blair, “I wish that the
                    parsons would confine themselves to their old occupation of worrying one
                    another, and leave philosophers to argue with temper, moderation, and good
                    manners.” But though Mr Hume, as appears from the words just quoted, was very
                    angry that a clergyman should become a philosopher, on a second perusal of the
                    Inquiry, he seems to have held very different sentiments, when he wrote to the
                    author himself in the following terms. “By Dr Butler’s means, I have been
                    favoured with the perusal of your performance, which I have read with great
                    pleasure and attention. It is certainly very rare, that a piece so deeply
                    philosophical is wrote [written] with so much spirit, and affords so much
                    entertainment to the reader; though I must still regret the disadvantages under
                    which I read it, as I never had the whole performance at once before me, and
                    could not be able fidly to compare one part with another. To this reason,
                    chiefly, I ascribe some obscurities, which, in spite of your short analysis or
                    abstract, still seem to hang over your system. For I must do you the justice to
                    own, that when I entered into your ideas, no man appears to ex-</p>
                <p>press himself with greater perspicuity than you do; a ta-ent which, above all
                    others, is requisite in that species of literature which you have
                    cultivated....As I was desirous to be of some use to you, I kept a watchful eye
                    all along over your style; but it is really so correct, and so good English,
                    that I found not any thing worth the remarking. There is only one passage in
                    this chapter, where you make use of the phrase <hi rend="italic">hinder to
                    do</hi> instead of <hi rend="italic">hinder from doing,</hi> which is the
                    English one; but I could not find the passage when I sought for it. You may
                    judge how unexceptionable the whole appeared to me, when I could remark so small
                    a blemish.”</p>
                <p>The impression made on the minds of speculative men by the publication of Dr
                    Reid’s Inquiry was as great as could reasonably be expected from the nature of
                    his undertaking. It was not level to the comprehension of the multitude, nor
                    even addressed to them; and as it examined opinions with the utmost freedom
                    which had obtained the sanction of the highest authorities, it had little
                    prospect of conciliating the favour of the learned. Some, however, there were,
                    who perceived the extent of his views, and beheld in his pages the true spirit
                    and language of inductive investigation, which made proselytes of many, who,
                    again, warmly recommended the work to the attention of others. The Inquiry of Dr
                    Reid was so much esteemed by the learned body of teachers then in the University
                    of Glasgow, that they gave him an invitation to the vacant professorship of
                    moral philosophy in the year 1763. It was no doubt with a considerable degree of
                    reluctance that he resolved to leave Aberdeen; yet so numerous were the
                    allurements which Glasgow presented to a man of his extensive erudition and deep
                    research, that he gave it the preference. That seminary of learning could then
                    boast of a Moor, a Simpson, a Black, a Leechman, the two Wilsons, father and
                    son, and the acute, discriminating Millar, with all of whom he was more or less
                    intimate, and whose fascinating conversation made him in some measure forget
                    that he had long been acquainted with men of genius in the university of
                    Aberdeen.</p>
                <p>Dr Reid’s merit as a public teacher arose principally from that fund of original
                    philosophy which is characteristic of his writings, and from his invincible
                    patience and perseverance in recommending such principles as he conceived to be
                    of the last importance to human happiness. His style, too, was simple and
                    perspicuous; his character was grave and possessed of authority; and his
                    students felt such an interest in the doctrines which he inculcated, that he
                    never failed to be heard with the most profound attention.</p>
                <p>In the year 1773 his remarks on Aristotle’s logic appeared in Lord Karnes’s
                    Sketches of the History of Man. “In attempting,” says he, “to give some account
                    of the Analytics and of the Topics of Aristotle, ingenuity [ingenuousness]
                    obliges me to confess, that though I have often purposed to read the whole with
                    care, and to understand what is intelligible, yet my courage and patience always
                    failed before I had done. Why should I throw away so much time and painful
                    attention upon a thing of so little use? If I had lived in those ages when the
                    knowledge of Aristotle’s <hi rend="italic">Organon</hi> entitled a man to the
                    highest rank in philosophy', ambition might have induced me to employ upon it
                    some years of painful study; and less, I conceive, would not be sufficient. Such
                    reflections as these always got the better of my resolution when the first
                    ardour began to cool. All I can saj’ is, that I have read some part of the
                    different books with care, some slightly, and some perhaps not at all. I have
                    glanced over the whole often; and when any thing attracted my attention, have
                    dipped into it till my appetite was satisfied.”</p>
                <p>But, in spite of his modest declarations, it is matter of doubt with some,
                    whether any of his publications does him more honour than his perspicuous view
                    of this complicated system. It is unquestionably superior to any other analysis
                    of these writings that we have yet seen; an opinion amply confirmed by the
                    sentiments of different literary characters who were intimately acquainted with
                    the works of the great philosopher of antiquity.</p>
                <p>Dr Reid declined reading lectures in the university for some years before his
                    death; and he devoted this period to the task of preparing for the press his
                    great work, which was published in two volumes 4to, the first in 1785, entitled
                    Essays on the Intellectual Powere of Man; and the second in 1788, entitled
                    Essays on the Active Powers of <pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:wu.89119129625&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=117" xml:id="kp-eb0719-0117-0107"
                    />Man. His Essay on Quantity, occasioned by reading a Treatise in which Simple
                    and Compound Ratios are applied to Virtue and Merit, was composed previously to
                    the year 1748, and published in the Philosophical Transactions of London for
                    that year. This paper affords some light respecting the progress of his
                    speculations about the period in question. The Inquiry into the Human Mind, of
                    which we have already taken notice, appeared in 1764; and at this time he was
                    complimented with the degree of Doctor in Divinity.</p>
                <p>In the year 1796, the last of his life, he was prevailed upon to spend with his
                    friends at Edinburgh a few weeks during the summer. From that visit he returned
                    to Glasgow in his usual health and spirits, and for some time continued to
                    devote a portion of his time to the exercise both of body and of mind. But about
                    the end of September he was seized with a violent disorder, with which he
                    maintained a severe struggle; and this, together with repeated strokes of the
                    palsy, put a period to his long and useful life on the 7th of October, and in
                    the eighty-seventh year of his age.</p>
                <p>As to his bodily constitution, few men have ever been more indebted to nature
                    than Dr Reid. In this respect he was athletic and vigorous, and his muscular
                    strength was uncommonly great; advantages which were powerfully seconded by his
                    temperance, exercise, and the unclouded serenity of his temper. Deep and
                    collected thought was very conspicuous in his countenance, and all his looks
                    were expressive of kindness and good will.</p>
                <p>With respect to his character, his rectitude was inflexible and intrepid; his
                    attachment to truth was pure; and he had an entire command over all his
                    passions, which he acquired by the unwearied exertions of a long life. When,
                    therefore, he found it necessary to dispute the conclusions of others in any of
                    his writings, he never employed any expressions to irritate those whom he was
                    anxious to convince; and the asperity of his opponents could not provoke him to
                    repress his spirit of liberality and good humour; for he considered the
                    intemperance with which controversy is carried on, as an enemy to the progress
                    of useful knowledge, and as having done more harm to the practice than service
                    to the theory of morality. He uniformly maintained the dignity of philosophy in
                    private life, and he united in his character the most amiable modesty and
                    gentleness with the noblest spirit of independence. He never solicited any
                    favours from the great; and all his academical or other preferments were
                    conferred upon him by those who were real judges of his merit, and thought he
                    deserved them. To a sound, cautious, and discriminating judgment, a singular
                    patience and perseverance of thought, and fixed attention to the operations of
                    his own mind, he added the curiosity of a naturalist and the eyes of an
                    observer; and of course his information was accurate and extensive. His
                    sensibility was of an active and lively nature; and wherever he could command
                    the means of relieving the distressed, he always employed them with the utmost
                    possible secrecy. The life of Dr Reid, by his disciple and friend Mr Dugald
                    Stewart, the great ornament of his master’s school, is known to all the world as
                    one of the first specimens of philosophical biography that any language can
                    furnish.</p>
