                <p><label type="entry">REFORMATION</label> is, in general, the act of reforming or
                    correcting an error or abuse in religion, discipline, or the like. By way of
                    eminence, the word is used for that great alteration and reformation in the
                    corrupted system of Christianity, commenced by Luther in the year 1517.</p>
                <p>Before the period of the Reformation, the pope had declared himself the sovereign
                    of the whole world. All the parts of it which were inhabited by those who were
                    not Christians, he accounted the same as if they were uninhabited; and if those
                    who called themselves Christians resolved on occupying any of those countries,
                    he gave them full liberty to make war upon the inhabitants without any
                    provocation. The countries, if conquered, were to be parcelled out according to
                    the pope’s pleasure; and dreadful was the situation of that prince who refused
                    to obey the will of the sovereign pontiff In consequence of this extraordinary
                    authority which the pope had assumed, he at last granted to the king of Portugal
                    all the countries to the eastward of Cape Nun in Africa, and to the king of
                    Spain all the countries to the westward of that point or headland. In this,
                    according to the opinions of some, was completed in his person the character of
                    Antichrist sitting in the temple of God, and showing himself as God (2 Thess.
                    ii. 4). He had long before, say they, assumed in spiritual matters the supremacy
                    belonging to the Deity himself; and now he assumed the same supremacy in
                    temporal affairs, giving the extreme regions of the earth to whomsoever he
                    pleased. The Reformation, therefore, they consider as the immediate effect of
                    divine power taking vengeance on this and all other deviations from the system
                    of truth; whilst others regard it merely as an effect of natural causes, which
                    might have been foreseen and prevented, without abridging the papal power in any
                    considerable degree.</p>
                <p>Be this as it may, however, the partition above mentioned was the last piece of
                    insolence which the pope ever had,</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="ht:wu.89119129625&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=98"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0719-0098-0088"/>
                <p>or in all probability ever will have, it in his power to exercise, in the way of
                    parcelling out the globe amongst his adherents. Everything was quiet, every
                    heretic had been ex- <hi rend="subscript">l</hi> terminated, and the whole
                    Christian world supinely acqui- <hi rend="subscript">ι</hi> esced in the
                    enormous absurdities which were inculcated upon them; when, in 1517, a spirit of
                    inquiry arose, and the empire of superstition began to decline. The person who
                    made the first attack on the extravagant superstitions then prevalent was Martin
                    Luther. By some it is pretended that the only motive which Luther had in
                    beginning the Reformation was his enmity to the Dominicans, who had excluded his
                    order, the Augustinians, from all share in the gainful traffic of indulgences.
                    But this does not seem at all probable, for such a motive would not naturally
                    lead him to deny the virtue of indulgences, whilst his conduct could not but
                    exclude him for ever from any chance of a share in the traffic, which otherwise
                    he might perhaps have obtained. Besides, this traffic was so contrary to the
                    common principles of reason and honesty, that we cannot wonder at finding one
                    man in the world who had sense enough to discern it, and virtue enough to oppose
                    such a disgraceful practice. In all probability, however, the insignificance of
                    the first reformer was the reason why he was not persecuted and exterminated at
                    the very outset, as others had been before him. Another reason probably might
                    be, that he did not at once attack the whole errors of Popery, but brought about
                    his reformation gradually, probably as it occurred to himself.</p>
                <p>The Reformation commenced in the city of Wittenberg "in Saxony, but was not long
                    confined either to that city or to the province in which it is situated. In 1520
                    the Franciscan friars, who had the care of promulgating indulgences in
                    Switzerland, were opposed by Zuinglius, a man not inferior in understanding and
                    knowledge to Luther himself. He proceeded with the greatest vigour to overturn
                    the whole fabric of Popery; but his opinions were declared to be erroneous by
                    the universities of Cologne and Louvain. Notwithstanding this, the magistrates
                    of Zurich approved of his proceedings; and the whole of that canton, together
                    with those of Berne, Basil, and Schauffhausen, embraced his opi nions.</p>
                <p>In Germany, Luther continued to make great advances, without being in the least
                    intimidated by the ecclesiastical censures which were thundered against him from
                    all quarters. Continually protected by the German princes, either from religious
                    or political motives, his adversaries could not accomplish his destruction as
                    they had done that of others. Those princes who were upon bad terms with the
                    court of Rome took advantage of the success of the new doctrines, and in their
                    own dominions easily overturned a church which had lost all respect and
                    veneration amongst the inferior ranks. The court of Rome had disobliged some of
                    the smaller princes in the north of Germany, whom the pope probably thought too
                    insignificant to be worth managing; and they, in revenge, universally
                    established the Reformation in their own dominions. Melancthon, Carlostadt, and
                    other men of eminence, also greatly forwarded the work of Luther; and in all
                    probability the papal hierarchy would have soon come to an end, in the northern
                    parts of Europe at least, had not the Emperor Charles V. given a severe check to
                    the progress of the Reformation in Germany. In order to follow out the schemes
                    dictated by his ambition, he thought it necessary to ingratiate himself with the
                    pope; and the most effectual method of doing this seemed to be by the
                    destruction of Luther. The pope’s legates insisted that Luther ought to be
                    condemned by the Diet of Worms, as a most notorious, avowed, and incorrigible
                    heretic. This however appeared unjust to the members of the diet, and he was
                    summoned to appear personally, which he accordingly did without hesitation.
                    There is not the least doubt that his appearance there would have been his last
                    in this world, if the astonishing respect that was paid him, and the crowds who
                    came daily to see him, had not deterred his judges from employing summary means
                    against the author of such a heresy. He was therefore permitted to depart with a
                    safe-conduct for a certain time; after which he remained in the state of a
                    proscribed or intercommuned criminal, to whom it was unlawful to perform any of
                    the ordinary offices of humanity.</p>
                <p>During the confinement of Luther in a castle near Warburg, the Reformation
                    advanced rapidly, almost every city in Saxony embracing the Lutheran opinions.
                    At this time an alteration in the established forms bf worship was first
                    adventured upon at Wittenberg, by abolishing the celebration of private masses,
                    and giving the cup as well as the bread to the laity in the Lord’s Supper. In a
                    short time, however, the new opinions were condemned by the university of Paris,
                    and a refutation of them was attempted by Henry VIII. of England. But Luther was
                    not to be thus intimidated. He published his animadversions on both with as much
                    acrimony as if he had been refuting the meanest adversary; and a controversy
                    managed by such illustrious antagonists attracted general attention, the
                    Reformers daily gaining new converts both in France and England.</p>
                <p>But whilst the efforts of Luther were thus everywhere crowned with success, the
                    divisions began to prevail which have since so much agitated the reformed
                    churches. The first dispute occurred between Luther and Zuinglius concerning the
                    manner in which the body and blood of Christ were present in the Eucharist.
                    Luther and his followers, although they had rejected the notion of
                    transubstantiation, were nevertheless of opinion that the body and blood of
                    Christ were really present in the Lord’s Supper, in a way which they could not
                    pretend to explain. Carlostadt, who was Luther’s colleague, first suggested
                    another view of the subject, which was afterwards confirmed and illustrated by
                    Zuinglius, namely, that the body and blood of Christ were not really present in
                    the Eucharist; and that the bread and wine were no more than external symbols to
                    excite the remembrance of Christ’s sufferings in the minds of those who received
                    it. Both parties maintained their tenets with the utmost obstinacy, and, by
                    their divisions, first gave their adversaries an argument against them, which to
                    this day the Catholics urge with great force; alleging that the Protestants are
                    so divided that it is impossible to know who is right or who is wrong; and
                    arguing from these divisions, that the whole doctrine is false.</p>
                <p>To these intestine divisions were added the horrors of a&lt; civil war,
                    occasioned by oppression on the one hand, and by enthusiasm on the other. In
                    1525, a great number of seditious fanatics arose on a sudden in different parts
                    of Germany; and having taken arms, they united their forces, and made war
                    against the empire, laying waste the country with fire and sword, and committing
                    everywhere the most barbarous cruelties. The greater part of this furious mob
                    was composed of peasants and vassals, who groaned under heavy burdens, and
                    declared that they were no longer able to bear the despotic government of their
                    chiefs; and hence this sedition received the name of the Rustic War, or the War
                    of the Peasants. At first this rabble declared, that they had no other motives
                    than the redress of their grievances; but no sooner had the enthusiast Munster,
                    the Anabaptist, placed himself at their head, than the face of things was
                    entirely changed, and the civil commotions in Saxony and Thuringia rapidly
                    increased. (See the article Anabap <hi rend="smallcaps">’ nsts.)</hi></p>
                <p>In the mean time Frederick, surnamed the Wise, elector of Saxony, and Luther’s
                    great patron, departed this life, and was succeeded by his brother John.
                    Frederick, though he had protected and encouraged Luther, yet was at no pains to
                    introduce the reformed religion into his dominions. But with his successor it
                    proved otherwise; for he, being convinced that Luther’s doctrine must soon be
                    totally destroyed <pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:wu.89119129625&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=99" xml:id="kp-eb0719-0099-0089"
                    />and suppressed unless it received a speedy and effectual support, ordered
                    Luther and Melancthon to draw up a body of laws relating to the form of
                    ecclesiastical government, the method of public worship, and other necessary
                    matters, which were to be proclaimed by heralds throughout his dominions. This
                    example was followed by all the princes and states of Germany who had renounced
                    the papal supremacy; and a similar form of worship, discipline, and government,
                    was thus introduced into all the churches which had dissented from that of Rome.
                    This open renunciation of the ancient ecclesiastical jurisdiction changed the
                    face of affairs; and the patrons of Popery intimated, in a manner not at all
                    ambiguous, that they intended to make war upon the Lutheran arty. On the other
                    hand, the Lutherans, apprised of these ostile intentions, began to deliberate on
                    a proper plan of defence against the attack with which they were threatened.</p>
                <p>The Diet of the Empire assembled in the year 1526, at Spires, where the emperor’s
                    ambassadors were desired to use their utmost endeavours to suppress all disputes
                    about religion, and to insist upon the rigorous execution of the sentence which
                    had been pronounced against Luther and his followers at Worms. The greater part
                    of the German princes, however, opposed this motion with the utmost resolution;
                    declaring that they could neither execute the sentence, nor come to any
                    determination with regard to the doctrines by which it had been occasioned,
                    before the whole matter had been submitted to the decision of a council lawfully
                    assembled; and further alleging, that the decision of controversies of this
                    nature belonged properly to a general council, and to it alone. This opinion,
                    after long and warm debates, was adopted by a majority, and at length consented
                    to by the whole assembly. It was unanimously agreed to present a solemn address
                    to the emperor, entreating him to assemble, without delay, a general council;
                    whilst in the mean time it was also agreed, that the princes of the empire
                    should, in their respective dominions, be at liberty to manage ec-</p>
                <p>clesiastical affairs in the manner they should think most proper, yet so as to be
                    able to give to God and the emperor a proper account of their administration
                    whenever it should be required of them.</p>
                <p>These resolutions proved exceedingly favourable to the cause of reformation.
                    Neither had the emperor, for some time, any leisure to give disturbance to the
                    reformed. The war, which about this time ensued between him and the pope, gave
                    the greatest advantage to the friends of the reformed, and considerably
                    augmented their number. Several princes, whom the fear of persecution and
                    punishment had hitherto prevented from lending their assistance, publicly
                    renounced the Catholic religion, and introduced amongst their subjects the same
                    forms of religious worship, and the same system of doctrine, which had been
                    received in Saxony. Others, though placed in such circumstances as discouraged
                    them from acting in an open manner against the interests of the Roman pontiff,
                    were, however, far from discovering the smallest opposition to those who
                    withdrew the people from his despotic yoke; nor did they molest the private
                    assemblies of those who had separated themselves from the communion of Rome.
                    And, in general, all the Germans who, before these resolutions of the Diet of
                    Spires, had rejected the papal discipline and doctrine, were now, in consequence
                    of the liberty they enjoyed, wholly employed in bringing their schemes and plans
                    to a certain degree of consistence, and in adding vigour and firmness to the
                    cause in which they were engaged.</p>
                <p>But this tranquillity and liberty were not of long duration. 'In the year 1529, a
                    new diet was assembled at the same place by the emperor, after he had quieted
                    the troubles in various parts of his dominions, and concluded a peace with the
                    pope. The power which had been granted to princes, of managing ecclesiastical
                    affairs until the meeting of a general council, was now revoked by a majority of
                    votes; and cvery</p>
                <p>VOL. XIX.</p>
                <p>change declared unlawful that should be introduced into the doctrine, discipline,
                    or worship of the established religion, before the determination of the
                    approaching council was known. This decree was considered as iniquitous and
                    intolerable by the Elector of Saxony, the Landgrave of Hesse, and other members
                    of the diet, who were persuaded of the necessity of a reformation. The promise
                    of speedily assembling a general council they looked upon as an artifice of the
                    Church of Rome, conceiving that a free and lawful council would be the last
                    thing to which the pope would consent.</p>
                <p>When, therefore, they found that all their arguments and remonstrances made no
                    impression upon Ferdinand, the emperor’s brother, who presided in the diet,
                    Charles himself being then at Barcelona, they entered a solemn protest against
                    this decree on the 19th of April, and appealed to the emperor and a future
                    council. Hence arose the denomination of Protestants, which from this period has
                    been given to those who separated from the communion of the Church of Rome. The
                    princes of the empire who entered this protest, were John elector of Saxony,
                    George elector of Brandenburg, Ernest and Francis dukes of Lunenburg, the
                    Landgrave of Hesse, and the Prince of Anhalt; and they were seconded by thirteen
                    imperial towns, viz. Strasburg, Ulm, Nuremberg, Constance, Windsheim,
                    Memmin-gen, Nordlingen, Lindau, Kempton, Heilbron, Wissem-burg, and St Gall.</p>
                <p>The dissenting princes, who were besides the protectors and heads of the reformed
                    churches, had no sooner entered their protest, than they sent proper persons to
                    the emperor, who was then upon his passage from Spain to Italy, to acquaint him
                    with their proceedings in this matter. The ministers employed in this commission
                    executed it with the greatest intrepidity and presence of mind; but the emperor,
                    exasperated at the audacity of those who presumed to differ from him, caused the
                    ambassadors to be arrested. The news of this violent step made the Protestant
                    princes conclude that their personal safety, and the success of their cause,
                    depended entirely upon their own courage and their union. They therefore
                    determined to enter into a solemn confederacy; and for this purpose they held
                    several meetings at Rot, Nuremberg, Smalcald, and other places; but so different
                    were their opinions and views, that for a time they could determine upon
                    nothing.</p>
                <p>One great obstacle to the intended confederacy was the dispute which had arisen
                    between Luther and Zuinglius, concerning the real presence of Christ in the
                    Lord’s Supper. To terminate this dispute, if possible, Philip, landgrave of
                    Hesse, in the year 1529 invited to a conference at Marpurg, Luther and
                    Zuinglius, together with several other of the more eminent doctors who adhered
                    to the respective parties of these contending chiefs. But this measure was not
                    attended with the salutary effects which were expected from it. The divines
                    disputed for four days in presence of the landgrave. Luther attacked
                    Oecolampa-dius, and Zuinglius was attacked by Melancthon. Zuin-glius was accused
                    of heresy, not only on account of his explanation of the nature and design of
                    the Lord’s Supper, but also in consequence of the false notions which he was
                    supposed to have adopted concerning the divinity of Christ, the efficacy of the
                    Divine Word, original sin, and some other parts of the Christian doctrine. This
                    illustrious reformer, however, cleared himself from the greater part of these
                    charges with the most triumphant evidence, and in such a manner as appeared
                    satisfactory even to Luther himself. But their dissension concerning the manner
                    of Christ’s presence in the Eucharist still remained; nor could either of the
                    contending parties be persuaded to abandon, or even to modify, their opinions
                    upon that matter. The only advantage, therefore, which resulted from the meeting
                    was, that the jarring doctors formed a kind of truce/ by agreeing</p>
                <p>M <pb break="no" facs="ht:wu.89119129625&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=100"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0719-0100-0090"/>to a mutual toleration of their sentiments, and
                    leaving to the disposal of Providence the cure of their divisions.</p>
                <p>In the mean time, news were received that the emperor designed to come into
                    Germany, with a view to terminate all religious differences at the approaching
                    Diet of Augsburg. Having foreseen some of the consequences of those disputes,
                    and, besides, taken the opinion of men of wisdom, sagacity, and experience, he
                    became at certain times more cool in his proceedings, and more impartial in his
                    opinions respecting the contending parties and the merits of the cause. He,
                    therefore, in an interview with the pope at Bologna, insisted, in the most
                    serious and urgent manner, on the necessity of a general council. His
                    remonstrances and expostulations, however, could not move the pontiff, who
                    maintained with zeal the papal prerogatives; reproached the emperor with an
                    ill-judged clemency; and alleged that it was the duty of that prince to support
                    the church, and to execute speedy vengeance upon that obstinate heretical
                    faction who had dared to call in question the authority of Rome. To this
                    discourse the emperor paid no regard, looking upon it as a most iniquitous
                    thing, and a measure directly opposite to the laws of the empire, to condemn
                    unheard so many men who had always approved themselves good citizens, and in
                    other respects deserved well of their country.</p>
                <p>Hitherto indeed it was not easy for the emperor to form a clear idea of the
                    matters in debate, since no regular system had as yet been composed, by which it
                    might be known with certainty what were the true causes of Luther’s opposition
                    to the pope. The Elector of Saxony, therefore, ordered Luther, and other eminent
                    divines, to commit to writing the chief articles of their religious system, and
                    the principal points in which they differed from the Church of Rome. Luther, in
                    compliance with this order, delivered to the elector at Torgau seventeen
                    articles which had been agreed upon in a conference at Sulzbach in 1529, and
                    hence these received the name of the Articles of Torgau. But though these were
                    deemed by Luther a sufficient declaration of the sentiments of the reformers,
                    yet it was judged proper to enlarge them, in order to give perspicuity to their
                    arguments, and strength to their cause. In this work Melancthon was employed;
                    but in it he showed a proper deference to the counsels of Luther, expressing his
                    sentiments and doctrine with the greatest elegance and perspicuity, and thus
                    came forth the famous Confession of Augsburg.</p>
                <p>On the 15th of June 1530, Charles arrived at Augsburg, - and the diet was opened
                    five days afterwards. The Protestants received a formal permission to present an
                    account of their tenets to the diet on the 25th of the same month; and in
                    consequence of this, at the time appointed, Christian Bayer, chancellor of
                    Saxony, read aloud, in the German language, before the emperor and the princes
                    assembled, the Confession of Augsburg above mentioned. It contained twenty-eight
                    chapters, of which twenty-one were employed in representing the religious
                    opinions of the Protestants, and the other seven in pointing out tile errors and
                    superstitions of the Church of Rome. The princes heard it with the deepest
                    attention. It confirmed some in the principles which they had embraced; it
                    surprised others, who had not given much consideration to the subject; and many,
                    who before this time had little or no idea of the religious sentiments of
                    Luther, were now not only convinced of their innocence, but delighted with their
                    purity and simplicity. The copies of this Confession, after being read, were
                    delivered to the emperor, being signed by John elector of Saxony, George marquis
                    of Brandenburg, Ernest duke of Lunenburg, Philip landgrave of Hesse, Wolfgang
                    prince of Anhalt, and by the imperial cities of Nuremberg and Reutlingen.</p>
                <p>The creatures of the Church of Rome who were present at this diet employed John
                    Faber, afterwards bishop of</p>
                <p>Vienna, together with Eckius <hi rend="subscript">1</hi> and another doctor, to
                    draw up a refutation of the Protestant Confession; and this having been publicly
                    read, the emperor required the Protestant members to acquiesce in it, and put an
                    end to the religious disputes by an unlimited submission to the opinions and
                    doctrines contained in this answer. But this demand was far from being complied
                    with. The Protestants, on the contrary, declared that they were by no means
                    satisfied with the reply of their adversaries, and earnestly desired a copy of
                    it, that they might more fully demonstrate its extreme insufficiency and
                    weakness. But this reasonable request was refused by the emperor, who interposed
                    his supreme authority to prevent any further proceedings in this matter, and
                    solemnly prohibited the publication of any new writings or declarations which
                    might contribute to protract these religious debates. This, however, did not
                    reduce the Protestants to silence. The divines of that communion who had been
                    present at the diet endeavoured to recollect the arguments and objections
                    employed by Faber, and had again recourse to the pen of Melancthon, who refuted
                    them in an ample and satisfactory manner, in a piece which was presented to the
                    emperor on the 22d of September, but which Charles refused to receive. This
                    answer was afterwards enlarged by Melancthon, when he had obtained a copy of
                    Faber’s reply; and was published in the year 1531, with the other pieces that
                    related to the doctrine and discipline of the Lutheran church, under the title
                    of Defence of the Confession of Augsburg.</p>
                <p>Matters now began to draw tow ards a crisis. There were only three ways of
                    bringing to a conclusion these religious differences: First, to grant the
                    Protestants a toleration and privilege of serving God as they thought proper;
                    secondly, to compel them to return to the Church of Rome by the violent methods
                    of persecution; or, thirdly, that a reconciliation should be made, upon fair,
                    and candid, and equitable terms, by engaging each of the parties to temper their
                    zeal with moderation, to abate reciprocally the rigour of their pretensions, and
                    to remit something of their respective claims. The third expedient was most
                    generally approved of, being peculiarly agreeable to all who had at heart the
                    welfare of the empire; nor did even the pope seem to look upon it with aversion
                    or contempt. Various conferences therefore were held between persons eminent for
                    piety and learning upon both sides; and nothing was omitted which might have the
                    least tendency to calm the animosities and heal the divisions which reigned
                    between the contending parties. But the differences were too great to admit of a
                    reconciliation; and therefore the votaries of Rome had recourse to the powerful
                    arguments of imperial edicts, and the force of the secular arm. On the 19th of
                    November, a severe decree was issued by order of the emperor, in which
                    everything was manifestly adapted to deject the friends of religious liberty,
                    excepting only a faint and dubious promise of engaging the pope to assemble a
                    general council about six months after the separation of the diet. In this
                    decree the dignity and excellence of the Catholic religion were extolled beyond
                    measure; a new degree of severity and force was added to that which had been
                    published at Worms against Luther and his adherents; the changes which had been
                    introduced into the doctrine and discipline of the Protestant churches were
                    severely censured; and a solemn order was addressed to the princes, cities, and
                    states, who had thrown off the papal yoke, to return to their allegiance to
                    Rome, on pain of incurring the indignation and vengeance of the emperor, as the
                    patron and protector of the church.</p>
                <p>Of this formidable decree the Elector of Saxony and the confederated princes were
                    no sooner informed than they assembled in order to deliberate on the measures
                    proper to be taken in such an emergency. In the years 1530 and 1531 they met,
                    first at Smalcald, and afterwards at Francfort,</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="ht:wu.89119129625&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=101"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0719-0101-0091"/>
                <p>where they formed a solemn alliance and confederacy, with the intention of
                    defending vigorously their religion and liberties against the dangers and
                    encroachments with which they were threatened by the edict of Augsburg, without
                    attempting, however, any thing offensive against the votaries of Rome; they
                    invited the kings of England, France, and Denmark, to join this confederacy,
                    leaving no means unemployed that might strengthen and cement so important an
                    alliance.</p>
                <p>This confederacy was at first opposed by Luther, from an apprehension of the
                    calamities and troubles which it might produce; but at last, perceiving the
                    necessity of concert, he consented, though he uncharitably, as well as
                    imprudently, refused to comprehend in it the followers of Zuing-lius amongst the
                    Swiss, as well as the German states and cities which had adopted the sentiments
                    and confession of Bucer. In the invitation addressed to Henry VIII. of England,
                    whom the confederate princes were willing to declare the head and protector of
                    their league, the following things, amongst others, were expressly stipulated:
                    That the king should encourage, promote, and maintain, the true doctrine of
                    Christ as it was contained in the Confession of Augsburg, and defend the same at
                    the next general council; that he should not agree to any council summoned by
                    the bishop of Rome, but protest against it, and neither submit to its decrees,
                    nor suffer them to be respected in his dominions; that he should never allow the
                    Roman pontiff to have any pre-eminence or jurisdiction in his dominions, and
                    should advance 100,000 crowns for the use of the confederacy, engaging to double
                    the sum if necessary: all which articles the confederate princes were equally
                    obliged to observe upon their part. To these demands the king replied, that he
                    would maintain and promote the true doctrine of Christ; but, at the same time,
                    as the true ground of that doctrine lay only in the Holy Scriptures, he would
                    not accept at any one’s hand what should be his own faith, or that of his
                    kingdom; and therefore desired that they would send over two learned men to
                    confer with him, in order to promote a religious union between him and the
                    confederates. He, however, declared himself of their opinion with regard to the
                    meeting of a free general council, and promised to join with them in all such
                    councils for the defence of the true doctrine; but he thought the regulation of
                    the ceremonial part of religion, being comparatively a matter of indifference,
                    should be left to the choice of each sovereign for his own dominions.
                    Subsequently the king gave them a second and more satisfactory answer; but after
                    the execution of Anne Boleyn, this negotiation came to nothing. On the one hand,
                    the king grew cold when he perceived that the confederates were no longer of use
                    to him in supporting the validity of his marriage; and, on the other, the German
                    princes became sensible that they could never succeed with Henry, unless they
                    allowed him an absolute dictatorship in matters of religion.</p>
                <p>Whilst everything thus tended to an open war between the opposite parties, the
                    Elector Palatine and the Elector of Mentz offered their mediation, and
                    endeavoured to bring about a reconciliation. The emperor himself, for various
                    reasons, was at this time inclined to peace. For, on the one hand, he stood in
                    need of succours against the Turks, which the Protestant princes refused to
                    grant as long as the edicts of Worms and Augsburg remained in force; and, on the
                    other, the election of his brother Ferdinand to the dignity of king of the
                    Romans, which had been carried by a majority of votes at the Diet of Cologne in
                    1531, was by the same princes contested, as being contrary to the fundamental
                    laws of the empire. In consequence of all this, after many negotiations and
                    projects of reconciliation, a treaty of peace was concluded at Nuremberg in
                    1532, between the emperor and the Protestant princes, on the following
                    conditions, viz. That the latter should furnish a subsidy for carrying on the
                    war against the Turks, and acknowledge Ferdinand as lawful king of the Romans;
                    and that the emperor upon his part should abrogate and annul the edicts of Worms
                    and Augsburg, and allow the Lutherans the free and undisturbed exercise of their
                    religious doctrine and discipline, until a rule of faith should be fixed either
                    in the free general council which was to be assembled in the space of six
                    months, or in a diet of the empire.</p>
                <p>Soon after the conclusion of the peace of Nuremberg, died JoIm elector of Saxony,
                    who was succeeded by his son John Frederick, a prince of invincible fortitude
                    and magnanimity, but whose reign was little better than one continued series of
                    disappointments and calamities. The religious truce, however, gave new vigour to
                    the Reformation. Those who had hitherto been only secret enemies of the Roman
                    pontiff, now publicly threw off his yoke; and various cities and provinces of
                    Germany enlisted themselves under the religious banners of Luther. On the other
                    hand, as the emperor had now no other hope of terminating the religious disputes
                    except by the meeting of a general council, he repeated his request to the
                    ι&gt;ontiff that such a council should be assembled. But Pope Clement VII., whom
                    the history of past councils filled with the greatest uneasiness, endeavoured to
                    retard what he could not with decency refuse. At last, in the year 1533, he made
                    a proposal by his legate to assemble a council at Mantua, Piacenza, or Bologna;
                    but the Protestants refused their consent to the nomination of an Italian
                    council, and insisted that a controversy which had its rise in the heart of
                    Germany should be determined within the limits of the empire. The pope, by his
                    usual artifices, eluded compliance with this demand, and, in 1534, he was cut
                    off by death, before any determination could be come to. His successor Paul III.
                    seemed to show less reluctance to the assembling of a general council, and in
                    1535 expressed his inclination to convoke one at Mantua; and, the year
                    following, he actually sent circular letters for that purpose throughout all the
                    states and kingdoms under his jurisdiction. Tllis council was summoned by a bull
                    issued on tile 2d of June 1536, to meet at Mantua in the Ibllowingyear. But
                    several obstacles prevented its meeting; one of the most material of which was,
                    that Frederick duke of Mantua had no inclination to receive at once so many
                    guests, some of them very turbulent, into the place of his residence. On the
                    other hand, the Protestants were firmly persuaded that, as the council was to be
                    assembled in Italy, and by the authority of the pope alone, the latter must have
                    an undue influence in that assembly; and, consequently, that all things would be
                    carried by the votaries of Rome. For this reason they assembled in the year 1537
                    at Smalcald, where they solemnly protested against this partial and corrupt
                    council, and, at the same time, had a new summary of their doctrine drawn up by
                    Luther, in order to present it to the assembled bishops if it should be required
                    of them. This summary, which received the title of the Articles of Smalcald, is
                    commonly conjoined with the creeds and confessions of the Lutheran church.</p>
                <p>After the meeting of the general council in Mantua had thus been prevented, many
                    schemes of accommodation were proposed both by the emperor and by the
                    Protestants; but, by the artifices of the Church of Rome, all of them came to
                    nothing. In 1541, the emperor appointed a conference to be held at Worms on the
                    subject of religion, between persons of piety and learning chosen from the
                    contending parties. This conference, however, was, for certain reasons, removed
                    to the diet which was to be held at Ratisbon that year, and in which the
                    principal subject of deliberation was a memorial presented by a person unknown,
                    containing a project of peace. But the conference produced no other effect than
                    a mutual agreement of the contending parties to refer their matters to a general
                    council, or, if the meeting of such a council should be prevented, to the next
                    German Diet.</p>

                <p>This resolution was rendered ineffectual by a variety of <hi rend="subscript"
                    >ι</hi> incidents, which widened the breach, and put off to a future day the
                    deliberations which were designed to heal it-The pope ordered his legate to
                    declare to the Diet of Spires, .assembled in 1542, that he would, according to
                    the promise he had already made, assemble a general council, and that Trent
                    should be the place of its meeting, if the diet had no objection to that city.
                    Ferdinand, and the princes who adhered to the cause of the pope, gave their
                    consent to this proposal; but it was vehemently ‘objected to by the Protestants,
                    both because the council was summoned by the authority of the pope only, and
                    also because the place was within the jurisdiction of his holiness; whereas they
                    desired a free council, which should not be biassed by the dictates nor awed by
                    the proximity of the pontiff But this protestation produced no effect. Paul III.
                    persisted in his purpose, and issued his circular letters for the convocation of
                    the council, with the approbation of the emperor. In justice to this pontiff,
                    however, it must be acknowledged, that he showed that he was not averse to every
                    reformation. He appointed four cardinals, and three other persons eminent for
                    their learning, to draw up a scheme for the reformation of the church in
                    general, and of that of Rome in particular. The reformation proposed in this
                    plan was indeed extremely superficial and partial; yet it contained some
                    particulars which could scarcely have been expected from those who composed it.
                    They complained of the pride and ignorance of the bishops, and proposed that
                    none should receive orders but learned and pious men; and that care should
                    therefore be taken to have proper masters for the instruction of youth. They
                    condemned translations from one benefice to another, with grants of reservation,
                    non-residence, and pluralities. They proposed that some convents should be
                    abolished; that the liberty of the press should be restrained and limited; that
                    the colloquies of Erasmus should be suppressed; that no ecclesiastic should
                    enjoy a benefice out of his own country; that no cardinal should have a
                    bishopric; that the questors of St Anthony and several other saints should be
                    abolished; and, which was the best of all their proposals, that the effects and
                    personal estates of ecclesiastics should be given to the poor. They concluded
                    with complaining of the prodigious number of indigent and ragged priests who
                    frequented St Peter’s church; and declared, that it was a great scandal to see
                    prostitutes lodged so magnificently at Rome, and riding through the streets on
                    fine mules, whilst the cardinals and other ecclesiastics accompanied them in the
                    most courteous manner. This plan of reformation was turned into ridicule by
                    Luther and Sturmius; and indeed it left unredressed the greatest grievances of
                    which the Protestants complained.</p>
                <p>All this time the emperor had been labouring to persuade the Protestants to
                    consent to the meeting of the council at Trent; but when he found them fixed in
                    their opposition to the measure, he began to listen to the sanguinary measures
                    of the pope, and resolved to terminate the disputes by force of arms. Upon this
                    the Elector of Saxony and the Landgrave of Hesse, who were the chief supporters
                    of the Protestant cause, took proper measures to prevent their being surprised
                    and overwhelmed by a superior force; but, before the horrors of war commenced,
                    Luther died in peace at Ayselben, the place of his nativity, in the year
                    1546.</p>
                <p>The emperor and the pope had mutually resolved on the destruction of all who
                    should dare to oppose the council of Trent. The meeting of this council was to
                    serve as a signal for taking up arms; and accordingly its deliberations were
                    scarcely commenced in 1546, when the Protestants perceived undoubted signs of
                    the approaching storm, and of</p>
                <p>. a formidable union between the emperor and pope, which threatened to overwhelm
                    them at once. This year indeed there had been a new conference at Ratisbon upon
                    the old subject of accommodating differences in religion; but from the manner in
                    which the debates were carried on, it appeared plainly that these differences
                    could only be decided in the field of battle. The council of Trent, in the mean
                    time, Promulgatedtheirdecrees; whilst the reformed princes, in the Diet of
                    Ratisbon, protested against their authority, and were on that account proscribed
                    by the emperor, who raised an army to reduce them to obedience.</p>
                <p>The Elector of Saxony and the Landgrave of Hesse led their forces into Bavaria
                    against the emperor, and cannonaded his camp near Ingolstadt. It was supposed
                    that this would bring on an engagement, which would probably have bee n
                    advantageous to the cause of the reformed; but this was prevented, chiefly by
                    the perfidy of Maurice duke of Saxony, who invaded the dominions of his uncle.
                    Divisions were also fomented amongst the confederate princes, by the
                    dissimulation of the emperor, and France failed in paying the subsidy which had
                    been promised by its monarch; all which so discouraged the heads of the
                    Protestant party, that their army soon dispersed, and the Elector of Saxony was
                    obliged to direct his march homewards. But he was pursued by the emperor, who
                    made several forced marches, with a view to overpower the enemy before he could
                    have time to recover his vigour. The two armies met near Mul-berg, on the Elbe,
                    on the 24th of April 1547; and, after a sanguinary action, the elector was
                    entirely defeated and taken prisoner. Maurice, who had so basely betrayed him,
                    was now declared Elector of Saxony; and by his entreaties, Philip, landgrave of
                    Hesse, the other chief of the Protestants, was persuaded to throw himself on the
                    mercy of the emperor, and to implore forgiveness. To this he consented, relying
                    on the promise of Charles for obtaining pardon, and being restored to liberty;
                    but, notwithstanding these expectations, he was unjustly detained prisoner, by a
                    scandalous violation of the most solemn convention. It is said that the emperor
                    retracted his promise, and deluded this unhappy prince by the ambiguity of two
                    German words. History indeed can scarcely furnish a parallel to the perfidious,
                    mean-spirited, and despotic behaviour of the emperor in the present case. After
                    having received in public the humble submission of the prince on his knees, and
                    set him at liberty in virtue of a solemn treaty, he caused him to be arrested
                    anew without any reason, nay, without any pretence, and kept him a close
                    prisoner for several years. When Maurice remonstrated against this new
                    confinement, the emperor answered that he had never promised that the landgrave
                    should not be imprisoned anew, but only that he should be exempted from
                    perpetual imprisonment; and, to support this assertion, he produced the
                    treaty.</p>
                <p>The affairs of the Protestants now seemed to be desperate. In the Diet of
                    Augsburg, which was soon afterwards called, the emperor required the Protestants
                    to leave the decision of these religious disputes to the wisdom of the council
                    which was to meet at Trent. The greater part of the members consented to this
                    proposal, being convinced by the powerful argument of an imperial army, which
                    was at hand to dispel the darkness from the eyes of such as might otherwise have
                    been blind to the force of Charles’s reasoning. However, this general submission
                    did not produce the effect which was expected from it. A plague which broke out,
                    or was said to have done so, in the city, caused the greater part of the bishops
                    to retire to Bologna, by which means the council was in effect dissolved; nor
                    could all the entreaties and remonstrances of the emperor prevail upon the pope
                    to re-assemble it without delay. During this interval, therefore, the emperor
                    judged it necessary to fall upon some method of accommodating the religious
                    differences, and maintaining peace until the council so long expected should
                    finally be decided on. With this view he ordered Julius Pelugius, bishop of
                    Naumberg, Michael Sido<pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:wu.89119129625&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=103" xml:id="kp-eb0719-0103-0093"
                    />nius, a creature of the pope, and John Agricoa, a native of Ayselben <hi
                    rend="subscript">1</hi> to draw up a formulary which might serve as a rule of
                    faith and worship, till the council should be assembled. But as this was only a
                    temporary expedient, and had not the force of a permanent or perpetual
                    institution, it thence obtained the name of the Interim.</p>
                <p> This project of Charles was formed partly with a design to vent his resentment
                    against the pope, and partly to answer other political purposes. It contained
                    all the essential doctrines of the Church of Rome, though considerably softened
                    by the artful terms which were employed, and which were quite different from
                    those employed before and after this period by the council of Trent. There was
                    even an affected ambiguity in many of the expressions, which made them
                    susceptible of different senses, and applicable to the sentiments of both
                    communions. The consequence of all this was, that the imperial formulary was
                    reprobated by both parties. However, it was promulgated with great solemnity by
                    the emperor at Augsburg. The Elector of Mentz, without even asking the opinion
                    of the princes present, gave a sanction to this formulary, as if he had been
                    commissioned to represent the whole diet. Many remained silent through fear, and
                    that silence was interpreted as a tacit consent. Some who had the courage to
                    oppose it, were reduced by force of arms; and the most deplorable scenes of
                    bloodshed and violence were enacted throughout the whole empire. Maurice,
                    elector of Saxony, who had hitherto kept neutral, now assembled the whole of his
                    nobility and clergy, in order to deliberate on this critical affair. At the head
                    of the latter was Melancthon, whose , word was respected as a law amongst the
                    Protestants. But this man had not the courage of Luther, and was therefore on
                    all occasions ready to make concessions, and to propose schemes of
                    accommodation. In the present case he gave it as his opinion, that the whole of
                    the book called Interim could not by any means be adopted by the Protestants;
                    but at the same time he declared, that he saw no reason why this book might not
                    be approved, adopted, and received, as an authoritative rule in things that did
                    not relate to the essential parts of religion, and which he accounted
                    indifferent. But this scheme, instead of cementing the differences, rendered
                    them worse than ever; and produced a division amongst the Protestants
                    themselves, which might have overthrown the Reformation entirely, if the emperor
                    and the pope had seized the opportunity.</p>
                <p>In the year 1549, Pope Paul III. died, and was suc ceeded by Julius III. who, at
                    the repeated solicitations of the emperor, consented to re-assemble the council
                    of Trent. A diet was again held at Augsburg under the cannon of the imperial
                    army, and Charles laid the matter before the princes of the empire. Most of
                    those present gave their consent to it, and amongst the rest Maurice elector of
                    Saxony, who consented on the following conditions, namely, that the points of
                    doctrine which had already been decided there should be re-examined; that this
                    examination should be made in presence of the Protestant divines; that the Saxon
                    Protestants should have the liberty of voting as well as of deliberating in the
                    council; and that the pope should not pretend to preside in that assembly,
                    either in person or by his legatees. This declaration of Maurice was read in the
                    diet, and his deputies insisted upon its being entered into the registers, which
                    the Archbishop of Mentz obstinately refused. This diet was concluded in the year
                    1551; and, at its breaking up, the emperor desired the assembled princes and
                    states to prepare all things for the approaching council, and promised to use
                    his utmost endeavours to procure moderation and harmony, impartiality and
                    charity, in the transactions of that assembly.</p>
                <p>On the breaking up of the diet, the Protestants took such steps as they thought
                    most proper for their own safety. The Saxons employed Melancthon, and the
                    Wurtembergers</p>
                <p>Brcngius, to draw up confessions of faith to be laid before the new council. The
                    Saxon divines, however, proceeded no farther than Nuremberg, having received
                    secret orders from Maurice to stop there; for the elector, perceiving that
                    Charles had formed designs against the liberties of the German princes, resolved
                    to take the most effectual measures for at once crushing his ambition. He
                    therefore entered with the utmost secrecy and expedition into an alliance with
                    the king of France and several of the German princes, for the security of the
                    rights and liberties of the empire; after which, having assembled a powerful
                    army in 1552, he marched against the emperor, who lay with a handful of troops
                    at Inspruck, expecting no attack from any quarter. By this sudden and unforeseen
                    accident Charles was so much dispirited, that he was willing to make peace
                    almost on any terms. The consequence was, that he concluded a treaty at Passau,
                    which by the Protestants is considered as the basis of their religious liberty.
                    By the first three articles of this treaty, it was agreed that Maurice and the
                    confederates should lay down their arms, and lend their troops to Ferdinand to
                    assist him against the Turks, and that the Landgrave of Hesse should be set at
                    liberty. By the fourth it was agreed that the rule of faith called the Interim
                    should be considered as null and void; that the contending parties should enjoy
                    the free and undisturbed exercise of their religion, until a diet should be
                    assembled to determine amicably the present disputes, which diet was to meet in
                    the space of six months; and that this religious liberty should continue always,
                    in case it should be found impossible to come to an uniformity in doctrine and
                    worship. It was also determined, that all those who had suffered banishment, or
                    any other calamity, on account of their having been concerned in the league or
                    war of Smalcald, should be reinstated in their privileges, possessions, and
                    employments; that the imperial chamber at Spiresshouldbe open to the Protestants
                    as well as to the Catholics; and that there should always be a certain number of
                    Lutherans in that high court. To this peace Albert, marquis of Brandenburg,
                    refused to subscribe, and continued the war against the Roman Catholics,
                    committing such ravages in the empire that a confederacy was at last formed
                    against him. At the head of this conspiracy was Maurice, elector of Saxony, who
                    died of a wound received in a battle fought in 1553.</p>
                <p>The assembling of the diet promised by Charles was delayed by various incidents;
                    however, it met at Augsburg in 1555, where it was opened by Ferdinand in name of
                    the emperor, and terminated those deplorable calamities which had so long
                    desolated the empire. After various debates, the following acts were passed, on
                    the 25th of September, viz. That the Protestants who followed the Confession of
                    Augsburg should be for the future considered as entirely free from the
                    jurisdiction of the Roman pontiff, and from the authority and superintendence of
                    the bishops; that they were left at perfect liberty to enact laws for themselves
                    relating to their religious sentiments, discipline, and worship; that all the
                    inhabitants of the German empire should be allowed to judge for themselves in
                    religious matters, and to join that church whose doctrine and worship they
                    thought the purest and most consonant to the spirit of true Christianity; and
                    that all those who should injure or persecute any person under religious
                    pretences, and on account of their opinions, should be declared and proceeded
                    against as public enemies of the empire, invaders of its liberty, and disturbers
                    of its peace.</p>
                <p>Thus was the Reformation established in many parts of the German empire, where it
                    continues to this day; nor have the efforts of the Catholic powers at any time
                    been able to suppress it, or even to prevent it from gaining ground. It was not,
                    however, in Germany alone that a reformation of religion took place. About the
                    same time almost all the kingdoms of Europe began to open their eyes to the
                    truth.</p>

                <p>The reformed religion was propagated in Sweden, soon after Luther’s rupture with
                    the Church of Rome, by one of his disciples, named Olaus Petri. The zealous
                    efforts of this missionary were seconded by Gustavus Vasa, whom the Swedes had
                    raised to the throne instead of Christiem king of Denmark, who by his horrid
                    barbarity lost the crown. This prince, however, was as prudent as he was
                    zealous; and, as the minds of the Swedes were in a fluctuating state, he wisely
                    avoided all kind of vehemence and precipitation in spreading the new doctrine.
                    Accordingly, the first object of his attention was the instruction of his people
                    in the sacred doctrines of the Holy Scriptures; and for this purpose he invited
                    into his dominions several learned Germans, and spread abroad throughout the
                    kingdom the Swedish translation of the Bible which had been made by Olaus Petri.
                    Some time after this, in 1526, he appointed a conference at Upsal, between this
                    reformer and Peter Gallius, a zealous defender of the ancient faith, in which
                    each of the champions was to bring forth his arguments, that it might be seen on
                    which side lay the truth. In this dispute Olaus obtained a signal victory, which
                    contributed much to confirm Gustavus in his persuasion of the truth of Luther’s
                    doctrine, and to promote its progress in Sweden. The following year another
                    event gave the finishing stroke to its propagation and success. This was the
                    assembly of the states at Westeraas, where Gustavus recommended the doctrine of
                    the reformers with such zeal, that, after warm debates fomented by the clergy,
                    it was unanimously resolved that the reformation introduced by Luther should be
                    adopted in Sweden. This resolution was principally owing to the firmness and
                    magnanimity of Gustavus, who declared publicly, that he would lay down the
                    sceptre and retire from the kingdom, rather than rule a people enslaved by the
                    orders and authority of the pope, and more controlled by the tyranny of their
                    bishops than by the laws of their monarch. From this time the papal empire in
                    Sweden was entirely overthrown, and Gustavus declared head of the church.</p>
                <p>In Denmark, the Reformation was introduced as early as the year 1521, in
                    consequence of the ardent desire discovered by Christiern II. of having his
                    subjects instructed in the doctrines of Luther. This monarch, notwithstanding
                    his cruelty, for which his name has been rendered odious, was nevertheless
                    desirous of delivering his dominions from the tyranny of the Church of Rome. For
                    this purpose, in the year 1520, he sent for Martin Reinard, one of the disciples
                    of Carlostadt, and appointed him professor of divinity at Hafnia; and after the
                    death of this man, which happened in 1521, he invited Carlostadt himself to fill
                    that important place. Carlostadt accepted of this office, indeed, but in a short
                    time returned to Germany; upon which Christiern used his utmost endeavours, but
                    in vain, to engage Luther to visit his dominions. However, the progress of
                    Christiern in reforming the religion of his subjects, or rather of advancing his
                    own power above that of the church, was checked, in the year 1523, by a
                    conspiracy, in consequence of which he was deposed and banished; his uncle
                    Frederick, duke of Holstein and Sleswick, being appointed his successor.</p>
                <p>Frederick conducted the Reformation with much greater prudence than his
                    predecessor. He permitted the Protestant doctors to preach publicly the
                    sentiments of Luther, but did not venture to change the established government
                    and discipline of the church. However, he contributed greatly to the progress of
                    the Reformation, by his successful attempts in favour of religious liberty, in
                    an assembly of the states held at Odensee in 1527. Here he procured the
                    publication of a famous edict, by which every subject of Denmark was declared
                    free to adhere either to the tenets of the Church of Rome or to the doctrine of
                    Luther. The papal tyranny was totally destroyed by his successor Chris-tiern
                    III. Hebeganbysuppressingthedespoticauthority of the bishops, and restoring to
                    their lawful owners a great part of the wealth and possessions which the church
                    had acquired by various stratagems. This was followed by a plan of religious
                    doctrine, worship, and discipline, laid down by Bu-genhagius, whom the king had
                    sent for from Wittenberg for the purpose; and in 1539 an assembly of the states
                    at Odensee gave their solemn sanction to all these transactions.</p>
                <p>In France, also, the Reformation began very early to make some progress. Margaret
                    queen of Navarre, and sister of Francis I. the perpetual rival of Charles V. was
                    a great friend to the new doctrine; and it appears that, as early as the year
                    1523, there were, in several of the provinces of France, great numbers of people
                    who had conceived the greatest aversion both to the doctrine and tyranny of the
                    Church of Rome, amongst whom were many of the first rank and dignity, and even
                    some of the episcopal order. But as their number increased daily, and troubles
                    and commotions were excited in several places on account of the religious
                    differences, the authority of the king intervened, and many persons eminent for
                    their virtue and piety were put to death in the most barbarous manner. Indeed,
                    Francis, who had either no religion at all, or, at best, no fixed and consistent
                    system of religious principles, conducted himself towards the Protestants in
                    such a manner as best answered his private views. Sometimes he resolved to
                    invite Mclancthon into France, probably with a view to please his sister the
                    queen of Navarre, whom he loved tenderly, and who had strongly imbibed the
                    Protestant principles. At other times he exercised the greatest cruelty towards
                    the reformed; and once made the following absurd declaration, that if he thought
                    the blood in his arm was tainted by the Lutheran heresy, he would have it cut
                    off; and that he would not spare even his own children, if they entertained
                    sentiments contrary to those of the Catholic church. About this time Calvin
                    began to attract the attention of the public, but more especially that of the
                    queen of Navarre. His zeal exposed him to danger; and as Francis was daily
                    committing to the flames the friends of the reformation, he was placed more than
                    once in the most perilous situation, from which he was only delivered by the
                    interposition of the queen of Navarre. He therefore retired from France to Basil
                    in Switzerland, where he published his Christian Institutions, and afterwards
                    became so famous in the history of Protestantism.</p>
                <p>Those amongst the French who first renounced the jurisdiction of the Church of
                    Rome are commonly called Lutherans by the writers of those early times. Hence it
                    has been supposed that they had all imbibed the peculiar sentiments of Luther.
                    But this appears not to have been the case: for the vicinity of the cities of
                    Geneva, Lausanne, and some others, which had adopted the doctrine of Calvin,
                    produced a remarkable effect upon the French Protestant churches; insomuch that,
                    about the middle of this century, they all entered into communion with the
                    church of Geneva. The French Protestants were, by way of contempt, called
                    Huguenots by their adversaries. Their fate was very severe, being persecuted
                    with unparalleled fury; and though several princes of the blood, and many of the
                    first nobility, had embraced their sentiments, yet in no part of the world did
                    the reformers suffer so much. At last all commotions were quelled by the
                    fortitude and magnanimity of Henry IV., who in the year 1598 granted all his
                    subjects full liberty of conscience by the famous edict of Nantes, and seemed to
                    have thoroughly established the Reformation throughout his dominions. During the
                    minority of Louis XIV. however, this edict was revoked by Cardinal Maza-rin,
                    since which time the Protestants have often been cruelly persecuted; nor was the
                    profession of the reformed religion in France at any time so safe as in most of
                    the other countries of Europe.</p>

                    />of Rome was but faint and ambiguous before the Diet of Augsburg. Prior to that
                    period, however, it appears, from undoubted testimony, that the doctrine of
                    Luther had made a considerable, though probably secret, progress throughout
                    Spain, Hungary, Bohemia, Britain, Poland, and Ithe Netherlands; and had in all
                    these countries gained many friends, of whom several repaired to Wittenberg, in
                    order to enlarge their knowledge by means of Luther’s conversation. Some of
                    these countries threw off entirely the yoke of Rome, and in others a prodigious
                    number of families embraced the principles of the reformed religion. It is
                    certain, indeed, and some Roman Catholics themselves acknowledge it without
                    hesitation, that the papal doctrines and authority would at once have fallen
                    into ruin in all parts of the world, had not the force of the secular arm been
                    employed to support the tottering edifice. In the Netherlands particularly, the
                    most grievous persecutions took place, so that by the Emperor Charles V. upwards
                    of a hundred thousand were destroyed, whilst still greater cruelties were
                    exercised upon the people by his son Philip II. The revolt of the United
                    Provinces, however, and motives of real policy,, at last put a stop to these
                    furious proceedings; and although, in many provinces of the Netherlands, the
                    establishment: of the Catholic religion was still continued, the Protestants
                    have been long free from the danger of persecution on account of their
                    principles.</p>
                <p>The Reformation mad? considerable progress in Spain and Italy soon after the
                    rupture between Luther and the Roman pontiff’. In all the provinces of Italy,
                    but more especially in the territories of Venice, Tuscany, and Naples, the
                    superstition of Rome lost ground, and great numbers of people of all ranks
                    expressed an aversion to the papal yoke. In the year 1546, this occasioned
                    violent and dangerous commotions in the kingdom of Naples; which, however, were
                    at last quelled by the united forces of Charles V., and his viceroy Don Pedro di
                    Toledo. In several places the pope put a stop to the progress of the
                    Reformation, by letting loose the inquisitors, who spread dreadful marks of
                    their barbarity throughout the greater part of Italy. These formidable ministers
                    of persecution put so many to death, and perpetrated such horrid acts of cruelty
                    and oppression, that most of the reformed consulted their safety by a voluntary
                    exile, whilst others returned to the religion of Rome, at least in external
                    appearance. But the inquisition, which frightened into the profession of Popery
                    several Protestants in other parts of Italy, could never make its way into the
                    kingdom of Naples; nor could either the authority or the entreaties of the pope
                    engage the Neapolitans to admit even visiting inquisitors.</p>
                <p>In Spain, several persons embraced the Protestant religion, not only from the
                    controversies of Luther, but even from those divines whom Charles V. had brought
                    with him into Germany in order to refute the doctrines of the Reformer. For
                    these doctors had imbibed the pretended heresy instead of refuting it, and
                    propagated it more or less on their return home. But the inquisition, which
                    could obtain no footing in Naples, reigned triumphant in Spain, and by the most
                    dreadful methods frightened the people back into Popery, and suppressed the
                    desire of exchanging their superstition for a more rational plan of religion. It
                    was indeed presumed that Charles himself died a Protestant; and it seems to be
                    certain, that when the approach of death had dissipated those schemes of
                    ambition and grandeur which had so long blinded him, his sentiments became much
                    more rational and agreeable to Christianity than they had ever been before. All
                    the ecclesiastics who had attended him, as soon as he expired, were sent to the
                    inquisition, and committed to the flames, or put to death by some other met hod
                    equally terrible. Such was the fate of Augustin Casal, the emperor’s preacher;
                    of Constantius Pontius, his confessor; of Egidius, whom he had named to the
                    bishopric of Tortosa; of Bartolomeo de Caranza <hi rend="subscript">1</hi> a
                    Dominican, who had been confessor to Philip and Mary; besides twenty others of
                    less note.</p>
                <p>In England, the principles of the Reformation began to be adopted as soon as an
                    account of Luther’s doctrines could be conveyed thither. In that kingdom there
                    were still remains of the sect called Lollards, whose doctrine resembled that of
                    Luther; and amongst whom, consequently, the sentiments of the Reformer gained
                    great credit. Henry VIII., king of England, was at that time a violent partisan
                    of the Church of Rome, and had a particular veneration for the writings of St
                    Thomas Aquinas. Being informed that Luther spoke of his favourite author with
                    contempt, he conceived a violent prejudice against the Reformer, and even wrote
                    against him, as we have already mentioned. Luther did not hesitate about writing
                    against his majesty, overcame him in argument, and treated him with very little
                    ceremony. The first step towards public reformation, how-ever, was not taken
                    until the year 1529. Great complaints had been made in England, from a very
                    early period, respecting the usurpations of the clergy; and the prevalence of
                    the Lutheran opinions rendered these complaints more loud and general than
                    before. The House of Commons, finding the occasion favourable, passed several
                    bills restraining the impositions of the clergy; but what threatened the
                    ecclesiastical order with the greatest danger, were the severe reproaches throw
                    n out in the house, almost without opposition, against the dissolute lives,
                    ambition, and avarice of the priests, and their continual encroachments on the
                    privileges of the laity. The bills for regulating the clergy met with opposition
                    in the House of Lords; and Bishop Fisher imputed them to want of faith in the
                    Commons, and to a formed design, proceeding from heretical and Lutheran
                    principles, of robbing the church of her patrimony, and overturning the national
                    religion. The Commons, however, complained to the king, by their Speaker Sir
                    Thomas Audley, of these reflections thrown out against them; and the bishop was
                    obliged to retract his words.</p>
                <p>Though Henry had not the least idea of rejecting any, even of the most absurd
                    observances of the Catholic Church, yet as the oppressions of the clergy w ere
                    very ill suited to the violence of his own temper, he was pleased with every
                    opportunity of lessening their power. In the parliament of 1531, he showed his
                    design of humbling the clergy in the most effectual manner. An obsolete statute
                    was revived, from which it was pretended, that to submit to the legatine power
                    which had been exercised by Cardinal Wolsey was criminal. By this stroke the
                    whole body of clergy was at once declared guilty. They were too well acquainted
                    with Henry’s disposition, however, to reply, that their ruin would have been the
                    certain consequence of their not submitting to Wolsey’s commission, which had
                    been given by royal authority. Instead of making any defence of this kind, they
                    chose to throw themselves on the mercy of their sovereign; which, however, it
                    cost them L.118,840 to procure. A confession was likewise extorted from them,
                    that the king was protector and supreme head of the Church of England; though
                    some of them had the dexterity to get a clause inserted, which invalidated the
                    whole submission, namely, “in as far as is permitted by the law of Christ.”</p>
                <p>The king having thus begun to reduce the power of the clergy, kept no bounds with
                    them afterwards. He did not indeed attempt any reformation in religious matters;
                    nay, he persecuted most violently such as did in the least degree attempt
                    anything of the kind. Indeed the most essential article of his creed seems to
                    have been his own supremacy; for whoever denied this, whether Protestant or
                    Papist, was sure to suffer the most severe penalties.</p>
                <p>He died in the year 1547, and was succeeded by his only son, Edward VI. This
                    amiable prince gave new spirit and vigour to the Protestant cause, and was its
                    brightest ornament;</p>

                <p>as well as its most effectual support. He encouraged learned and pious men of
                    foreign countries to settle in England, and addressed a particular invitation to
                    Martin Bucer and Paul Fagius, whose moderation added a lustre to their other
                    virtues; in hopes that, by the ministry and labours of these eminent men, in
                    concert with those of the friends of the Reformation in England, he might purge
                    his dominions from the fictions of Popery, and establish in their room the pure
                    doctrines of Christianity. For this purpose, he issued the wisest orders for the
                    restoration of true religion; but his reign was too short to accomplish fully
                    such a glorious purpose. In the year 1553, he was taken from his loving and
                    afflicted subjects, whose sorrow was great, and suited to their loss. His sister
                    Mary, the daughter of Catharine of Aragon, from whom Henry had been divorced,
                    blindly bigoted to the Church of Rome, and a princess whose natural character,
                    like the spirit of her religion, was despotic and cruel, succeeded him on the
                    throne, and imposed anew the arbitrary laws and the tyrannical yoke of Rome upon
                    the people of England. Nor were the methods which she employed in the cause of
                    superstition better than the cause itself, or tempered by any sentiments of
                    equity or compassion. Barbarous tortures, and death in the most shocking forms,
                    awaited those who opposed her will, or made the least stand against the
                    restoration of Popery. And amongst many other victims, the learned and pious
                    Cranmer, archbishop of Canterbury, who had been one of the most efficient
                    instruments of the Reformation in England, fell a sacrifice to her fury. But
                    this odious scene of persecution was happily concluded in the year 1558, by the
                    death of the queen, who left no issue; and, as soon as her successor Elizabeth
                    ascended the throne, all things assumed a new aspect. The glorious period of
                    this reign was alike eminent for religious knowledge and for daring genius, for
                    civil prosperity and for martial glory. Elizabeth, whose sentiments, and
                    councils, and projects, breathed a spirit superior to the natural softness and
                    delicacy of her sex, exerted this vigorous and masculine spirit in the defence
                    of oppressed conscience and expiring liberty; broke anew the despotic yoke of
                    papal authority and superstition; and, delivering her people from the bondage of
                    Rome, established that form of religious doctrine and ecclesiastical government
                    which still subsists in. England. This religious establishment differed in some
                    respects from the plan which had been formed by those whom Edward VI. had
                    employed for promoting the cause of the Reformation, and approached nearer to
                    the rites and discipline of former times; though it is.widely different, and, in
                    the most important points, entirely opposite to the principles of the Roman
                    Catholic hierarchy.</p>
                <p>The cause of the Reformation underwent in Ireland the same vicissitudes and
                    revolutions which had attended it in England. When Henry VIII. after the
                    abolition of the papal authority, was declared supreme head of the Church of
                    England upon earth, George Brown, a native of England, and a monk of the
                    Augustinian order, whom that monarch had created, in the year 1535, Archbishop
                    of Dublin, began to act with the utmost vigour in consequence of this change in
                    the hierarchy. He purged the churches within his diocese from superstition in
                    all its various forms; pulled down images; destroyed relics; abolished absurd
                    and idolatrous rites; and, by the influence as well as authority he had obtained
                    in Ireland, caused the king’s supremacy to be acknowledged in that nation. Henry
                    soon afterwards showed that this supremacy was by no means a vain title; for he
                    banished the monks out of that kingdom, confiscated their revenues, and
                    destroyed their convents. In the reign of Edward VI. Still further progress was
                    made in the removal of popish superstitions, by the zealous labours of Bishop
                    Brown, and the auspicious encouragement he granted to all who exerted themselves
                    in the cause of the Reformation. The death of this young prince, however, and
                    the accession of Queen</p>
                <p>Mary, had nearly changed the face of affairs in Ireland as much as in England;
                    but her designs were disappointed by a very curious adventure, of which the
                    following account has been copied from the papers of Richard earl of Cork.</p>
                <p>“Queen Mary having dealt severely with the Protestants in England, about the
                    latter end of her reign signed a commission for to take the same course with
                    them in Ireland; and to execute the same with greater force, she nominates Dr
                    Cole one of the commissioners. The doctor coming, with the commission, to
                    Chester on his journey, the mayor of that city, hearing that her majesty was
                    sending a messenger into Ireland, and he being a churchman, waited on the
                    doctor, who in discourse with the mayor taketh out of a cloke-bag a leather box,
                    saying unto him, Here is a commission that shall lash the heretics of Ireland,
                    calling the Protestants by that title. The good woman of the house being well
                    affected to the Protestant religion, and also having a brother named John
                    Edmonds of the same persuasion, then a citizen in Dublin, was much troubled at
                    the doctor’s words; but watching her convenient time, while the mayor took his
                    leave, and the doctor complimented him down the stairs, she opens the box, takes
                    the commission out, and places in lieu thereof a sheet of paper with a pack of
                    cards wrapt up therein, the knave of clubs being faced uppermost. The doctor
                    coming up to his chamber, suspecting nothing of what had been done, put up the
                    box as formerly. The next day going to the water-side, wind and weather serving
                    him, he sails towards Ireland, and landed on the 7th of October 1558 at Dublin.
                    Then coming to the castle, the Lord Fitzwalters being lord-deputy, sent for him
                    to come before him and the privy-council; who, coming in, after he had made a
                    speech relating upon what account he came over, he presents the box unto the
                    lord-deputy; who causing it to be opened, that the secretary might read the
                    commission, there was nothing save a pack of cards with the knave of clubs
                    uppermost; which not only startled the lord-deputy and council, but the doctor,
                    who assured them he had a commission, but knew not how it was gone. Then the
                    lord-deputy made answer: Let us have another commission, and we will shuffle the
                    cards in the meanwhile. The doctor being troubled in his mind, went away, and
                    returned into England, and coming to the court obtained another commission: but
                    staying for a wind on the waterside, news came to him that the queen was dead;
                    and thus God preserved the Protestants of Ireland.” Queen Elizabeth was so
                    delighted with this story, which was related to her by Lord Fitzwalter on his
                    return to England, that she sent for Elizabeth Edmonds, whose husband’s name was
                    Mattershad, and gave her a pension of forty pounds a year during her life.</p>
                <p>In Scotland, the seeds of the Reformation were very early sown, by several
                    noblemen who had resided in Germany during the religious disputes there. But for
                    many years it was suppressed by the power of the pope, seconded by severe law’s
                    and not a few executions. The most eminent opponent of the papal jurisdiction
                    was John Knox, a disciple of Calvin, and a man of great zeal and invincible
                    fortitude. On all occasions he raised the drooping spirits of the reformers, and
                    encouraged them to go on with their work, notwithstanding the opposition and
                    treachery of the queen-regent; until at last, in 1561, by the assistance of an
                    English army sent by Elizabeth, Popery was in a manner totally extirpated from
                    every part of the kingdom. From this period the form of doctrine, worship, and
                    discipline established by Calvin at Geneva, has had the ascendency in
                    Scotland.</p>
