                    significant corrections to the OCR text, predominantly in cases of confusing "c"
                    and "e." Isolates 90 entries that were mistakenly included at the end of prior
                    entries in v1 and v2. Normalizes ordinal numbers. Separates metadata in
                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra
                    space around the <gi>pb</gi> tag. Where a word is hyphenated at a <gi>pb</gi>,
                    the end fragment is now joined to the start fragment, making a machine-readable
                    word.</change>

                <p><label type="entry">ROOKE</label> Sir George, a gallant naval commander, was born
                    of an ancient and honourable family in Kent in 1650. His merit raised him by
                    regular steps to be vice-admiral of the blue, in which station he served in the
                    battle of La Hogue, on the 22d of May 1692, when it was owing to his vigorous
                    behaviour that the last stroke was given on that important day, which threw the
                    French entirely into confusion. But the next day he obtained still more glory,
                    for he had orders to go into La Hogue, and burn the enemy’s ships as they lay
                    there. There were thirteen large men of war, which had crowded as far up as
                    possible; and the transports, tenders, and ammunition ships, were disposed in
                    such a manner that it was thought impossible to burn them. Besides, the French
                    camp was in sight, with all the French and Irish troops that were to have been
                    employed in the invasion of England; and several batteries were raised on the
                    coast, which were well provided with heavy artillery. The vice-admiral made the
                    necessary preparations for obeying his orders, but found it impossible to carry
                    in the ships of his squadron. He therefore ordered his light frigates to ply in
                    close to the shore; and having manned all his boats, went himself to give
                    directions for the attack, burned that very night six three-decked ships, and
                    the next day six more, from seventy-six to sixty guns, together with most of the
                    transports and ammunition vessels; and this under the fire of all the batteries
                    just mentioned, and in sight of all the French and Irish troops. Yet this bold
                    action cost the lives of no more than ten men. The vice-admiral’s behaviour on
                    this occasion appeared to King William so great, that having no opportunity at
                    that time of promoting him, he settled a pension of L.1000 per annum on him for
                    life; and afterwards going to Portsmouth to view the fleet, went on board
                    Admiral Rooke’s ship, dined with him, and then conferred on him the honour of
                    knighthood, having a little before made him vice-admiral of the red.</p>
                <p>In consequence of other services, he was in 1694 raised to the rank of admiral of
                    the blue; towards the close of the next year he became admiral of the white, and
                    was also appointed admiral and commander in chief in the Mediterranean.</p>
                <p>During King William’s reign, Sir George was twice elected member for Portsmouth;
                    and upon tile accession of Queen Anne in 1702, he was constituted vice-admiral
                    and lieutenant of the admiralty of England, as also lieutenant of the fleets and
                    seas of this kingdom. Upon the declaration of war against France, he was ordered
                    to command a fleet sent against Cadiz, the Duke of Ormond having the command of
                    the land forces. On his passage home, having received an account that the
                    galleons, under the escort of a strong French squadron, had got into the harbour
                    of Vigo, he resolved to attack them; and on the 11th of October he came before
                    the harbour of Rondon-dello, where the French commander had neglected nothing
                    necessary for putting the place in the best posture of defence. But
                    notwithstanding this, a detachment of fifteen English and ten Dutch men of war,
                    of the line of battle, with all the fire-ships, were ordered in; the frigates
                    and bomb-vessels followed; the great ships moved after them, and the army landed
                    near Rondondello. The whole service was performed under Sir George’s directions,
                    with admirable conduct and bravery; for all the ships were destroyed or taken,
                    prodigious damage was done to the enemy, and vast wealth was acquired by the
                    allies. For this action Sir George received the thanks of the House of Commons,
                    a day of thanksgiving was appointed both by the queen and the states-general,
                    and Sir George was appointed to a seat in the privy-council. Yet notwithstanding
                    this, the House of Lords resolved to inquire into his conduct at Cadiz. But he
                    so fully justified himself, that a vote was passed approving his behaviour.</p>
                <p>In the spring of the year 1704, Sir George commanded the ships of war which
                    conveyed King Charles III. of Spain to Lisbon. In July he attacked Gibraltar,
                    when, by the bravery of the English seamen, the place was taken on the 24th,
                    though the town was extremely strong, well furnished with ammunition, and had a
                    hundred guns mounted, all facing the sea and the narrow passes to the land; an
                    action which was conceived and executed in less than a week, though it has since
                    endured sieges of many months’ continuance, and more than once baffled the
                    united forces of France and Spain. This brave officer being at last obliged, by
                    the prevalence of party spirit, to quit the service of his country, retired to
                    his seat in Kent, where he spent the remainder of his days as a private
                    gentleman. He was thrice married; and by his second lady, Mrs Luttrel, left one
                    son.</p>

                <p>He died on the 24th of January 1708, in his fifty-eighth year.</p>
