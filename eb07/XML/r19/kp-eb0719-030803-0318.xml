                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra

                <p><label type="entry">ROCKY <hi rend="smallcaps">Mountains</hi></label>, a great
                    mountain chain which traverses the western part of North America, extending from
                    about latitude 70° north to Mexico where it is continued by the Cordilleras of
                    the Andes. These ranges are considered as forming part of one vast chain, which
                    in South America, near the equator, attains its greatest elevation. At the
                    Isthmus of Panama it is so low as nearly to disappear; but this is in conformity
                    with the narrowness of the land in that quarter, and but for a short space. This
                    slight interruption is not sufficient to entitle us to consider the continuity
                    as broken, so that we have in the western hemisphere one great mountain range
                    extending along both continents, from the Polar Sea on the north, to Cape Horn
                    on the south, a distance of more than one hundred and twenty degrees of
                    latitude, without including the windings. The eastern side of North America is
                    traversed by a similar range of mountains called the Alleghanies, which stretch
                    along in continued and parallel lines; but the extent, breadth, and height of
                    the Rocky Mountains are much greater than those of the former. It is however
                    supposed that the Rocky Mountains extend along the western part of the
                    continent, at about the same distance from the Pacific Ocean that the
                    Alleghanies on the eastern side extend from the Atlantic Ocean. Although but
                    partially explored, the primitive character of the Rocky Mountains is clearly
                    established. Their eastern sides are covered to the height of two hundred or
                    three hundred feet, with a sandstone consisting of the ruins of the granitic
                    rocks upon which it reposes, where disintegration was apparently effected by the
                    gradual agency of an ancient ocean, once occupying the immense plain or basin
                    now extending eastward from the base of these mountains to the chain of the
                    Alleghanies. They have not however been sufficiently explored to admit our
                    advancing any scientific details in regard to them. Many of the detached
                    mountains and prominent peaks have not yet been either named, classified, or
                    described. It does not appear that many of them rise above the region of
                    perpetual refrigeration. But we have the concurrent testimony of Lewis and
                    Clarke, as well as others, that in latitude 47° north, immense quantities of
                    snow are on their summits, between the Missouri and Columbia, in the months of
                    June and July. They are seen like a vast rampart rising from the grassy plains,
                    stretching from north to south. Sometimes their aspect is that of continued
                    ranges of a grayish colour, rising into the blue of the atmosphere, above the
                    region of the clouds. A great number are black, ragged, and precipitous; and
                    their bases are strewn with· immense boulders and fragments of rock, detached by
                    earthquakes and the elements. From this iron-bound and precipitous character
                    they probably received the appellation of Rocky Mountains. Some of the peaks are
                    supposed to be twelve or thirteen thousand feet in height; and the general range
                    is considerably higher than any other in North America, with the exception of
                    the <pb break="no" facs="ht:wu.89119129625&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=319"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0719-0319-0309"/>Cordilleras. It is not certainly known whether any
                    of them are volcanic. Pumice stones are often seen floating on the Mississippi,
                    and still oftener on the Missouri. These are generally of a reddish yellow, or
                    flame colour, and are amongst the largest and finest specimens of this substance
                    to be met with. Some assert that they proceed from hills of burning coal, but we
                    never heard of hills of burning coal ever yielding such a product. They are
                    entirely a volcanic production, and beyond doubt are either discharged from
                    craters at present active, or are washed away by the mountain torrents, from
                    places which were formerly the scene of such phenomena. Mica is also abundantly
                    carried along by the waters which flow from the Rocky Mountains. The great
                    rivers that are discharged from their eastern and western declivities wind among
                    the mountains, the Arkansas on the east, and the Oregon or Columbia on the west,
                    more than a hundred leagues before they issue into the plains. In following the
                    beds of such streams, travellers pass through the range without much difficulty,
                    so that the reports of the early travellers that they presented a high,
                    continuous, and almost impassable barrier, are incorrect. Various leaders of
                    expeditions have passed them at different points, and affirm that they found no
                    such formidable and insurmountable barriers, the mention of which was wont to
                    deter traders from attempting to cross from east to west or from west to east by
                    this route. Following the river Platt, which is one of the principal southern
                    branches of the Missouri, the traveller finds a road even to Lake Buenaventura,
                    on the Pacific plains, that needs little labour to adapt it to the passage of
                    horses and waggons. The acclivity is nowhere so great as to exceed an ascent of
                    three degrees.</p>
                <p>This vast range has been divided into the Rocky, Chepy-wan, and Masserne
                    Mountains, on what ground is not exactly kno¼ <hi rend="superscript">r</hi> n.
                    The ranges on the south, at the sources of the Arkansas, and running thence
                    towards the Gulf of Mexico are called the Masserne Mountains. A single peak of
                    this ridge, seen as a landmark for immense distances over the subjacent plains,
                    is called Mount Pike, a very appropriate name. It is described as of
                    incomparable grandeur in appearance, and has been differently estimated at from
                    seven to ten thousand feet in height. On the ridges of the Rocky Mountains, the
                    Colorado of the Pacific, the Rio del Norte of Mexico the Roche-jaune or
                    Yellow-stone of the Missouri, and the Arkansas and Red River of the Mississippi,
                    streams which have outlets at such immense distances apart, all have their
                    origin. Many accounts have been given of the appearance of silver and other
                    metals in the Rocky Mountains, but they have been too partially explored to
                    entitle us to pronounce on the extent or value of the veins. (r. r. r.)</p>
