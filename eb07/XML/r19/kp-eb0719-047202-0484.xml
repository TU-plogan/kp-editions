                <p><label type="entry">ROSCOE</label> William, a distinguished writer, was born at
                    Liverpool on the 8th of March 1753. He was the only son of William Roscoe, who
                    then kept a public-house called the Bowling Green, and who is described as a man
                    below the middle stature, but of remarkable bodily strength and activity; of
                    much vivacity of temperament, and greatly attached to field-sports and other
                    amusements, for which his son never acquired any relish. He had also an only
                    daughter, who became the wife of Daniel Daulby, Esq. With the charge of his
                    public-house he united that of a market-garden; but during his declining age, he
                    retired to Charnock, his native place, and was for many years supported by his
                    son. Two years before his death, Mr Roscoe removed him to his own house at
                    Birchfield, where his latter days were soothed by the assiduous kindness of his
                    two children. Having reached an advanced age, he died in 1796. His wife, whose
                    name was Elizabeth, is said to have been a woman of a superior mind and of warm
                    affections, and to have exercised over the character of her son an influence, of
                    which the effects were never obliterated to the latest period of his life</p>
                <p>The first elements of learning he acquired under the tuition of a schooloustress;
                    and at the age of six, he was removed to a day-school kept by Mr Martin in
                    Paradise Street. After an interval of about two years, he became the pupil of Mr
                    Sykes, who, in the same house, kept a school for writing, arithmetic, and
                    English grammar. He had a numerous seminary, and was considered as a good
                    instructor in his own department. At the age of twelve Roscoe quitted this
                    school, the master having reported that his scholar had learned all that he
                    professed to teach; which, besides English grammar, included the common rules of
                    arithmetic, algebra, and mensuration. He acquired a very early relish for
                    reading, and particularly for poetical reading. “I was at this period of my
                    life,” he has recorded, “of a wild, rambling, and unsocial disposition; passing
                    many of my hours in strolling along the shore of the river Mersey, or in
                    fishing, or in taking long walks alone....I now began to assist my father in his
                    agricultural concerns, particularly in his business of cultivating potatoes for
                    sale, of which he every year grew several acres, and which he sold, when
                    produced early in the season, at very advanced prices. His mode of cultivation
                    was entirely by the spade; and when raised early, they were considered in that
                    part of Lancashire as a favourite esculent. When they had attained their proper
                    growth, we were accustomed to carry them to the market on our heads, in large
                    baskets, for sale, where I was generally intrusted with the disposal of them,
                    and soon became a very useful assistant to my father. In this and other
                    laborious occupations, particularly in the care of a garden, in which I took
                    great pleasure, I passed several years of my life, devoting my hours of
                    relaxation to reading my books. This mode of life gave health and vigour to my
                    body, and amusement and instruction to my mind; and to this day I well remember
                    the delicious sleep which succeeded my labours, from which I was again called at
                    an early hour. If I were now asked whom I consider to be happiest of the human
                    race, I should answer, those who cultivate the earth by their own hands.”</p>
                <p>Having reached his fifteenth year, he found it expedient to make choice of a
                    profession. His love of reading induced him to prefer the avocation of a
                    bookseller; but he was disappointed in his expectation of finding it altogether
                    pleasant, and after a trial of a month, he returned to his rustic labours. In
                    the course of the ensuing year, 1769, he was articled to a young attorney, who
                    died before the completion of his clerkship. The remainder of it was passed in
                    the office of Mr Peter Ellames, who was eminent in his profession, and who was
                    much satisfied with his pupil’s talents and industry. During this period, he
                    still continued to reside with his father, but he had previously the misfortune
                    to Jose his mother. Although very punctual in his attention to business, he
                    always found some precious intervals of leisure for the cultivation of his
                    literary talents; and his early love of poetry had its usual effect in purifying
                    and refining the taste. His chief favourite was Shenstone, with whose elegant
                    simplicity he appears to have been greatly captivated. He cultivated an intimate
                    friendship with other ingenuous youths, who cherished the same love of
                    literature. In conjunction with two of these, William Clarke and Richard
                    Lowndes, he applied himself to the study of the ancient languages; and with
                    these individuals, to the close of their lives, he continued in habits of the
                    strictest intimacy. They had another associate, who was capable of directing as
                    well as participating in their studies. This was Francis Holden, a young man of
                    uncommon talents, who was an assistant in his uncle’s school, where it was his
                    business to teach, not only mathematics, but likewise the Greek, Latin, Italian,
                    and French languages. They were accustomed to meet early in the morning, and to
                    pursue their classical studies till the hours of business called them to less
                    genial avocations. It was the example <pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:wu.89119129625&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=485" xml:id="kp-eb0719-0485-0473"
                    />of Holden that prompted him to begin the study of the Italian language, in
                    which he at length attained to so great proficiency.</p>
                <p>He thus continued to improve his taste, and to enlarge his fund of knowledge.
                    From a fervent admiration of poetry there is generally an easy transition to the
                    composition of poems. He wrote many verses in his early youth; and at the age of
                    twenty, he printed an Ode on the Foundation of a Society for the Encouragement
                    of the Arts of Painting and Design, in the town of Liverpool. About the same
                    period he wrote a descriptive poem, entitled Mount Pleasant, which was not
                    however published till the year 1777. His ode was then reprinted. These poems
                    were favourably received; and they obtained the approbation of two very
                    competent judges, Mr Mason and Sir Joshua Reynolds.</p>
                <p>Having completed his clerkship, he was in 1774 admitted an attorney of the Court
                    of King’s Bench. During the same year, he entered into partnership with a Mr
                    Bannister, but their connexion was of a very short duration. He afterwards
                    formed a more permanent engagement with Mr Samuel Aspinall, who had long been
                    known as a respectable practitioner. He was assiduous in his attention to the
                    business of his profession; but he did not find himself constrained to abandon
                    his literary studies, and he thus continued the gradual improvement of his
                    excellent talents. At an early period of his life, he became intimately
                    acquainted with the family of a respectable tradesman named Griffies. Jane, the
                    second of three daughters, “soon attracted his admiration, and won his
                    affection, by her gentle yet lively manners, by the sweetness of her
                    disposition, and by the many admirable qualities of her truly feminine mind.
                    Although the state of his circumstances at this time gave little promise of an
                    immediate union with the object of his attachment, it was not the wish, and
                    perhaps it was scarcely in the power, of one possessing the frank and ardent
                    character of Mr Roscoe, to conceal from her the feelings she had inspired. From
                    that moment, to the close of his long and eventful life, he never found reason
                    to regret, for one instant, the judgment of his youth.” A considerable interval
                    elapsed before they could prudently fulfil their engagement; but his
                    professional emoluments gradually became more ample, and they were married on
                    the 22d of February 1781. Their union was attended with more than common
                    felicity.</p>
                <p>The African slave-trade was now in its fullest vigour; and as it formed a very
                    material part of the commerce of .Liverpool, the great body of the inhabitants
                    were interested, either directly or indirectly, in the continuance of this
                    detestable traffic. For any individual to raise a warning voice against it in
                    such a community, required no small portion of moral courage. The generous
                    feelings and manly character of Mr Roscoe urged him to take a very prominent
                    share in those proceedings which finally led to its suppression; a measure which
                    reflected so much honour on that administration which included Fox, Grey,
                    Holland, and Erskine. He composed, in blank verse, a poem entitled “The Wrongs
                    of Africa ;” of which the first part was published in 1787, and the second in
                    1788. It was translated into German by a clergyman named Kiihn. In 1787 he
                    likewise published “A general View of the African Slave Trade, demonstrating its
                    Injustice and Impolicy: with Hints towards a Bill for its Abolition.” This
                    seasonable tract was followed in 1788 by “A Scriptural Refutation of a Pamphlet
                    lately published by the Rev. Raymond Harris, entitled ‘ Scriptural Researches on
                    the Licitness of the Slave Trade’: in four Letters from the Author to a Friend.”
                    Harris was a clergyman of the established church, but had been educated for the
                    popish priesthood. Such talents as he possessed were employed in an attempt to
                    prove that slavery, as a system, has ob tained the divine approval; that God has
                    sanctioned the principle of one portion of mankind treating another like beasts
                    of burden. For his satisfactory refutation of this reverend apologist of such
                    enormities, Mr Roscoe received the thanks of the London Abolition Committee.
                    They likewise printed a new edition of his pamphlet, which was extensively
                    circulated, and highly approved. In 1792 he published “An Inquiry into the
                    Causes of the Insurrection of the Negroes in the Island of St Domingo.” Of this
                    insurrection the advocates of slavery had endeavoured to avail themselves, as a
                    most powerful argument against the abolition; and he therefore performed another
                    important service by exposing the fallacies of their reasonings and
                    inferences.</p>
                <p>In other public transactions of that eventful period, he likewise felt a deep
                    interest. On all subjects his sentiments were humane and liberal. With some of
                    the most enlightened men of the kingdom, he contemplated the French revolution
                    as a glorious event; and his feelings of exultation were expressed in more than
                    one poetical effusion. The atrocities which ensued were revolting to every
                    well-constituted mind: but he still continued true to the great cause of civil
                    and religious liberty, and in the midst of the apostacy of one party, and the
                    phrensy of another, he continued to avow and to maintain those principles which
                    established, and which alone can uphold the British constitution. The most
                    conspicuous apostate of that period was Edmund Burke, who deserted his former
                    principles and his former friends, and made a general declaration of war against
                    all those who breathed an ardent wish for the political or social melioration of
                    mankind. The powers of his eloquence were exerted, with a morbid and phren-sied
                    fervour, against those who differed from him after he began to differ from
                    himself; and when we consider that he was instrumental, beyond any other
                    individual, in promoting war abroad, and despotism at home, it may without any
                    breach of charity be affirmed, that his memory deserves the execration of
                    posterity. In the year 1796 Roscoe published “Strictures on Mr Burke’s Two
                    Letters, addressed to a Member of the present Parliament.” Here he animadverts
                    on the exaggerated statements of his adversary, and exposes the real object of
                    his recent publications, the suppression of all liberal and independent
                    speculation on the subject of politics. This famous orator was evidently
                    disposed to acquiesce in the opinion of Bishop Horsley, that the people have
                    nothing to do with the laws but to obey them. At an earlier period, 1791, Roscoe
                    had printed a merry ballad concerning “The Life, Death, and wonderful
                    Achievements of Edmund Burke ;” and had adorned it with a frontispiece etched by
                    himself, and representing Burke equipped like a knight-errant, and assaulting
                    Fox in the House of Commons.</p>
                <p>About this period his mind was vigorously devoted to an undertaking of a more
                    important nature. The plan of preparing a biographical account of Lorenzo de’
                    Medici had occurred to him at a very early stage of his literary career. He long
                    continued to collect books, and to amass materials; and at the close of the year
                    1789, he communicated his design to his intimate friend Mr Clarke, who was then
                    residing in Italy for the benefit of a milder climate. This gentleman had been
                    engaged in commercial pursuits, but is said to have been skilled in ancient as
                    well as modern literature. With great alacrity he undertook the task of
                    exploring the archives and libraries of Florence, in quest of materials for the
                    projected work; and the author ac-knowjedged himself deeply indebted to the
                    assistance which he had thus received. The sale of the Crevenna and Pi-nelli
                    libraries enabled him to procure many rare books, for which he might otherwise
                    have made a hopeless search. “The Life of Lorenzo de Medici, called the
                    Magnificent,” was at length published in the year 1796, in two volumes <pb
                    break="no" facs="ht:wu.89119129625&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=486"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0719-0486-0474"/>quarto. It was elegantly printed by John
                    Maccreery, who, at his suggestion, had recently established a press in
                    Liverpool. The success of this publication exceeded the most sanguine
                    expectations which the author could have ventured to cherish. From the
                    periodical critics he obtained ample praise. He received letters of warm
                    commendation from men of rank and men of letters, with several of whom he had no
                    previous acquaintance or correspondence. One of these was the eccentric earl of
                    Bristol and bishop of Derry, who was then residing in Rome. He first applied to
                    Mr Cadell,the bookseller, in order to ascertain the author’s profession,
                    resources in life, and what present of books, pictures, or statues, might be
                    most acceptable to him. Dr Parr’s fervent zeal in the cause of literature
                    likewise prompted him to seek the correspondence of the elegant biographer. The
                    first letter which he addressed to him contains the subsequent passage: “You
                    will pardon my zeal, Sir, and you may confide in my sincerity, when I declare to
                    you that the contents of your book far surpassed my expectation, and amply
                    rewarded the attention with which I perused it. You have thrown the clearest and
                    fullest light upon a period most interesting to every scholar. You have produced
                    much that was unknown, and to that which was known vou have given perspicuity,
                    order, and grace. You have shown the greatest diligence in your researches, and
                    the purest taste in your selection; and upon the characters and events which
                    passed in review before your inquisitive and discriminating mind, you have
                    united sagacity of observation with correctness, elegance, and vigour of style.”
                    The correspondence thus begun led to an intimate friendship. The work obtained a
                    very high compliment from another individual, from whom it was less to be
                    expected. Mathias so completely overcame the violence of his political
                    animosities, as to bestow this eulogium on the author:</p>

                <p>To these lines, in his Pursuits of Literature, he has subjoined a long note,
                    which contains the subsequent passage: “I have not terms sufficient to express
                    my admiration of his genius and erudition, or my gratitude for the amusement and
                    information I have received.” An intercourse of civilities with the anonymous
                    writer was a very natural result; and he was afterwards extolled by Mathias in
                    Italian verse as well as prose.</p>
                <p>The first edition of this work was printed at the expense of the author; but soon
                    after its appearance, Cadell and Davies offered him no less a sum than L.1200
                    for the copyright. Of this liberal offer he did not hesitate to accept; and
                    little doubt can be entertained that the booksellers found it a very
                    advantageous transaction. The fourth edition, in three volumes octavo, was
                    printed in 1800. In other countries, the success of this book was equally
                    brilliant. Three editions were speedily circulated in America. The work,
                    translated into German by Sprengel, was published at Berlin in 1797. In 1799 a
                    French translation, by François Thurot, was published at Paris. During the same
                    year, an Italian version, by the Cavaliero Gaetano Mechi-rini, made its
                    appearance at Pisa, in four volumes octavo. It was undertaken at the suggestion
                    of the elegant Fabroni, who had himself published a Latin life of Lorenzo, which
                    he intended to translate into his native language; but he was so much delighted
                    with Roscoe’s work, that he abandoned bis design, and recommended the other task
                    to Mechirini. In the course of the ensuing year, he addressed a very gratifying
                    letter to the author. Similar letters were addressed to him by Bandini, the
                    learned keeper of the Laurentian</p>
                <p>Library in Florence, and by the Abate Andres, a Spanish Jesuit, resident in
                    Italy, and deeply skilled in Italian literature.</p>
                <p>For the avocation of an attorney Mr Roscoe never had any hearty relish, and he
                    finally relinquished it in the year 17^96. With his last partner, Mr Lace, he
                    made an arrangement which secured him some interest in the business; and during
                    the following year he entered himself at Gray’s Inn, with the view of being
                    called to the bar. He kept Hilary term, but made no further progress in this new
                    career, although, according to the opinion of his son, he possessed qualities
                    which must in all probability have rendered his success certain. In conjunction
                    with Mr Thomas Wakefield, he had in 1793 obtained a lease of an extensive tract
                    of peat-moss in the vicinity of Manchester; and from the draining and
                    improvement of this land he anticipated an ample return. In 1799 he purchased
                    one half of the Allerton estate, a valuable property situate about six miles
                    from Liverpool. Allerton Hall, which belonged to his portion, was originally
                    built in the reign of James the First; but that structure had been partly taken
                    down about the middle of last century, and a handsome stone-edifice had been
                    erected in its place. The house was surrounded by gardens disposed in the old
                    English taste, and was environed on every side with ample woods. Here it was his
                    wish to spend the remainder of his days in studious retirement; but within the
                    brief period of twelve months, he found himself deeply involved in the labours
                    and anxieties of commercial life. The family of his intimate friend Mr Clarke,
                    which had long been connected with an extensive banking-house at Liverpool, was
                    at the close of the year 1799 placed in circumstances of considerable
                    difficulty. “The aid of Mr Roscoe, as a confidential adviser, was requested by
                    the partners, and he did not hesitate to lend his best assistance. Chiefly
                    through his instrumentality, the difficulties which existed between the
                    Liverpool bank and their London correspondents were removed, and it was the
                    anxious wish of the latter, as well as the former, that Mr Roscoe should render
                    his labours complete, by becoming an active partner in the banking-house at
                    Liverpool.” It was rather his friendship for tile family of Clarke, than any
                    motive more personal to himself, that induced him to embrace this offer.</p>
                <p>By great and unremitting exertions, he brought the affairs of the house into a
                    better train of management; and towards the close of the year 1800, he could
                    again command some portion of leisure for his favourite pursuits. He had
                    previously published “The Nurse, a poem translated from the Italian of Luigi
                    Tansillo.” This elegant versioc was favourably received, and it reached a third
                    edition in 1804. But he had for some time contemplated a more magnificent
                    undertaking, a life of Leo the Tenth; and on receiving, through the kindness of
                    Lord Holland, some important and unpublished materials from Florence, he
                    reverted to it with new ardour. “The History of the Life and Pontificate of Leo
                    X.” was published in four volumes quarto in the year 1805. It had been in the
                    press upwards of two years. For one half of the copyright Cadell and Davies paid
                    the sum of L.2000. This work, notwithstanding its great and varied merit,
                    experienced a less favourable reception than its precursor. The author’s
                    brilliant success appears to have excited no small degree of spleen in some of
                    the periodical critics, who accordingly treated him with little candour or
                    courtesy. This production however, relating to a most important era in the
                    civil, ecclesiastical, and literary history of Europe, was highly estimated by
                    many very competent judges. The history of the revival of learning was itself a
                    very extensive, as τvell as a very arduous field for disquisition. The history
                    of the fine arts required knowledge and taste of a different denomination. The
                    history of the reformation of religion involved many questions of subtle
                    disputation, as well as many topics of <pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:wu.89119129625&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=487" xml:id="kp-eb0719-0487-0475"
                    />character and conduct; and for a writer of great candour and discernment, it
                    was scarcely possible to satisfy either the Papists or the Protestants. The Life
                    of Leo, with the omission of the documents contained in the appendix, was
                    speedily reprinted at Philadelphia; but the sale was not there so rapid as that
                    of his former work. A German translation, by Professor Glaser, was published at
                    Leipzig in three volumes octavo, which successively appeared in 1806, 1807, and
                    1808. A preface, notes, and disquisitions, were contributed by Henke. In 1808 a
                    French translation, by P. F. Henry, was published at Paris, and a corrected
                    edition appeared in 1813. An Italian version was subsequently undertaken by
                    Count Luigi Bossi, who began by translating from the French. This work extended
                    to twelve volumes octavo, published at Milan in 1816 and 1817. He added a
                    variety of notes and documents illustrative of the text, together with numerous
                    engravings of portraits and medals. The sovereign pontiff, Leo XII., inserted
                    this translation in the catalogue of prohibited books, but in spite of his
                    denunciation, 2800 copies of it have been dispersed in Italy, where the name of
                    the elegant author continues to be held in no common estimation.</p>
                <p>Soon after the appearance of his great work, he was suddenly induced to place
                    himself in a new sphere of action. “Although from a very early period of life Mr
                    Roscoe had taken a deep interest in public affairs, and had manifested, not only
                    by his writings, but also by the part he had taken in promoting public meetings
                    in Liverpool, the strong desire he felt to render himself useful to the country,
                    he had yet never entertained the idea that he should be called upon to fill the
                    responsible situation of a representative of the people. It was therefore with
                    the greatest surprise that, on the eve of the general election in 1806, he
                    received a requisition from a number of the most respectable burgesses of
                    Liverpool, requesting him to come forward as a candidate for the representation
                    of his native town.” This requisition he received on the 30th of October; he
                    issued his address to the electors on the following day, and the election
                    commenced on the first of November. His two opponents were General Gascoigne and
                    General Tarleton; of whom the former had represented the borough for ten, and
                    the latter for sixteen years. They were both Tories, but with this difference,
                    that Tarleton was a deserter from the Whigs. They were both supported by the
                    corporation; but after a very strenuous contest of seven days, the election
                    terminated in favour of Roscoe, who had nearly two hundred votes over Tarleton,
                    and thirteen over Gascoigne. During the progress of the election, he had
                    uniformly been the popular candidate; his success was hailed with the most
                    enthusiastic rejoicings; and he was chaired through a greater concourse of
                    people than the town had probably ever beheld on any former occasion.</p>
                <p>Of the House of Commons he was not a silent member. He took a respectable share
                    in various debates; and he had the high satisfaction of raising his voice in
                    favour of the abolition of the slave-trade. He likewise made a judicious speech
                    in support of Romilly’s bill for subjecting real estates to debts of simple
                    contract. The unhappy and inveterate prejudices of the king led to the
                    dissolution of the ministry in the spring of 1807. On the 15th of April, Mr
                    Littleton moved a resolution, expressing the regret of the house at the recent
                    change in his majesty’s councils; and Mr Roscoe then spoke with manly
                    indignation against the conduct of Canning, who, in a previous debate, had
                    thought proper to threaten the house, that if its members did not vote according
                    to the will of the ministry, his majesty would be advised to appeal to the
                    people, or, in other words, to dissolve his parliament. The parliament was
                    dissolved, and the senseless cry of “No Popery,” and “the Church in danger,”
                    resounded from one end of the island to the other. It was the peculiar
                    infelicity and infatuation of the old king’s administration, that he was
                    uniformly averse from employing men who supported the principles which had
                    placed his family on the British throne.</p>
                <p>Mr Roscoe returned to Liverpool in the month of May, and, on approaching the
                    town, was received by a numerous procession of friends, partly on horseback, and
                    partly on foot. Their progress was speedily obstructed by large bodies of men,
                    chiefly consisting of the crews of vessels recently engaged in the slave-trade,
                    armed with bludgeons and other weapons, and disposed along the range of streets.
                    The procession moved with difficulty, and not without danger. Many personal
                    injuries were sustained on both sides; and if great forbearance had not been
                    displayed towards the ruffianly assailants, the most fatal consequences might
                    have ensued. When he reached the bank, and attempted to address the crowd, the
                    clamour was so loud and unceasing that he found it impossible to obtain a
                    hearing. He had honourably given a vote against the traffic in human flesh, and
                    by that craft most of the disorderly multitude had their living. Disgusted at
                    such a display of popular violence, he speedily declared his resolution of
                    declining to offer himself as a candidate at the ensuing election; but he was
                    nominated without his own consent, and the contest was protracted till the
                    seventh day, when it terminated by the return of the two generals.</p>
                <p>Although he thus ceased to be a member of parliament, he did not cease to take an
                    interest in public affairs. In 1808 he published “Considerations on the Causes,
                    Objects, and Consequences of the present War, and on the Expediency or the
                    Danger of Peace with France.” This was an able as well as a seasonable
                    publication; but we cannot add, that it produced any extensive or speedy
                    effects. The war, which had been carried on at such an enormous expense of blood
                    and treasure, was profitable to an immense multitude of individuals: it served
                    to extend the patronage and influence of the ministry; loans, contracts, and
                    other contingencies, enriched one class of their adherents; an immense field of
                    employment and promotion was opened in the army and navy; while another class of
                    men, who were specially bound to act as messengers of peace, were too generally
                    disposed to keep in the onward path of preferment by preaching in favour of
                    “this just and necessary war.” The real object of the war was a matter so
                    extremely doubtful, that it. was not unusual to hear a variety of objects
                    specified by different individuals all equally fervent in the same cause. By one
                    great personage, the hopeful project of restoring the Bourbons was doubtless
                    contemplated as the great and paramount object. Roscoe’s tract was published in
                    January, and a fourth edition was sent to press before the end of that month. It
                    was speedily followed by “Remarks on the Proposals made to Great Britain for
                    opening Négociations for Peace, in the year 1807.” The several tracts which he
                    had published on such topics, were in 1810 collected into a volume bearing the
                    title of “Occasional Tracts relative to the War.” This collection, which
                    includes several tracts that have not been enumerated, remains a monument of his
                    wisdom, in the midst of the general phrensy which then prevailed. In 1812 he
                    published “A Review of the Speeches of the Right Hon. George Canning on the late
                    Election for Liverpool, so far as they relate to the Questions of Peace and
                    Reform.” Roscoe was an able and enlightened advocate of parliamentary reform, as
                    of all other attempts to improve the general welfare. During this general
                    election, some of the inhabitants entertained a plan of returning him free of
                    expense. He was likewise solicited to allow his friends to put him in nomination
                    at Westminster; but he had no inclination to resume his seat in the House of
                    Commons. Some of the electors of Leicester, where any opposition to the
                    prevalent corruption was nearly hopeless, nominated him as a candidate without
                    his previous knowledge; and, under <pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:wu.89119129625&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=488" xml:id="kp-eb0719-0488-0476"
                    />these peculiar circumstances, he obtained 412 votes, while the second of the
                    successful candidates had only 967. This homage to an individual personally
                    unknown, was paid to him as “the friend of peace, of reform, and of religious
                    liberty.” In his printed address to the independent electors of this borough, he
                    expressed his “conviction that the great work, which must eventually produce the
                    reformation and happiness of the people, was already begun.” An eventful period
                    of twenty years served to evince how well he had discerned tile signs of the
                    times.</p>
                <p>The return of peace did not immediately produce all the benefits that were
                    anticipated. The war-establishment, with its lavish profusion of expenditure,
                    had long contributed to maintain an artificial state of things. When the war was
                    at length brought to a termination, we were overwhelmed with an enormous
                    national debt; and under such burdens as this debt imposed, it was difficult for
                    manufactures and trade to find a favourable channel. The banking-house with
                    which Roscoe was connected did not escape the commercial pressure of that
                    period. Great exertions were made by the partners to avert the crisis by which
                    they were threatened; but suspicions having been excited, large balances were
                    suddenly withdrawn from the bank; and after struggling for a few days in the
                    vain hope of supporting their credit, they were, on the 25th of January 1816,
                    reduced to the necessity of suspending their payments. A committee appointed by
                    the creditors reported that, after the liquidation of the debts, there would
                    remain a surplus of L.6l,144. The bank was never shut; and the house was allowed
                    six years for discharging all the debts, with interest. Roscoe undertook the
                    management of its affairs, and exerted himself with surprising energy. One of
                    the greatest trials which he sustained, was the necessity of parting with his
                    library, pictures, and other works of art, the valuable and cherished
                    accumulation of nearly half a century. The auction of his library, which was
                    sold by Win-stanley of London, extended to fourteen days, commencing with the
                    19th of August 1816. It included rare and precious works in several departments,
                    but was particularly rich in Italian literature. The sale of the books was
                    immediately followed by that of the prints, which occupied eleven days, and,
                    being divided into 1352 lots, produced the sum of L.1915. Is. The drawings,
                    consisting of 610 lots, and the paintings, of 156, were sold for L.2825.

                <p>In the midst of these vicissitudes and trials, which he endured with exemplary
                    fortitude, he still retained his love of literature. In the establishment of the
                    Royal Institution of Liverpool, he lent his effective aid. A plan for such an
                    institution had in 1813 been written by Dr Traill, now professor of medical
                    jurisprudence in the university of Edinburgh. The scheme was at length brought
                    towards maturity; and, after an interval of four years, Mr Roscoe, as chairman
                    of a committee, prepared an explanatory report. He was induced, though not
                    without considerable difficulty, to compose and to deliver the inaugural address
                    at the opening of the institution. The attendance was very numerous, and he
                    received the most gratifying applause. On the ensuing day, he was requested by
                    the committee to publish his discourse, and it accordingly appeared under the
                    subsequent title: “On the Origin and Vicissitudes of Literature, Science, and
                    Art, and their Influence on the present State of Society: a Discourse delivered
                    on the Opening of the Liverpool Royal Institution, 25th November 1817.” In 1819
                    he published his “Observations on Penal Jurisprudence, and the Reformation of
                    Offenders.” In 1822 appeared his “Additional Observations” on the same subject;
                    and a third part followed in 1825. He afterwards published two tracts on the
                    penitentiary discipline of the United States. In all his literary undertakings,
                    he aimed at improving the morals and increasing the happiness of mankind.</p>
                <p>In the mean time, the affairs of the bank had reached their final crisis. The
                    partners found themselves unable to contend with the difficulties which beset
                    and impeded their progress, and a commission of bankruptcy was issued in the
                    year 1820, Having now withdrawn from business, he seems to have placed his chief
                    reliance on the remuneration of his literary labours. Some of his friends
                    privately raised the sum of L.2500, and vested it in trustees for the benefit of
                    himself and his family. “The office of communicating to him this kind and
                    liberal act, on the part of his friends, was confided to Dr Traill, who by his
                    judicious representations, and affectionate remonstrances, succeeded in removing
                    from the mind of Mr Roscoe the objections which he felt to incur obligations of
                    so serious a nature.” About this period, he found a pleasing employment in
                    arranging and improving the library of Mr Coke, now earl of Leicester, and in
                    preparing a catalogue of the numerous manuscripts. His visits to Holkham were
                    rendered peculiarly pleasant; and this gentleman, as we are informed, “conferred
                    upon him obligations of no ordinary nature.” His literary ardour was still
                    unabated; and in 1822 he published an octavo volume, under the title of
                    “Blustrations, Historical and Critical, of the Life of Lorenzo de’ Medici,
                    called the Magnificent; with an Appendix of original and other Documents.” An
                    Italian version, exclusive of the appendix, was published at Florence by
                    Pecchioli in the course of the following year. In 1822 he likewise published a
                    “Memoir of Richard Roberts Jones of Aberdaron, in the county of Carnarvon, in
                    North Wales, exhibiting a remarkable instance of a partial power and cultivation
                    of intellect.” This extraordinary character, who was originally a fisher-lad,
                    “continues to display a love of learning and an extent of erudition seldom
                    exhibited within the walls of schools or universities, united with a want of
                    common sense amounting almost to idiocy, and a squalor and wretchedness of
                    appearance of which a common mendicant would be ashamed.” At Allerton he had a
                    conversation with Dr Parr on languages, oriental and occidental; and on being
                    afterwards asked his opinion of the learned stranger, he replied, “He is less
                    ignorant than most men.”</p>
                <p>During this year he quitted his residence in Liverpool, and took a house in Lodge
                    Lane, Toxteth Park, about a mile from the town. Two years afterwards he had the
                    severe misfortune to lose the excellent and cherished partner of all his joys
                    and sorrows. She died on the 24th of September 1824. This event was very deeply
                    felt; but the affectionate attention of his two daughters afforded some
                    compensation of a loss which it was impossible to repair. In the early part of
                    the year he had been elected an honorary associate of the Royal Society of
                    Literature; and after an interval of a few months he was appointed an associate
                    of the first class. He thus became entitled to a pension of one hundred guineas;
                    but, on the death of the king, the annual grant from the privy purse was
                    withheld by his successor. As its total amount was only a thousand pounds, this
                    cannot but be considered as a miserable piece of economy. In 1827 the great gold
                    medal of the society was awarded to him for his merits as an historian. From
                    other learned associations he obtained various honours; nor must we omit to
                    state that, during the same year, he was elected a corresponding member of the
                    Accademia della Crusea.</p>
                <p>In the spring of 1821 he had been engaged by the London booksellers to undertake
                    a new edition of the Works of Po∣&gt;e. It appeared in 1824, in ten volumes
                    octavo. He contributed a copious and elegant life of the author, and to a
                    selection of the notes of former editors added a few of his own. Of the
                    character of Pope, both as a man and as a poet, he formed a more favourable
                    estimate than either Dr Warton or Mr Bowles. Those who deny or reluctantly
                    concede to Pope the name of a poet, seem to judge according to a very arbitrary
                    standard. A few months after the <pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:wu.89119129625&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=489" xml:id="kp-eb0719-0489-0477"
                    />appearance of this edition, Mr Bowles published “A final Appeal to the
                    Literary Public, relative to Pope, in Reply to certain Observations of Mr
                    Roscoe, in his Edition of that Poet’s Works; to which are added, some Remarks on
                    Lord Byron’s Conversations, so far as they relate to the same subject and the
                    Author: in Letters to a Literary Friend.” To this publication Mr Roscoe speedily
                    replied in “A Letter to the Rev. W. Lisle Bowles, A. M. Prebendary of Sarum,
                    &amp;c. in Reply to his ‘ Final Appeal to the Literary Public relative to
                    Pope.’” His edition, as well as his Letter, obtained a favourable notice in the
                    Quarterly Review for October 1825; and Mr Bowles was induced to publish “Lessons
                    in Criticism to William Roscoe, Esq. F. R. S. &amp;c. in Answer to his Letter to
                    the Rev. W. L. Bowles, on the Character and Poetry of Pope. With further Lessons
                    in Criticism to a Quarterly Reviewer.” These lessons in criticism were not very
                    satisfactory to the public, and Mr Roscoe wisely desisted from any further
                    controversy.</p>
                <p>In 1827 he published an edition of the Life of Lorenzo in two, and of the History
                    of Leo in four volumes octavo. He had now reached an advanced period of life,
                    and had begun to feel the pressure of age. Towards the close of this year, he
                    was suddenly attacked with paralysis, which affected one side of hie face, and
                    deprived him of the use of one hand; but medical aid was promptly procured, and
                    he recovered the use of his hand, as well as of his speech. Botany had been
                    among the number of his favourite pursuits. He had been a contributor to the
                    Transactions of the Lin-naean Society, and was regarded as no mean proficient in
                    this science. After his recovery from the paralytic attack, he published the
                    fifteenth and concluding number of a splendid volume on Monandrian Plants.
                    Towards the end of June 1831 he experienced a severe atcack of influenza; and
                    after he seemed to be recovering, he was on the 27th of that month seized with a
                    violent fit of shivering, accompanied with almost total prostration of strength.
                    The near approach of death he contemplated with calm resignation to the will of
                    God. On the 30th he closed his mortal career, after having completed the
                    seventy-eighth year of his age. The proximate cause of his death was an effusion
                    into the chest. His remains were interred in the burying ground of the Unitarian
                    chapel in Renshaw Street, the service being performed by his intimate friend Mr
                    Shepherd. Six sons and two daughters survived him. One daughter he had lost in
                    her infancy, and a son in his mature age. His eldest daughter was married to
                    Thomas Jevons, Esq. of Liverpool. One of his sons, who still survives, is well
                    known as a man of letters. Another has too speedily followed the father to the
                    grave. He was a barrister at law; and, besides several works connected with his
                    own profession, he published an interesting though somewhat diffuse account of
                    his honoured father’s life. <note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                <p>Dr Traill, the friend and physician of this eminent man, speaks of him in the
                    following terms. “In person, Mr Roscoe was tall and rather slender. In early
                    life he possessed much bodily activity. His hair was light auburn, almost
                    inclining to red; his full grey eye was clear and mild; his face expressive and
                    cheerful. As he advanced in life, the benevolent expression of his countenance
                    remained, but the vivacity of the features was tempered into a noble dignity,
                    which it was impossible to see without respect and admiration; while the mouth
                    bespoke taste and feeling, and the clustering hoary hair round his temples gave
                    a venerable air to his manly features....Of the qualities of his heart, as a
                    private individual, it is impossible to speak too highly. In the relations of
                    husband, father, and friend, his conduct was most exemplary; and it would be
                    difficult to point out a man who possessed the fascination of manner which
                    attracts and rivets attachment, in a higher degree than William Roscoe.” <note
