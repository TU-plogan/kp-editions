                <p><label type="entry">ROBISON</label> John, a distinguished professor of natural
                    philosophy, born in 1739 at Boghall, in the parish of Bal-dernock and county of
                    Stirling, was a younger son of John Robison, Esq. who had formerly been a
                    merchant at Glasgow, and had retired to live in considerable affluence on bis
                    estate at Boghall, not far from that city.</p>
                <p>He was of a family sufficiently respectable to enable his son at a subsequent
                    period to prove himself, to the satisfaction of the court of St Petersburg, a
                    <hi rend="italic">gentleman</hi> born. As a younger brother, that son was
                    originally intended for the church, and went at an early age, according to the
                    custom of Scotland, in 1750, to enter as a student in the university of Glasgow,
                    so that he was initiated almost in the rudimente of Grecian literature under the
                    able instruction of Dr Moor, the well-known professor of Greek; and he acquired
                    such a knowledge of the classical languages as served to constitute him a
                    correct scholar through life. He pursued his studies with so much attention as
                    to obtain the approbation of his teachers and the admiration of his
                    contemporaries, who were delighted with the originality and ingenuity of his
                    conversation, though he did not himself reflect with perfect satisfaction upon
                    the degree of application which he had exerted in his academical education. He
                    took the degree of Master of Arts in 1756, having studied mathematics under Dr
                    Robert Simson, and moral philosophy under Dr Adam Smith. The example of so
                    correct and rigid a follower of the ancient methods of demonstration as Dr
                    Simson, must unquestionably have exercised considerable influence on his yet
                    unformed taste in mathematics; but he seems to have had a natural preference,
                    either from the constitution of his mind, or from some previously acquired
                    habits of thinking, for the geometrical method; for we are informed that “he
                    first attracted the regard of Dr Simson by owning his dislike of algebra, and by
                    returning a neat geometrical solution of a problem which had been given out to
                    the class in an algebraical form: with this mode of solution the professor was
                    delighted, though the pupil candidly acknowledged that it had been adopted only
                    because he could not solve the problem in the manner required of the class.”</p>
                <p>In the course of his studies, he had imbibed an insuperable aversion to the
                    pursuit of his original objects in the church; not certainly from any want of
                    religious feeling, or from a dislike to the kind of life that was intended for
                    him, but probably from some difficulties that had occurred to him respecting
                    particular points of doctrine or of practice. He was therefore compelled to
                    provide himself with some other occupation; and he readily accepted the offer of
                    some of his friends in 1758, to recommend him to Dr Blair, a prebendary of
                    Westminster, who had formed a scheme for sending Prince Edward, the young duke
                    of York, to complete his professional education at sea, in company <pb

                    to have instructed his royal highness in mathematics and navigation. On his
                    arrival in London, he was much disappointed to find that the expedition had
                    never been seriously intended; and he readily accepted an engagement to attend
                    young Knowles as a private tutor, when he went as a midshipman on board of the
                    Neptune of ninety guns, with Admiral Saunders, who had the command of a force
                    intended to co-operate with General Wolfe in the reduction of Quebec; and upon
                    the appointment of his friend as a lieutenant on board of the Royal William,
                    Robison was himself rated as a midshipman in that ship.</p>
                <p>The fleet arrived on the coast of America in April 1759; in May they got up the
                    river, and Mr Robison was one of a party of 100 seamen draughted from the Royal
                    William into the admiral’s ship, under the command of Lieutenant Knowles. In
                    this capacity he had an opportunity of seeing considerable service, and of
                    making some surveys of the river and of the neighbouring country; an employment
                    for which he was perfectly qualified, both as a geometrician and a draughtsman.
                    He also remarked the effect of the aurora borealis on the compass, which had
                    been noticed by Mairan and Wargentin some years before, but which was then not
                    commonly known. After the battle which was signalized by the victory and death
                    of the gallant Wolfe, the Royal William sailed with his body to Europe, and
                    arrived at Spit-head in November. The next year she was sent to cruise off Cape
                    Finisterre; but in six months she was obliged to return home, from having the
                    greater part of the men disabled by the scurvy.</p>
                <p>He used to consider the two years that he spent on board of the Royal William as
                    the happiest of his life; and no <sic>insiderable</sic> part of his
                    gratification was derived from the study of seamanship as he saw it practised
                    under the auspices of Captain Hugh Pigot. He did not, however, acquire any firm
                    attachment to the mode of life which he had temporarily adopted; he was rather
                    disposed to resume his academical pursuits, and he had overcome his earlier
                    objections to the ecclesiastical profession. He could not, however, refuse the
                    kindly invitation of Admiral Knowles to come and live with him in the country,
                    and to assist him in some important experiments which he was making upon
                    mechanical and nautical subjects.</p>
                <p>In the month of February 1762, Lieutenant Knowles was appointed to the Peregrine
                    sloop, of twenty guns, and Mr Robison accompanied him with the hope of becoming
                    a purser. He visited Lisbon and several other parts of Portugal; but he found a
                    cruise in a small ship much less convenient and agreeable than in a large one,
                    and, fortunately for himself and for mankind, he finally quitted the Peregrine
                    and the naval service in June, and returned to live with Admiral Knowles, who
                    soon after recommended him as a proper person to take charge of Harrison’s
                    timekeeper, which had been completed by the labour of thirty-five years, after
                    many unsuccessful experiments, and which was now sent out by desire of the Board
                    of Longitude to the West Indies, under the care of young Harrison and of Mr
                    Robison. The rate of the chronometer was ascertained at Portsmouth the 6th
                    November 1762, and it indicated at Port Royal, in Jamaica, a difference of time
                    amounting to 5∣ι 2∏&gt; 47», which is only four seconds less than the true
                    longitude. After a few days the observers had a prompt opportunity of returning
                    home by the Merlin sloop, which was sent to Europe with despatches. The voyage
                    was most disastrous with respect to wind and weather, and at last the ship took
                    fire; but she arrived safe at Portsmouth in March, and on the 2d of April the
                    watch gave 1 l <hi rend="superscript">b</hi> 58 <hi rend="superscript">m</hi> 6⅛
                    <hi rend="superscript">s</hi> , instead of 12 <hi rend="superscript">h</hi> ,
                    for the time of mean noon, so that the error, after six months, was only 1“ 53½
                    <hi rend="superscript">,</hi> , amounting to no more than about twenty miles of
                    distance.</p>
                <p>Mr Robison received, upon his return, the afflicting intelligence of the total
                    loss of the Peregrine, which had foundered at sea with her commander and the
                    whole of the ship’s company. He was also greatly disappointed in the failure of
                    some hopes which had been held out to him from the Admiralty and the Board of
                    Longitude; though in fact there is little reason for the public to regret that
                    he was not gratified with the pursership, which he claimed as the reward of his
                    services. He was indeed afterwards actually made a purser by Lord Sandwich, in
                    1763; but he then declined accepting the appointment. His biographers very
                    naturally complain of the neglect of those boards which ought to have
                    recompensed him; but certainly the Board of Longitude had no power whatever, and
                    probably not much influence, in the appointment of a purser; and, after all, the
                    delay of a year or two was nothing very uncommon in the navy.</p>
                <p>He had now no other resource than to return to Glasgow, and to resume his
                    academical pursuits with renewed energy. It was from this time that he dated his
                    serious application to his studies. He became extremely intimate with Dr Reid
                    and Dr Alexander Wilson; and he had the advantage of being a witness of two of
                    the greatest steps in the improvement of physical science that have been made in
                    modern times, Dr Black’s experimental theory of heat, and Mr Watt’s invention of
                    a new steam-engine. Dr Black was the first that determined the quantity of heat
                    required for the conversion of ice into water: Mr Watt, who was settled as a
                    mathematical instrument-maker at Glasgow, had been employed in repairing a
                    working model of New comen’s engine for one of the professors of the university;
                    and it was the difficulty of supplying this model with steam that suggested to
                    Mr Watt the eligibility of having a separate condenser, and that led him, in
                    conjunction with Dr Black, to a knowledge of the quantity of heat consumed in
                    evaporation.</p>
                <p>Amid the enthusiasm which is always inspired by the progress of scientific
                    discovery and of practical improvement, Mr Robison found every encouragement and
                    every facility for the pursuit of his favourite objects. He was recommended by
                    Dr Black, upon his removal to Edinburgh in 1766, as his successor in the
                    lectureship of chemistry, though without the appointment of a professor. He took
                    charge, also, of the education of Mr Macdowall of Garth-land, and of Mr Charles
                    Knowles, afterwards Sir Charles. Admiral Knowles was soon after recommended by
                    the British government to the empress of Russia, in order to effect a
                    reformation in her navy, having been employed on a similar service in Portugal
                    almost fifty years before; he hadal-ways been a firm friend to Mr Robison, and
                    now engaged him on this mission, with a salary of L.250 a year; and they
                    proceeded together to St Petersburg in December 1770. Being hospitably
                    entertained on their way by the prince bishop of Liege, whom they found to
                    constitute, with his chapter and all his servants, a lodge of freemasons, Mr
                    Robison was easily persuaded to become one of that fraternity: in a few days he
                    was made an apprentice, and by degrees attained the rank of Scottish master, as
                    he has himself related in his publication upon the subject. He continued nearly
                    two years at St Petersburg, still acting in the capacity of private secretary to
                    Sir Charles, who was appointed president of the Board of Admiralty, much to the
                    advantage of the Russian navy, though his improvements were frequently retarded
                    by the prejudices of the native officers. Mr Robison was then appointed
                    inspector general of the corps of marine cadets at Cronstadt, with a double
                    salary, and with the rank of lieutenant-colonel. His duty was to receive the
                    report of about forty teachers and orofessors, respecting the studies of 400
                    young noblemen, who were their pupils, and to class them according to his
                    judgment of their merits; but he had himself nothing to teach, nor could he have
                    had much occasion for “lecturing fluently <pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:wu.89119129625&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=315" xml:id="kp-eb0719-0315-0305"
                    />in the Russian language,” though he was introduced by his friend Kutusoff to
                    the Grand Duke Paul as a proficient in that language; but to the empress he was
                    not personally known. At Petersburg he could have lived without regretting his
                    country, in the society of such men as Euler and Alpinus, admired by the
                    Russians, and beloved by the British; but Cronstadt in winter was deplorably
                    melancholy; and in 1773 he was induced, without much difficulty, to makc some
                    little pecuniary sacrifice in accepting the professorship of natural philosophy
                    at Edinburgh, which had become vacant by the death of Dr Russell, and to which
                    he had been recommended by Dr Robertson, then principal of the university. His
                    determination was not disapproved by the Russian government, who granted him a
                    pension of about L.80 a year for life; but it was only paid as long as three or
                    four young men, who had accompanied him as pupils, continued to reside at
                    Edinburgh; some discontent having been expressed because he did not keep up a
                    correspondence with the academy on the improvement of maritime education.</p>
                <p>He arrived at Edinburgh in September 1774. He married soon afterwards, and
                    continued to reside in that city for the remaining thirty years of his life,
                    paying only an annual visit to his native place, where he possessed a part of
                    the paternal estate; not being solicitous to extend it, although “he did not
                    diminish it otherwise than as it had been diminished before,” that is, in making
                    provision for younger children. His predecessor had been very judicious and
                    successful as a lecturer, though not a mathematician of the highest order: he
                    had himself more practical knowledge and experience in mechanics, and was better
                    acquainted with the foreign mathematicians, who had naturally fallen under his
                    notice during his residence on the continent. His lectures were considered by
                    most of his pupils as somewhat too difficult to be followed; a complaint which,
                    if it did not depend on their own want of preparatory information, arose perhaps
                    rather more from the hasty manner of his enunciation than from the abstruseness
                    of his matter. “The singular facility of his own apprehension,” says Professor
                    Playfair, “made him judge too favourably of the same power in others. To
                    understand his lectures completely was, on account of the rapidity and the
                    uniform flow of his discourse, not a very easy task, even for men tolerably
                    familiar with the subject. On this account his lectures were less popular than
                    might have been expected from such a combination of talents as the author of
                    them possessed.” This inconvenience was increased “by the small number of
                    experiments he introduced, and a view that he took of natural philosophy, which
                    left but a very subordinate place for them to occupy. An experiment, he would
                    very truly observe, does not establish a general proposition, and never can do
                    more than prove a particular fact ;” but he seems to have carried this principle
                    to some little excess: it is, in fact, the <hi rend="italic">illustration,</hi>
                    and not the <hi rend="italic">proof,</hi> of general principles that is the
                    object of a public exhibition of experiments; and it is very doubtful whether
                    Archimedes, or Newton, or Leibnitz, or Euler, would have been very successful as
                    <hi rend="italic">showmen.</hi> With respect, however, to “accuracy of
                    definition, to clearness, brevity, and elegance of demonstration, and even to
                    neatness and precision in experiments,” Professor Robison was very successful;
                    his course extended “to every branch of physics and of mixed mathematics,” and
                    entered so fully into the detail of each particular division of the subjects,
                    that “a more perfect system of academical instruction is not easily to be
                    imagined.” Nothing, in short, was wanting, but so much previous knowledge of
                    mathematics in his pupils as he thought he had a right to expect, though his
                    expectations were too rarely fulfilled.</p>
                <p>The Philosophical Society of Edinburgh had almost been suffered to sink into
                    oblivion after the publication of the third volume of its Essays, in 1756.
                    Professor Robison became a member of it soon after his return from Russia, and
                    was chosen secretary of the new society upon its formation by royal charter in
                    1783, when it incorporated with itself the whole of the surviving members of the
                    former society. In 1798 he received the compliment of a degree of Doctor of Laws
                    from the university of New Jersey; and a similar honour was paid him at Glasgow
                    the year after. In 1800 he was elected, as successor to Dr Black, on the list of
                    the foreign members of the Royal Academy of Sciences of St Petersburg.</p>
                <p>In 1785 he was attacked by a severe disorder, from which he was never afterwards
                    wholly free, though it produced little inconvenience besides pain, with some
                    depression of spirits, which was, however, attributed rather to the closeness of
                    his application than to the immediate effect of the disease, which was a
                    glandular induration. For many years he was obliged to obtain the assistance of
                    substitutes in the delivery of his lectures; but towards the end of his life he
                    was able again to perform the duties of the professorship in person. He
                    continued his literary labours with little intermission, and was most happy in
                    the care and attention of his wife and children, whose virtues he found the best
                    alleviation of his sufferings. He took a slight cold, after giving a lecture, on
                    the 28th of January 1805, and died on the 30th.</p>
                <p>1. It was comparatively late in life that Professor Robison assumed the character
                    of an author, having communicated to the Royal Society of Edinburgh, in 1786, a
                    paper on the Determination of the Orbit and Motion of the Geor-gium Sidus, which
                    was published in the Edinburgh Transactions, vol. i. He had observed - the
                    opposition of the planet with an equatorial telescope only, and he had computed
                    the elements of its orbit with greater accuracy than any other astronomer had
                    then done; although his suspicion of the effect of such a planet on the motions
                    of Jupiter and Saturn has not been confirmed by later investigations, the
                    irregularities of these planets, on the contrary, having been otherwise
                    explained.</p>
                <p>2. A second paper, published in the same collection, vol. ii. p. 82, relates to
                    the Motion of Light, as affected by refracting or reflecting substances which
                    are themselves in motion. The author corrects some errors of Boscovich, who had
                    miscalculated the effect of a water-telescope; but he seems to agree with Dr
                    Wilson in the suggestion of another experiment of a similar nature, which, to
                    say the least, is wholly superfluous.</p>
                <p>3. The most important, beyond all comparison, of Professor Robison’s scientific
                    publications, are the articles which he communicated from time to time to the
                    third edition of the Encyclopaedia Britannica, and to its Supplement. It was
                    under the care of Mr Colin Macfarquhar that the first twelve volumes of that
                    edition of this work were published; <note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>The third edition of the Encyclopaedia Britannica consisted
                    of eighteen volumes; the Supplement to it of two volume». </p></note> and upon
                    his death, in 1793, the task of continuing it was committed to Dr Gleig, to whom
                    Professor Robison became a most essential co-operator, and from that time “the
                    work ceased to be a mere compilation.” The first of his contributions, according
                    to Professor Playfair, was the article Optics, but it is probable he only
                    revised and enlarged that article: it was followed by Philosophy, which he wrote
                    jointly with Dr Gleig; by Physics, Pneumatics, Precession, Projectiles, Pumps,
                    Resistance, Rivers, Roof, Rope-making, Rotation, Seamanship, Signal, Sound,
                    Specific Gravity, Statics, Steam, Steam-Engine, Steelyard,

                    Magnetism, Mechanics, Percussion, Pianoforte, Position, Temperament, Thunder,
                    Trumpet, Tschirnhaus, and Watch-work. Notwithstanding some degree of prolixity
                    and want bf arrangement, which could scarcely be avoided in the preparation of
                    original articles for such a mode of publication, the whole of them, taken
                    together, undeniably exhibit a more complete view of the modern improvements of
                    physical science than had ever before been in the possession of the British
                    public; and display such a combination of acquired knowledge with original power
                    of reasoning, as has fallen to the lot of a few only of the most favoured of
                    mankind.</p>
                <p>4. It is not altogether with so high approbation that his friends and his
                    biographers have mentioned a work, of a nature rather political than
                    philosophical, entitled Proofs of a Conspiracy against all the Religions and
                    Governments of Europe, Edinb. 1797, 8vo; though it went through several
                    editions. The principal part of the book consists of the history of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Illuminati</hi> and the German Union, whom he considers as having
                    become the chief agents in a plot first formed by the freemasons, at the
                    suggestion of some ex-jesuit, who proposed for their model the internal economy
                    of the order which he had quitted; and whatever foundation this outline may have
                    had in truth, there is no doubt that the manner in which Professor Robison has
                    filled it up, betrays a degree of credulity extremely remarkable in a person
                    used to calm reasoning and philosophical demonstration: for example, in the
                    admission of a story told by an anonymous German author, that the minister
                    Turgot was the protector of a society that met at Baron d’Hol-bach’s, for the
                    purpose of examining the brains of <hi rend="italic">living children,</hi> in
                    order to discover the principle of vitality. He does not accuse the English
                    freemasons of having participated in the conspiracy; but he considers the
                    continental lodges as having been universally implicated in it.</p>
                <p>5. After the death of Dr Black, in 1799, he undertook to superintend the
                    publication of his Lectures on Chemistry, which appeared in 1803, 2 vols. 4to.
                    And this task, which was rather laborious than difficult, he executed with equal
                    zeal and ability. He endeavoured to reduce to their just estimate the
                    comparative pretensions of the French and British chemists, though he is
                    somewhat puritanically severe in criticizing the literal meaning of the
                    compliments paid to Black by Lavoisier, on which he founds a charge of
                    insincerity.</p>
                <p>6. His last publication was the first volume of a series which was to form a
                    complete system, entitled Elements of Mechanical Philosophy, Edinb. 1804,8vo. It
                    comprehended only Dynamics and Astronomy, and it never became very popular: it
                    was too difficult for the many, who wished for general and philosophical notions
                    only, and not sufficiently precise and demonstrative for the few, who wanted
                    practical and numerical results. In attempting to combine the separate merits of
                    the <hi rend="italic">Exposition du Système du Monde,</hi> and of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Mécanique Céleste,</hi> the author sacrificed both the popular
                    simplicity of the former, and the mathematical perfection of the latter. A few
                    inaccuracies, which ought not to escape the attention of the reader of the work,
                    have been pointed out in the Imperial Review for March 1805; a journal long
                    since discontinued.</p>
                <p>7. The contents of the volume last mentioned, together with some manuscripts
                    intended to have formed part of a second, and the greater part of the articles
                    furnished by Professor Robison to the Encyclopaedia, were collected into a
                    System of Mechanical Philosophy, with Notes, by David Brewster, LL. D. Edinb.
                    1822, 4 vols. 8vo; a spirited bookseller in London having undertaken the risk of
                    the publication. 1. The first volume begins with the articles Dynamics,
                    Projectiles, Corpuscular Forces, Capillary Attraction, Boscovich’s Theory, and
                    Rotation, all as remodelled for the Elements; then follow Strength op Materials,
                    Carpentry, Roof, Construction of Arches, Construction of Centres. 2. The article
                    Steam-Engine is enriched with notes and an appendix by the late Mr Watt: the
                    next is Machinery, then Resistance of Fluids, Rivers, Water-works, Pumps. 3.
                    Astronomy, Telescope, Pneumatics. 4. Electricity, Magnetism, Variation,
                    Temperament, Trumpet, Watch-work, and Seamanship. The notes are not numerous,
                    and the editor’s principal labour has been to retrench some passages that
                    appeared to him superfluous when the papers were to stand as parts of such a
                    collection.</p>
                <p>“Although Dr Robison’s name,” says Dr Brewster in his preface, “cannot be
                    associated with the great discoveries of the century which he adorned, yet the
                    memory of his talents and his virtues will be long cherished by his country.
                    Imbued with the genuine spirit of the philosophy which he taught, he was one of
                    the warmest patrons of genius wherever it was found. His mind was nobly elevated
                    above the mean jealousies of rival ambition, and his love of science and of
                    justice was too ardent to allow him either to depreciate the labours of others,
                    or to transfer them to himself. To these great qualities as a philosopher, Dr
                    Robison added all the more estimable endowments of domestic and of social life.
                    His friendship was at all times generous and sincere. His piety was ardent and
                    unostentatious. His patriotism was of the most pure and exalted character; and,
                    like the immortal Newton, whose memory he cherished with a peculiar reverence,
                    he was pre-eminently entitled to the high distinction of a Christian, patriot,
                    and philosopher.” His person was handsome, and his physiognomy prepossessing;
                    and he appears to have been endowed with an extraordinary combination of
                    talents, even exclusively of those which were called into immediate activity in
                    his professional pursuits; for he was a good linguist, an excellent draughtsman,
                    and an accomplished musician. His conversation was always energetic and
                    interesting, and sometimes even poetical; and his liberality of sentiment was
                    only limited by his regard for what he considered as the best interests of
                    mankind.</p>
                <p>A short account of his life was published in 1802, by a contributor to the
                    Philosophical Magazine, who, among other inaccuracies, thought himself at
                    liberty to assert that he was an admirer of the algebraical form of
                    representation, in preference to the geometrical. His friend Dr Gleig soon after
                    stepped forward to correct these mistakes, in the Antijacobin Review for 1802,
                    and his letter was copied into the Philosophical Magazine. He asserts, from his
                    own knowledge, that even yet Professor Robison “delights much more in geometry
                    than in any of the modes of algebra, assigning as the reason of his preference,
                    that in the longest demonstration the geometrician has always clear and adequate
                    ideas, which the most expert algebraist can very seldom have.” It may perhaps be
                    asserted, on the other hand, that the same reasoning would lead us always to
                    employ actual multiplication or division, in preference to the use of logarithms
                    or of a sliding rule; and that the whole of the magic of calculation depends on
                    the abstraction of the results from the numerous and separately unimportant
                    steps by which they are obtained; but the having once seen those steps clearly
                    is certainly of great importance to the process of reasoning, even when the
                    memory no longer retains them; and no mathematician of correct taste can study
                    the ancient geometricians without admiring the elegance and precision of their
                    method, even amidst the pedantry which too frequently envelopes their
                    expressions, and without being grateful for their punctuality in collecting
                    their results into the very convenient form of distinct propositions, and in
                    making such references from each proposition to the foundations on which it
                    depends, as to en<pb break="no"

                    />able him readily to trace back their steps to the most elementary principles;
                    which is scarcely possible in any of the works of the most modem school of
                    analysis. Professor Robison, however, seems rarely to have cultivated the higher
                    mathematics for their own sake only, or any further than as they could be
                    applied to the study of the phenomena of nature, or to the practice of the
                    combinations of art: in fact, without some such limitation, there would be no
                    track to guide us in the pathless regions of quantity and number, and their
                    endless relations and functions. But besides the utility of the pure mathematics
                    as a branch of early education, in exercising and fortifying the powers of the
                    mind, it is impossible to foresee with certainty <hi rend="italic">how much</hi>
                    of mathematics may be wanted by the natural philosopher in any given
                    investigation; and Professor Robison, as well as many others of his countrymen,
                    would certainly have been the better for the possession of <hi rend="italic">a
                    little more,</hi> as the author of the criticisms in the Imperial Review has
                    already had occasion to remark.</p>
