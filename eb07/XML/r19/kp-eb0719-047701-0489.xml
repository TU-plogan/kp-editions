                <p><label type="entry">ROSCOMMON</label> an inland county in the province of
                    Connaught, in Ireland, is bounded on the north by the county of Sligo, on the
                    east by those of Leitrim, Longford, and Westmeath, on the south-east by the
                    King’s County, on the south-west by Galway, and on the west by the same county
                    and by Mayo. It extends over a surface of 609,405 acres, of which 453,555 are
                    cultivated, 131,063 are uncultivated mountain or bog, and 24,787 are under
                    water. According to Ptolemy, it was inhabited by the Auteri; afterwards the
                    tribes or septs of the O’Conors, O’Kellys, M‘Dermots, O'Flanegans, O’Flyns, and
                    O’Hanlys, were the chief possessors of it. Shortly after the arrival of the
                    English in the reign of Henry II. it was seized upon by the new settlers, and
                    their maintenance of it secured by the erection of several fortresses. For a
                    long period afterwards the whole province was considered as consisting but of
                    two counties, that of Roscommon being one, and all the remainder, with the
                    county of Clare included, the other, under the name of the county of Connaught.
                    This arrangement continued until the beginning of the reign of Elizabeth, when
                    the whole province underwent a new classification, and the county of Roscommon
                    was divided into the baronies of Athlone, Ballintubber, Boyle, Moycarnon, and
                    Roscommon. At the close of the war of 1641, nearly all the former proprietors
                    were dispossessed for having espoused the royal cause, and their possessions
                    transferred to the republican adventurers and soldiers; since which period, that
                    branch of the O’Conor family, once sovereigns of all Ireland, now known by the
                    name of the O’Conor Don, is the only one of the former possessors who holds any
                    part of ancestral possessions in the country. The five baronies are subdivided
                    into fifty-three parishes, and four parts of parishes, the remaining parts of
                    which are in some of the adjoining counties. According to the ecclesiastical
                    arrangements of the country, Roscommon contains fifty-seven parishes, of which
                    fifty-one are in the diocese of Elphin, three in Tuam, two in Clonfert, and one
                    in Ardagh. The seat of the bishopric of Elphin is in the town of the same name
                    in the county.</p>
                <p>Roscommon is in shape long and narrow, extending sixty miles in a northern and
                    southern direction, whilst its breadth from east to west, where greatest, is but
                    thirty-two miles; and it decreases gradually until it terminates in a point in
                    its southern extremity. The greatest part of it is level, forming the western
                    portion of the central floetz limestone field of Ireland; varied, however, by
                    frequent inconsider-ble elevations, and by long low ridges or escars formed of
                    limestone gravel. In the north the country rises into rugged mountains with
                    abrupt precipitous sides and flattened summits, the highest of which, Bracklieve
                    and Slieve Corkagh, are upwards of a thousand feet above the level of the sea.
                    The equally wild though less elevated range of the Curlew Mountains also forms
                    part of the northern boundary. The Slieve Bawn Mountains range along the middle
                    part of the eastern boundary. Slieve Aluyn, in the west, is also of considerable
                    height. No large river passes through the county, but both its eastern and
                    western limits are watered by navigable streams. To the east the Shannon rolls
                    its immense volume of waters along that whole side, and on the west the Suck,
                    which is navigable for barges to Ballina-sloe, unites with the Shannon at the
                    extreme south point. The rivers in the interior, which are small and
                    insignificant, are all tributaries to one or other of these main channels, and
                    chiefly to the former, discharging themselves into their <pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:wu.89119129625&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=490" xml:id="kp-eb0719-0490-0478"
                    />streams, either directly, or through the medium of some of the numerous lakes
                    dispersed throughout various parts. Of these smaller rivers, the Arigna, the
                    Fiorish, and the Gara or Boyle river, are tributaries to the Shannon; the
                    Bresgue and the Lung, the latter of which flows through a subterraneous channel
                    during part of its course, discharge their contents into Lough Gara. The most
                    remarkable of the lakes, both for size and beauty, is Lough Kea in the northern
                    part, near the town of Boyle, from which place it also takes a name, as likewise
                    that of Rockingham Lake, from the seat of Lord Lorton upon its shore. It is
                    about three miles in length by two in breadth, and studded with several
                    picturesque islands, amongst which Trinity Island is noted for its monastic
                    ruins, and Castle Island for an ancient fortress of the M <hi rend="superscript"
                    >1</hi> Dermots, now modernized into an elegant villa. The lake derives its
                    supply from the neighbouring boundary lake of Lough Gara upon the borders of
                    Sligo, which, though larger, and still more irregular in its outline, is less
                    attractive in appearance than that on which it bestows its redundant waters. To
                    the north of Lough Kea the two smaller lakes, Lough Skeen and Lough Meelagh, are
                    connected by a short channel with the Shannon. The lakes of Bodarrig, Boflin,
                    and Reagh, on its eastern side, which are, strictly speaking, expansions of the
                    Shannon, may also be considered as partially belonging to the county. The
                    principal of the smaller lakes are Loughs Errit, Glynn, Funcheon, and Aluyn.
                    There are several extensive furloughs or winter lakes, which, being generally
                    dry in summer, afford rich pasturage for sheep. Between Frenchpark and Elphin,
                    that of Mantua covers seven hundred acres; another near Lough Glynn, in the
                    extreme west of the county, is half a mile long.</p>
                <p>The limestone, which forms the base of all the level districts, is of various
                    kinds, some gray, containing numerous fossil remains, chiefly madrepores; some
                    of the formation called calp, which is often found blended with layers of Lydian
                    stone; and some black, being susceptible of a high polish, as is a light gray
                    marble found in the southern parts. Sandstone shows itself in the eminences that
                    protrude through the limestone. Slieve Bawn is mostly composed of it; and in the
                    neighbourhood of Frenchpark it is raised in laminae so thin as to be used for
                    the covering of roofs. The northern district is of the coal formation, which
                    extends also into the adjoining county of Leitrim; but the principal stores of
                    this most valuable mineral, and of ironstone, are to be found on the Roscommon
                    side. The entire area, which is divided into two parts by the Arigna, extends
                    over six thousand five hundred acres, of which two thousand are to the north and
                    four thousand five hundred to the south of that river. The strata of coal rise
                    into the mountains of Bracklieve and Slieve Corkagh, where the outcrop may be
                    distinctly seen in several places in the precipitous sides of the declivities.
                    The coal is of the blazing or bituminous character, less inflammable than that
                    of Scotland, but more so than that of the north of England. The principal beds
                    are the Rover, Gubberother, and Aughabehy collieries, in the latter of which,
                    the chief seam, and the only one deemed sufficiently rich to defray the expense
                    of working, is from one foot to two and a half feet thick, and promises to be
                    abundant in quantity, although subject to interruptions, or what the workmen
                    call faults, occasioned by the strata of one part of a hill having slipped down
                    to a depth of from twenty to fifty yards, and settled on a lower level. The
                    principal beds of iron ore are also on the south side of the Arigna river,
                    whence the workings derive their name. They exhibit decisive indications of
                    having been in operation at an early period; but, most probably in consequence
                    of the exhaustion of timber for fuel, they were latterly inoperative until 1788,
                    when the pit-coal found in the neighbourhood led to a new speculation in them,
                    which, however, was dropped at the end of twenty years. The workings were
                    resumed by three of the mining companies which the extravagant spirit of
                    joint-stock enterprise gave rise to about the year 1825; but only one of them,
                    the Arigna company, persevered in the experiment, until involved in a chancery
                    suit as to the right of tenure, which being decided against them in 1836, the
                    works have been resumed by their successful opponent, by whom they are now
                    carried on upon a very extended scale, and with a prospect of adequate
                    remuneration for the capital sunk in the concern. Both the ironstone and the
                    limestone used as a flux have been pronounced to be of prime quality. Potters’
                    clay is found in several places, and is manufactured into the coarser kinds of
                    wares. Fire-bricks are made at Arigna, of fire-clay, which forms some of the
                    mineral strata there.</p>
                <p>The soil varies nearly according to the nature of its substratum, that on the
                    limestone being much the most productive; except in the hilly district between
                    the Shannon and the Suck, in which the stone rises so near the surface that the
                    superincumbent vegetable mould is scarcely of denth sufficient to admit the use
                    of the plough. The borders of the rivers which flow through the level parts, and
                    are therefore liable to overflow their banks during winter, become, on the
                    return of dry weather, pastures and meadows of the richest quality. Bogs of
                    every size, from an extent of a thousand acres to patches merely adequate for
                    the domestic demands of the immediate neighbourhood in which they lie, are to be
                    found in many parts. The mountains are mostly covered with bog and marsh,
                    interspersed with dry patches on which heath grows most luxuriantly. In the
                    southern part, large tracts of a very light sandy soil, lying on the low hills
                    between the Suck and the Shannon, afford excellent pasturage for sheep. The
                    borders of Lough Aluyn are in some parts formed of sand, apparently carried from
                    the lake by the wind. Large deposits of gravel and different kinds of loam are
                    often found between the surface-soil and the rock which forms the
                    substratum.</p>

                    or of one to every l∙89 cultivated acre. The returns of the Commissioners of
                    Public Instruction in 1834 having been made up according to dioceses, though
                    they do not give results sufficiently accurate to be placed along with those in
                    the preceding table, afford data sufficient respecting the comparative numbers
                    of the three principal religious persuasions, to justify the statement, that if
                    the whole population of the county be estimated at 240,000 (a close
                    approximation to that of 1831), the numbers of Protestants are 7000, and of
                    Roman Catholics 233,000, being an average of one to thirty-three nearly. The
                    total number of protestant dissenters in the county, according to the same
                    return, was but forty-three.</p>
                <p>This population was represented in the Irish parliament by eight members; two for

                    deprived of the right of election. The number of registered electors for the

                    Protestants, and 13,262 Roman Catholics; the religious persuasion of the
                    remaining 343 was not specified. The total number of schools in the county was
                    309; of which seventeen, containing 545 pupils, were maintained by grants of
                    public money; thirty-eight, containing 1954 pupils, by the voluntary
                    contributions of societies or individuals; and the remaining 254 schools, which
                    afforded the means of instruction to 12,147 pupils, were maintained wholly by
                    the pupils’ fees. The report of the Commissioners of National Education in 1837
                    (the latest published) states the number of schools, teachers, and pupils,
                    connected with their board, as follows: Schools, eleven; teachers, twelve; boys,
                    941; girls, 757; total of pupils, 1698. The diocesan school of the see of Elphin
                    is in the county.</p>
                <p>The habits of the population are so thoroughly rural, that there are but four
                    towns of which the population of each exceeds a thousand souls, two of them
                    containing between three and four thousand, and the other two between one and
                    two thousand. There are several fine mansions and demesnes in the hands of
                    resident noblemen and gentlemen, and numerous villas and country-seats belonging
                    to independent landed proprietors; but as to the small farmers and cottiers, the
                    appearance of their dwellings and homesteads in many cases are far from showing
                    those indications of internal comfort that might be expected in a district so
                    highly favoured by nature. Agriculture is carried on with much spirit amongst
                    the higher classes, by whom the latest improvements in tillage, and the best
                    constructed vehicles and implements, have been introduced; but the old customs
                    and antiquated implements are pertinaciously adhered to by most of the smaller
                    farmers. Wheat is largely sown; a judicious rotation system is carried on; and
                    green crops are frequent, with the exception of turnips and mangel-wurzel, which
                    have not been found to answer. In the mountainous districts the spade is
                    frequently used instead of the plough. In these also the neighbouring
                    landholders generally club their labour together, particularly in planting and
                    raising potatoes, all uniting to complete the work of one farm, and then
                    proceeding successively in a body to execute that of the other partners in the
                    amicable joint-stock concern. The pastures are amongst the best in Ireland, and
                    as their proprietors are almost fastidiously particular in the selection of live
                    stock of every description, the best-fed beasts are to be met with here. This is
                    peculiarly the case with respect to bullocks; the sheep also are of first-rate
                    quality, both as to fleece and flavour of carcass. In prime grazing land an acre
                    feeds a bullock and a sheep. Notwithstanding the superior capabilities of the
                    soil for pasturage, there are not many large dairies. But few farms, however
                    small, are without one cow, if not more, so that butter of excellent quality is
                    made, not only sufficient for the internal demand, but for forming a material
                    article of export. The breed of horses is much esteemed. The annual fair of
                    Ballinasloe, in October, is the principal mart at which the black cattle and
                    sheep are disposed of. Fences in general are made of stone-walls, raised to a
                    considerable height, as they arc considered to afford better shelter for cattle
                    than those of timber. That the county was once well wooded, appears not only
                    from the evidence of history, but from the fact that wherever the impediments to
                    its growth are removed, the soil spontaneously throws up shoots of those species
                    of forest-</p>
                <p>trees with which the whole face of the country was once covered. The excessive
                    clearing of the woods, without precautionary measures to secure a new growth,
                    has left the surface very bare; but this defect, equally unsightly to the eye of
                    taste and injurious to the progress of improvement, is annually diminishing,
                    through the exertions of the landed gentry, many of whose mansions are
                    surrounded with noble plantations. Manufactures, with the exception of those
                    already noticed, and of coarse woollens and linens for domestic consumption, are
                    almost unknown. The articles of export are confined to agricultural produce and
                    live stock, for which the recent improvements on the course of the Shannon have
                    afforded great facilities. The navigation of this fine river, which, as has
                    already been said, skirts the county along the whole of its eastern verge, was
                    so much obstructed by several rapids as to render it useless as a channel of
                    enlarged inland traffic. These impediments have been obviated by means of short
                    canals along the side of the river in those parts where the rapids occur. The
                    first is from Lough Allen in Leitrim to Battlebridge, whence the river-stream is
                    available somewhat farther than Carrick, where a second canal serves to avoid
                    the rapids between Jamestown and Drumsna. Other short canals occur at the falls
                    of Ruskey, of Lanesborough, and of Athlone. Thence the channel is clear to the
                    junction with the Suck, where it quits the county. The connection by water with
                    the eastern counties to Dublin is maintained by the Royal and Grand Canals,
                    which communicate with the Shannon at Tarmonbarry and Shannon Harbour. The
                    principal exports are corn and butter, all the coal as yet raised being not more
                    than sufficient for the supply of the districts surrounding the collieries. As
                    all the great lines of land conveyance to Connaught from Leinster and Ulster
                    pass through the county, the roads are numerous, and generally well kept up.</p>
                <p>The monastic antiquities are very numerous. The ruins of the abbey of Boyle still
                    exhibit a large part of its highly ornamented church, with its tower rising from
                    the middle of the building, and resting on four colum∏3 of colossal dimensions,
                    enriched with a variety of sculptures; and the Dominican friary at Roscommon
                    contains a monument of an ancient member of the O’Conor family, exhibiting an
                    effigy of an armed warrior in a lying posture, with four other armed figures on
                    the base. Derhan Abbey, in the neighbourhood of Roscommon, is little more than a
                    heap of stones. The others of which some relics still exist, are Trinity Abbey
                    in Lough Kea, Tulsk, Clonshanvill, and Clontuskert, in which there are several
                    monuments and inscriptions relating to the O’Kellys and other ancient families.
                    In the parish of Oran on the Suck, in the west of the county, are the remains of
                    an ancient pillar-tower, about ten feet high; and in every part there are raths
                    so numerous that nearly five hundred are still visible. The county contained a
                    great number of small fortresses, evidently built when it was one of the marches
                    or border districts, to repress the incursions of the Connaught Irish, besides
                    which there were a few of great extent and strength, as is testified by that of
                    Roscommon, forming a quadrangle of 220 by 180 feet, with towers at the angles
                    and at the gateway, and containing the remains of a large building, supposed to
                    be the residence of the governor. The most remarkable of the other castles are
                    those of Athlone, Ballinasloe, Ballynafad, and Lough Glynn.</p>
                <p>Roscommon, the county town, is built on the sides of a hill, near the middle of
                    the county, in a plain between the Shannon and the Suck. It consists but of one
                    main street, with several minor avenues branching out into five main roads, in
                    various directions. It was incorporated at a very early period, and was
                    considered to be one of the chief places in these parts. Writs for the better
                    defence of the town and castle are frequent among the earlier records. It
                    returned <pb break="no" facs="ht:wu.89119129625&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=492"

                    Union. Here are all the buildings connected with the local administration of
                    justice. The county court-house is a spacious and well-arranged edifice, with an
                    elegant Grecian-Doric porticoin front. The county prison, built on the radiating
                    plan, contains accommodations for upwards of a hundred prisoners, and has a
                    tread-mill. The county infirmary, which also contains a fever hospital and
                    infirmary, admits an average of three hundred patients annually. The modern
                    ecclesiastical buildings are not remarkable for architectural elegance. The
                    parish church is a neat structure. The old court-house has been converted into a
                    Roman Catholic chapel. The town is a place of very limited trade, except in that
                    of grain, large quantities of which are sent to Lanesborough to be exported
                    thence by means of the Royal Canal or the Shannon. The population in 1831 was
                    3306. That of other towns the number of whose inhabitants exceeded 1000, was
                    Boyle, the largest and most commercial in the county, 3433; Strokestoun, 1548;
                    and Elphin, in which there is a poor cathedral to a very wealthy diocese, and a
                    diocesan school, 1507. That part of the town of Athlone on the Shannon, in which
                    the fortified magazines and works intended for the defence of the pass of the
                    Shannon have been built, is on the Roscommon side of the river. The greater part
                    of the town of Ballinasloe, celebrated for its great annual fair of sheep and
                    horned cattle, is also in this county, (c. p.)</p>

                    of,</hi> a celebrated poet of the seventeenth century, was the son of James
                    Dillon, earl of Roscommon, and was born in Ireland, under the administration of
                    the first Earl of Strafford, who was his uncle, and from whom he received the
                    name of <hi rend="italic">Wentworth</hi> at his baptism. He passed his infancy
                    in Ireland; after which the Earl of Strafford sent for him into England, and
                    placed him at his own seat in Yorkshire, under the tuition of Dr Hall,
                    afterwards bishop of Norwich, who instructed him in Latin, without teaching him
                    the common rules of grammar, which he could never retain in his memory, though
                    he learned to write in that language with classical elegance and propriety. On
                    the Earl of Strafford’s being impeached, he went to complete his education at
                    Caen in Normandy; and after some years he travelled to Rome, where he became
                    acquainted with the most valuable remains of antiquity, and in particular was
                    well skilled in medals, and learned to speak Italian with such grace and fluency
                    that he was frequently taken for a native. He returned to England soon after the
                    Restoration, and was made captain of the band of pensioners; but a dispute with
                    the lord privy-seal about a part of his estate obliged him to resign his post,
                    and revisit his native country, where the Duke of Ormond appointed him captain
                    of the guards. He was unhappily very fond of gaming; and as he was returning to
                    his lodgings from a gaming-table in Dublin, he was attacked in the dark by three
                    ruffians, who were employed to assassinate him. The earl defended himself with
                    such resolution, that he had despatched one of the aggressors, when a gentleman
                    passing that way took his part, and disarmed another, on which the third sought
                    his safety in flight. This generous assistant was a disbanded officer of good
                    family and fair reputation, but reduced to poverty; and his lordship rewarded
                    his bravery by resigning to him his post of captain of the guards. Heat length
                    returned to London, when he was made master of the horse to the Duchess of York,
                    and married the Lady Frances, the eldest daughter of Richard earl of Burlington,
                    and the widow of Colonel Courtney. Here he distinguished himself by his
                    writings; and, in imitation of those learned and polite assemblies with which he
                    had been acquainted abroad, he began to form a society for refining and fixing
                    the standard of the English language, in which his great friend Dryden was a
                    principal assistant. This scheme, however, was entirely defeated by the
                    religious commotions which ensued on King</p>
                <p>James’s accession to the throne. In 1683 he was seized with the gout; and being
                    too impatient of pain, he permitted a bold French empiric to apply a repelling
                    medicine, in order to give him immediate relief. This drove the distemper into
                    his bowels, and in a short time put a period to his life. He died in the month
                    of January 1684, and was buried with great pomp in Westminster Abbey.</p>
                <p>His poems, which are not numerous, are in the body of English poetry collected by
                    Dr Johnson. His Essay on Translated Verse, and his translation of Horace’s Art
                    of Poetry, have been much commended. Upon the latter, Waller addressed a poem to
                    his lordship when he was seventy-five years of age. “In the writings of this
                    nobleman we view,” says Fenton, “the image of a mind naturally serious and
                    solid; richly furnished and adorned with all the ornaments of art and science;
                    and these ornaments unaffectedly disposed in the most regular and elegant order.
                    His imagination might probably have been more fruitful and sprightly, if his
                    judgment had been less severe; but that severity (delivered in a masculine,
                    clear, succinct style) contributed to make him so eminent in the didactical
                    manner, that no man with justice can affirm he was equalled by any of our
                    nation, without confessing at the same time that he is inferior to none. In some
                    other kinds of writing his genius seems to have wanted fire to attain the point
                    of perfection; but who can attain it ?” He was a man of an amiable disposition,
                    as well as a good poet; as Pope, in his Essay on Criticism, has testified in the
                    following lines:</p>
                <p>Roscommon not more learned than good,</p>
                <p>With manners generous as his noble blood:</p>
                <p>To him the wit of Greece and Rome was known,</p>
                <p>And every author’s merit but his own.</p>
                <p>We must allow of Roscommon, what Fenton has not mentioned so distinctly as he
                    ought, and what is yet very much to his honour, that he is perhaps the only
                    correct writer in verse before Addison; and that, if there are not so many or so
                    great beauties in his composition as in those of some contemporaries, there are
                    at least fewer faults. Nor is this his highest praise. For Pope has celebrated
                    him as the only moral writer of King Charles’s reign.</p>
                <p>Unhappy Dryden! in all Charles’s days,</p>
                <p>Roscommon only boasts unspotted lays.</p>
                <p>“Of Roscommon’s works,” as Dr Johnson has remarked, “the judgment of the public
                    seems to be right. He is elegant, but not great; he never labours after
                    exquisite beauties, and he seldom falls into gross faults. His versification is
                    smooth, but rarely vigorous; and his rhymes are remarkably exact. He improved
                    taste, if he did not enlarge knowledge, and may be numbered among the
                    benefactors to English literature.</p>
