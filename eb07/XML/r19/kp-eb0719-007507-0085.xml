                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra

                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">burg, a city of the modern kingdom of Bavaria, the capital
                    of the circle of that name. This city in ancient times, though under the
                    protection of the elector of Bavaria, was considered as an imperial city, and
                    the diets of the German empire were frequently held within it. It was then the
                    see of an archbishop, and remarkable for its zealous adherence to the Catholic
                    church. It was the scene of one of the most bloody conflicts during the Thirty
                    Years’ War, when the army of the imperial general Wallenstein was intrenched
                    before it, and the Swedish monarch Gustavus Adolphus made re-, peated but
                    ultimately unsuccessful attempts to storm the works, and lost so many men that
                    he was compelled to retreat. It suffered much during the war between the French
                    and Austrians in 1809.</hi></p>
                <p>Ratisbon was a place of much greater relative importance in former times than it
                    is at present, having then the exclusive right to all the trade by the river
                    Danube, both upwards as far as Ulm, and downwards as far as Vienna.</p>
                <p>The city stands on the river Danube, at the spot where the river Regen <hi
                    rend="subscript">1</hi> from which its German name is derived, falls into that
                    great stream. The bridge over the Danube connects the several parts of the city.
                    It is still in an imperfect degree fortified, but is totally indefensible
                    against any armed force. The buildings are of antique models, particularly the
                    ancient council-house, in which the representatives of all the states of Germany
                    were accustomed to assemble. The cathedral is a large Gothic building; as are
                    the church of St Emeran and the Lutheran church of the Holy Trinity, the latter
                    of which was the college of the Jesuits till the abolition of the order.</p>
                <p>The population, which in 1811 amounted to 18,843 persons, has much increased, and
                    was found in 1837 to be 26,550. Of these, about one third are Lutherans; and two
                    thirds, comprehending almost the whole of the labouring classes, are Roman
                    Catholics. The former party have a gymnasium, and the latter a lyceum. There is
                    a learned society, who have a botanical garden and a respectable library, with a
                    museum of mathematical and philosophical instruments, and a picture-gallery.
                    There are manufactures of morocco leather, many tanneries, soap-makers, wax and
                    tallow chandlers, with large breweries and distilleries. On the banks of the
                    Danube are some establishments for building barques and boats for navigating
                    that river. The transit trade between eastern and western Germany gives
                    employment to several respectable mercantile houses. A project, now considerably
                    advanced, gives hope to the inhabitants of this city of a much greater portion
                    of transit commerce. The Royal Bavarian Canal is hastening to its completion,
                    and will open a communication by water between the Rhine and the Danube, the
                    whole length being within the dominions of Bavaria. It commences at the river
                    Mayn, which empties itself into the Rhine, and will terminate in the Danube,
                    near this city. It is hoped that the timber of Bavaria will thus find a market
                    in Hungary, and the surplus corn of that kingdom a constant vent on the banks of
                    the Rhine, especially in Holland.</p>
