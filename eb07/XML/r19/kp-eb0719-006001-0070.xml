                <p><hi rend="italic">Lunar RainBow.</hi> The moon sometimes exhibits the phenomenon
                    of an iris or rainbow by the refraction of her rays in drops of rain during the
                    night-time. But this phenomenon is very rare. In the Philosophical Transactions
                    for 1783, however, we have an account of three which were seen in one year, and
                    all in the same place; it is communicated in two letters by Mr Marmaduke
                    Tunstall. The first was seen on the 27th of February 1782, at Greta Bridge,
                    Yorkshire, between seven and eight at night, and appeared in tolerably distinct
                    colours, similar to a solar one, but more feint, the orange colour seeming to
                    predominate. It happened at full moon, at which time alone they are said to be
                    always seen. Though Aristotle is stated to have observed two, and some others
                    have been seen by Snellius, Mr Tun-stall could only find two described with any
                    accuracy; one by Plot, in his History of Oxfordshire, which was seen by him in
                    1675, though without colours; and the other seen by a Derbyshire gentleman at
                    Glapwell, near Chesterfield, described by Thoresby, and inserted in the
                    Philosophical Transactions, No. 331. This was about Christmas 1710, and is said
                    to have had all the colours of the <hi rend="italic">iris Solaris.</hi> The
                    night was windy; and although there was then a drizzling rain and a dark cloud,
                    in which the rainbow was reflected, it proved afterwards a light frost.</p>
                <p>Two others were afterwards seen by Mr Tunstall. One of these was observed on the
                    30th of July, about eleven o’clock, which lasted about a quarter of an hour, but
                    without colours; and the other, which appeared on the 18th of October, was
                    perhaps the most extraordinary one of the kind that had ever been seen. It
                    became visible about nine o’clock, and con<pb break="no"

                    />tinued, though with very different degrees of brilliancy, till 'past two. At
                    first, though a strongly-marked bow, it was without colours; but afterwards they
                    were very conspicuous and vivid, in the same form as in the solar, though
                    fainter, the red, green, and purple being the most distinguishable. About twelve
                    it was the most splendid in appearance; its arc was a considerably smaller
                    segment of a circle than a solar; and its south-east limb first began to fail, a
                    considerable time before its final extinction. The wind was very high, nearly
                    due west, accompanied most part of the time with a drizzling rain. It is a
                    singular circumstance, that three of these phenomena should have been seen in so
                    short a time and in one place; as they have been esteemed, ever since the time
                    of Aristotle, who is said to have been the first observer of them, and saw only
                    two in fifty years, and since by Plot and Thoresby, almost the only two English
                    authors who have spoken of them, to be exceedingly rare. They evidently appear
                    to be occasioned by a refraction in a cloud or turbid atmosphere, and in general
                    are indications of stormy and rainy weather. Thoresby, indeed, says the one he
                    observed was succeeded by several days of fine serene weather. One particular,
                    rather singular, in the second, namely, that of July the 30th, was its being six
                    days after the full moon; and the last, though of so long a duration, was three
                    days before the full moon. That of the 27th of February was exactly at the full,
                    which used to be judged the only time when they could be seen, though there is
                    an account that Weidler observed one in 1719, during the first quarter of the
                    moon, with faint colours, and in very calm weather.</p>
                <p>In the Gentleman’s Magazine for August 1788 an account is given of a lunar
                    rainbow by a correspondent, who saw it. “On Sunday evening the 17th of August,”
                    says he, “after two days, on both of which, particularly the former, there had
                    been a great deal of rain, together with lightning and thunder, just as the
                    clocks were striking nine, twenty-three hours after full moon, looking through
                    my window, 1 was struck with the appearance of something in the sky, which
                    seemed like a rainbow. Having never seen a rainbow by night, I thought it a very
                    extraordinary phenomenon, and hastened to a place where there were no buildings
                    to obstruct my view of the hemisphere. Here I found that the phenomenon was no
                    other than a lunar rainbow; the moon was truly ‘ walking in brightness,’
                    brilliant as she could be; not a cloud was to be seen near her; and over against
                    her, toward the north-west, or perhaps rather more to the north, was a rainbow,
                    a vast arch, perfect in all its parts, not interrupted or broken as rainbows
                    frequently are, but Unremittedly visible from one horizon to the other. In order
                    to give some idea of its extent, it is necessary to say, that as I stood toward
                    the western extremity of the parish of Stoke-Newington, it seemed to take its
                    rise from the west of Hampstead, and to end, perhaps, in the river Lea, the
                    eastern boundary of Tottenham; its colour was white, cloudy, or grayish, but a
                    part of its western leg seemed to exhibit tints of a faint sickly green. I
                    continued viewing it for some time, till it began to rain; and at length the
                    rain increasing and the sky growing more hazy, I returned home about a quarter
                    or twenty minutes past nine, and in ten minutes came out again; but by that time
                    all was over, the moon was darkened by clouds, and the rainbow of course
                    vanished.”</p>
