                <p><label type="entry">RHETORIC</label>.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">The</hi> founder of modern philosophy describes the subject
                    of our present inquiry as being “that science which we call Rhetoric or Art of
                    Eloquence; a science excellent, and excellently well laboured.” But Bacon’s
                    praise of the science itself, and of its ancient cultivators, has been fair from
                    commanding universal assent. The prejudice with which rhetorical studies are
                    regarded by so many, has, it must be confessed, been fostered, if not generated,
                    by the fault of some of its students and expositors. Rhetoricians, like teachers
                    of the kindred science logic, have too often claimed for their art the
                    possession of powers which do not belong to it: their systems of precepts have
                    become most ponderous, and their pretensions most extravagant, in times when
                    eloquence was sunk in the deepest decay; and in the rhetorical writings of the
                    lower empire and the dark ages, it seems to be implicitly assumed that every man
                    who submits to learn and practise certain prescribed rules, will attain skill in
                    speech and writing, as certainly as he would, by an industrious apprenticeship,
                    acquire the mastery of a mechanical trade. Accordingly, in more than one period,
                    and in none perhaps more decidedly than in our own, the very name of Rhetoric
                    has been put under the ban of the empire of literature; and the sentence has
                    been justified by misrepresentations both of the purposes of the art, and of the
                    works which result from it. Its rules have been described as a scheme of petty
                    sophistical artifices, designed to aid in smuggling falsehood into the mind
                    under the disguise of logical quibbles or oratorical ornaments; and, the worst
                    declamations of the worst declaimers being exhibited as adequate specimens,
                    rhetorical composition has been defined to be, that which possesses the forms of
                    eloquence without its spirit. We hear truth, good taste, and eloquence,
                    severally spoken of as the antitheses of rhetoric. Words, to use Mirabeau’s
                    paradox, are things; and the subject which we are now to consider is not the
                    only one, nor by any means the most important, in which infinite mischief has
                    been done by the attaching of contemptible associations to terms of neutral
                    meaning, and by the affixing of odious names to objects in themselves innocent
                    or useful.</p>
                <p>The truth is, that the uses of rhetoric, as well as of all the other arts or
                    sciences which, in different departments, aim at the training of the human mind
                    for exertions in which it is itself its own instrument, are principally
                    negative. Neither in reasoning nor in oratory can any scheme of rules, logical
                    or rhetorical, nor any study of models however profound, nor any practice
                    however long and intelligent, enable the intellect to perform, even moderately
                    well, a task for which it has an inherent incapacity; and if excellence be the
                    end in view, it will assuredly never be reached, either with the observance of
                    rules or independently of them, unless genius be present to give the primary
                    impulse, and to sustain the mind in its course. Logic, strictly speaking, does
                    not teach us how to reason, but only how to avoid violations of those essential
                    principles on which all reasoning is founded. In like manner, a legitimate
                    system of rhetoric would teach, not what eloquence <hi rend="italic">is,</hi>
                    but what it is <hi rend="italic">not;</hi> it would disclaim all purpose of
                    qualifying its students to compound an eloquent discourse by rule, as a medicine
                    is compounded after a prescription; and it would occupy itself mainly in
                    discovering, by the immediate study of the mind itself, and by critical
                    examination of the works of genius, those guiding and universal laws of human
                    intellect which the student of eloquence <hi rend="italic">must not</hi>
                    disobey, if he wishes to attain, in any shape, the end which he pursues.</p>
                <p>It must be that such principles exist: if we apprehend rightly what eloquence is,
                    we may reasonably hope to discover at least some of them; and even if we could
                    discover them all,—which no sound thinker has ever yet pretended to do,—the
                    speaker or writer would still retain ample space for the exertion of his natural
                    powers, which indeed would act with redoubled ease and vigour from his distinct
                    knowledge of the limits of their domain. A chart does not teach the mariner how
                    to navigate his vessel; but it may fare hardly with him if he wants one in a
                    narrow sea, with whose soundings he is imperfectly acquainted.</p>
                <p>It is designed, in this paper, not to present a dissertation having any claim to
                    be considered as a complete exposition of the subject in any of its sections,
                    but simply to sketch in outline a plan of rhetorical studies, which the student
                    may not find altogether useless as a clue when he attempts to master the details
                    under the guidance of more ambitious works; and it may be well to state at the
                    outset the view which, in common with those who have thought most deeply on the
                    matter, we entertain as to the means by which rhetoric is qualified to execute
                    the very important task which it undertakes.</p>
                <p>In the first place, then, we hold that the systematic view of the principles and
                    rules of eloquence which rhetorical treatises usually offer, must peremptorily
                    be embraced, as an essential part, in the studies of every one who would become
                    really eloquent in speech or in writing. But this proposition must be understood
                    with two cautions. First, in regard to many particulars indispensable towards
                    the attainment of eloquence, every sound scheme of rhetorical precepts,
                    abandoning all claim to primary discovery, contents itself with informing or
                    reminding the student, that he must seek for knowledge elsewhere, from
                    reflection on the phenomena of his own mind, from the best works in philosophy,
                    and from an observation of the world and of human nature. This is true, not
                    merely as to the matter on which eloquence may employ itself, as to which,
                    however, it is true universally; but also as to most of the instruments which
                    the art uses. Secondly, and more particularly, the real usefulness of rhetoric
                    rests, not on its special rules, but on its general principles. As soon as a
                    rule diverts the student’s attention from the principle, it for him ceases to be
                    an aid, and becomes a positive hindrance. As soon as a treatise on rhetoric has
                    impressed on the student’s mind distinctly and indelibly the great principles on
                    which eloquence is founded, it has given him a talisman to guard him against all
                    seductions into error, and even against the very mistakes which may be
                    inculcated in the book itself. Systems of rhetoric aid effectually in the
                    attainment of eloquence, only so far as they teach the student to reflect on its
                    principles.</p>
                <p>But, further, we have called systematic rhetoric a part only of the studies
                    leading towards eloquence. It is in truth a part which, by itself, is
                    insufficient for the attainment of the end; for we must add to it a critical
                    acquaintance with the best models of literature, extending over as many of its
                    departments as possible, but especially minute in that which the student chiefly
                    designs to cultivate. What is here meant is a study of literary works, not for
                    the knowledge which they contain, but as models; a study directed towards an
                    analysis of the mode in which they communicate knowledge, and of the conformity
                    or disagreement of that mode with the laws of eloquence. Such a study may be
                    said to bear towards the systematic portion of rhe<pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:wu.89119129625&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=210" xml:id="kp-eb0719-0210-0200"
                    />toric a relation similar to that which, in physical science, an examination of
                    the experiments made by the best philosophers bears towards the series of
                    fundamental propositions in which the result of the experiments is embodied; but
                    the study of the experiments is incalculably more imperative in rhetoric than in
                    natural science, from the incompleteness of the systematic result in the one
                    case compared with that which is reached in the other. Treatises on eloquence
                    which aim at expounding its principles, can seldom, in regard to the critical
                    branch, do more than recommend its prosecution, or practically countenance it by
                    incidental illustrations; but it possesses such importance as to merit a more
                    prominent place than it occupies in most systematic works on the subject.</p>
                <p>Lastly, long practice must be added to all these studies before the end can even
                    be approached. This requisite, however, a treatise on rhetoric can do little
                    more than acknowledge and urge.</p>
                <p>In pursuance of the opinions now expressed, these pages will endeavour to
                    illustrate the subject in Three Divisions. The First will embrace general
                    observations, intended to elicit the true principles of Eloquence, and to
                    exhibit them in various points of view. From our strong impression as to the
                    predominant importance of the general principles over the special rules, we
                    shall be tempted to linger on this branch longer than may be approved by those
                    who are attached to the minutiae of the study; and for the same reason we will
                    not allow ourselves to be deterred by the fear of being charged with truisms,
                    from stating considerations which seem calculated to lead us nearer to the goal.
                    The Second Division will contain a brief summary of the most important
                    principles which have been expounded in the best systems of rhetoric; our
                    principal guides, however, being the treatises of Aristotle, Dr Campbell, and
                    Archbishop Whately. The Third Division will attempt to furnish the student with
                    some aids towards his critical acquaintance with models.</p>
                <p>I.</p>
                <p>“The word Eloquence,” says Campbell, adopting the ancient definitions, “in its
                    greatest latitude, denotes ‘ that art or talent by which a discourse is adapted
                    to its end.’ All the ends of speaking are reducible to four; every speech being
                    intended to enlighten the understanding, to please the imagination, to move the
                    passions, or to influence the will.” The observations by which the same most
                    acute writer immediately afterwards illustrates this his leading proposition,
                    have much truth and great value. It is said, first, that “any one discourse
                    admits only one of these ends as the principal,” to which the others, so far as
                    they are admissible at all, must be rendered conducive; secondly, that “each
                    preceding species, in the order above exhibited, is preparatory to the
                    subsequent ;” thirdly, that, in addressing the understanding, the speaker
                    proposes either to explain to his hearers something unknown or not distinctly
                    comprehended, or to prove something disbelieved or doubted; so that, “in the one
                    case, his aim is their information, in the other their conviction ;” fourthly,
                    that the address to the imagination is common to oratory with poctry, to which
                    indeed it may be added, that the address to the passions must also be considered
                    common to these two arts; and, lastly, that the height of success in persuasion,
                    the fourth end of the orator, is attained by effecting all these ends in the
                    same discourse.</p>
                <p>The analysis, to the extent to which it goes, is strictly accurate; and there is
                    no just reason for refusing to predicate eloquence of every composition written
                    or spoken, which fulfils its conditions. A simple and perspicuous narrative of
                    facts,-—an unimpassioned but convincing argument in proof of a controverted
                    proposition in any department of moral knowledge,—and a harangue which,
                    convincing our understanding of what is, or seems to be, an important truth,
                    summoning before our fancy vivid images of its consequences, and, kindling into
                    flame the most powerful emotions of our nature, hurries us irresistibly to
                    resolution and to action,—each of these exertions of intellect may, in its own
                    sphere, be fully deserving of the appellation of eloquent, because each may
                    possess all the qualities which fit it for producing its end. But we shall still
                    be in danger of misapprehending the real essence of eloquence, unless we state
                    to ourselves substantively, and bring prominently to light, certain principles
                    which the analysis involves, but which it passes over slightly.</p>
                <p>It is rightly said, that each of the purposes of eloquence rises out of, and is
                    necessarily founded on, those which precede it. In other words, the information
                    or conviction of the understanding does, in the first place, he at the root of
                    all eloquence; no composition is eloquent which does not effect this end. The
                    state of mind which eloquence in all circumstances necessarily produces, is that
                    of Belief. This is the fundamental proposition of the Rhetorical Art, and on it
                    depends every well-founded rule which Rhetoric can deduce from its principles.
                    We cannot have the proposition too strongly impressed on our minds; and we may
                    be assured that, the farther we diverge from its central point, the more we
                    shall find ourselves removed from the ability to apprehend or reduce to practice
                    the principles of Eloquent Composition.</p>
                <p>The most common definition of Rhetoric describes it as the Art of Persuasion, a
                    view derived from some of the ancient writers, whose instructions were almost
                    wholly addressed to the case of public speaking in courts of law and popular
                    assemblies. The definition, although it involves the true principle, is slightly
                    faulty, both by excess and by defect. It says more than is true, in stating
                    influence on the will as essential to eloquence; and, on the other hand, it is
                    apt to lead us away from the principle, by tempting us to forget that, as is
                    well said by Whately, the latest and one of the very ablest of the rhetorical
                    writers, “the conviction of the understanding is an essential part of
                    persuasion.” If we must describe Rhetoric by a reference to its purpose, we
                    shall perhaps incur the least risk of mistake by stating simply, that it aims,
                    through the instrumentality of language, at the Production of Belief; and we may
                    perhaps venture to suggest, that this seems to be the true meaning, both of the
                    introductory definition, and of the numerous incidental illustrations, which we
                    find in a treatise at once the oldest and the best upon the subject, namely, the
                    Rhetoric of Aristotle.</p>
                <p>But since rhetoric, so far as it can be treated as a science (which to a certain
                    extent it may), is called on to investigate principles which a writer or speaker
                    must obey, in order to command belief, and since, too, its inquiries must
                    embrace, not only the laws which regulate the conviction of the understanding,
                    but also those which rule in the excitement of the imagination and the
                    feelings,— it may be asked w hether its province does not in several quarters
                    extend over ground belonging properly to Other departments of the mental
                    philosophy. The answer to this question is twofold. There are certain principles
                    which rhetoric does not establish for itself, but assumes as proved by common
                    observation, and by the researches instituted in other branches of mental
                    science; but it also possesses principles which are peculiar to itself, and
                    bring it into no collision even with those other walks of philosophy with which
                    it may be suspected of being identical. By endeavouring at this stage to
                    illustrate both of these propositions, we shall be enabled to bring into a
                    strong light some considerations which might be overlooked if introduced
                    incidentally as bearing on specific rules.</p>

                <p>First, then, Rhetoric is not a primary science. Its first principles are the
                    phenomena and laws of the human mind, which it assumes as known to us from
                    consciousness and observation, and as taught in rational systems of psychology,
                    logic, and ethics. Aristotle, among the many instances in which he protested
                    against errors that had arisen before his time, and have survived in spite of
                    his remonstrances, was especially careful in determining the point at which
                    rhetoric should commence its investigations. He lays it down as a fundamental
                    principle, that the student of eloquence must prepare himself by an adequate
                    acquaintance with three primary branches of knowledge which rhetoric cannot
                    teach him; the science of dialectics, the philosophy of human character and
                    morals, and the philosophy of the passions. The Stagyrite’s requirement of skill
                    in logic for one who desires to acquire skill in oratory, will seem
                    unreasonable, not only to those who disdain the assistance of rules in every
                    department of mental exertion, but to some who are disposed in certain matters
                    to avail themselves of the aids which philosophy offers. If, however, we merely
                    advise them to make themselves familiar, so far as they are not so already, with
                    the principles and practice of reasoning, they cannot fairly consider the
                    counsel as useless; and if they admit the necessity of this study, we can only
                    remind them further, that they must either be content to receive the syllogistic
                    logic of Aristotle, as expounding justly the principles on which all reasoning
                    is founded, or engage in that attempt at discovering a new system, which has
                    baffled the human intellect for two thousand years. “I cannot but consider him,”
                    Says Whately, “as undertaking a task of unnecessary difficulty, who endeavours,
                    without studying logic, to become a thoroughly good argumentative writer.” That
                    Aristotle’s other demands on the student are well founded, will be more readily
                    admitted, how far soever men may disagree as to the mode in which these branches
                    of knowledge may be best acquired. For those who aim principally at applying
                    their acquaintance with human nature to the purpose here in view, the world is
                    doubtless a better school than the closet of the metaphysician; especially as
                    metaphysical writers have, almost without exception, devoted themselves chiefly
                    to those sections of their science which are least closely allied to active
                    life. But the philosopher’s attention is nevertheless directed to many important
                    points which the unsystematic observer is in danger of overlooking; and no one
                    will find cause to regret the time bestowed on a course of metaphysical study,
                    when he proceeds to the task of convincing and persuading his fellow-men.
                    Unfortunately, however, the falsity and extravagance of several very famous
                    systems of ethics, make caution indispensable in regard to such studies. A
                    disciple of Hobbes, who, in addressing himself to any body of men by speech or
                    writing, should frame all his appeals to their feelings, on the assumption that
                    a degrading selfishness was the ruling passion in every breast, would, if he
                    should be within the reach of conviction, discover the best practical refutation
                    of his master’s dogmas in his own utter failure; and one whose mind is
                    thoroughly attuned to the low key of Paley’s philosophy, would probably,
                    although his heresy in morals is less dangerous, find the application of his
                    creed to the purposes of eloquence scarcely less ineffectual.</p>
                <p>But, secondly, there are certain other principles of rhetoric, constituting
                    indeed its essence, which, though they touch the frontier of other mental
                    sciences, are yet sub. Stantially distinct and peculiar. The two subjects of
                    inquiry with which the Philosophy of Eloquence comes most nearly into contact
                    are, on the one hand, Logic, and, on the other, the Philosophy of Poetry. We
                    shall be easily able to distinguish the points at which it branches oft’ from
                    both, if we keep firmly in view the main proposition, that the purpose of
                    eloquence is the production of belief.</p>
                <p>And, first, as to logic. In the first place, this science is conversant about the
                    three discursive operations of the mind, apprehension, judgment, and reasoning,
                    and takes no cognizance of any others. Secondly, logic is strictly “a formal
                    science.” In regard to reasoning, which is its principal object, it guarantees,
                    to use the words of a very distinguished living metaphysician, “neither the
                    premises nor the conclusion, but merely the consequence of the latter from the
                    former.” Of the truth or falsehood of the propositions which form the logician’s
                    premises, his science teaches him absolutely nothing. Here, then, are two
                    barriers, by both of which logic, omnipotent within its own domain, has that
                    domain limited; and beyond each of them lies a wide class of principles
                    essentially affecting human belief. Let us even suppose that the human mind were
                    biassed, in arriving at its conclusions, by no extra-logical operations of its
                    own. Even on this supposition, logical rules would not teach us how to produce
                    belief of any given proposition. For though they would enable us to discover
                    premises from which the required conclusion might be logically inferred, they
                    possess no machinery which would qualify us for judging whether those premises
                    would command the belief of those whom we wished to convince. Logic could
                    neither inform us whether our premises are absolutely true, nor (which is here
                    the real subject of inquiry) whether they are likely to seem true to others.
                    Therefore, even for producing conviction by pure reasoning, the discovery of
                    arguments is a task, and one of unquestionable importance, which logic cannot
                    perform; and if rhetoric, or any other science, undertakes to lay down
                    principles facilitating its execution, we shall do well to examine, at least
                    candidly, its capacity for fulfilling its professions.</p>
                <p>But, in the next place, the mind of man is not so simply constituted, and his
                    position in the system of nature has, as it were, fenced round his rational
                    faculties with those powers which issue in action. The emotions pervade every
                    operation of the mind, as the life-blood circulates through the body: within us
                    and without, in the corporeal world and in the spiritual, in the past, the
                    present, and the future, there is no object of thought which they do not touch,
                    few, very few, which they do not colour and transmute. The argument which, if it
                    could be presented pure to the reasoning faculties, would be fairly weighed, and
                    calmly received or rejected, is sometimes disguised by passion, as completely as
                    a landscape is by clouds, whose stormy piles we mistake for the distant
                    mountains; and in almost every case the conclusion or its proof, or both the one
                    and the other, are seen through a medium more or less hazy, in which they
                    present themselves as the objects of our bodily appetites, or our mental fears
                    and desires, as instruments or hindrances of our affections, kind or malevolent,
                    towards our fellow-men, or as falling under the jurisdiction of that supreme
                    judge and monarch, the moral faculty, which sits enthroned in the inmost
                    recesses of the heart, always able, when accurately informed, to confirm the
                    decisions of reason, but, like other despots, often allowing its power to
                    slumber, and often misled by faithless ministers. If we would command the belief
                    of minds thus variously affected, it is manifest that other principles, besides
                    those of logic, must aid us both in the discovery of arguments, and in their
                    form and arrangement. 1. As to the discovery of arguments, we must always, both
                    for protecting our own minds against error, and for qualifying us to deal with
                    men of cold and unimaginative temper, aim at making ourselves masters of such
                    premises as would probably command the belief of those on whose minds pure
                    reasoning could fall directly, without being turned aside by intervening
                    obstacles. We may always encounter some men whose minds, wdlen directed to
                    certain objects, are more or less nearly in this position. 2. In regard to the
                    same department of our business of conviction, we must endeavour to perform the
                    far more diffi<pb break="no" facs="ht:wu.89119129625&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=212"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0719-0212-0202"/>cult task, of discovering what propositions are
                    likely to be received as truths, by minds affected by all the incongruous
                    influences of imagination, passion, self-love, and ill-instructed conscience.
                    The proof of a proposition from considerations of moral duty may appear weak to
                    a man in whom some strong passion rebels against the principle; but it may yet
                    be possible for us to combat his scepticism by arguments of other kinds, drawing
                    their topics, perhaps, from self-love, or from other passions to which we know
                    him to be subject. 3. The necessity of watching the operations of the active
                    powers of the mind, before we determine on the form and arrangement of
                    arguments, may be sufficiently illustrated for the purpose here in view, by
                    tracing the example last given for one step farther. Our proof of a proposition
                    from ethical principles, although, in the case supposed, it would probably be
                    met by incredulity or ridicule if stated at the outset, may gain a very
                    different reception after we have cut a path for it by arguments addressed to
                    the personal feelings of the auditor. When we have convinced him, that the truth
                    on which we insist is conducive to his interest, and that, if it opposes one of
                    his strongest passions, it is favourable to another, we have prepared his
                    understanding for receiving attentively, and without prejudice, that argument
                    from morality on which the proof of the proposition truly rests.</p>
                <p>Those applications of the principles of eloquence which have been last before us,
                    lead to the consideration of the second question that was proposed as to the
                    connection of this branch of philosophy with others :—what is the relation which
                    eloquence bears to poetry? Both endeavour to arouse the imagination and the
                    feelings; the latter indeed always aiming at this effect, but the former too
                    striving to attain it on those occasions when it puts forth all its strength:
                    what, then, is it that distinguishes the one art from the other? The answer is
                    not hard to find. Both arts, in attempting to excite the fancy and the feelings,
                    are only using means, which each applies to its own peculiar end; and the ends
                    which the two propose to reach are essentially dissimilar. The dissertation on
                    poetry in this work has correctly stated the end of that art to be “the creation
                    of intellectual pleasure we have here considered the end of eloquence to be “the
                    production of belief.” Poetry, like the other fine arts, appeals to the taste;
                    its compositions attain their proper and final result in the pleasure of
                    contemplation; and the truth or falsehood of their representations, and, in
                    short, their agreement or disagreement with all the laws of the mental system,
                    are qualities which enter into our conception of the essence of poetry only so
                    far as they are subservient to that one peculiar result. The mathematician who
                    complained that the Paradise Lost proved nothing, stated accurately the
                    principle which separates poetry from eloquence and science.</p>
                <p>Indeed the principle of distinction, when thus broadly enunciated, is something
                    very like a palpable truism; but it is one of those truths, unfortunately common
                    in the affairs of real life as well as in the field of speculation, which are in
                    theory universally acknowledged, and in practice very frequently forgotten: and
                    no age can more pressingly need to be reminded of this truth than one like our
                    own, in which what is called poetical prose has gained such general favour. We
                    are in constant danger of being led astray by the fact, that eloquence, in
                    addressing itself to cultivated minds (which is the only application of its
                    powers that entitles it to be called an art, or to be investigated either
                    philosophically or critically), does always include the gratification of taste
                    as one of its purposes. We forget that this purpose is altogether a subordinate
                    one, and that, if it ever comes in competition with the proper and principal
                    purpose of the art, it ought to be unhesitatingly sacrificed. The authority of
                    Aristotle will once more support our view, to which indeed his reasoning has
                    conducted us. It is one of the earliest and most valuable propositions in his
                    treatise, that the arguments and other instruments tending to produce belief
                    constitute the essence of eloquence, and that everything else is merely
                    accessory.</p>
                <p>Our review leads us, in the next place, to consider two objections, which are
                    very often urged against the study of the subject. The first of these is chiefly
                    directed against the practical application of eloquence, the second against the
                    science or art which undertakes to expound its laws.</p>
                <p>First, it is said that rhetoric is a dishonest art, which, so far as it is
                    supposed to have any practical uses, is designed to qualify its students for
                    inculcating falsehood as readily as truth. In answering this cavil, we must, if
                    we would not altogether lose sight of the real principle, face boldly the
                    difficulty which it suggests. We cheerfully admit that rhetoric directs the
                    student to search, not for such propositions as are absolutely true, but merely
                    for such as are likely to <hi rend="italic">seem</hi> true to those whom he
                    wishes to convince or persuade. But, in the first place, it does not follow that
                    it directs him to search for falsehoods, or that these are the propositions
                    which will best serve his purpose. The very reverse is the fact. The highest of
                    all authorities on the subject lays it down most justly, as at once an essential
                    principle of human nature, and a warning to the aspirant after eloquence, that
                    mankind have a natural love and predisposition towards truth, and seldom fail in
                    finding it out. Eloquence may doubtless be abused by being applied to wrong
                    purposes; but so may every science, mental and physical, which admits of any
                    practical application at all, with the single exception of the science of
                    morals, which, unlike all other branches of inquiry, has moral good for its
                    object, and, if it has discovered the truths which it seeks, has thereby secured
                    itself against all misuse of its investigations. Eloquence may be used for
                    disseminating falsehood or heresy, as it may be for teaching truth and
                    recommending genuine religion; and the most important discoveries in physics may
                    be turned to purposes of destruction, or made to promote the comfort and
                    happiness of mankind. But, it must be once again repeated, he who attempts to
                    apply this art, or any other which uses for its materials the principles of
                    moral belief, to ends adverse to the cause of truth and morality, will speedily
                    discover that he is misusing his instrument, by the imperfection of the results
                    which he will usually produce. In the second place, however, rhetoric, assuming
                    it to be capable of fulfilling the promise which it holds out, is not merely
                    harmless, but positively beneficial, and is in fact necessary for the protection
                    of truth and goodness. The argumentative writer or speaker, in the legitimate
                    exercise of his art, addressing himself with the view of expounding or proving
                    valuable truths to men in general, who possess but fragmentary knowledge, and
                    are unaccustomed to discussions in scientific form, knows that he cannot
                    convince the understanding, unless he at the same time engages the attention and
                    conciliates the affections; and also that he possesses no media of proof by
                    which he can arouse the discursive faculties of those whom he addresses, except
                    the knowledge and opinions which are already fixed in their minds. A felicitous
                    image presented to the fancy, a gentle dealing with angry passions, an avoidance
                    of collision with a rooted prejudice, may, without the slightest violation of
                    truth or moral rectitude, open the minds of an assembly or a nation to receive
                    with honest conviction a system of knowledge, religious, ethical, or political,
                    which philosophical reasoning or uncompromising dogmatism might have striven for
                    ages to force upon them, and striven in vain. But skill in rhetoric admits of
                    another application. It may and will enable one to detect and expose sophistry
                    and empty declamation. The art does unquestionably aid those who wish to
                    mislead; but it is on <pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:wu.89119129625&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=213" xml:id="kp-eb0719-0213-0203"
                    />that account the more necessary that an instrument so powerful should not be
                    abandoned to dangerous hands. A mischievous boy in a steam-vessel may, by the
                    simple pressure of his foot, cause an explosion that shall destroy the ship’s
                    whole company; but the danger should induce us, instead of undervaluing or
                    discarding this wonderful combination of machinery, to study means which make it
                    difficult or impossible to effect the mischief. This is really the result which
                    such risks of abuse have produced in all the powerful applications of mechanical
                    science; and it is the result which ought to be produced in those far more
                    important cases where the materials of the art are seated in the mind, and the
                    evils which may be derived from them extend over the moral world.</p>
                <p>The second objection frequently taken to the art of rhetoric is, that it is
                    useless. The objectors of this class are not by any means agreed as to the
                    ground on which their allegation is to be defended; but the only section of them
                    whose argument is plausible enough to deserve refutation, are those who, while
                    they admit that practice and the study of models are necessary for the
                    production of eloquent compositions, deny the utility of attempts to investigate
                    the principles of eloquence systematically and philosophically. In this shape
                    the opinion is very far from being uncommon; and, like all other common
                    prejudices, it appears on analysis to contain a mixture of truth along with its
                    errors. The discussion of it will bring us yet nearer to the point which, in all
                    these general observations, it is our wish to reach.</p>
                <p>In the first place, then, the objection, in whatever shape it is put, assumes the
                    fact, of which also the objectors make much use in maintaining their argument,
                    that the laws of eloquence are inherent in every intelligent mind, and are put
                    in daily practice by those who are quite guiltless of rhetorical studies. Now
                    this is the fact which lies at the root of all philosophical discussions on the
                    subject, and of all rules which can be fairly deduced from the investigations.
                    “All men,” says Aristotle, “in some sort practise both dialectics and rhetoric;
                    for all to a certain extent endeavour both to discover arguments and to maintain
                    them, to accuse and to defend. Accordingly, of people in general, some, in the
                    performance of these tasks, obey merely the impulses of their own minds, without
                    having present to their thoughts any rule or general principle; while others
                    avail themselves of all the principles and precepts which they have been able to
                    gather from experience and practice. Now, since the end which men thus speaking
                    have in view, can be reached both in the one way and in the other, it is
                    manifest that both classes must act upon the same principles, and that these,
                    since they at the same time form legitimate subjects of speculation, and are
                    capable of being put to practical uses, may be combined so as to form a system
                    of rules which will be universally admitted to deserve the name of an art.”
                    Those, if there are any such, who go so far as to maintain that the natural
                    powers are sufficient for the production of eloquence without training of any
                    sort, are contradicted by notorious and invariable facts. And those who maintain
                    or conceive that practice and the study of models are in themselves sufficient
                    aids, must be reminded that, so far as their Success exceeds that of the
                    unlearned speaker, it is gained for them by this circumstance, that, whether
                    they are conscious of it or not, they obey more closely than he does those
                    principles which are common to them with him. If we suppose that the practised
                    speaker who decries rhetoric is a perfect orator, he may be safely assured that
                    no sound system of rhetoric which he may condescend to study, will expound to
                    him a single principle which he has not already reduced to practice; and even if
                    we suppose him more moderately skilled in the art, he may be told with equal
                    truth, that the system will not contradict any principle which he has used in
                    practice, and found effectual for his end.</p>
                <p>If, then, a student of eloquence, who declines to listen to a rhetorical
                    exposition of the principles of his art, attempts to justify his refusal by
                    maintaining, as an universal <hi rend="subscript"/> proposition, that, in every
                    art, a systematic acquaintance, with the principles is useless or injurious to
                    one who wishes, to practise it, his assertion, contradicted by common sense and
                    immemorial experience, deserves no serious answer. But if he maintains that this
                    particular art forms an exception to the general rule, and that in regard to it
                    his proposition is true, he will find that the arguments by which his position
                    may be most plausibly supported are two. He may allege, either, first, that the
                    experience of modern Europe has shown rhetorical studies to be useless for the
                    end at which they profess to aim, or, secondly, that rhetoric has failed in
                    furnishing such a systematic view of principles as can be considered either
                    complete or useful. These arguments lead us to consider a difference, to which
                    we have not yet adverted, between the ancient and the modern methods of studying
                    eloquence.</p>
                <p>We have already fully admitted, or rather we have laid it formally down as an
                    element in the view which we take of the subject treated in these pages, that
                    the philosophical principles, or (which in certain respects is the same thing)
                    the preceptive rules, of rhetoric, are not by themselves sufficient even for
                    that negative purpose which, as we have also said, all schemes of mental
                    training have most prominently in view. A critical examination of models in
                    oratory, and the other branches of literature, is an indispensable part of the
                    task which the rhetorical student is bound to perform. Now, of these two
                    divisions, or modes of studying eloquence, the former is emphatically the
                    ancient, and the latter the modem method.</p>
                <p>Aristotle’s treatise is strictly and wholly didactic: his criticisms are short,
                    infrequent, and closely limited to the immediate purpose of explaining his
                    argument; and although he strenuously recommends the study of the historical and
                    other branches of literature as a means of collecting the materials of
                    eloquence, we cannot with certainty gather from any part of his work a distinct
                    advice to the prosecution of these studies, as furnishing models of composition.
                    From the temper of the great philosopher’s mind, it may not be rash to suspect
                    that, even if he had been unfettered in his method of dealing with his subject,
                    he might perhaps have placed a higher value than most men will do on the
                    systematic precepts of the art, and have too much neglected its critical
                    portion; but there are certain reasons which deprive us of the right to infer
                    positively that this was really his view of the matter. His main purpose was the
                    formation of a system of precepts for spoken eloquence, written composition
                    being adverted to but occasionally, and by way of digression; but, down to his
                    time, the only high specimens of spoken oratory were the harangues of his Attic
                    contemporaries; and for him, the tutor of Alexander, and the pensioner of
                    Philip, the orations of Demosthenes (if the best of these were composed before
                    the treatise on rhetoric, which is a doubtful point) were no safe themes of
                    criticism or commendation After Aristotle’s time, it is true, criticism became
                    more prominent in the manuals of eloquence: the best works which remain to us of
                    some of its most renowned teachers, such as Dionysius of Halicarnassus, are
                    purely critical; and in the writings of some others, which are principally
                    preceptive, by far the most valuable portions are critical analyses of literary
                    works, examples of this latter sort being the spirited and refined dissertations
                    of Cicero, the judicious and liberal remarks of Quinctilian, and the severe but
                    often very instructive criticisms of the boy-philosopher Hermogenes. But
                    although criticism grew as the models of excellence accumulated, the tendency to
                    theorize and systematize kept equal pace with its increase; and in the latest
                    and worst days of ancient rhetoric, criticism, which, if not <pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:wu.89119129625&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=214" xml:id="kp-eb0719-0214-0204"
                    />so difficult as philosophical generalization, demands a wider union of powers
                    and knowledge, died entirely away, leaving the rhetorical systems as bare of the
                    highest kind of illustration as Aristotle’s work, while they were a thousand
                    times more complicated in the rules which they expounded.</p>
                <p>Since the revival of learning, men seem in general to have derived their opinions
                    as to the real nature and value of the ancient rhetoric, not so much from the
                    works of Aristotle, or even those of Cicero, Quinctilian, and Hermogenes, as
                    from treatises like the curious rhetorical dialogue of Alcuin with Charlemagne,
                    a production which, with its burdensome, wearisome, and useless subdivisions,
                    its odd, impossible, and unpractical examples, and its confident claims to
                    infallibility, is a fair specimen, but by no means one of the worst, of those
                    treatises which fill the collection of the Rhetores Latini, and the separate
                    volumes of such men as Theon, Aphthonius, and the other Greek rhetoricians of
                    the declining ages. We have consequently, in modern times, run into the opposite
                    extreme; and, as we have already admitted, the prevalent tendency has long been
                    to deny that the systematic rules are of any use whatever. The writings of a few
                    very able men have been insufficient to stem the current, although the list of
                    rhetorical writers includes Bacon in our own country, and Fenelon in France.</p>
                <p>But we must return to the two arguments against rhetorical studies, from which we
                    have diverged in order to collect materials for answering them; and, first, as
                    to the objection from the supposed experience of modern times. In the first
                    place, it will surely be confessed that there is an antecedent presumption
                    against the supposition that the study of principles is unnecessary; and, in the
                    next place, any appeal to the success of modern oratory or prose literature in
                    general, in proof that certain methods are useless which the ancients practised
                    and the moderns do not, would require to be accompanied by an assertion,—which,
                    if we are competently informed, we shall scarcely venture to make,— that in
                    excellence of composition, taken in its highest sense, modern oratory and prose
                    literature are not inferior to those of the ancients. But, further, we must also
                    recollect that the study of models is in itself a study of principles, if it be
                    conducted with intelligence, or so as to serve any good purpose whatever; for he
                    who adopts this mode of study to the exclusion of the other, is just playing the
                    part of a traveller, who, undertaking a journey on foot through a difficult
                    country, begins by throwing his map into the fire, and resolves to trust to the
                    guidance of chance passengers. We are, indeed, strongly inclined to hold one
                    doctrine, which, if it be sound, would compel us to believe that the immediate
                    study of the principles is far more necessary in modern times than it ever could
                    have been in the ancient world. We believe that, for the attainment of a certain
                    degree of success, this study may be much more safely dispensed with by the
                    public speaker than by the author who gives his thoughts to the world in books.
                    The former is, in the delivery of his harangues, instituting per force a series
                    of experiments, from which, doubtless at the expense of many a mortifying
                    failure, he must, if he possesses natural powers capable of producing cloquence
                    in any circumstances, at length learn, or approach to learning, both the
                    principles of eloquence, and its most useful practical rules. The author almost
                    wholly wants this aid. His experiments, if they are to be called so, are usually
                    few, and he has but the most imperfect means of judging what has been their
                    issue; for the success or failure of a book is dependent on so many
                    circumstances, that it can seldom enable the writer to determine how far it has
                    been owing to his success or failure in the great end of composition. But,
                    lastly on this head, a late writer, Whately, has thrown out a hint which has in
                    it much truth as well as ingenuity. He remarks that, after all, the modern
                    disavowal of rhetorical studies may not be strictly consistent with truth. The
                    suspicion of rhetorical artifice, he says, creates such distrust that every one
                    is eager to disclaim it, and none more so than those who have availed themselves
                    of it most widely and successfully. The ancients were freed from the necessity
                    of this venial duplicity by the peculiar nature of their education, in which,
                    under the name of rhetorical training, were included all the branches of
                    learning requisite for the accomplishment of a man qualified to shine in
                    political life. The Greek rhetorician taught his pupil the principles of
                    politics, legislation, and every department of general knowledge; and the pupil,
                    when he had taken his place in the nation as a public man, was called an orator
                    <hi rend="italic">(p⅙riuD</hi> and not, as we should now call him, a statesman.
                    No man required to conceal his having studied the subsidiary sciences; or rather
                    every one wished to have it believed that he was familiar with them; and his
                    skill in rhetoric proper escaped notice in the general muster. The dissimilar
                    position of the ancients is further illustrated by a second consideration, which
                    is commented on for a different purpose by another writer of high authority,
                    namely, that the Greek orators seem always to have had in view the communication
                    of an aesthetical pleasure to their hearers, as an end scarcely subordinate even
                    to the principal one of moving their minds to belief and action. An assembly
                    which did not listen to Demosthenes with the less admiration, nor with the less
                    disposition to be convinced by his argument, for knowing that he had devoted
                    months to the preparation of his speech, and who recognised in some of its most
                    impassioned appeals whole paragraphs which they had heard him pronounce before,
                    were not likely to be staggered by reflecting that the speaker had long studied
                    oratory under Isocrates.</p>
                <p>But the second objection, levelled against the preceptive section of rhetoric,
                    asserts that every system of the kind is incomplete, and therefore useless. The
                    allegation of incompleteness is perfectly true; but it does not warrant the
                    inference. No rational inquirer into rhetorical principleshas ever pretended to
                    have fully explored all the regions of mind over which eloquence holds its
                    empire; indeed, in entering on such investigations, as far as they involve
                    simply matters of fact and experience, he is encroaching on the province of
                    other branches of the mental philosophy, and abandoning that of rhetoric, which,
                    receiving its facts from without, busies itself properly in determining the
                    relation which the facts bear to a certain end. Neither from ordinary and
                    unscientific observation, nor from the systematic inquiries of philosophy, do we
                    yet know nearly all that may be learned as to the principles of the mental
                    economy; and, moreover, when psychology and its kindred sciences shall have
                    reached their utmost development, they will still find their province to be
                    surrounded on all sides by a darkness which created intellect cannot penetrate.
                    But those who have studied the philosophy of mind most practically and most
                    profoundly, are also those who can bear the most decided testimony to the fact,
                    that the incompleteness of its results does not deprive it either of interest or
                    usefulness. The same thing is even more palpably true of this particular branch
                    of inquiry, in which every experiment is instituted with a direct view to a
                    certain practical end.</p>
                <p>The avowed incompleteness, however, not merely of all existing, but of all
                    possible, rhetorical systems, not only forms no valid ground for denying their
                    usefulness, but may suggest very strong positive arguments in their favour.
                    Those rhetorical rules which are really sound and useful do not mark out, like
                    guide-posts inscribed with the penalties of a turnpike statute, one fixed road
                    in which they tell the student of eloquence that he must travel, although there
                    are other roads which will equally well lead him to his journey’s end: the most
                    important and certain <pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:wu.89119129625&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=215" xml:id="kp-eb0719-0215-0205"
                    />of them, indeed, are not even directions which indicate to him the best road
                    in which to travel; but they are peremptory warnings, set up at certain places
                    to inform him, that the cross-roads which at these points diverge from the
                    highway, will lead him quite astray if he shall be tempted to strike into them.
                    Now, it so happens that rhetoric would completely attain this its purpose of
                    protecting us against error, if, discarding all special rules, it were simply to
                    hold up to view, at all points suspected of being the commencement of
                    bewildering paths, a statement of its own fundamental and ruling principle, and
                    of two or three of the most obvious corollaries which the principle involves. If
                    the student of eloquence has been enabled, no matter by what means, firmly to
                    apprehend and retain these essential truths, he has made an acquisition which is
                    more valuable than any other connected with his art.</p>
                <p>To the apprehension of those truths we have here endeavoured to aid in leading
                    him. The aim of all composition not poetical being the Production of Belief, the
                    great task of the speaker or writer should be the study of the character of
                    those whom he addresses, or, in other words, the study of human nature, in all
                    its regions, if possible, but at any rate in those with whose peculiarities his
                    purpose is most likely to bring him into collision. This study must be
                    prosecuted both in the closet and in the world, by reflection as well as by
                    study and observation. In those departments of it which bear reference to human
                    nature in the abstract, the hints of some writers on eloquence may aid a little,
                    and metaphysical studies greatly more; but even in this field the investigation
                    of the recluse will often be barren; and for the infinitely more varied and
                    interesting study of individual character, the aspirant after literary or
                    oratorical fame must repair to the crowded scenes of active life. But the
                    knowledge with which study so conducted will store and fortify the mind, must be
                    applied by the mind, in its constant meditations, to the special purpose of
                    enabling us to accommodate our discourse both to the intellect, the imagination,
                    and the feelings, the temper and prejudices, the state and amount of knowledge,
                    and, in short, to the whole character, of our readers or hearers. There are some
                    minds endowed with vigorous understanding, active imagination, and deep and
                    varied sensibilities, in which much of this knowledge seems to be almost
                    instinctive; the possessors of such minds are men of genius, and eloquent almost
                    as soon as experience has enabled them to overcome preliminary and practical
                    difficulties; and it is only from minds thus naturally full and strong that
                    eloquence of the highest class will ever issue. Even genius, however, is a light
                    that too often leads astray; and the highest genius has always been the most
                    warm in its gratitude to philosophy for stretching out her hand to lead it back
                    to truth and nature. But there are innumerable and endless degrees and kinds of
                    intellect, all below the highest, all imperfectly fitted for the tasks of
                    conviction and persuasion, all requiring aid from without, all capable of
                    receiving and profiting by such aid, and all more or less deficient in <hi
                    rend="italic">a</hi> distinct apprehension of the true aim of eloquence. In
                    eloquence, as in morality, every class of minds is liable in its own way to
                    forget and abandon the right path. The man of strong intellect and firm will
                    degenerates into dogmatism, and reasons with his fellow-men in the same spirit
                    in which the Jews built the second temple, where every man worked with one hand,
                    and with the other hand held a weapon. If, in the common intercourse of society,
                    we refuse to humour the characters of those around us, we shall receive our
                    reward in the loss of confidence and love; if, when we reason with or endeavour
                    to instruct them, we refuse to make a similar allowance for those principles in
                    their minds on which we seek to operate, the result will be that we shall leave
                    them careless, uninformed, and unconvinced.</p>
                <p>On the other hand, the man of fancy and warm feelings soars into the fairy-land
                    of poetry; amidst clouds of imagery and tempests of passion his hearers catch
                    but the faintest glimpse of the truth which he designed to unfold; and a
                    weighing of proofs or a comprehension of explanations are things altogether out
                    of the question. The poet and the dogmatist are equally distant from genuine
                    eloquence; and both equally forget, that he who wishes to convince others of a
                    truth should aim principally at discovering, not in what aspect the assertion
                    and its proofs present themselves to his own mind, but in what light they are
                    likely to be view ed by those to whom he is about to communicate them.</p>
                <p>II.</p>
                <p>Rhetoric, though etymologically referring only to spoken eloquence, was, even by
                    the ancients, considered as fairly and necessarily embracing written composition
                    likewise; and in modern times, in which the press discharges so many of the
                    functions which the public speaker of old exercised in his own person, the
                    extension is quite indispensable. In the widest acceptation, then, Rhetoric is
                    the art of Composition in Prose. However, even in treatises far more detailed
                    than the present, it has been found convenient to limit the subject to
                    Argumentative Composition; and accordingly this view will be taken in the
                    illustrations now to be offered. One who has accurately studied the philosophy
                    and practice of Rhetorical Argument, will have little to learn when he turns to
                    other branches of composition.</p>
                <p>It will be advisable to adopt, with only an immaterial deviation from the order,
                    the division of the subject which is laid down in the treatise of Aristotle;
                    according to which the rules of Rhetoric will be treated in three sections; the
                    first embracing the principles on which Belief must be produced by rhetorical
                    composition; the second treating very briefly of the Disposition or Arrangement
                    of the Parts of an argumentative discourse; and the third entering on the
                    examination of the principles of Style.</p>
                <p>It is laid down by Aristotle, as the foundation of the rhetorical art, that the
                    Belief which it is the purpose of elo-</p>
                <p>quence to produce, flows, so far as it is produced by the discourse, from one or
                    another of three causes, and from no others. Either, first, the conclusion has
                    been proved, or seems, to those to whom it is addressed, to have been proved, by
                    arguments directly appealing to the understanding; or, secondly, the discourse
                    has created a bias in favour of the writer or speaker, which makes the
                    conclusion be received on the authority of his assertion; or, thirdly, the
                    discourse has excited in the minds of the hearers or readers other feelings
                    (besides those favourable to the speaker or writer), by which the understanding
                    is in the same way biassed. These in their order will now engage our
                    attention.</p>
                <p>Under the first head we are invited to examine the principles which should direct
                    us in the Discovery of Arguments, and in their Arrangement.</p>
                <p/>
                <p>And, first, as to the Discovery of Arguments. For assisting the writer or speaker
                    in this task, the ancient rhetori-cians offered means of two kinds. The one was
                    a Classification of Arguments into their different kinds, with illustra-tive
                    hints as to the proper uses of each. The second was, the amassing of a
                    collection of Topics or Common-places, of which some were arguments that
                    admitted of being applied in any question of moral reasoning; while others,
                    although not so widely available, were so for all questions embraced under the
                    particular department of oratory in which they were classed.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="ht:wu.89119129625&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=216"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0719-0216-0206"/>
                <p>In modem times the use of common-places has been universally decried, as a mere
                    device for qualifying a man to speak or write fluently on subjects of which he
                    is utterly ignorant; and if all objections to the art were as well founded as
                    this, it would be truly a waste of time to study it. The invention was well
                    suited for enabling a subtile and flowery declaimer, like the sophist Gorgias
                    <hi rend="subscript">1</hi> to justify his famous boast, that he could speak
                    extempore on any given question; but the systematic use of these storehouses of
                    universal topics was utterly preposterous in the business of real life. “Such
                    discourse,” says Blair, with great truth, “could be no other than trivial. What
                    is truly solid and persuasive must be drawn <hi rend="italic">ex visccribus
                    causae,</hi> from a thorough knowledge of the subject, and profound meditation
                    on it. They who would direct students of oratory to any other sources of
                    argumentation, only delude them; and, by attempting to render rhetoric too
                    perfect an art, they render it in truth a trifling and childish study.” If we
                    thought the ancient Topics really worthy of defence, we would not be deterred
                    from defending them, either by this grave reasoning, or by the recollection of
                    Corporal Trim’s extemporaneous oration on the white bear; but the rebuke of the
                    critic, and the ridicule of the wit, are both well deserved. And yet in this, as
                    in most other errors, we detect merely the misapplication of a truth. For the
                    invention of the Topics is founded on a consideration of the common principles
                    and relations of matters of reasoning in general, and of those matters which are
                    embraced under each particular division of knowledge; and it is manifest that
                    reflection on such general truths as these, although it should not be applied as
                    those ancient sophists applied it, is in itself not merely an unobjectionable,
                    but a positively useful and necessary duty, for those who wish either to write
                    well or to think rightly. Even as to the practical use of commonplaces, no one
                    who has been accustomed to hear practised public speakers can have failed to
                    remark, that most of them tall more or less into the repetition of set phrases
                    and ideas, which are as truly common-places as if they had been learned by rote
                    from Boethius or Fortunatianus: and in the oratory of the bar, where
                    extemporaneous fluency is indispensable, the systematic use of common-places is
                    to some extent both advantageous and ordinary. For written compositions
                    common-places are unnecessary and absurd; and we are not much encouraged to
                    their adoption by the example of Cicero, who, having sent to Atticus a treatise
                    prefaced by an eloquent introduction, was reminded by his friend that he had
                    already used the passage as the prooemium of another work.</p>
                <p>Knowledge of the subject of the composition, and meditation on its facts and
                    principles, must, as our authority just cited has told us, be substituted for
                    treasuries of commonplaces; and no one has insisted on the necessity of such
                    studies more strenuously than Aristotle, who, although he wrote with the view of
                    aiding public speakers, and therefore, both in his Rhetoric and his Topics,
                    collected those common-places which he considered most useful, yet broadly and
                    repeatedly lays down the doctrine of their total insufficiency as the principal
                    source of the orator’s materials. One chapter of the Rhetoric contains as much
                    practical sense on this subject as might satisfy the most determined of modern
                    utilitarians; and we cannot do better than dismiss the topics by stating its
                    substance, which, although addressed immediately to the case of public speaking,
                    possesses much value even with regard to purely literary compositions. It has
                    been observed, says he, that, for plebeian assemblies, unlearned men are by far
                    the most persuasive orators. And why is this? Simply because they state the
                    particular facts from which they themselves have drawn their inferences, and
                    which the audience know and are qualified to comprehend; while instructed men,
                    addressing the same hearers, puzzle and repel them by enunciating universal
                    truths. This remark is followed by four advices to the orator. First, he is
                    warmly urged to the anxious study of his subject, as in every view essential to
                    his success. Secondly, the advice is enforced by reminding him, that the more
                    facts he knows as to the matter to be handled, the better chance has he of
                    discovering among them some argument which will prove convincing. Thirdly, he is
                    warned that the general rule of oratory which directs the speaker to study and
                    condescend to the characters of his hearers, must be specially applied, so far
                    as his means of knowledge allow him, to the particular persons whom he happens
                    to address. Fourthly, he is cautioned not to shun the statement of common and
                    well-known facts, but rather to consider these as the great magazine of his
                    arguments.</p>
                <p>The second sort of aid which the ancient rhetoricians held out for the Discovery
                    of Arguments, namely, that which results from a Classification of their Kinds,
                    is as truly sound and valuable as the other sort is the reverse. It has,
                    however, met with little more favour in the eyes of the moderns; but in our own
                    times, one of the ablest writers on rhetoric has adopted Aristotle’s division of
                    arguments, analysing it satisfactorily, and increasing its utility by several
                    excellent supplements of his own. All that follows on this part of the subject
                    may be considered as either suggested by Aristotle and Whately, or in substance
                    directly borrowed from them, except a few incidental remarks and
                    illustrations.</p>
                <p>It must be premised, however, that in every thing to be said on this head,
                    reference is made solely to moral truths, as the conclusions sought to be
                    established in argument. All reasoning is of course ultimately founded on
                    admitted truths, and such reasoning as will serve the orator’s purpose must be
                    founded on truths admitted by those whom he addresses. Necessary truths,
                    constituting the first principles of the mathematical sciences, can scarcely
                    ever enter into rhetorical consideration in any shape, and may be safely left
                    out of view altogether. Contingent truths, composing the other great class of
                    ultimate principles, and embracing truths moral and physical, compose the great
                    quarry of materials for human thought and reasoning; the latter class, however,
                    occupying, in most applications of rhetorical principles, a place comparatively
                    subordinate.</p>
                <p>With regard to the Division of Arguments, then, it is to be observed, in the
                    first place, that the division which aids the rhetorical student, is one neither
                    founded on differences in the mode of stating them (as syllogistic,
                    unsyllogis-tic, or the like), nor on differences in their subject (as moral or
                    necessary), nor on differences in the purpose of using them (as direct or
                    indirect, probative or refutative arguments). That which is here useful is a
                    division of arguments <hi rend="italic">as such.</hi> Upon this principle
                    Aristotle may be understood as dividing all arguments in moral reasoning into
                    three kinds; what he calls the uz⅛s (literally, Proof of Probability); the Sign
                    or Symptom ( <hi rend="italic">βr</hi><hi rend="italic">∣</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >μttw);</hi> and the Example <hi rend="italic">f-a^Mtιγ</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >∣</hi><hi rend="italic">ιa).</hi> Whately first divides all arguments into Two
                    Classes, the first consisting of “such as might have been employed to <hi
                    rend="italic">account for</hi> the fact or principle maintained, supposing its
                    truth granted ;” the second, of “such as could <hi rend="italic">not</hi> be so
                    employed.” The former class he considers to be the <hi rend="italic">unira</hi>
                    of Aristotle, and terms them Arguments α <hi rend="italic">priori,</hi> or
                    Arguments from Antecedent Probability. Those of the second class he considers as
                    all referable to Aristotle’s two classes of Signs and Examples.</p>
                <p>The f∕xJ{, or Argument <hi rend="italic">a priori,</hi> is an argument from cause
                    to effect, these words being understood in the popular and ordinary sense. The
                    conviction which it bears evidently admits of innumerable degrees of strength,
                    from the faintest shadow of likelihood to complete moral certainty. The shades
                    of distinction cannot be marked by appropriate terms, either in the language of
                    common life or in that of <pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:wu.89119129625&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=217" xml:id="kp-eb0719-0217-0207"
                    />philosophy; both because they run into each other imperceptibly at every point
                    of the progression, and because the same proof, perhaps, does not appear to any
                    two minds as involving exactly the same strength of evidence. Nevertheless there
                    are in popular language some distinguishing words, of which rhetoric may
                    advantageously avail itself. The two most ordinary and useful of these are,
                    Plausibility and Probability, both of them wide words, but each marked in common
                    use by its own essential and distinctive character. Probability, indeed, in the
                    philosophical and proper sense, embraces all the degrees of moral evidence; but
                    in the popular meaning here adverted to, it imports a degree of evidence higher
                    than that of plausibility. Plausibility is a faint degree of likelihood, whose
                    essence Campbell, quite accurately as it should seem, has analysed thus. The
                    hearer considers an argument as plausible which does not contradict his own
                    experience, or that system of general truths which, more or less extensive in
                    different minds, has been collected by every mind from particular facts
                    remembered. If the argument goes farther than this point, it loses the character
                    of plausibility, and acquires a higher rank, passing, in ordinary language, into
                    the class of probabilities; if it falls short, by contradicting any of our
                    habitual conclusions, it is less than plausible, and utterly worthless towards
                    effecting conviction. The only objection to the term plausibility arises from
                    this; that, on account of ordinary associations, it suggests to most minds an
                    unfavourable impression, which does not necessarily or properly belong to the
                    species of evidence it is here used to designate; for, although a plausible
                    proof must never be taken for more than it is worth, it may often do infinite
                    service in preparing the way for others more convincing. Campbell has proposed
                    to substitute for it the word verisimilitude, but his advice has not been
                    followed. It has been observed by the same writer, that this quality of a
                    non-contradiction of experience, is the essential condition of what in poetical
                    invention is called truth to nature. We pronounce the characters in a poem to be
                    well sustained if the acts ascribed to them are similar to those which we have
                    seen such men perform in such circumstances; and as the poet undertakes to prove
                    nothing, we rest in the intellectual pleasure which the invention affords us. If
                    a similar picture of character in action is laid before us, as a step towards
                    convincing us that a certain act has really been done, we try the representation
                    by the former test; but then, if the argument holds good to the extent to which
                    it professes to go, we retain our conviction of this faint antecedent
                    probability, as an element to aid us in judging of the sufficiency of other
                    proofs, if such shall afterwards be adduced. Arguments <hi rend="italic">a
                    priori</hi> which deserve the name of probable, go farther than this, and rise
                    gradually till they operate complete conviction. “As far as any cause, popularly
                    speaking, has a tendency to produce a certain effect, so far its existence is an
                    argument for that of the effect-If the cause be fully su <hi rend="italic"
                    >fficient,</hi> and no <hi rend="italic">impediments</hi> intervene, the effect
                    in question follows certainly; and the nearer we approach to this, the stronger
                    the argument.”</p>
                <p>The class of Signs forms a very large numerical proportion of our materials in
                    argumentative composition. It is satisfactorily analysed by Whately, whom we
                    here follow closely in all our observations on it, venturing only on one point a
                    silent dissent. “As far as any circumstance is what may be called a <hi
                    rend="italic">condition</hi> of the existence of a certain effect or phenomenon,
                    so far it may be inferred from the existence of that effect; if it be a
                    condition absolutely essential, the argument is of course demonstrative; and the
                    probability is the stronger in proportion as we approach to that case. Of this
                    kind are the following arguments. A man is suspected as the perpetrator of a
                    murder, from the circumstance of his clothes being bloody; the murder being
                    considered as, in a certain degree, a probable <hi rend="italic">condition</hi>
                    of that appearance; that is, it is presumed that his clothes would not <hi
                    rend="italic">otherwise</hi> have been bloody. Again, from the appearance of
                    ice, we infer decidedly the existence of a temperature below the freezing point;
                    that temperature being an essential <hi rend="italic">condition</hi> of the
                    crystallization of water.”</p>
                <p>Arguments which infer effect from cause having been ranked as our first branch,
                    and examples, the third branch, being, as we shall immediately discover,
                    incapable by themselves of leading to absolute moral conviction,—the class of
                    signs must include both those proofs which from an admitted phenomenon infer its
                    cause, and those which from the same datum infer a condition which is not the
                    cause. And, first, as to those arguments which prove the existence of causes by
                    that of their effects, it must be specially observed, that the cause “is never
                    so proved <hi rend="italic">so far forth as</hi> it is a <hi rend="italic"
                    >cause,</hi> but so far forth as it is a <hi rend="italic">condition,</hi> or
                    necessary circumstance.” This is far from being so shadowy a distinction as
                    might be supposed; it enters radically into the mode in which the mind is
                    affected by the different methods of using causes and effects to prove each
                    other. The proposition as it is here maintained, without involving, or tempting
                    us to institute, any inroad into the debateable land of the philosophy of
                    causation, is simply this: that my conviction of the existence of a fact, from
                    my knowledge of another fact which is its effect, is exactly the same kind of
                    conviction as I should derive of the same truth from my knowledge of any fact
                    which was not an effect, but a simple condition, or other concomitant; any
                    difference in the strength of evidence in particular cases depends solely on the
                    circumstances, and, as these vary, the one kind of proof may now be the
                    stronger, and now the other. From the fact that Moscow was burned in the month
                    of September 1812, we infer the existence of the city in the preceding month,
                    because that previous existence, although no cause of the conflagration, in any
                    sense of the word, is a condition, but for which the catastrophe could not have
                    taken place; and as the previous existence is a necessary condition, the
                    conviction which the inference gives amounts to complete moral certainty; but,
                    from the same fact, as it is now stated, we can draw, as to the causes of it, no
                    inferences whatever that amount to more than the weakest of all plausibilities,
                    being just an enumeration of causes, by any of which it is possible the event
                    may have been produced, though, with regard to most of them, we cannot pronounce
                    any one to be more probable than the rest. On the other hand, if, when we have
                    perused the writings of an author, our feelings and our critical judgment agree
                    in declaring them to possess high and genuine eloquence, we infer at once the
                    genius of the writer (the cause, or one of the concurring causes, of the
                    excellence), and our inference is one of positive certainty, because we know
                    genius to be a necessary condition, without which the work could not have
                    possessed the merit it does: while, in the same case, on this naked enunciation
                    of it, our inferences as to many of those conditions of the excellence, which
                    are not in any sense causes, must be founded on plausibilities as weak as those
                    described under the last example.</p>
                <p>Of Signs, then, many are not causes. It is needless to illustrate this species of
                    signs further by individual examples; but it is important to observe, that some
                    general classes of, arguments fall under this second division of signs. Of this
                    sort is the Argument from Testimony, to which, if we were to embrace in our view
                    any besides moral truths, we should have to add the argument from Calculation of
                    Chances, on which so much rests in the science of natural theology. Both of
                    these arguments are signs from which we infer conditions that are not causes.
                    The argument from testimony has been thus analysed. “The premise is the
                    existence of the testimony; the conclusion, the truth of what is attested; which
                    is considered as a <hi rend="italic">condition</hi> of the testimony having been
                    given; since it is evident, that so far only as this is allowed (i. e. so far
                    only as it is allowed that the testimony would not have been given had it not
                    been true)</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="ht:wu.89119129625&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=218"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0719-0218-0208"/>
                <p>can this argument have any force.” The testimony of the inspired writers is
                    before us, declaring the truth of the Bible history; we believe in the truth
                    thus testified, because,— assuming that we have examined the antecedent steps of
                    the argument, and have reached the point at which the argument from testimony
                    comes in unmixed,—we believe the witnesses, or, in other words, we are convinced
                    that, but for the truth of their testimony (its condition), it would not have
                    been given. On this head we must content ourselves with simply urging the study
                    of one of the most deeply important inquiries connected with the argument,
                    namely, the genuine test of concurrent testimonies. The subject is ably treated
                    both by Campbell and Whately, and the former writer thus states the principle.
                    “In a number of concurrent testimonies (in cases wherein there could have been
                    no previous concert), there is a probability <hi rend="italic">distinct</hi>
                    from that which may be termed the sum of the probabilities resulting from the
                    testimonies of the witnesses,—a probability which would remain, even though the
                    witnesses were of such a character as to merit no faith at all. This probability
                    arises purely <hi rend="italic">from the concurrence itself.</hi> That such a
                    concurrence should spring from chance, is as one to infinitude; that is, in
                    other words, morally impossible. If, therefore, concert be excluded, there
                    remains no other supposition but the reality of the fact.”</p>
                <p>We now pass to the third and last kind of Arguments, those from Example, which
                    Whately analyses thus. In all the arguments designated by this name, “we
                    consider one or more <hi rend="italic">known</hi> individual objects, or
                    instances of a certain class, as fair <hi rend="italic">specimens,</hi> in
                    respect of some point or other, of that class; and consequently draw an
                    inference from them respecting either the whole class, or other <hi
                    rend="italic">less known</hi> individuads of it. In arguments of this kind,
                    then, it will be found, that, universally, we assume as a major premise, that
                    what is true (in regard to the point in question) of the individual or
                    individuals which we bring forward and appeal to, is true of the whole class to
                    which they belong: the minor premise next asserts something of that individual;
                    and the same is then inferred respecting the whole class; whether we stop at
                    that general conclusion, or descend from thence to another unknown individual;
                    in which last case, which is the most usually called the argument from example,
                    we generally omit, for the sake of brevity, the intermediate step, and pass at
                    once, in the expression of the arguments, from the known to the unknown
                    individual.” These principles apply not only to the common argument from
                    Example, but to those from Induction, Experience, Analogy, and the like.</p>
                <p>The easiest way of discovering the real force of this class of arguments for
                    direct conviction, is (for those at least who are not wilfully resolved on
                    creating difficulties for themselves) to examine its relation to the principles
                    of logic. Both the Argument from Antecedent Probability and the Argument from
                    Signs are strictly logical; or, in other words, they can be so stated that their
                    form will of itself show whether the conclusion is legitimate or not; for, in
                    order to reduce arguments of these kinds to formal syllogisms, we have only to
                    restore the premise suppressed in ordinary discourse, and to limit in such a way
                    the expression of both premises, that the degree of probability may distinctly
                    appear in each, and may thence pass regularly into the conclusion. If the
                    premises are certain, the conclusion will be so likewise; if that element is
                    wanting, the conclusion will only reach one or another of the infinite degrees
                    of probability. Now, on the other hand, the Argument from Example, in all its
                    varied shapes, is always one which will not stand the test of transformation
                    into a logical shape. We may comprehend this most readily in the case of a
                    rhetorical Induction, which, assuming Whately’s analysis as our guide, is an
                    argument stopping short at the general conclusion from the premises, without
                    going on to the last step, which infers as to the unknown individual. The
                    process thus performed corresponds with what most logicians call an Imperfect
                    Induction, which is truly no logical induction at all, but merely something
                    wearing the appearance of it-The logical induction (to borrow again from a high
                    metaphysical authority already cited) is governed by the rule, “That what
                    belongs (or does not belong) to <hi rend="italic">all</hi> the constituent
                    parts, belongs (or does not belong) to the constituted whole.” The imperfect or
                    rhetorical induction assumes, that what belongs (or does not belong) to <hi
                    rend="italic">some</hi> of the constituent parts, belongs (or does not belong)
                    to the constituted whole. This conclusion may or may not be true in the
                    particular case, but it is always illogical.</p>
                <p>There is a pressing reason for urging the importance of this view of the subject.
                    In matters of moral reasoning, the argument from example is oftener misused than
                    any other, and is altogether a very dangerous one in unskilful hands, the
                    mischief sometimes falling on him who uses it, and sometimes on those to whom it
                    is addressed. We are apt to be widely misled by the analogies of physical
                    science, which give the name of induction to arguments in which an inference is
                    drawn respecting a whole class from experiments on a few individuals, or even
                    from one solitary experiment. If this experiment has been cautiously and
                    un-objectionably made, so as to insure the essential point, that the individual
                    is truly an adequate specimen of the class, the inference is sound and the
                    induction valid. The process of reasoning, in short, sets out from a number of
                    silent assumptions, and it is worthless if any one of these has been
                    unwarranted. The history of the material sciences abounds with instances of the
                    most grievous errors which have arisen from such assumptions of false data; and
                    this notwithstanding the facilities generally existing there for decisive
                    experiments, by which the philosopher may place the subjects of his inquiries
                    almost in any circumstances he will. In moral science we can scarcely ever
                    experiment at all; we are confined to the task of watching the phenomena which
                    the course of nature evolves, and of drawing our conclusions from facts as to
                    which we are often exceedingly in doubt whether we may not have misapprehended
                    their real nature and causes. “The <hi rend="italic">experimentum crucis”</hi>
                    says Playfair, in his Preliminary Dissertation to this work, “is of such weight
                    in matters of induction, that in all those branches of science where it cannot
                    easily be resorted to (the circumstances of an experiment being out of our
                    power, and incapable of being varied at pleasure), there is often a great want
                    of conclusive evidence.......Men deceive themselves continually, and think they
                    are reasoning from fact and experience, when in reality they are only reasoning
                    from a mixture of truth and falsehood.” I learn from a few experiments that
                    certain acids act on certain other bodies as solvents; and the inferences are
                    correct, not because they are logically drawn, but because all the assumptions
                    on which they proceed have been tested by observation, and discovered to be well
                    founded. Afterwards, turning to subjects of moral reasoning, I infer that all
                    political revolutions are accompanied by wars and bloodshed, because I know that
                    such evils attended the French Revolution of the eighteenth century, and that
                    which took place in England in the first half of the seventeenth. The
                    conclusion, as every one will tell me, is false; but it is also logically
                    inconsequent; for the reasoning has silently assumed as true an infinite number
                    of principles, all of which are essential to its validity, and many of which are
                    utterly destitute of truth and probability.</p>
                <p>The principles to which it has been here attempted to invite the student’s
                    notice, are convincingly illustrated by Campbell, in his analysis of arguments
                    from experience. The evidence of Analogy, as the same writer observes, “is but a
                    more indirect experience, founded on some remote similitude ;” and its force is
                    always small, requiring indeed <pb break="no"

                    />a very unusual accumulation of comparisons before it can ' be relied on for
                    any further purpose in argument than that which it has often served so well,
                    namely, the repelling of captious refutations. In this kind of argument, quite
                    as strictly as in any other instance of example, the things compared are
                    assumed, in regard to the point of comparison, to belong to the same genus; but
                    there is evidently here a still greater risk than that which prevails in other
                    reasonings of the same class, of either over-estimating or underestimating the
                    weight of the evidence. The generic and specific names in common use alternately
                    involve us in mistakes and help to extricate us from them. All of these are
                    accurate for their own purposes; but the purpose for which we use the example
                    may, though quite legitimate, be extremely different from that which has
                    dictated the common divisions. If, taking any number of men, who form a class in
                    respect of social or civil relations,—a nation, a civic community, or even a
                    large household,—we discover a certain physical peculiarity in one individual,
                    and thence, without examination, infer it of another,—we are arguing, not from
                    similarity, but from one of the remotest and most worthless of all analogies; an
                    analogy founded, not on any of those qualities of the individuals which came
                    into view in their classification, but on one which merely happens to belong to
                    one of them, and possibly or probably may not be found in any other, being, in
                    short, what logicians would call an inseparable accident. On the other hand,
                    direct and close similarities may be continually discovered between individuals
                    which have in ordinary language no common name, and which could not be classed
                    together for any of the practical purposes of life. Amidst the countless variety
                    of natures and ends which divides the universe into such an interminable number
                    of classes, genera, and species, all the individuals arc united by at least one
                    common relation, that which the created bear to the Creator; and when we
                    endeavour to contemplate the world in its position towards God, we discover near
                    and essential resemblances between the highest sentient beings and the most
                    insignificant atoms of matter,—between the spirit of the archangel and the
                    trodden grain of sand.</p>
                <p>In estimating the force of Arguments from Example, our great task should always
                    be, to discover the principle of the division which the reasoning assumes. Ifwe
                    clearly apprehend the principle, and keep it steadily in view, we shall be able
                    to steer safely through all the perplexities of individual cases. When the
                    alleged point of similarity makes up the whole essence of the genus, the pioof,
                    supposing the genus really to exist, is morally certain: when it appears on
                    analysis to be only a separable accident of an individual, the proof is a
                    worthless analogy. Between these two extreme points lies the wide channel
                    through whose shoals the principle will always be able to pilot us.</p>
                <p>In regard to the Comparative Efficiency and the Proper Order of the several kinds
                    of arguments, as indeed in regard to every other point essential to the
                    rhetorical art, Aristotle will furnish us with the germ of all the principles,
                    and with many of their elucidations; but Whately’s work is extremely valuable in
                    this section, and will aid us scarcely less than it has aided us in the inquiry
                    which we have just left. All that is most important on this subject may be
                    comDrehended under the answers to three questions.</p>
                <p>First, what is the Comparative Efficiency of the several sorts of arguments,
                    considered with reference to the nature of the conclusions sought to be
                    established by them? Our guide answers as follows. “Matters of opinion, as they
                    are called (that is, where we are not said properly to know, ,but to judge), are
                    established chiefly by Antecedent Probability (arguments of the first class,
                    from cause to effect), though the Testimony of wise men is also admissible; past
                    facts, chiefly by Signs of various kinds (that term, it must be remembered,
                    including Testimony); and future events, by Antecedent Probabilities and
                    Examples.” Cases may often occur which form exceptions to these principles; but
                    reflection will easily convince every one that the outline of them here given is
                    substantially accurate; and any doubts which may arise on an abstract
                    consideration of the question may be certainly removed by an examination of the
                    most, convincing argumentative compositions. In few instances where argument is
                    applied to practical uses, does any of the several sorts of conclusions
                    constitute the whole of the end which the discourse proposes; but, in every
                    discourse, one or another of the kinds holds the most prominent place.
                    Compositions chiefly designed for instruction or exhortation, such as ethical
                    and most religious discourses, being principally conversant about conclusions of
                    the first class, appeal mainly to the argument from cause to effect,
                    strengthening this argument by authorities fairly and judiciously selected, and
                    also making frequent use of examples, seldomer however as proofs than as
                    illustrations, which are not introduced for the purpose of proving anything, but
                    merely in order to place imperfectly-apprehended proposi∙ tions in a stronger
                    light. Judicial oratory, when employed on those questions which fall within the
                    province of juries, has mainly reference to the second class of conclusions, so
                    that signs compose the chief weapons of the legal speaker’s armoury. Harangues
                    addressed to deliberative assemblies embrace the whole field of conclusions, but
                    in most cases are chiefly directed tow ards those of the third class.</p>
                <p>Secondly, what is the Comparative Efficiency of the several sorts of argument,
                    considered with reference to our position towards the party whom we desire to
                    convince? Which sort is best calculated for direct Conviction? and which for
                    Refutation? We again borrow an answer. “It should be considered whether the
                    principal object of the discourse be, to give <hi rend="italic">satisfaction to
                    a candid mind</hi> and convey <hi rend="italic">instruction</hi> to those who
                    are ready to receive it, or to <hi rend="italic">comped the assent or silence
                    the. objections</hi> of an opponent. The former of these purposes is in general
                    principally to be accomplished by the former of those two great classes into
                    which arguments were divided (viz. by those from cause to effect), the other by
                    the latter. To whatever class, however, the arguments we resort to may belong,
                    the general tenor of the reasoning will in many respects be affected by the
                    present consideration. The distinction in question is nevertheless in general
                    little attended to. It is usual to call an argument simply <hi rend="italic"
                    >strong</hi> or <hi rend="italic">weak,</hi> without reference to the purpose
                    for which it was designed; whereas the arguments which afford the most <hi
                    rend="italic">satisfaction</hi> to a candid mind, are often such as would have
                    less weight in <hi rend="italic">controversy</hi> than many others, which,
                    again, would be less suitable for the former purpose. For example; the internal
                    evidence of Christianity in general proves the most satisfactory to a believer’s
                    mind, but is not that which makes the most show in the refutation of infidels.
                    The arguments from analogy, on the other hand, which are the most <hi
                    rend="italic">unanswerable,</hi> are not so pleasing and consolatory.”</p>
                <p>Thirdly, where we are in possession of arguments of all the kinds, all bearing on
                    the conclusion which we wish to reach, what Arrangement of these is most
                    effectual for producing conviction? This question is one of the most important
                    in rhetoric: indeed there is scarcely any other which goes so closely to the
                    foundation of all eloquence. A just Arrangement of Arguments is indispensable
                    towards success in conviction or persuasion; and the leading principles of
                    eloquence carry us by a very short journey to general rules on the subject,
                    which may be considered as infallible. Aristotle has not enlarged on this point
                    further than to press the necessity of using probative examples in the very last
                    place; but Whately has very justly observed that the principle should be
                    extended much more widely. The <pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:wu.89119129625&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=220" xml:id="kp-eb0719-0220-0210"
                    />three kinds of argument,—supposing that in the particular case each is
                    accessible, applicable, and necessary,—should be used in the order in which they
                    were explained in preceding paragraphs; the Argument from Antecedent
                    Probabilities coming first, that from Signs second, and that from Examples last
                    of all. If we violate the principle of this rule, we cripple every branch of our
                    proof, as we may readily convince ourselves by trying the experiment on any case
                    in which all the classes of argument must have place. Let us take the instance
                    of a judicial address, intended to convince a jury that a certain man has
                    committed a murder, supposing also the state of the proof to be such that the
                    speaker rightly considers it necessary to use all the three kinds of argument;
                    and let us adduce the arguments in the order opposite to that which the rule
                    suggests. By commencing with analogical arguments, or other proofs from example,
                    we instantly prepossess our hearers against the conclusion which we wish to
                    establish. All men feel, more or less, the weakness of this sort of proof when
                    taken by itself, whether they clearly perceive the cause of the weakness or not;
                    and the defect will strike them forcibly and painfully in a case like that
                    supposed, in which they are naturally reluctant to come to the conclusion which
                    is urged on them: a single example is in such a place even worse than worthless;
                    accumulated examples perplex the mind, and excite it to an effort of memory
                    which withdraws it from its proper task; and, lastly, the argument, if adduced
                    at this stage, is a building reared without a foundation; for, as we have proved
                    no circumstances of the special fact, our hearers have no materials for
                    determining whether our analogy holds or not. Let us next proceed to the
                    argument from signs: we still want something. For, even although we had been
                    able to convince our hearers by the first branch of our argument, that our
                    allegation has in it nothing which common experience has shown to be impossible,
                    or very highly improbable, we have as yet not advanced a single step towards
                    proving <hi rend="italic">a priori,</hi> that the fact is positively likely to
                    be true, and our audience are still indisposed to believe that it is so. On the
                    supposition made, the proof from signs is stated as in itself not conclusive
                    (for, if it were so, there would be no use for either of the other two kinds of
                    proof); and, the case being so,—the fact being, by its accompanying
                    circumstances, made more or less probable, but not certain, and nothing having
                    been established which, like a strong motive, or such probable cause, would lead
                    our hearers to anticipate the fact as likely, before they become acquainted with
                    the corroborating symptoms,—we shall still have failed in gaining our end, and
                    perhaps have come little nearer to it than the point at which we stood in the
                    beginning. In order to complete our evidence, we must, therefore, proceed to the
                    third series of arguments, tending to establish antecedent probability, which
                    now come forward with every possible disadvantage. Our hearers have to apply the
                    argument to the preceding facts, by a toilsome exertion of memory, which
                    prevents the discursive faculties from acting freely, and, if the proof is
                    complicated, may, after all, be completely unsuccessful; or, if we endeavour to
                    remove this risk, we must do so by a recapitulation, which will be wearisome,
                    inefficient, and in itself an adequate reason for believing that our arrangement
                    has been radically wrong. Let us reverse the arrangement, and everything will
                    find quick and easy access to the mind. We first establish that our conclusion
                    has antecedent presumptions in its favour, and the hearers are thus prepared for
                    receiving with attention, candour, and even prepossession, all specific proofs
                    in support of it. We next adduce those concurrent circumstances which we
                    maintain would not have happened had not the fact taken place which we wish to
                    prove. And, lastly, after we have conducted thus far those whom we address,
                    examples or analogies complete the chain of probabilities. “After the other
                    proofs have been adduced,” says Aristotle, “a single example comes in with as
                    much force as the testimony of a single honest witness.” The application of the
                    same principles to the refutation of an address like that now analysed, is too
                    obvious to require illustration.</p>
                <p>In any treatise which should aim at following out the principles of rhetoric to
                    their detailed consequences (a design far beyond the limits of these pages), it
                    would be of the highest advantage to devote a separate section to a systematic
                    consideration of the most usual Rhetorical Fallacies. Under this head would be
                    analysed, not only those artifices by which falsehood may in argument be most
                    easily made to pass current for truth, but also those others, by means of which
                    conclusions may be represented as fallacies without really being so. It is not
                    more important to expose the foundations of real fallacies, than to exhibit the
                    unsoundness of those objections which represent as fallacies arguments truly
                    sound. Although this double task belongs, in most of its applications, to
                    logical science, there are many cases in which it is from the principles of
                    rhetoric, not from those of dialectics, that the refutation of the error must be
                    drawn. From Aristotle’s two admirable chapters on Fallacies, and on the
                    Refutation of Arguments and of Objections, only one observation shall here be
                    cited, on account of the practical importance of the truth which it contains.
                    Where, remarks the philosopher, the aim of an argument is merely to establish a
                    probability, contrary facts may always be truly alleged. But the existence of
                    such facts does not prove the argument to be fallacious; for a probability is
                    not disproved till we have proved that the fact does usually happen
                    contrariwise. The cavil which this remark exposes, lies at the root of very much
                    of the sophistry which has been put in use against truth, both in religion and
                    in politics.</p>
                <p>Our next subject of inquiry is Aristotle’s Second Rhetorical ground of Belief;
                    namely, that which arises from the favourable impression created by the
                    discourse as to the Character of the Writer or Speaker. The impression here
                    meant is one arising wholly from the discourse; for, so far as it is produced by
                    previous knowledge possessed by those who are addressed, it is no subject of
                    rhetorical consideration. This is a ground of belief, which, although it is
                    sometimes very effective in written discourses, and although in such discourses
                    the violation of its principle often occasions lamentable failures, has yet its
                    principal field in spoken oratory. A speaker who is skilled in producing
                    conviction in this way, has often applied to him, in common language, the
                    epithet of plausible. Aristotle places high reliance on this ground of belief;
                    observing of it, in two different places, that it is most effectual indeed when
                    the audience are very imperfectly informed on the matter of the discourse, but
                    that, taken all in all, it is probably the most extensively powerful of all
                    means of persuasion; and that, in deliberative assemblies, it very often
                    triumphs over all other oratorical artifices. The speaker’s Character must be
                    favourably developed in three particulars; the hearers must be led to have faith
                    in his Moral Worth, in his Understanding, and in his Good Dispositions towards
                    them. It is scarcely possible to overrate the power of the first point. Indeed
                    the art of persuading the audience into a belief of his high moral principle, or
                    of his perfect honesty and fairness, is one of the most valuable an orator can
                    acquire. Its attainment should be a leading aim; but it is not equally
                    attainable in every kind of oratory; and, in particular, the acquisition of this
                    kind of plausibility is one of the most difficult tasks of a barrister who
                    struggles for success in addressing juries. His difficulties are of two kinds;
                    the one arising from his audience, mainly founded on their knowledge of his
                    professional position, and their consequent tendency to distrust; the <pb
                    break="no" facs="ht:wu.89119129625&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=221"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0719-0221-0211"/>other inherent in himself, founded on the abstract
                    nature and the over-cautious, captious spirit, of the legal arguments which in
                    most courts form the greater part of the ordinary practice, and which, as we see
                    in everyday experience, disqualify most lawyers, by various defects (and most of
                    all by want of apparent candour), from success as popular speakers. For success
                    in pulpit-oratory, this instrument of persuasion is absolutely and without
                    exception indispensable. The hearer’s confidence in the speaker’s understanding
                    requires scarcely any illustrative remark but this; that it must not be a
                    confidence in his oratorical skill, which has an inevitable tendency to check
                    belief: but it may advantageously extend to an unlimited admiration of his
                    general intelligence, and of the profundity of his acquaintance with the matter
                    of the address; with this restriction, however, that the display of these
                    qualities will lose all their force, if, by exhibiting a want of modesty, they
                    draw the speaker into a violation of the first section of the rule. The hearer’s
                    confidence in the speaker’s good-will is as essential as the rest, and the want
                    of this confidence is the main obstacle which makes a speaker on political
                    questions almost inevitably unable to make an impression on men belonging to an
                    opposite faction.</p>
                <p>We have now reached the Third Ground of Belief; that which the writer or speaker
                    produces by exciting, in the minds of those whom he addresses, such an Emotion,
                    or series of Emotions, as for a time excludes the application of their
                    discursive faculties to the arguments regarding the question discussed. The
                    operation which Eloquence here effects on the mind is, it must be observed,
                    complex. The faculty primarily excited is the Imagination; but the agency of
                    this faculty is merely instrumental; for the office which it is made to
                    discharge is, that of calling up images which are adequate objects of the
                    Emotions, and are calculated to arouse them. But, further, these objects of the
                    imagination and the feelings, so far as they are useful towards the Production
                    of Belief, are either themselves conclusions presented to the Reason to be
                    pronounced by it true or false, or they are at least steps leading towards such
                    conclusions. This appeal to the Reason, however, is the very last stage of the
                    process: and if the discourse has effected its end, the operation of judgment is
                    instantaneous, and as it were instinctive: the conclusion is admitted by the
                    mind, not as the result of a train of argument, but as an element, so to speak,
                    of the mind’s own experience or consciousness.</p>
                <p>This is the true analysis of all animated and passionate eloquence; and yet, when
                    so represented, this process, in which the art gains its highest triumphs, and
                    without which it would be quite powerless as an instrument for persuading the
                    mass of mankind, may at first sight appear more open to the charge of unfairness
                    than any other means which literature and oratory employ. But the objection is
                    unsound. This, like every other element of eloquence, is a neutral power, which
                    may be made to ally itself either with good or evil, being, however, always most
                    willing to serve truth and rectitude. We shall be enabled to discern its real
                    position, by examining two of its most usual applications.</p>
                <p>The first case is that in which the aim of the discourse is to determine the
                    hearers or readers to a certain course of action, of whose abstract justice and
                    propriety they are convinced by a simple statement of its principles, but
                    towards which neither the abstract statement, nor their previous feelings on the
                    subject, tend strongly enough to prompt them; in other words, a case in which
                    persuasion (in the strict sense of the word), not conviction, is the proper aim.
                    The mere conviction would clearly not lead to the result required; because men
                    act not from convictions, but from motives; not from simple belief of truth,
                    reposing ultimately in the understanding, nor even from a belief superinduced on
                    this, that the truth is also an object adequate to the gra tification of one or
                    more of the active powers of the mind,— but from the suggestions of these active
                    faculties themselves, aroused to energy, and directed to the truths in question
                    as their fittest or only objects. Eloquence strives to communicate the impulse
                    thus needed. The most important truth stated abstractly and barely, and the same
                    truth set forth with the adornment of eloquence, often bear to each other, in
                    respect of their comparative value for mankind, the same relation which the
                    skeleton-hull in the building-yard bears to the gallant ship at sea, armed,
                    manned, and in full sail.</p>
                <p>We next take a case which brings us nearer to the disputable ground; being one in
                    which we attempt, by the excitement of emotion, to lead men to a conclusion in
                    which they would not have acquiesced but for such excitement. There is nothing
                    to prevent us from assuming, that the conclusion which we maintain in the case
                    supposed is true, although it may seem to those whom we address to be either
                    positively false, or exceedingly problematical. Now this belief or doubt of
                    theirs, adverse at once to the truth and to the end of the discourse, may arise
                    in their minds in a variety of ways, all of these, however, being reducible to
                    two; for it must either be founded on an antecedent process of pure reasoning
                    which has gone on in their minds, or it must rest on some other antecedent
                    mental process, in which the discursive faculties are either not at all, or not
                    alone, active. The former class of wrong conclusions arise much seldomer from
                    any defect in the process of reasoning which has conducted to them, than from
                    the assumption of erroneous premises; and this makes it the more difficult to
                    combat them directly by argument. The latter class, however, is that to which
                    belong the great mass of common prejudices; opinions often resulting from an
                    inextricable combination of shallow reflection, hasty observation, ruling
                    passion, imperfect views of moral duty, and personal or local affections and
                    dislikes; prepossessions on which arguments can take no hold, but which are
                    often quickly displaced by other notions suggested without argument: just as, in
                    a siege, the shot and shells rebound without effect from the masonry of a
                    casemated bastion, which a storming party, if they can once enter the trenches,
                    will carry at the first assault If we undertake to instruct or convince minds
                    engrossed by false opinions of either class, we have only two alternatives:
                    either a direct attack on the reason by argument, which will meet with an
                    inevitable and signal repulse, or a well-directed appeal to other principles of
                    the mind, which will often insure a gratifying success. No doubt it would be
                    better if truth could be protected and disseminated without the use of these
                    indirect methods: no doubt we can conceive, and ardently desire to witness, an
                    advancement of human knowledge, a purification of human desires and affections,
                    an elevation of the standard of conscience as well as intellect, which should
                    make a simple presentation of truth to the reason always adequate for the
                    dislodgement of error: but our mortal nature does not stand on this height, and
                    will never rise so high till it has put on immortality; and the aspirant after
                    eloquence, like the philosopher and the man of business, must, in his endeavours
                    to act on the minds of others, be contented to take their condition as he finds
                    it. This is all that Aristotle has said, or intended to say, in a passage which
                    has been strangely cited as expressing an opinion, that all the appeals of
                    eloquence to the passions are wrong and illegitimate; we say strangely, when the
                    assertion is made as to a writer who placed so much weight on this instrument of
                    the art, that he devoted a large proportion of his rhetorical work to an
                    analysis of the most common passions, although, according to his own view of the
                    province of rhetoric, the subject lies beyond its limits.</p>
                <p>The Aristotle of modern times has at once beautiftiliy illustrated and
                    convincingly defended the operation of elo<pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:wu.89119129625&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=222" xml:id="kp-eb0719-0222-0212"
                    />quence on the imagination and the feelings. “If the affections in themselves,”
                    says Bacon, “were pliant and obedient to reason, it were true there should be no
                    great use of persuasions and insinuations to the will, more than of naked
                    proposition and proofs. But in regard of the continual mutinies and seditions of
                    the affections, reason would become captive and servile if eloquence of
                    persuasions did not practise and win the imagination from the affections’ part,
                    and contract a confederacy between the reason and imagination against the
                    affections. For the affections themselves carry ever an appetite to good, as
                    reason doth: the difference is, that the affection beholdeth merely the present;
                    reason beholdeth the future and sum of time. And therefore, the present filling
                    the imagination more, reason is commonly vanquished: but after that the force of
                    eloquence and persuasion hath made tilings future and remote appear as present,
                    then upon the revolt of the imagination reason pre-vaileth.”</p>
                <p>But this is a department in which rhetoric can aid the student less than in any
                    other. As it is the field in which genius gathers its fairest harvest, so it is
                    also that which she is called on chiefly to cultivate from her own resources. No
                    rules, and no study or experience, will qualify one for attaining this loftiest
                    stage of eloquence, unless the mind glows spontaneously with that warmth and
                    depth of feeling which its exertions aim at communicating to the breasts of
                    others. To the active and searching intellect, whose suggestions, operating on
                    the stores of knowledge possessed by the writer or speaker, lead him to the
                    sources and instruments of conviction in the argumentative part of his task, and
                    whose acuteness and energy can be incalculably aided by philosophical and
                    critical study, and by experimental practice,—to this foundation and groundwork
                    of success must be added, for the acquisition of excellence in impassioned
                    eloquence, natural powers to which external aids can minister but weakly. A very
                    few observations, therefore, may suffice on this head.</p>
                <p>The philosophy of those regions of the human mind on which eloquence here seeks
                    to work, must be learned, not from rhetoric, but from consciousness,
                    observation, and the systematic study of the mental philosophy. It is most usual
                    to consider the class of mental phenomena which are here brought into play as
                    embracing only the active principles of human nature; but the student will
                    unquestionably gain many incidental hints which would otherwise have escaped his
                    notice, and will probably find his general view over this province of the art
                    made at once clearer and wider, if he investigates with reference to it the
                    whole of that class of phenomena which Thomas Brown ranks together in his
                    analysis of the emotions, in their three genera of the immediate, retrospective,
                    and prospective, and their subdivision (still more valuable for the present
                    purpose) into those which do, and those which do not, involve the feelings that
                    form the criterion of the objects of the moral faculty.</p>
                <p>All advices which rhetoric can give on the subject are immediate corollaries from
                    one part of the proposition laid down as our definition; namely, that the
                    emotion sought to be produced excludes the action of the discursive faculties.
                    The moment an argument, or a hint towards one, is suggested by the impassioned
                    portions of a discourse, the emotion begins to be chilled, and the effect is
                    lost. The emo tion is generated through the excitement of the imagination; and
                    this fact, with the exclusion of argument, is nearly all that art can here
                    teach. “The first and most important point to be observed in every address to
                    any passion, sentiment, feeling, &amp;c. is, that it should not be introduced as
                    such, and plainly avowed.” This rule follows both from the principles just laid
                    down, and from another consideration: if the feeling sought to be excited is
                    wrong, the avowal of the intention is manifestly destructive: if it is right and
                    honourable, the self-love of those whom we address is offended by having it
                    hinted that they are deficient in it. Another rule, following from the
                    instrumentality of the imagination, teaches us that conciseness, which in
                    argument is a virtue if it does not degenerate into obscurity, is in the
                    impassioned parts of a discourse always a positive, fault. The imagination is
                    operated on, not by general, views, but by special circumstances, by pictures
                    held up to it and brought close that they may be distinctly seen. On this, as on
                    other questions connected with the impassioned parts of a discourse, Cicero,
                    himself one of the greatest proficients in this branch, peculiarly attached to
                    its study, and inclined to undervalue other sections of the art, has thrown out,
                    in his attractively desultory fashion, hints that are extremely instructive. A
                    third rule, nearly akin to the last, which may indeed be considered as a portion
                    of it, prescribes an examination and knowledge of all those circumstances which
                    are chiefly instrumental in affecting the feelings; and Campbell has ably
                    illustrated this precept, classing the most obvious of such circumstances under
                    the seven heads of “probability, plausibility” (which he considers as different
                    from probability in kind, not in degree), “importance, proximity of time,
                    connection of place, relation of the actors or sufferers to the hearers or
                    speaker, and interest of the hearers or speaker in the consequences.” But,
                    fourthly, such an examination will discover to us many-circumstances which tend
                    to check the flow of feeling, and against which consequently we must guard.
                    Among these, a prominent place is occupied by tediousness, a fault into which
                    the second rule just propounded may entice those who want a complete
                    apprehension of its principle. “Nothing,” says an ancient critic, “dries up more
                    quickly than a tear ;” and what is thus true of the softer feelings, is equally
                    so of the more vehement: none of them can be adequately supported by eloquence
                    for more than a certain period, the length of which an impassioned orator must
                    learn from his own consciousness and observation, being always, however, in
                    danger of extending its limits too far, rather than of unduly restricting them.
                    Appeals to the sense of the ludicrous by means of wit or humour may, if well
                    supported, be responded to for a much longer time than the serious emotions,
                    even although they should be conducted with little variety and intermission; but
                    no class of feelings is more completely inconsistent with the exercise of the
                    reasoning faculties; and a discourse which rests its strength solely or mainly
                    on the use of ridicule, thereby shows that, whatever the author’s motives may be
                    for the choice, he is at any rate disinclined to attempt reaching his end by any
                    thing like pure conviction. Some of the instruments of the ludicrous, too, are
                    apt to fail in their purpose with many people, from being misunderstood; and
                    against irony in particular, the sharpest of all the weapons of wit, dulness of
                    heart or fancy cases very many in armour of proof. This truth has been
                    remarkably experienced by Swift, who is perhaps the greatest master of irony in
                    any language, but whose polemical dissertations, often clothed in an ironical
                    dress from beginning to end, are thus, in many cases, as little appreciable by a
                    large majority of his readers as if they had been written in an unknown
                    language. As instances of this fault, we may cite two of his most severe
                    satires; the one his “Argument against abolishing Christianity,” aimed both at
                    the irreligion and the false religion of the times; and the other, still more
                    celebrated, the “Modest proposal for preventing the children of poor people in
                    Ireland from being a burden to their parents or country, and for making them
                    beneficial to the public,” being the bitterest of all sarcastic invectives
                    against the misgovernment of that unhappy island, whose miseries Swift professes
                    to see no possible means of alleviating, except by devoting the superabundant
                    population to the shambles. The only other questions connected with the inquiry
                    which we shall allude to, are those which address themselves to the case <pb
                    break="no" facs="ht:wu.89119129625&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=223"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0719-0223-0213"/>in which those whom we address are already under
                    the influence of some emotion, which we must endeavour to allay, or to divert
                    from its original object. The main principle applicable to this head is, that a
                    passion may generally be destroyed most easily, not by the excitement of another
                    which may be considered as its opposite, but by that of passions which do not
                    lie so far distant from it. Anger towards a person, for example, may be removed,
                    not only by exciting good-will towards him, but by holding him up as a proper
                    object of fear. “Compassion, likewise, may be counteracted either by
                    disapprobation, by jealousy, by fear, or by disgust; and horror and envy either
                    by good-will or by contempt.” Aristotle, in his minute analysis of the passions
                    most usually appealed to in oratory, which is well worthy of being deeply
                    studied, has several very valuable observations on this head; as Whately and
                    Campbell have on the whole subject of impassioned eloquence: and Cicero and
                    Quinctilian are much more useful here than they are in relation to the
                    philosophy of arguments.</p>
                <p>Our general plan of the Systematic portion of Rhetoric now presents to us its
                    Second Division, which treats of what the ancients called Disposition, or the
                    Arrangement of the several Parts of a Discourse. This department of the inquiry,
                    a favourite one with the classical rhetoricians, especially those of the later
                    ages, has, in modern systems of the art, seldom received a place as a distinct
                    branch, and has, indeed, been generally overlooked altogether; but the
                    consideration of it suggests illustrations of the laws of eloquence, which claim
                    for it some attention at least, although we shall not be tempted to dwell long
                    upon it.</p>
                <p>In reference to the animation of a discourse, and to every appeal which it makes
                    to any principles of the mind besides the reasoning powers, Cicero has well
                    said, that an eloquent composition should be constructed on the principle of the
                    climax, rising gradually in its demands on the fancy and feelings of those to
                    whom it is addressed, in the same ratio in which it has succeeded in opening the
                    way for their rational conviction. This rule is in truth a very simple
                    application of the fundamental proposition of rhetoric; and all special
                    directions regarding arrangement will, so far as they are sound, be immediately
                    deducible from it. Aristotle, desirous, as he always is, to expel the prevailing
                    errors of his time, by maintaining the due prevalence of the argumentative
                    element of eloquence, observes that, in despite of that complication of
                    divisions which already reigned in the schools, the essential parts common to
                    all argumentative compositions are two only; the proposition or statement of the
                    question, and the proof or argument in support of it. And this is quite true;
                    for every other portion is introduced solely for the sake of these two, and has
                    no value, unless in so far as it promotes their purpose. In most cases, however,
                    an argument cannot with advantage be maintained thus barely; but a complete
                    discourse may always be with little difficulty analysed by a division into four
                    parts; the Exordium or Introduction, the Proposition or Statement of the
                    Question, the Proof or Argument, and the Peroration.</p>
                <p>The Exordium, when it finds a place, is designed for conciliating the minds of
                    the persons addressed; and Quinctilian reduces to three the dispositions which
                    it should aim at producing—Good-will, Attention, and Docility. The materials of
                    the introduction should be drawn as closely as possible from the subject of the
                    discourse, and as little as possible from common-places; and it therefore
                    follows, that the ancient oratorical practice of keeping a stock of exordia
                    prepared beforehand, which Cicero generally followed, and which Demosthenes has
                    exemplified by a collection of more than fifty specimens, one or two of them
                    introduced in his extant harangues, was unsatisfactory and dangerous even for
                    public speakers, unless used with great judgment, and was quite preposterous in
                    the case of all other writers. Both for the writer and the speaker, but more
                    especially for the latter, the chief difficulty is, the passing naturally and
                    safely from the theme suggested in the introduction, to that which is to be
                    propounded in the next part of the composition.</p>
                <p>If we say that the Proposition requires little illustration and few precepts, we
                    shall find that Aristotle is with us,Quinctilian neutral, and the later
                    rhetoricians, both Greek and Latin, decidedly against us. Even if we professed
                    to deliver a complete system, we should not be easily induced to try the
                    student’s patience, by following Severianus, or the pseudo-Augustin, far through
                    the mazes of the <hi rend="italic">Status Quaestionis;</hi> but the principles
                    which should guide us in laying down our proposition, and in choosing it when
                    that is in our power, are far too little studied (if gross violation of the
                    principle be a proof that it has not been studied or understood) by many
                    argumentative writers, and by a still greater number of argumentative speakers.
                    Preachers are in this respect decidedly the most faulty class; and orators of
                    other kinds are protected against the error less by their own familiarity with
                    the principles than by their liability to those checks by contradiction which
                    the preacher wants. The most important rule, and one which is but too often
                    broken, is to frame in our own minds a clear notion of the proposition, which
                    involves among other contained rules that of ascertaining, that what we are
                    about to argue is truly a proposition, and not a mere term. “In an ethical
                    work,” says Whately, “one may be treating of virtue, while discussing all or any
                    of these questions—wherein virtue consists? whence our notions of it arise?
                    whence it derives its obligation? &amp;c.; but if these questions were
                    confusedly blended together, or if all of them were treated of within a short
                    compass, the most just remarks and forcible arguments would lose their interest
                    and their utility.”</p>
                <p>Of the Argumentative, or third portion of the composition, which has been already
                    discussed at such length, little seems necessary to be added. It must, of
                    course, include the Refutation of an opponent’s argument, as well as the
                    statement of those by which our own proposition is directly supported. The
                    proper places for such refutative arguments, and the best arrangement of
                    arguments in general, in cases where the rules draw n from the kind of the
                    argument do not apply, have given rise to much discussion, and to many
                    contradictory rules, from which it is not easy to extract general laws, or any
                    very positive inference beyond the advice, to study the aspect of the evidence,
                    and the disposition of those who are to judge of it. The rule most commonly
                    received, which directs that the strongest arguments be placed first and last,
                    and the weakest in the middle, is subject to constantly recurring exceptions, of
                    which we only cite one from Quinctilian, namely, the case where a harangue
                    preceding ours has created in the minds of the hearers on certain points an
                    impression strongly unfavourable to us, which we must at all hazards endeavour
                    immediately to remove. Under this head, in respect both of their nature and
                    their place, fall most of those passages occasionally introduced in
                    argumentative composition, which, under the names of Narration, Digression, and
                    the like, rhetoricians have often classed separately as integral parts of a
                    discourse; and here also there frequently occur fitting occasions for the
                    introduction of appeals to the feelings.</p>
                <p>But the Conclusion or Peroration is the place for pressing such appeals to the
                    utmost, to which office it adds that of bringing together into one view, by a
                    Recapitulation, when one is thought necessary, the heads of the argument, or at
                    least the results to which the speaker wishes it to be believed that they
                    conduct. The Recapitulation is, for those who are maintaining a weak cause, a
                    favourite and advantageous place for varnishing over the defects of the
                    proof,—by assumptions of things as proved which have not been proved,— by
                    exaggeration of the favourable points in our own cause,—</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="ht:wu.89119129625&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=224"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0719-0224-0214"/>
                <p>by the explaining away of such points in the argument opposed to us,—and by other
                    artifices belonging to the numerous class of Rhetorical Fallacies. In its
                    passionate parts the peroration has, both in ancient and in modern times,
                    prompted some of the noblest flights of human eloquence.</p>
                <p>If Eloquence depended solely on Style, those lofty pretensions of rhetoricians
                    which were alluded to in the first paragraph of this paper would be not merely
                    excusable or plausible, but to a considerable extent justified by their results.
                    The highest qualities of style indeed are emanations from the mind; but many of
                    its excellences may be attained by industrious practice, conducted in obedience
                    to systematic rules. The expression may be feeble, because words, phrases, and
                    sentences cannot be strong, unless the thoughts which they represent be strong
                    likewise; it may be wanting in precision, because this is another quality
                    flowing essentially from the nature of the author’s conceptions; and if ornament
                    be introduced, it may be destitute of originality and liveliness, because no
                    rules can confer either the power of felicitous invention or that of extensive
                    and acute observation. But even in these very particulars, art, although weak,
                    is not altogether powerless; accuracy, or even strength of thinking, and
                    closeness of observation, may be increased by sound precepts and active
                    exercise, which, by thus improving the faculties of the intellect, will
                    necessarily facilitate the expression of its thoughts by language. And, again,
                    if a man can only be taught to apprehend distinctly the limits of the province
                    within which his mind may act with advantage, and to adapt the character of his
                    style to that of his natural powers, the rules of composition may suffice to
                    render his style, if not positively good, at least negatively faultless.</p>
                <p>But Style, instead of solely constituting eloquence, might, if we chose to court
                    contradiction by stating a truth in the shape of a paradox, be even said to be
                    no essential part of it. It is an unavoidable inference from the principles
                    which we have laid down, that all eloquence is relative. The harangues which a
                    chief in the centre of Africa delivers to his fellow-savages, or by which a
                    demagogue in religion or politics excites an uneducated mob, such as
                    unfortunately may still be found in our country as well as in others, may be
                    truly and powerfully eloquent, because fitted beyond all other discourses for
                    convincing and impelling to action the persons on whose understanding and will
                    they are designed to operate; and yet, not only may these orations contain
                    constant violations of all rules of style, except those few which are directly
                    referable to the thought, but they may owe to such violations no mean part of
                    their persuasive efficacy. This view, however, is stated solely for the purpose
                    of guarding against error in our notions as to the place which style really
                    holds as an element of eloquence. In all the applications of preceptive systems
                    of the art in civilized and cultivated society, or, in other words, in all cases
                    in which such preceptive systems can arise, the rules of style must be obeyed
                    more or less closely, and the acquisition of them is indispensable for every
                    student of rhetoric.</p>
                <p>But the details of the subject cannot here be taught. Our plan is that of a mere
                    outline, and in tilling it up we confine ourselves to an attempt to illustrate
                    some of those points which bear most strongly on the mental laws of rhetorical
                    belief. Those useful rules which affect style chiefly or essentially as such,
                    may be satisfactorily learned from many works of different kinds, both in our
                    own language, and in others, both ancient and modern. The principles of style in
                    the classical tongues are not truths foreign to our own, but only truths which,
                    always analogically useful, do in many instances hold as to all languages, while
                    in some they cannot be applied to the tongues of modern Europe, without cautions
                    and modifications: we may learn much from Aristotle, Quinctilian, Dionysius of
                    Halicarnassus, and even from the later rhetoricians and critics, Greek as well
                    as Latin. On English style we have many good works: Campbell, Blair, Karnes, and
                    Whately, abound with valuable illustrations of the subject in its relation to
                    rhetorical principles; and of those treatises which are designed chiefly as
                    manuals of style, without aiming at a general exposition of the philosophical
                    principles of eloquence, more than one might be safely recommended. Of those
                    works which have attained reputation in this latter class, none will be found so
                    useful as one of the latest, Irving’s unpretending and excellent Elements of
                    English Composition.</p>
                <p>We may here confine ourselves almost to a simple enumeration of those Qualities
                    of Style which are strictly Rhetorical, and which, availing ourselves of
                    Whately’s extension of the analysis proposed by Campbell, we may reduce to
                    three: Perspicuity, Vivacity, and Beauty.</p>
                <p>The first quality is of course an indispensable requisite in compositions of
                    every kind; and the principles of rhetoric remind us, that, while style, in
                    order to be perspicuous at all, must obey certain general laws, the quality is
                    also in a very important sense relative to the knowledge and intellect of those
                    whom the language is intended to instruct, convince, or persuade. The same
                    statement which is abundantly perspicuous to one audience, may be quite
                    unintelligible to another less informed. In the adaptation of style in this
                    respect to different classes of readers and hearers, the student cannot be so
                    much aided by any rules as by his own judgment and observation; but in order to
                    avoid, on the one hand, the obscurity which may arise from conciseness, and, on
                    the other, the wearisomeness which inevitably attends prolixity, it has been
                    recommended to repeat the thought and argument in several different forms, “each
                    in itself brief, but all together affording such an expansion of the sense to be
                    conveyed, and so detaining the mind upon it, as the case may require.” “Cicero
                    among the ancients, and Burke among the modern writers, afford perhaps the most
                    abundant practical exemplifications of this rule.” But, as we shall speedily
                    discover that an overflow of figurative language is inconsistent with
                    perspicuity in all circumstances, we must not be thus tempted to believe that
                    the style which is least figurative is the most perspicuous. Illiterate
                    audiences, in particular, are not only-pleased with figurative language, but may
                    often by means of it be made to comprehend a principle, which would have
                    remained perfectly dark to them if conveyed in abstract and unimaginative
                    terms.</p>
                <p>Vivacity of style is the quality by which it makes its appeal to the imagination,
                    or, through that faculty, to the passions and other active powers. Independently
                    of those considerations as to the number and arrangement of words, upon which we
                    cannot here enter, Vivacity is chiefly produced by the use of figurative
                    language, which critical and rhetorical writers have divided into two kinds,
                    Tropes and Figures. It has been said by some writers of authority, that the
                    distinction implied in these terms is of little importance, because, it is
                    added, “nothing can be built upon it in practice, nor can it always be clearly
                    observed.” The language of the imagination and passions, however, does naturally
                    fall into two classes, the characteristics of which correspond substantially
                    with those assigned by the rhetoricians to their two divisions; and the student
                    of the principles of eloquence may find it worth while to recollect the
                    distinction. In the former class, which one may consider as properly Tropes,
                    taking the metaphor as an example, a word is used in a sense different from its
                    usual and appropriate one. In the other class, composing the Figures, a word or
                    sentence, without being either employed in a different sense from its usual one,
                    or put into any unusual form, derives its figurative or exciting power merely
                    from the fact, that the form of expression is not that which an unimpassioned
                    mind would have used in the place where it occurs, but that <pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:wu.89119129625&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=225" xml:id="kp-eb0719-0225-0215"
                    />which would have suggested itself to one whose feelings or imagination were at
                    the time highly active: the Interrogation, the Apostrophe, the Exclamation, and
                    similar rhetorical figures, may be cited as instances. There is at least one
                    practical inference deducible from the distinction; namely, that the Trope
                    proper may sometimes be safely used by rule, while the Figure proper will always
                    be ridiculous unless prompted by genuine emotion. The former may have place in
                    all the degrees of style, from the calmest to the most animated; the latter is
                    appropriate to eloquence of a highly passionate or imaginative cast, and is
                    indeed much more rarely admissible in written prose composition than in poetry
                    or in spoken oratory.</p>
                <p>Perspicuity and Vivacity are qualities of style, which minister directly to the
                    great purpose of eloquence, and which, indeed, language must possess before it
                    can reach its rhetorical end by both of its two leading paths; the former being
                    essential for the conviction of the understanding, and the latter for the
                    awakening of the fancy and the feelings. The same thing cannot be said, at least
                    not without qualification, as to the third quality of style, namely, Beauty or
                    Elegance, whose immediate purpose is the gratification of taste. Either in this
                    place, or at a former stage of the inquiry, there might have been room for some
                    curious speculations as to the functions which taste really exercises as an
                    oratorical instrument of belief; but the practical inferences, on which alone it
                    is proper to enter, are very plain, and may be very briefly stated. If it is
                    found that the gratification of the taste of those whom we address is likely to
                    impede our progress towards impressing on their minds the truth which we wish to
                    teach, we should at once abandon all attempts to furnish such gratification, and
                    pursue our principal end by means of clearness and animation. But if it is
                    found, as it most usually will be, that our purpose may be promoted by
                    gratifying the sense of beauty in our hearers, either through the general
                    elegance of our composition, or even through longer and more sustained addresses
                    to the imagination, not issuing in the excitement of passion, but resting
                    ultimately in the mere pleasure of contemplation,— we shall be bound to use, so
                    far as we are able, this lawful means of persuasion; taking care however to
                    recollect, that, as soon as we have reason to believe the minds of the hearers
                    in danger of being tempted towards such a lively attention to those incidental
                    ornaments of our discourse as will exclude from their thoughts the main subject
                    of it, we have thus evidence that it is time to discard the assistant, which,
                    like a spoiled domestic servant, has begun to play the part of the master.</p>
                <p>III.</p>
                <p>The last division of the three, in which we undertook to treat the subject of
                    this paper, embraces what may be called the Criticism of Rhetoric.</p>
                <p>This branch, as it must present itself to the student, should engage him in an
                    examination of the most celebrated efforts of eloquence which have been given to
                    the world, either by speech or by writing, in ancient as well as in modern
                    times; the philosophical principles of the art being assumed throughout as the
                    standard, and the analysis of the works being instituted for the purpose of
                    discovering the extent and particulars of their obedience to those fundamental
                    laws, or their departure from them. In reflecting, however, on the limits within
                    which the plan of this work necessarily and properly restricts our contribution
                    to it, we have more than once, convinced of the inadequacy of all that could be
                    here performed, towards aiding the student in this interesting and valuable
                    department of his training, felt strongly inclined to content ourselves with a
                    brief though earnest exhortation to this branch of rhetorical stu -dies, as
                    indispensable for all who would derive full advantage from a systematic
                    acquaintance with the principles. But there is one consideration which
                    imperatively forbids this. We would not willingly, it is true, be suspected <hi
                    rend="italic">of</hi> hoping that we shall be able to convert to the orthodox
                    doctrine any who remain incredulous after perusing the higher and more elaborate
                    works on rhetoric; but our outline may fall into the hands of some who either
                    have not studied the subject at all, or have not derived their notions of it
                    from the best sources. To such readers, indeed, our illustrations are
                    particularly addressed; and we shall have failed altogether in our purpose, if
                    our mode of treating the subject should lead to a radical misapprehension of the
                    relative importance belonging to the several branches into which the study of
                    rhetoric divides itself; a result which would be not unlikely to happen, if one
                    essential department were dismissed with a simple recommendation, however
                    warm.</p>
                <p>But the plan adopted in our systematic section, resembling that of a map, in
                    which the chief cities of an empire are laid down in their relative bearings, is
                    inapplicable to the present division, in which, as we assume the office of
                    topographers, we must select one or two narrow districts as the scene of our
                    labours. The province from which our very few specimens will be exclusively
                    selected, is that of Political Oratory, which offers to the student of eloquence
                    peculiar advantages, arising chiefly from the universally acknowledged
                    excellence of the ancient masterpieces, from the high merit, as well as
                    interest, of many works of the kind in our own country, and from the immense
                    variety which the compositions display, both in matter and in form.</p>
                <p>In many of the qualities essential to eloquent composition, the historical
                    writings of the moderns, and some of their philosophical works, will, at least,
                    suffer no dishonour by comparison with those of the ancients; although on a
                    close and comprehensive parallel they cannot, with respect to the mere manner of
                    delivery, be fairly said to equal the philosophy and history of the heathen
                    world. But, in Public Speaking, the Eloquence of the Ancients has left modern
                    oratory at an immeasureable distance; and in this field the Greeks are even
                    farther superior to the Romans, than these are to the nations of Christian
                    Europe.</p>
                <p>The great age of the Grecian Orators embraces scarcely three generations, and the
                    most celebrated names are to be found about the middle of the period, all within
                    the petty district of Attica. The critics of the Alexandrian school, when they
                    issued in a later time that sovereign decree, which declared certain authors and
                    no others, in every department of literature, to be classical and worthy of
                    study, admitted into their approved list ten Attic orators, of each of whom,
                    excepting Hyperides, we possess some remains. Antiphon, Andocides, Lycurgus, and
                    Dinarchus, must not here detain us; and Lysias, Isocrates, and Isaeus, can
                    scarcely receive more attention, although their works are far from being
                    undeserving of study as models of eloquence, and are singularly instructive as
                    illustrating, in many varied cases of private litigation, points which bear upon
                    the merits and character of the two great orators, and which present themselves
                    less prominently in the political, and even the judicial harangues which have
                    been bequeathed to us by these latter. Lysias, one of the simplest and purest of
                    Attic writers, is especially commended by the ancient critics for his skill in
                    the introductory and narrative parts of his orations; and Dionysius of
                    Halicarnassus considers Isaeus as closely resembling him, with less real
                    eloquence and less nature. Isocrates, who merely composed discourses to be
                    delivered by others, and was the teacher of all the most celebrated orators who
                    succeeded him, is one of the greatest masters of style whom Grecian literature
                    possesses; while he unites this quality <pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:wu.89119129625&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=226" xml:id="kp-eb0719-0226-0216"
                    />with others of a higher class in some of his discourses, such as the oration
                    written in the name of Archidamus, which, with another composition of the same
                    author, is our only example of ancient political pamphlets, or argumentative
                    discussions on temporary topics, avowedly composed for circulation, not for oral
                    delivery.</p>
                <p>But the most exalted place, not among the Athenian ora-tors only, but among those
                    of ancient times in general, belongs to the two celebrated contemporaries and
                    rivals, Demosthenes and Aeschines, of both of whom we possess adequate
                    specimens.</p>
                <p>The fame of Demosthenes has suffered less question from modem critics, than that
                    of any other ancient author whatever; and no one who studies the works of the
                    mighty Athenian with intelligence, sensibility, and becoming information, will
                    dream of dissenting from the universal judgment. The secret of his success lay
                    unquestionably in that predominant quality which, difficult or impossible of
                    analysis, but instinctively felt by his readers, while they are carried along on
                    his irresistible current of thought and feeling, the ancients called his
                    vehemence <hi rend="italic">(inviτηf),—</hi> that strong firmness of soul with
                    which he threw himself upon his subject, grasping its details in all their
                    relations, forcing them to support him as he hurried towards the end which lay
                    before him, and kindling them, by the flashes of his imagination and passion,
                    into lights which illuminated his headlong course. Dionysius, one of his best
                    critics,—who analyses his style into a combination of all those which had
                    preceded, uniting, in particular, the austerity of the early orators and
                    historians with the polish of the later,—describes the effects of his orations
                    upon the feelings, when compared with that which is produced by such
                    compositions as those of Isocrates, by saying that the latter leave us in the
                    same contemplative mood as if we had been listening to strains of exquisite
                    music, while the former inspire us by turns with all the passions incident to
                    humanity, and with an agitation as fierce as that which raged among the
                    initiated during the celebration of the mystic rites of Cybele. And yet the man
                    who, by stamping upon his subject the impress of his own vigorous and
                    impassioned mind, has made himself thus eloquent in the very loftiest sense
                    which the word can bear, attained this high excellence and unchallenged fame by
                    a course of self-training the most severe that is on record, and, after all his
                    exertions, wanted altogether many of those lesser attractions, both of matter
                    and of style, which have of themselves been sufficient to establish the fame of
                    meaner orators. A writer in the Edinburgh Review in 1820, whose hand is easily
                    recognisable as the same which annexed the Dissertation on the Eloquence of the
                    Ancients to the collected edition of Lord Brougham’s speeches, has not one whit
                    overstated the amount of Demosthenes’s deficiencies, in describing him as having
                    gained his ascendancy “without any ostentation of profound reflection or
                    philosophical remark—with few attempts at generalization—without the glare and
                    attraction of prominent ornaments—with extremely few, and those not very
                    successful, instances of the tender and pathetic—with a considerable degree of
                    coarseness, and what we should call vulgarity—and absolutely without any
                    pretension to wit or humour.” “Could the manner of Demosthenes be copied,” says
                    David Hume, with an unusual warmth of commendation, “its success would be
                    infallible over a modern assembly. It is rapid harmony exactly adjusted to the
                    sense; it is vehement reasoning, without any appearance of art; it is disdain,
                    anger, boldness, freedom, involved in a continued stream of argument; and, of
                    all human productions, the orations of Demosthenes present to us the models
                    which approach the nearest to perfection.”</p>
                <p>It would be easy, if our limits allowed us, to indicate, in every one of the
                    political orations of Demosthenes, instances illustrating his favourite and
                    characteristic methods of influencing his hearers ;—his striking and lively
                    narratives of interesting facts, like the scene at Athens on the taking of
                    Elatea, painted in the oration for the Crown ;—the happy illustrations from
                    familiar life which abound everywhere ;— the metaphors few and brief, and
                    effective in proportion to their briefness and rarity, like the example in the
                    first Philippic, where Philip is represented as a hunter, and the Athenians as
                    his prey lying quietly within the toils ;—those tremendous invectives launched
                    by turns against Philip and his Athenian partisans ;—those apparently
                    unpremeditated bursts of feeling, in which every strong emotion, personal or
                    political, in the minds of the audience, is awakened by an honest, indignant,
                    conversational remonstrance,—a class of appeals exemplified in the celebrated
                    reproach to the Athenians for their newsmonging indolence, while events the most
                    extraordinary were summoning them loudly to action (introduced originally in the
                    first Philippic, and again more briefly in the speech on Philip’s Letter);—and
                    those grandest and most sustained flights of all, in which the nationality of
                    Greece, and of Attica, the proudest tribe of Grecians, is at once aroused and
                    flattered by the most dramatic exhibitions of their ancient glory and greatness.
                    For those who wish to see most of the orator’s characteristics developed within
                    a moderate compass, none of the orations perhaps is better suited than the third
                    Philippic. His favourite paradoxical argument, that the utter wretchedness of
                    the Athenian affairs at that juncture, caused, as it had been, by their own
                    shameful inactivity, gave them truly the best reason to hope for success on a
                    change of measures,—is followed by an argument, not unlike Canning’s in 1826 for
                    the war with Spain, in which the speaker maintains that peace is unattainable
                    from the position and character of the enemy, whose treachery is exemplified in
                    a style of the most powerful irony: the arbitrary government of Philip, and its
                    results, are set in strong contrast to the nature and consequences of the
                    liberal supremacy which Athens, Sparta, and Thebes, had by turns exercised over
                    the free states of Greece: a bitterly contemptuous simile, the celebrated one of
                    the heir and the slave, introduces a noble parallel between ancient honesty and
                    modern corruption: the story of Euphraeus adds individual interest to the
                    general picture of the misusage of the Greeks by Philip, which receives its
                    finishing touches in the indignantly sarcastic description of the fate which had
                    befallen Philip’s submissive victims, the men of Oreum and Eretria: and the
                    brief practical Summary of advices which closes the speech is ushered in by a
                    declaration which the speaker thunders in the ears of the Athenian people, with
                    the majesty of a king commanding his subjects—that if all mankind should consent
                    to be slaves, the struggle for liberty must still be maintained by them, who of
                    old had been so proudly illustrious and free.</p>
                <p>But both Demosthenes and Aeschines may be studied to most advantage in the extant
                    orations delivered by each of them on two occasions, in which their personal
                    character and fortunes were at stake. The former of the two was that on which
                    Demosthenes impeached his rival for corruption and misconduct in the famous
                    Embassy to Philip. His speech in support of the accusation is as characteristic
                    as any of his which we possess, and, while it abounds with his other
                    excellencies, is particularly happy in its wealth of picturesque and pointed
                    incident; Philip’s oath in the tavern, the anecdote of Satyrus, the supper of
                    Phaidimos, and the melancholy group of the Olynthian prisoners, being singularly
                    beautiful examples of this kind. The answer of Aeschines is yet finer, being,
                    indeed, the acknowledged masterpiece of that, most skilful and eloquent orator,
                    whose fame, but, for the overshadowing neighbourhood of his immortal rival,
                    would have grown up higher and more widely than that of any other public speaker
                    of the ancient world. But these two orations on the β-α^αiΓfsi⅛ι∕α, as they are
                    usually called, are not so well fitted to become rhetorical exercises <pb
                    break="no" facs="ht:wu.89119129625&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=227"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0719-0227-0217"/>as the other two, being the Orations on the Crown,
                    or the accusation and defence of Ctesiphon. Upon these we must enter more
                    minutely, the latter being by far the most admirable of Demosthenes’s works.</p>
                <p>While the Athenians were engaged in their struggle against Philip, Ctesiphon had
                    moved and carried in the assembly of the people a decree for honouring
                    Demosthenes with a civic crown, as a benefactor of his country. After the battle
                    of Chaeronaea had made Greece truly a province of Macedon, Philip and his son,
                    by a very sound policy, allowed the Greek citizens to fight out their old
                    political quarrels; and Athens continued to be torn in pieces by her two
                    factions, as incessantly as when the one, headed by Demosthenes, had opposed
                    Philip to the death, and the other, actuated by very various motives, and led by
                    Aeschines in alliance with the virtuous Phocion and others of the aristocratic
                    party, had urged early submission to the conqueror. The latter faction eagerly
                    seized Ctesiphon’s decree as a means of crushing Demosthenes. It was grossly and
                    undeniably illegal in two respects; having been issued before Demosthenes had
                    given in his accounts for certain public offices which he then held, and having
                    directed the proclamation of the honour to be made in the theatre, not in one of
                    the national assemblies; both of which acts were forbidden by subsisting laws.
                    If, then, the sole end had been to procure a conviction against Ctesiphon, and
                    if the court appointed to try him had been well informed and impartial, the
                    issue could not have been for a moment doubtful. The court, however, possessed
                    neither of these qualifications; and, moreover, although Ctesiphon was nominally
                    the person impeached, yet the sentence against him was avowedly intended to be
                    used as a vote of censure on the whole political conduct of Demosthenes, and the
                    proceedings would not, to the slightest extent, have answered the purpose of
                    their promoters unless this should be their understood result. On this ground
                    both parties prepared to fight the battle; and the contest, prompted by party
                    spirit and personal animosity, involving in its decision no great political
                    question, and debased in its progress by number-less instances of calumny and
                    malevolence on both sides, has nevertheless given us two such specimens of
                    eloquence as neither judicial nor political oratory has equalled before or
                    since.</p>
                <p>Those who recollect that this was the real state of the question, will admire the
                    skill and judgment exhibited by Aeschines in conducting his argument in support
                    of the accusation; in which, if we are to believe that the parties understood
                    Ctesiphon to be the real and only defendant, he cannot be absolved from the
                    charge of having made a most injudicious, and indeed partially irrelevant choice
                    of topics, and of having by his line of remark wilfully drawn upon himself the
                    triumphant reply of his adversary.</p>
                <p>The exordium is simple, but very fine: it contains a complaint of factious and
                    unlawful exertions made by the opposite party, and of an inveterate disuse of
                    certain old regulations, which disuse had enabled demagogues to carry laws
                    destructive of the constitution: it declares the right of impeaching the
                    proposers of such measures to be the only remaining safeguard of the state: and
                    it concludes with an animated address, calling on the judges to deal fearlessly
                    with the cause, as the sworn administrators of justice and as citizens intrusted
                    with the protection of the laws and of freedom, like soldiers placed in the
                    front of the battle.</p>
                <p>The speaker instantly passes to the strong part of his case,—a clear exposition
                    of the several laws which Ctesiphon’s decree was alleged to have transgressed, a
                    proof from the public records that the decree had in fact violated those
                    enactments, and a statement and refutation of every sophism by which the
                    adversary could be conceived likely to support the plea that the laws did not
                    apply to the notorious facts. His argument, in all its parts, is completely
                    unanswerable; but it occupies barely a sixth part of the oration; and the words
                    of the decree, assigning as reasons for the honour conferred on Demosthenes, his
                    virtue, his courage, and his constant pursuit of the true weal of the state,
                    give the cue for the commencement of the attack upon him, the real object of the
                    prosecution. The nominal defendant is dropped as an incumbrance, and the orator
                    girds himself manfully for the serious part of the onset. We cannot follow him
                    through the details of his enemy’s political conduct, private life, doubtful
                    pedigree, and faulty oratory, all of which are described with a plausible
                    minuteness, and with the keenest sarcasm. Political folly is the slightest of
                    the charges: Demosthenes is accused, at every step, of political dishonesty,—of
                    peculation and corruption,—of favour to the Persian king, and co-operation with
                    his views, a charge which was quite true and quite creditable to the accused,
                    but was as skilfully chosen for rousing Athenian prejudices as a charge of
                    combination with France would have been for exciting an English mob in 1793,—and
                    (which sounds rather oddly) he is roundly taxed with a secret attachment to the
                    Macedonian interest, and with the secret acceptance of bribes from Philip. There
                    were two points in which Aeschines had a strong hold on his antagonist, and with
                    which he therefore taunts him incessantly: the unhappy issue of the war with
                    Philip, which, it is again and again asserted, had been wholly caused by the
                    policy of Demosthenes; and that orator’s unfortunate deficiency in personal
                    courage, which had prompted him to a disgraceful flight at the battle of
                    Chaeronaea. There are many fine passages in the earlier parts of this long
                    review; but the orator does not begin to rise steadily till, in closing the main
                    section of his argument under this head, he recalls the glory of the Persian
                    times, and contrasts the simple honours which rewarded the patriotism of
                    Miltiades, Aristides, and the soldiers who conquered in the battle of the
                    Strymon, with the profuse decorations now every day lavished on the chiefs of
                    petty factions.</p>
                <p>He then reminds the judges that, after all, from the terms of those articles of
                    impeachment which they sat there to try, even his failure in convincing them
                    that Demosthenes was a bad man and a bad citizen would not entitle Ctesi-phon to
                    an acquittal, since his decree, as proved in the first part of the argument, was
                    at any rate manifestly illegal: he urges them to insist on Ctesiphon or his
                    advocate keeping closely to the point; and he exhorts them yet more strenuously
                    to compel his adherence to the division of the argument which Aeschines had laid
                    down, and still more parti-cularly to the order of the topics adopted in that
                    division. He now proceeds with increased rapidity and vehemence. He anticipates
                    Demosthenes’s passionate style of address, cautions the judges against its
                    effects, and endeavours to render it ridiculous by mimicry. He answers by
                    anticipation, and with much manliness and candour, though with severe
                    recrimination, the personal abuse which he professed to be certain that
                    Demosthenes would heap upon him.</p>
                <p>He then, entering on his peroration, passes to a summary of the whole argument,
                    amounting to this, that the decree was illegal, and that, although it had been
                    perfectly regular, Demosthenes was utterly unworthy of the honours which it
                    conferred. He thence rises into one of the noblest and most effective
                    exhortations which the records of oratory have to exhibit; opening with
                    skilfully chosen instances of the severity with which the existing laws had
                    recently punished citizens who deserted their country, as Demosthenes had
                    deserted his place in battle and his duty as an adviser of the state; reminding
                    the judges of those feelings of shame with which the Athenians would appear in
                    the presence of Greece at the approaching national convocation, if they should
                    have failed to brand with infamy the destroyer of their country; and closing
                    with what is perhaps the very grandest extant example of solemn imaginative
                    eloquence.</p>

                <p>He calls on the judges to conceive the wise and good of old as rising and
                    surrounding the tribunal,—Solon entreating the judges to respect their oaths and
                    the laws,—Aristides in anguish deploring the perversion of justice. “Think ye
                    not,” exclaims he in conclusion, “think ye not that Themistocles, and they who
                    died at Marathon and at Plataea,— ay, and the very graves of your
                    forefathers,—will utter groans, if he who avows that he conspired with the
                    barbarians against the Greeks shall be publicly honoured by your decree ?” It is
                    provoking to be compelled to add, that this admirable close does not conclude
                    the oration. A few common-place words of application would have wound up the
                    discourse in the usual way; and these accordingly Aes-chines does not fail to
                    insert; but not till, with the sound of his own magnificent exorcism still
                    ringing in his ears, he has marred everything by a tragic invocation of the
                    earth and the sun, and virtue, and intelligence, and instruction, conceived in
                    the very worst taste of Euripides, all but non sensical in itself, misplaced in
                    any oration, and in this a most humiliating spectacle of incorrect judgment
                    degrading and disarming genius.</p>
                <p>Every one knows what was the issue of the contest.</p>
                <p>Ctesiphon was acquitted; and his accuser, having failed in gaining the number of
                    votes which would have protected the charge from being considered frivolous and
                    malicious, was fined, and compelled to go into exile. We do not possess such
                    materials as enable us to judge of the relative strength of the two factions
                    among the numerous judges who pronounced this decision; but the splendid oration
                    of Demosthenes for the defence, now perused by us under every possible
                    disadvantage, would tempt us to believe that, in an audience so volatile and
                    susceptible as the Athenians, who were confessedly on many occasions impelled
                    hither and thither by the orators at their will, even party-spirit may for once
                    have been compelled to deny its own nature, and to become silent and
                    impartial.</p>
                <p>The oration of Demosthenes, admirable though it be, will not call for a more
                    minute analysis than that of Aeschines; both because it is better known and more
                    generally accessible, and because its strain may in part be anticipated from the
                    outline which has just been given. Many of its most striking beauties we must
                    pass unnoticed, and we can but indicate one or two others; such as the skill of
                    insinuation throughout, with which the orator endeavours at once to kindle the
                    feelings of his own party, and to conciliate those of the other; the frequent
                    felicity of illustration, as where he compares Aeschines to a physician, who,
                    after having watched his patient through a long sickness, propounds his remedies
                    for the first time on the day of the funeral; the fine sketches of character,
                    like that noble one of Philip, crippled in every member of his body, but
                    unsubdued in mind, and burning with the love of power and honour.</p>
                <p>The Exordium is exceedingly skilful. After briefly claiming credit for good will,
                    the speaker protests, with a very well acted indignation, against the attempt of
                    his adversary to bind him to a particular order of topics, which, he asserts,
                    the judges cannot countenance without violating their oath and every principle
                    of justice: he then, after adverting to his own disadvantages, declares with
                    artful earnestness, that the turn which Aeschines had given to the accusation
                    had, as he now found, put the character of Demosthenes himself distinctly in
                    issue, forcing him, whether he would or not, to defend the whole tenor of his
                    public life: he asserts peremptorily, that if Aeschines had confined himself to
                    the matters really suggested by the articles of impeachment, he, in the defence,
                    would have entered at once on the question of the legality of the decree, but
                    that he was now obliged to follow a different course in order to dispel
                    unfounded prejudices: and he closes his introduction by insinuations against the
                    accuser, both for his long delay in bringing the charge, and for the form in
                    which it was at length presented.</p>
                <p>He commences the body of the oration by intimating his intention to answer
                    specifically each article of the charge, after he shall have premised a general
                    view of the state of affairs when he first entered on political life. We cannot
                    follow him through the details by which he redeems, or seems to redeem, this
                    promise; but two or three points may be selected as prominently instructive.
                    Indignant denials of unproved charges are thrown out at the very commencement,
                    and accompanied by that overwhelming strength of recrimination which is exerted
                    in almost every page of the whole speech: again and again, from the very opening
                    of the argument, he protests that his line of reasoning had been forced on him
                    by his adversary; and not till after he had endeavoured to destroy the whole
                    credit of the accuser, by repeated and detailed charges of gross dishonesty and
                    corruption, does he venture to approach the articles of impeachment themselves.
                    At length he recites them, and enters on his answer; but, protesting once more
                    against the accuser’s tactics, he professes himself compelled to defend, in the
                    first place, that part of the decree which sets forth his own character, which
                    he vindicates by a long and animated history. He then, with a contemptuous
                    negligence of expression, intimates that there seems to be no other task left
                    him, than to prove the strict legality of the decree, in favour of which he
                    delivers an argument extending to about one twentieth part of the whole
                    discourse. On this point, which was the one formally at issue, his defence is as
                    lame as can well be conceived: Aeschines, indeed, by his arguments in
                    anticipation, had beaten away from beneath his feet all the ground on which he
                    could have hoped to stand: one such plea, however, from the existence of a
                    contradictory law, he does plausibly support; and one unanticipated ground which
                    he urges, intended as a denial of the fact, proves, on close examination, to
                    amount nearly to this, that although he had not accounted when the decree was
                    passed, he had done so before the accusation was brought, and his accounts had
                    not been challenged.</p>
                <p>But the great orator, strong as was his faith in the legal inaptitude and
                    factious prepossessions of the judges, dared not to close his case on such
                    sophisms as this; and accordingly, when he leaves the question as to the
                    legality of the decree, never again to mention it, the oration is not quite half
                    over. He immediately resumes his former detail of facts, grappling, however,
                    more and more closely with Aeschines, and following up every proof of his own
                    patriotism and sagacity with a stinging contrast between his conduct and that of
                    his enemy. Of the two points on which his argument was weakest, the one, his own
                    personal courage, does not draw from him a single word; but the other, the
                    undeniable failure of the policy which he had advised, it behoved him to touch;
                    and as it was a matter in which, till some answer should be attempted, there
                    might prevail in the minds of the audience a lurking conviction ruinous to
                    Demosthenes and his cause, he summons up all his energies to dislodge the
                    impression, introducing the subject boldly almost immediately after he had
                    dismissed the legal argument, and disposing of it in one of his noblest appeals
                    to national pride and the sense of honour. This magnificent passage of the
                    speech is composed in the same lofty key in which we heard the orator closing
                    the third Philippic: it rolls on in a mingled flood of rapid illustration, of
                    proudly patriotic spirit, and of declarations of that love of freedom which must
                    burn in Athens though all the world besides were dark; and it is terminated by
                    the tremendous oath, in which the brave who had died in battle for their country
                    are called as witnesses to the truth of the principles which the speaker
                    maintained. This most eloquent and celebrated passage is not an argument: it
                    will bear no analysis as such; but it is one of the most strongly felt and
                    admirably wrought of all addresses to the feelings of national honour, pride,
                    and independence. The alterna<pb break="no"

                    unfairness of the comparison proposed by rEschines, between the honours of the
                    ancient times and those now conferred.</p>
                <p>A short peroration follows, in which Demosthenes, without attempting any summary,
                    claims for himself, and denies to his rival, credit for possessing what he
                    maintains to be the two principal qualifications of a good citizen; namely,
                    unchangeable love for his country, and a constant inclination to prompt his
                    countrymen to noble and ambitious deeds. The foreign faction are then painted
                    with a few bold and hurried strokes; and the oration closes with a prayer to the
                    gods to convert them if they will be converted, and if they will not, to cut
                    them off from among the people, destroying a few men that the nation may be
                    saved.</p>
                <p>We had designed to attempt exhibiting the eloquence of the great Attic masters in
                    a yet stronger light, by contrasting it with specimens from the lowest ages of
                    Greek oratory; and for that purpose we had selected one or two disputations of
                    the learned and skilful sophist Libanius, the panegyrist of Julian the Apostate.
                    Want of space, however, compels us to abandon this intention; and as the same
                    cause prevents us from entering minutely on the Orations of Cicero, we prefer
                    leaving these altogether untouched, to passing them with a few vague
                    generalities. The characteristics of Cicero’s admirable eloquence, and the
                    differences between it and that of Demosthenes, are matters familiar to every
                    one; and the study of the Latin orator is more common than that of the Greek,
                    nearly in the inverse proportion of the real merits of the two.</p>

                    Grattan, Erskine, and Sheridan; and we pause at the threshold of the present
                    age, naming no man who is still alive.</p>
                <p>But of the political orators who have preceded the present The three time both in
                    the last century and this, by far the most re-great ora-markable, in a merely
                    rhetorical point of view, were these <hi rend="superscript">tors-</hi> three;
                    Chatham, Burke, and Canning.</p>
                <p>Very many of Chatham’s speeches are unreported; many The elo-of the earlier ones
                    have reached us with much distortion; quence of and there are but a very few in
                    which we can believe our- ^ <hi rend="superscript">orci</hi> *-**at-selves to be
                    listening throughout to the exact words of the <hi rend="superscript">ham</hi> ‘
                    speaker. But enough remains to convince us that Chatham was the most powerful
                    and striking political orator whom our country has ever produced. His celebrated
                    youthful retort to the elder Horace Walpole bears unequivocal marks of being, in
                    the shape in which we possess it, the manufacture of Samuel Johnson; and we have
                    scarcely any speech completely and genuinely reported, which was delivered
                    before his fiftieth year. In the orations succeeding that time, our recollection
                    of the speaker’s age and lofty position in the state prepares our minds to
                    harmonize with the tone of address, and to consider that as noble boldness,
                    which in a younger and meaner man might have received another name. The tone is
                    never varied; it is always uncompromising, stern, and admonitory: the speaker is
                    not an advocate devising means to conciliate and persuade, but a preacher of
                    truth and right, denouncing judgments on political transgression. Chatham’s mind
                    never grew old; to the last hour of his public life the feelings glowed as
                    passionately, and prompted images as vivid, and alternately checked, and
                    impelled, and transformed the language, in figures as abrupt and varied, as in
                    the morning of his youth and dawning ambition; the sickness and decay of the
                    body were overcome by the resistless energy of the fiery soul; and the British
                    House of Lords trembled before the cripple who stood up feebly in the midst of
                    them, to grow strong as he spoke by the impulse of his own fervent imagination.
                    The idol of Chatham’s mind was the baronial constitution of England as confirmed
                    in Magna Charta, which, indeed, with the Petition and Bill of Rights, he himself
                    called the Englishman’s political bible: all the strong and diversified powers
                    of his intellect, in observation, judgment, and rapidly convincing argument, and
                    all the array of his chivalrously generous feelings, did continual homage at the
                    one sacred shrine: attempts from below to widen the area of the political
                    edifice, that the mass of the people might come in, the aristocratic Whig would
                    have laughed to scorn: insidious endeavours from above and within to shake the
                    pillars of the temple, roused him repeatedly to overwhelming indignation.</p>
                <p>His eloquence found its most favourable field of display in two questions of his
                    time: the famous elections of Wilkes for Middlesex, which were made the occasion
                    of fierce debates as to the constitutional rights of the subject; and the more
                    <pb break="no" facs="ht:wu.89119129625&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=230"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0719-0230-0220"/>important discussions"on the American war. The
                    former of these themes, in which Chatham stood, forth as the champion of the
                    people against the supposed usurpation of the House of Commons, drew from him
                    some of his most electric flashes of passion and imagery. One is the speech in
                    1770, on the Marquis of Rockingham’s motion for an inquiry into the state of the
                    nation; in which occurs the splendid passage beginning with the bold prayer for
                    the prevalence of discord, if freedom could not otherwise be preserved, thence
                    passing to the parallel between the scriptural records and the charters of the
                    English constitution, and ending with the stern allusion to the value which the
                    Revolution of 1688 possessed as a warning to succeeding British monarchs. But it
                    is to the American question that we owe his finest speeches; and on this subject
                    we have a series of harangues, exhibiting in admirable union the intellectual,
                    the imaginative, and the passionate elements of oratory, and invaluable to the
                    student, both for their high rank in these points of excellence, for the pointed
                    nervousness of the style, and for the singular force and nature of the
                    rhetorical figures,—indignant interrogation, sudden self-correction, and anxious
                    and solemn repetition. The finest of all is undoubtedly the speech on the
                    address to the throne in November 1777. But no parliamentary speech whatever is
                    more interesting, or more honourable to the speaker, than the extemporaneous
                    address elicited from the old man in the same year, by the ministerial defence
                    of the employment of the Indians in America. In the imperfectly reported speech
                    which he delivered on that memorable evening, his last in public life, when he
                    fell down in convulsions, on rising to reply to the attacks of the Duke of
                    Richmond, he related the whole history of the war with America; he repeated the
                    predictions which he had himself day after day pronounced as warnings to the
                    state; and, like a dying prophet reproaching an unbelieving generation, he
                    followed his recital of every prediction by the words, “And so it proved !”</p>
                <p>Burke’s speeches and political pamphlets compose by far the most valuable body of
                    lessons in eloquence which our language possesses. They instruct us sometimes by
                    those failures into which the orator was betrayed by his teeming, imaginative,
                    and exciteable genius; but they teach us at least as often by examples of the
                    most signal and splendid success. As Burke, more than any other of our
                    statesmen, nourished the ambition of rivalling ancient eloquence, so his works,
                    in the variety of their oratorical qualities, and in the finish which they
                    frequently exhibit, do unquestionably come nearer than any others to the ancient
                    character. They are, it is true, in their prevailing manner, more like to the
                    ornate and redundant elocution of Cicero, than to the severe simplicity of the
                    great Athenian; but some of their happiest images and thoughts are derived from
                    Demosthenes, and some equally happy are not unworthy of him. Burke’s style,
                    while it is highly argumentative, is distinguished, beyond that of any other
                    political writer or speaker, for the continual distrust which it exhibits in the
                    hearers’ ability or willingness to follow trains of pure argument: the
                    imagination is constantly excited by illustration and imagery: and, to use our
                    rhetorical terminology, the favourite argument is the example, instances real
                    and fictitious being crowded upon each other, as if the speaker were resolutely
                    determined to appropriate one to every individual who listened to him; and the
                    argument being at length usually closed by a strongly worded aphorism, sometimes
                    true and as often erroneous, very seldom logically proved by the arguments which
                    have preceded it, but always strikingly illustrated by them, and exhibited in
                    the most conciliating and attractive light. Perhaps Burke’s oratorical skill and
                    genius are not anywhere displayed so remarkably as in his Reflections on the
                    Revolution of France, in which the writer, besides the prejudice to which he
                    exposed himself by his sudden change of party, had another and stronger
                    disadvantage in his own mind; namely, that of defending and representing as
                    paramount a series of principles in politics and legislation, which, if he had
                    not substantively denied their truth, he had at least, in common with his party,
                    always represented as subordinate to other principles which it was now his task
                    to decry. But the man of genius did not shrink from the undertaking, and the
                    powers of his remarkable mind bore him triumphantly through it; for no discourse
                    could have been more skilfully conducted, or better calculated to make a strong
                    impression. He even labours again and again to enlist in his new cause those
                    feelings in favour of constitutional freedom, which he had so long been
                    accustomed to rally round him; but he rests his hopes of success mainly on the
                    excitement of other ideas and feelings, which he paints to the fancy in colours
                    as bright as any in which his pencil was ever dipped. The horror of bloodshed,
                    attachment to order, and fear of anarchy, now hold in the writer’s mind that
                    prevailing place which had formerly belonged to the hatred of despotism and the
                    love of freedom: the sentiment of chivalrous devotion to kings and ladies is
                    aroused by that beautifully and pathetically romantic picture of the Queen of
                    France as the morning star: the departure of the ancient days of knightly
                    strength and honour is seriously and warmly deplored; their very vices, it is
                    declared, have given place to others worse, and their religious superstition is
                    boldly preferred to the philosophical superstition of the modern sceptics. Among
                    Burke’s speeches, the masterpieces are admittedly those on the impeachment of
                    Warren Hastings, which compose a field too wide to be here surveyed. Of the
                    minor speeches there is scarcely one that is not both characteristic and highly
                    instructive. None of them possesses greater variety than the speech of 1775 for
                    Conciliation with America; the beauties of which it is not easy to select :—the
                    vision of the guardian angel, who, drawing aside a curtain, displays the glories
                    of Britain in sunshine, darkened but by one faint and distant spot (an image
                    which, like many others of the same speaker, hovers on the very verge of poetry,
                    and can scarcely have been successful in the House of Commons); the picturesque
                    description of the kingdom of the backwoodsmen; the animated appeals to English
                    freedom and free habits, like that in which he tells his hearers, that if they
                    preach unconstitutional doctrines to the Americans, their English speech will
                    betray them; the bold figures by which he introduces the resolutions which he
                    was to move; and the classical image of the temple of peace, with which the
                    oration closes. The speech of 1780, on Economical Reform, is at once manly,
                    practical, and well reasoned, and full of the most happily-conceived ridicule.
                    The celebrated speech at Bristol, and that on Fox’s East India Bill, although
                    possessing high oratorical merit, and abounding with fine passages, are yet less
                    valuable to the student than to the politician. The speech on the Nabob of
                    Arcot’s Debts exhibits Burke at once in his full strength, and with much of his
                    weakness; it is full of pertinent inferences from granted facts; rich in
                    picturesque oriental imagery; and adorned by a profusion of oratorical figures,
                    varying in character and success from the grand image of Hyder Ali and the cloud
                    (after Demosthenes), down to the familiar one which represents the minister as
                    sowing corruption broadcast, and the disgusting one in which one of the orator’s
                    most disliked adversaries is compared to the most unclean of animals.</p>
                <p>Of Canning we mean to say very little, besides recommending his speeches to the
                    student as exceedingly instructive lessons. They are in the hands, and familiar
                    to the recollection, of every one; and no estimate of their merits could be
                    complete which should not analyse, by way of comparison, the oratory of one or
                    more of his rivals who have not yet quitted the scene. In Canning’s speeches,
                    the <pb break="no" facs="ht:wu.89119129625&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=231"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0719-0231-0221"/>orator seldom rises into strong passion himself,
                    and never elevates the audience along with him: the loftiest atmosphere in which
                    he ever moves is that of noble and generous feeling, expressed with warmth
                    enough to kindle its glow in the breasts of others, but never so warmly as
                    Undeprive either them or the speaker of perfect self-possession. The direct and
                    ultimate appeal to the imagination is practised much oftener and more boldly,
                    and, in many beautiful and poetical pictures, is conducted with singular taste
                    and success: a keen and playful wit, now veiled in irony, now half disguised in
                    bitter sarcasm, and now shedding a fiery shower of open invective, is everywhere
                    present, and almost everywhere holds a prominent place; and the oration,
                    considered as an address to the understanding, is always clear and well
                    reasoned, generally close and pointed, and often, in dealing with difficult
                    materials, distinguished by consummate rhetorical skill. Of Canning’s ingenuity
                    in debating a delicate and hazardous question, we can desire no better instance
                    than his eloquent and most skilful argument against Parliamentary Reform,
                    delivered at the election dinner at Liverpool in 1818. The most passionate
                    specimens of his eloquence are contained in some of his speeches on Catholic
                    Emancipation; and his genius probably nowhere displayed its powers so
                    commandingly as in two of its latest efforts, the speech and reply on the
                    projected invasion of Portugal by Spain, delivered in December 1826. (b. l.)</p>
