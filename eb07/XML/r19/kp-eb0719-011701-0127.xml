                <p><label type="entry">REMPHAN</label> an idol or god whom St Stephen says the</p>
                <p>Israelites worshipped in the wilderness as they passed from</p>
                <p>Egypt to the Land of Promise. “Yea, ye took up the tabernacle of Moloch, and the
                    star of your god <hi rend="italic">Remphan;</hi> figures which ye made to
                    worship them.” That the martyr here quotes the following words of the prophet
                    Amos, all commentators are agreed: “Ye have borne the tabernacle of your Moloch,
                    and <hi rend="italic">Chiun</hi> your images, the star of your god, which ye
                    made to yourselves.” But if this coincidence between the Clnistian preacher and
                    the Jewish prophet be admitted, it follows that <hi rend="italic">Chiun</hi> and
                    <hi rend="italic">Remphan</hi> are two names of one and the same deity. This
                    indeed is further evident from the Septuagint translators having substituted in
                    their version the word Pα∕βαι&gt;, instead of <hi rend="italic">Chiun,</hi>
                    which we read in the Hebrew and English Bibles. But the question which still
                    remains to be answered is, What god was worshipped by the name of <hi
                    rend="italic">Remphan, Raiphaft,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Chiun?</hi></p>
                <p>That <hi rend="italic">Chitin</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Remphan</hi> was an
                    Egyptian divinity, cannot be questioned; for at the era of the Exodus the
                    Hebrew’s must have been strangers to the idolatrous worship of all other
                    nations; nor are they ever accused of any other than Egyptian idolatries during
                    their forty years’ wanderings in the wilderness, till towards the end of that
                    period, when they became infected by the Moabites with the worship of <hi
                    rend="italic">Baal-peor.</hi> That <hi rend="italic">Moloch, Moleh, Melek,</hi>
                    or <hi rend="italic">Mil-com,</hi> in its original acceptation, denotes a king
                    or chief, is known to every oriental scholar; and therefore, when it is used as
                    the name of a god, it undoubtedly signifies the <hi rend="italic">Sun,</hi> and
                    is the same divinity with the Egyptian <hi rend="italic">Ra, Ré,</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">Phrc.</hi> Reasoning in this way, many critics, and we believe
                    Selden amongst the number, have concluded that <hi rend="italic">Chian,</hi> and
                    of course <hi rend="italic">Remphan,</hi> is the planet Saturn; because <hi
                    rend="italic">Chiun</hi> is written <hi rend="italic">Ciun, Cevan, Ceuan,
                    Chevvin,</hi> all of which are modern oriental names of that planet.</p>
                <p>But against this hypothesis insurmountable objections present themselves. It is
                    universally allowed that the first objects of idolatrous worship were the Sun
                    and Moon, considered as the king and queen of heaven. The fixed stars, indeed,
                    and the planets, were afterwards gradually admitted into the Pagan Pantheon; but
                    we may be sure that these would be' first associated with the two prime
                    luminaries which most resembled them in brightness, and were supposed to be most
                    benignant to man. The planet Saturn, however, appears to the naked eye with so
                    feeble a lustre, that, in the infancy of astronomy, it could not make such an
                    impression on the mind as to excite that admiration which we must conceive to
                    have always preceded planetary worship. It is to be observed, too, that by the
                    Pagan writers of antiquity Saturn is constantly represented as a star of baleful
                    influence. He is termed the <hi rend="italic">leaden planet;</hi> the <hi
                    rend="italic">planet of malevolent aspect;</hi> the <hi rend="italic"
                    >dismal,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">inhuman star.</hi> That the Egyptians, at so
                    early a period as that under consideration, should have adored as one of their
                    greatest gods a planet obscure in its appearance, distant in its situation, and
                    baleful in its influence, is wholly incredible.</p>
                <p>There is another star, however, which they might naturally adore, and which we
                    know they actually did worship, as one of their most beneficent gods, at a very
                    early period. This is the citfrgaxu⅛w or <hi rend="italic">&lt;supt&gt;i</hi> of
                    the Greeks, the <hi rend="italic">canis</hi> or <hi rend="italic">stella
                    canicularis</hi> of the Romans, and the <hi rend="italic">dog-star</hi> of
                    modern Europe. By the Egyptians it was called <hi rend="italic">Sothis</hi> or
                    <hi rend="italic">Soth,</hi> which signifies safety, beneficence, fecundity; and
                    it received this name because, making its appearance in the heavens at the very
                    time when the Nile overflowed the country, it was supposed to regulate the
                    inundation. On this account, Plutarch tells us, they believed the soul of their
                    illustrious benefactress Isis to have transmigrated into the star Sothis, which
                    they therefore worshipped as the divinity which rendered their country fruitful.
                    It made its appearance, too, on the first day of the month called <hi
                    rend="italic">Thoth,</hi><note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>This was the case at a very remote period; but it is otherwise at present,
                    owing to the precession of the Equinoxes. </p></note> which was the beginning of
                    the Egyptian year, and as such celebrated with feasting and festivity; and being
                    by far the brightest star in the heavens, Horus Apollo informs us that it was
                    considered as sovereign over the rest. A combination of so many important
                    circumstances might have induced a people less superstitious than the Egyptians
                    to pay divine homage to that glorious luminary, which was confounded with Isis,
                    who had been long regarded with the highest veneration; and as Isis was the wife
                    and sister of Osiris, and always associated with him, the star of Isis or
                    Remphan was naturally associated with Moloch, the same with Osiris.</p>
                <p>But it will be asked, how the star which by the Egyptians was called Soth or
                    Sothis came to be worshipped by the Hebrews under the appellation of <hi
                    rend="italic">Chiun</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Remphan.</hi> This is a pertinent
                    question, and we shall endeavour to answer it.</p>
                <p>Every one knows that the pronunciation of oriental w0rd3 is very uncertain; and
                    that as the vowels were often omitted in writing, it is of very little
                    importance to the meaning how they be supplied, provided we retain the radical
                    consonants. The word <hi rend="italic">Chiun</hi> may with equal propriety be
                    written <hi rend="italic">Kiun, Kion,</hi> or even <hi rend="italic">Kyon,</hi>
                    the HebrewJod being convertible into the Greek <hi rend="italic">u</hi> or the
                    Roman <hi rend="italic">y;</hi> but the words <hi rend="italic">Cane, Chan,
                    Kan,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Khan,</hi> which are often diversified into <hi
                    rend="italic">Khen, Kyn, Cohen, Cahan,</hi> signifying <hi rend="italic">head,
                    chief, prince,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">king,</hi> are diffused throughout a
                    great part of Asia and Europe. In the Chinese language <hi rend="italic"
                    >Quin,</hi> which signifies a <hi rend="italic">king,</hi> is so similar to the
                    word <hi rend="italic">Chiun</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Khiun</hi> under
                    consideration, that no etymologist will hesitate to pronounce them of the same
                    origin and import. The W'ord <hi rend="italic">Kan</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >Khan</hi> is universally known to be an honorary title in Tar-tary; and <hi
                    rend="italic">Kaian</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Kain,</hi> which is manifestly a
                    cognate of the word <hi rend="italic">Chinn</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Kiun,</hi>
                    is, in the Pahlavi, or old Persian language, the epithet applied to the dynasty
                    of princes which succeeded Cyrus the Great Amongst the Scythians or ancient
                    Tartars, <hi rend="italic">Ghiun</hi> signifies the Sun and likewise the day;
                    and <hi rend="italic">Kung, Kinung, Kun,</hi> runs through all the dialects of
                    the Gothic tongue, everywhere denoting a chief or sovereign. In the Syrian
                    dialect, <hi rend="italic">Kon</hi> signifies a prince; and hence the Almighty
                    is styled (Gen. xiv. 19) <hi rend="italic">Konah,</hi> which is translated <hi
                    rend="italic">possessor,</hi> but might, with perhaps more propriety, have been
                    rendered sovereign of heaven and earth. In the Hebrew, the word <hi
                    rend="italic">Kahan</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Kahen,</hi> which is the same with
                    <hi rend="italic">Khan</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Kan,</hi> signifies either a
                    priest or a prince; and in ancient Egypt <hi rend="italic">Kon</hi> was the name
                    of the first Hercules, or the Sun. Hence the same word in composition denotes
                    greatness, as <hi rend="italic">Can-obus,</hi> the great serpent; <hi
                    rend="italic">Canathoth,</hi> the great <hi rend="italic">Thoth</hi> or Mercury;
                    <hi rend="italic">Canosiris,</hi> the great <hi rend="italic">Osiris.</hi></p>
                <p>From this deduction we may conclude that the'word, which is found in so many
                    tongues, and always denotes chief, prince, or sovereign, is the very word <hi
                    rend="italic">Chiun</hi> which the Egyptians and Hebrews applied to Sothis, as
                    being, in their conceptions, the chief or sovereign of all the stars. This will
                    appear still more probable, when we have ascertained the import of the word <hi
                    rend="italic">Remphan,</hi> or, as the Seventy-two have it, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Raiphan.</hi></p>
                <pb break="no" facs="ht:wu.89119129625&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=128"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0719-0128-0118"/>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Phan,</hi> the latter part of this word, is unquestionably the
                    same with <hi rend="italic">Pan,</hi> the most ancient of the Egyptian gods. It
                    is likewise a cognate of the Hebrew Phanah, <hi rend="italic">conspexit,
                    spectavit, vidit;</hi> and the radical word seems to be Phah, or Phthah, which
                    signifies sometimes the countenance, and sometimes light. Hence <hi
                    rend="italic">Phaethon,</hi> which is compounded of <hi rend="italic">pha,</hi>
                    light; <hi rend="italic">eût</hi> or esA, fire; and <hi rend="italic">on,</hi>
                    strength; came to be one of the names of the Sun. <hi rend="italic">Rai,</hi>
                    which we commonly write <hi rend="italic">Rajah,</hi> has long signified,
                    amongst the Indians, a subordinate prince; and we know that between India and
                    Egypt there was a very early intercourse. <hi rend="italic">Raiphan,</hi>
                    therefore, may be either the <hi rend="italic">royal light</hi> or the <hi
                    rend="italic">bright prince,</hi> subordinate to Osiris; and in either sense it
                    was a very proper epithet of Sothis in the Egyptian !calendar. The word <hi
                    rend="italic">Rem</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Rom,</hi> again, for it is sometimes
                    written Remphan, and sometimes Roropha, is no other than the Hebrew n∏, <hi
                    rend="italic">Rum,</hi> high or exalted. Hence Remphan is the <hi rend="italic"
                    >high</hi> or <hi rend="italic">exalted light,</hi> which Sothis certainly was.
