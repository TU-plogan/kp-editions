                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra

                <p><label type="entry">RAY</label> John, a celebrated naturalist, and the son of Mr
                    Roger Ray, a blacksmith, was born at Black Notly, in Essex, in 1628. He received
                    the rudiments of learning at the grammar-school of Braintree; and in 1644 was
                    admitted into Catharine Hall, Cambridge, whence he afterwards removed to Trinity
                    College in that university. He took the degree of master of arts, and became at
                    length a senior fellow of the college; but his intense application to his
                    studies having injured his health, he was obliged at his leisure hours to
                    exercise himself by riding or walking in the fields, which led him to the study
                    of plants. He noted from Johnson, Parkinson, and the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Phytologia Britannica,</hi> the places where curious plants grew; and in 1658
                    he rode from Cambridge to the city of Chester, whence he proceeded to North
                    Wales, visiting many places, and amongst others the famous hill of Snowdon, and
                    returning by Shrewsbury and Gloucester. In 1660 he published his <hi
                    rend="italic">Catalogus Plantorum circa Cnutabrigiam nascentium,</hi> and the
                    same <pb break="no" facs="ht:wu.89119129625&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=88"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0719-0088-0078"/>year he was ordained deacon and priest. In 1661 he
                    accompanied Mr Francis Willoughby and others, in search of plants and other
                    natural curiosities, to the north of England and Scotland; and the next year he
                    made a western tour from Chester, and through Wales, to Cornwall, Devonshire,
                    Dorsetshire, Hampshire, Wiltshire, and other counties. He afterwards travelled
                    with Mr Willoughby and other gentlemen through Holland, Germany, Italy, France,
                    and other foreign parts, made several tours in England, and was admitted fellow
                    of the Royal Society. In 1672 his friend Mr Willoughby died, in the
                    thirty-seventh year of his age, at Middleton Hall, his seat at Yorkshire, to the
                    infinite and unspeakable loss and grief of Mr Ray himself, his friends, and all
                    good men. As there existed the closest and most sincere friendship between Mr
                    Willoughby and Mr Ray from the time of their being fellow-students, Mr
                    Willoughby not only confided in Mr Ray in his lifetime, but also at his death;
                    for he made him one of the executors of his will, and charged him with the
                    education of his sons, Francis and Thomas, leaving him at the same time an
                    annuity of L.60 per annum. The eldest of these young gentlemen not being four
                    years of age, Mr Ray, as a faithful trustee, undertook their instruction, and
                    for their use compiled his <hi rend="italic">Nomenclator Classwus,</hi> which
                    was published the same year. Francis, the eldest, dying before he became of age,
                    the younger became Lord Middleton. Not many months after the death of Mr
                    Willoughby, Mr Ray lost another of his best friends, Bishop Wilkins, whom he
                    visited in London on the 18th of November 1672, and found almost expiring from a
                    total suppression of urine. As it is natural for the mind, when hurt in one
                    part, to seek relief in another, so Mr Ray, having lost some of his best
                    friends, and being in a manner left destitute, conceived thoughts of marriage;
                    and, accordingly, in June 1673, he espoused a gentlewoman of about twenty years
                    of age, the daughter of Mr Oakley of Launton, in Oxfordshire. Towards the end of
                    this year came forth his Observations made in foreign countries, to which was
                    added, his <hi rend="italic">Catalvgus StirpiUm in exteris Regionibus
                    observatarum;</hi> and about the same time appeared his Collection of unusual or
                    local English words, which he had made in his travels through the counties of
                    England. After having published many books upon subjects foreign to his
                    profession, he at length resolved to appear in the character of divine, as well
                    as in that of natural philosopher; and with this view he published his excellent
                    demonstration of the being and attributes of God, entitled The Wisdom of God
                    manifested in the Works of the Creation, 1697, 8vo. The rudiments of this work
                    were read in some college lectures; and another collection of the same kind he
                    enlarged and published under the title of Three PhysicoIheological Discourses
                    concerning the Chaos, Deluge, and Dissolution of the World, 1692, in 8vo. Ray
                    died in 1705. He was modest, affable, and communicative, and distinguished by
                    his probity, charity, sobriety, and piety. He wrote a great number of works, the
                    principal of which, besides those already mentioned, are, 1. <hi rend="italic"
