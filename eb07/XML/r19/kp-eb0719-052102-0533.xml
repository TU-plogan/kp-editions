                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra
                    space around the <gi>pb</gi> tag. Where a word is hyphenated at a <gi>pb</gi>,

                <p><label type="entry">RUNCIMAN</label> Alexander, an eminent Scottish painter, was
                    born in Edinburgh in the year 1736. He was the son of an architect, a profession
                    which has a strong affinity to that of painting. The opportunity he thus enjoyed
                    of examining his father’s drawings gave him an early propensity to the art in
                    general, which he very soon evinced by making sketches of any remarkable object,
                    either of nature or art, that happened to come in his way. We are unacquainted
                    with the gradual progress of his fertile genius; but it is not to be supposed
                    that he remained long satisfied with the delineations of straight lines, whilst
                    the fascinating beauties of landscape lay open to his inspection. Water that
                    falls over a rugged precipice in the form of cascades, or the foaming surges of
                    the deep when carried like hoar frost with impetuosity into the air, both
                    astonish and delight by their awful grandeur. These objects, and such as these,
                    would naturally fire, at an early period, the genius of Runciman.</p>
                <p>He was bound an apprentice to John and Robert Norry in the year 1750, the former
                    of whom was a landscape-painter of very considerable eminence, and by his
                    instructions our young artist made rapid progress. About the year 1755, when
                    only nineteen years of age, he began professionally to paint landscapes; from
                    which it appeared that they were by no means first attempts, as they evinced his
                    ardent application to study before he ventured to appear at the tribunal of the
                    public. Yet although these were excellent, they were nothing more than the dawn
                    of that distinguished eminence to which he afterwards attained. His reputation
                    as a painter of landscape continued to increase during five years; but such was
                    the strength of his genius, and the amazing fertility of his invention, that he
                    could not rest satisfied with eminence in a single department. About the year
                    1760 he successfully attempted historical painting, in which his mind had more
                    ample scope than in pour-traying the solemn silence of a field, a humble
                    cottage, or a shepherd void of ambition. Six years of his life were devoted to
                    the study and practice of this important branch of the art, notwithstanding his
                    situation was attended with numerous disadvantages. Great, however, as his
                    attainments were in this department, he could never be satisfied with himself
                    till he had studied in Italy those masterly performances which it was his
                    highest ambition to imitate.</p>
                <p>He accordingly set out for Italy in the year 1766, when just thirty years of age;
                    and during a residence of five years in that enchanting country, where specimens
                    of his favourite art are met with in all their grandeur and perfection, he
                    continued to copy the best pictures of the ancient masters, in consequence of
                    which his taste was very much corrected and improved. His conceptions were also
                    greatly enlarged by the steady contemplation of so many works of the greatest
                    and most celebrated artists. The art of composition, which it is of the first
                    consequence for an historical painter to understand, was only to be acquired
                    from the study of its principles, as they are exemplified in such
                    highly-finished models; and to these he applied himself with indefatigable
                    industry. He caught the rich yet chaste colouring of the Venetian school with
                    such truth that he was allowed to surpass all his competitors in this valuable
                    quality.</p>
                <p>In the year 1771, Runciman returned to his native country in the full possession
                    of such improvements as were to be expected from the opportunities he had
                    enjoyed, and also with a judgment very much matured. It will readily be granted
                    that he had now some claim upon the patronage of his country, and we are happy
                    to add that this was not withheld; for the Board of Trustees, and Sir James
                    Clerk of Pennycuick, were amongst his patrons; and to Mr Robert Alexander in
                    particular, a respectable merchant in Edinburgh, his country was more indebted
                    for fostering his rising genius than to the whole of its nobility.</p>
                <p>An academy for the study of drawing and painting was established in Edinburgh by
                    the honourable trustees for the encouragement of the arts in Scotland, of which
                    De la Cour and Pavilon, two French artists of some ability, were successively
                    chosen masters. When Pavilon died in 1771, an application was made to Runciman
                    to take charge of the academy, the laborious and interesting duties of which he
                    discharged much to his own honour and the benefit of his country.</p>
                <p>His masterly work in the hall of Ossian at Pennycuick, the seat of his patron Sir
                    James Clerk, was projected and begun by him soon after his return to Edinburgh.
                    The next performance of Runciman was the picture of the Ascension, painted on
                    the ceiling above the altar of the episcopal chapel, Cowgate, Edinburgh.</p>
                <p>The fire and the feeling displayed in his King Lear were conceived and executed
                    in a manner not inferior to those of Shakspeare; and the Andromeda, from which
                    Legat took his highly-finished engraving, will bear a comparison, in colouring,
                    with the works of Titian or Correggio. He appears to have regarded his own
                    historical work of Agrippina landing the ashes of Germanicus her husband, as a
                    capital performance, in the execution of which he had bestowed more than
                    ordinary pains.</p>
                <p>Whilst his health permitted, which the painting of the hall of Ossian had much
                    impaired, he continued to superintend the business of the academy, and devoted
                    his leisure hours to the drawing of historical pieces. He enjoyed a competency
                    from his office as teacher, which, with the emoluments arising from his other
                    works, made him independent.</p>
                <p>Runciman as a man was possessed of great candour and simplicity of manners,
                    having a happy talent for conversation, which made some of the most
                    distinguished literary characters, such as Hume, Robertson, Kames, and Monboddo,
                    extremely fond of his company; but his genuine worth, and his real goodness of
                    heart, were only fully known to his most intimate friends. He could communicate
                    information with great facility, and gave his best advice to young artists, with
                    a view to facilitate the progress of their improvement.</p>
                <p>As a painter, his character has been elegantly drawn by a brother artist, Mr John
                    Brown, who was better qualified than most men to make a proper estimate of his
                    merits. “Mr Runciman was an artist by nature, eminently qualified to excel in
                    all those nobler parts of the art, the attainment of which depends upon the
                    possession of the highest powers of the mind. Though for a long period of years
                    labouring under every possible disadvantage, he completed works which, upon the
                    whole, are equal to the best of those of his contemporaries, and in some
                    respects it may be boldly asserted that they are superior. His fancy was
                    fertile, his discernment of character keen, his taste truly elegant, and his
                    conceptions always great. Though his genius seems to be best suited to the grand
                    and serious, yet many of his works amply prove that he could move with equal
                    success in the less elevated line of the gay and pleasing. His chief excellence
                    was composition, the noblest part of the art, in which it is doubted whether he
                    had any living superior. With regard to the truth, the harmony, the richness,
                    and the gravity of colouring; in that style, in short, which is the peculiar
                    characteristic of the ancient Venetian, and the direct contrast to the modern
                    English school, he was unrivalled. His works, it must be granted, like all those
                    of the present times, were far from being perfect; but it was Mr Runciman’s
                    peculiar misfortune, that his defects <pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:wu.89119129625&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=534" xml:id="kp-eb0719-0534-0522"
                    />were of such a nature as to be obvious to the most unskilful.” The fine arts
                    and his friends were deprived of this distinguished painter on the 21st of
                    October 1785.</p>
