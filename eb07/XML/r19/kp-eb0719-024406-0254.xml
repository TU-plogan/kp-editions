                <p><label type="entry">RIO GRANDE</label> a large river of Western Africa, which
                    falls into the Atlantic a considerable distance to the south of the Gambia. It
                    appears to be now ascertained, that the three great rivers of the western coast,
                    the Senegal, the Gambia, and the Rio Grande, have all their sources very close
                    to each other, in a range of mountains a short distance to the north-west of
                    Teembo, in Foota Jallo. M. Mollien’s account represents the Gambia, called the
                    Ba Diman, and the Rio Grande, called the Comba, as springing from the same
                    basin, amid high mountains. The source of the latter stream is in latitude 10.
                    37. north, and longitude 11. 17. west. The correctness of this traveller’s
                    statements is confirmed by M. Caillé, who crossed his route. M. Mol-lien, in
                    describing the origin of the rivers, says, that on leaving the village called
                    Toulon, he was led to the summit of one of the mountains which bear the
                    appellation of Badet. Below him appeared two thickets, the one concealing the
                    sources of the Rio Grande, and the other those of the Gambia. The valley in
                    which they are situated forms a kind of funnel, having no other outlets than the
                    two defiles by which the rivers issue. On quitting this basin these rivers
                    pursue their course towards opposite points. The current of the Rio Grande is at
                    first slow and turbid, but it soon clears; and beyond the valley its direction,
                    hitherto north-north-east, changes to the west. After receiving the Tomine or
                    Dongo, it assumes the appellation of Kaboo, a name which also distinguishes the
                    country between the Rio Grande, the Gambia, and the Geba river. The territories
                    bordering on the upper part of its course are inhabited by Foulahs, and the
                    kingdom of Foota Jallo extends along the right bank. Further down, its shores
                    are peopled by the Biafaras <hi rend="subscript">1</hi> Balantes, Papels, and
                    other tribes, and occupied by the kingdoms of Ghinala and Biguba-Near its
                    embouchure it divides into a number of branches, forming alluvial islands,
                    which, with others farther out at sea, compose the Archipelago of the Bissagos.
                    The whole length of its course may be about 500 miles. It falls into the
                    Atlantic fifty leagues to the south of the Gambia.</p>
                <p>Rio Grande do Norte, a province of Brazil, is bounded on the south by Paraiba, on
                    the north and east by the Atlantic Ocean, and on the west by Seara. Situated
                    between the parallels of 4. 10. and 5. 45. of south latitude, the climate is of
                    course very hot. At Cape St Roque, which forms the angle of this province, in
                    longitude 36. 15. west, latitude 5. 7. south, the coast of Brazil terminates
                    towards the north-east; and the Atlantic Ocean, which has so long been its
                    boundary on the east, begins to wash its northern shores. It presents about one
                    hundred miles of sea-coast. The general features of the province may be laid
                    down as displaying a tolerable fertility to the southward of Natal, the capital,
                    and as presenting a barren aspect to the northward of it, except on the banks,
                    and in the immediate neighbourhood of the Rio Grande, or Potengi, the great
                    river of the province. This stream rises in a ridge in the western limits of Rio
                    Grande, and traverses its whole extent in a direction from south-west to
                    north-east. The bar of the Potengi is narrow, but sufficiently deep for vessels
                    of moderate tonnage. The river is very safe within the bar; the water being deep
                    and quite tranquil. The province is irrigated by other streams, on whose banks
                    the most fertile land is to be found. The village and valley of Papari, lying to
                    the north of the Rio Grande, are described as presenting a most inviting aspect.
                    The whole of the valley is cultivated, and when every other part of the
                    surrounding country is parched with drought, and the high sandy lands are
                    rendered quite barren, this place retains its freshest verdure. Although at the
                    distance of three or four leagues from the sea, the salt-water lake of Groahyras
                    communicates with it, so that the inhabitants have the fish brought to their own
                    doors. Between three and four leagues farther is the Indian village of St Joze,
                    situated on a dry sandy soil. A <pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:wu.89119129625&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=255" xml:id="kp-eb0719-0255-0245"
                    />few leagues beyond this place the road passes over a succession of dismal
                    sand-hills. These are perpetually changing their situations and forms; and the
                    high winds raise the sand in clouds, which render the road dangerous when they
                    prevail. The sand is white and very fine, so that horses sink up to the knees at
                    every step; and it is so light as to prevent almost all vegetation.</p>
                <p>Natal, the capital (so named because the church was consecrated on
                    Christmas-day), sometimes called Cidade dos Reys <hi rend="subscript">1</hi> or
                    City of the Kings, is situated on the right margin of the Rio Grande, about two
                    miles above its mouth. So highly was the position of Natal at one time valued,
                    that during the Dutch war its fortress was deemed the strongest place in Brazil.
                    At present it contains some good streets, squares, and churches, a governor’s
                    palace, a town-hall, prison, and other public buildings. The harbour of Natal is
                    spacious, and a flourishing trade is carried on. The population amounts to about
                    19,000.</p>
                <p>To the north of Natal lies the town of Estremoz, about ten miles to the
                    north-west, and at the same distance from the sea. In the western part of the
                    province are several towns, of which the most considerable is that formerly
                    called Assu, but now dignified with the name of Villa Nova da Princesa. It is
                    situated on the left bank of the river of the same name, otherwise called the
                    Parinhas, twenty-five miles from its mouth. Its position is nearly in the centre
                    of Rio Grande; and the road leading from Natal to it having been traversed by Mr
                    Koster, a brief abstract of his description will serve to convey an idea of the
                    character of the province in this quarter. The tract of country through which
                    the road lies, is a plain traversed by a river remarkable for its serpentine
                    evolutions. Here is a place called Lagoa Seca, or dry lake; a place which is
                    laid under water by the rains, but which supplies the capital with farinha
                    during the drought. Between eight and ten leagues from Natal is Pai Paulo, a
                    place situated on the borders of the Sertam, a long barren plain of five days’
                    journey. This scene is desolate and dreary in the extreme. On approaching Assu,
                    however, lands covered with wood make their appearance; and fazendas and other
                    indications of human neighbourhood rise around. The town of Assu is situated
                    upon the northern bank of the smaller branch of the river Assu, which here runs
                    for a short distance in two channels. This place, chiefly built in the form of a
                    square, contains several churches, and other public buildings. There are
                    numerous salt-works in the vicinity, which bring some trade to the place, and
                    large barks in the proper season ascend the river to the town. At the distance
                    of about a league from Assu is the lake of Piato, three leagues in length by one
                    in breadth, which is filled by the river in the rainy season, and is never quite
                    dry. In summer its sides afford a rich soil for the cultivation of rice, maize,
                    the cane, melons, and cotton. Between this place and the frontier of the
                    province of Seara, a distance of four days’ journey, the country consists for
                    the most part of plains, with trees thinly scattered, and patches of wood.
                    Several salt-marshes intervene, and these, during the rainy season, form lakes.
                    The Arraial of St Luzia stands on the left bank of the river Appody, about
                    twenty miles from the sea. Large canoes advance up the river to this place,
                    which carries on a trade in salt. From this situation downwards are found the
                    famous salterns of Massoro, the salt of which is as white as snow. The Appody
                    has a course of a hundred and thirty miles, running almost the whole way through
                    a flat country, interspersed with lakes, which it fills by its floods. This
                    river forms the boundary line between Rio Grande do Norte and Seara. The soil of
                    many parts of this province is favourable to the growth of sugar-cane, and some
                    trade is carried on in sugar, which, together with salt, seems to be the staple
                    of commerce in this quarter of Brazil. The population of the whole province is
                    not supposed to exceed 80,000 inhabitants.</p>
                <p>Rio Grande do Sul, formerly the most southern province in the empire of Brazil,
                    but, according to recent accounts, now an independent republic of South America.
                    It declared its independence in 1836, and resolved on introducing a constitution
                    similar to that of the United States of North America. In April and May 1838 two
                    severe conflicts took place between the troops of the emperor of Brazil and the
                    insurgents, in both of which the former were defeated with great slaughter.
                    Whether this country may ultimately succeed in maintaining its position among
                    the republican states of South America, appears very doubtful. Rio Grande do Sul
                    is bounded on the north by St Catharina and St Paulo; on the west by the river
                    Uruguay, which separates it from the republic of the same name; on the south by
                    the river Plata; and on the east by the Atlantic Ocean. Itis upwards of five
                    hundred miles in length by four hundred in breadth, lying between latitude 28°
                    and 35° south, and enjoys a temperate and salubrious climate. This extensive
                    country chiefly consists of large plains, covered with immense herds of cattle
                    and other animals. Some mountain-ridges traverse it in various directions, but
                    none of them is of any great height. Here several large rivers have their
                    origin, of which the Uruguay, the Jacuhy or Rio Pardo, and the Camapuam, are the
                    most important Its great extent of level and alluvial coast exhibits some lakes
                    of vast dimensions. The Lagoa dos Patos is the largest lake in Brazil, being one
                    hundred and fifty miles in length from northeast to south-west and about forty
                    miles in breadth. It is said to derive its name from a species of fowl which
                    frequents its waters in great numbers. This lake is the recipient of almost all
                    the streams which irrigate the northern and eastern portions of the country. It
                    is very shallow, and its water continues fresh as far as the island dos
                    Marin-heiros, near the port of St Pedro. Although encumbered with sand-banks,
                    and subject to violent squalls of wind, it may be navigated without much risk.
                    The peninsula lying between the lake and the ocean is low and level, and almost
                    in a direct line on the eastern side, but forms various points and bays on the
                    opposite side. The western shore of the lake is bold but not rugged, and is cut
                    by several rivers, of which the Camapuam and Jacuhy, already mentioned, are most
                    deserving of notice. The sources of the former are in a chain of low hills
                    called the great Cochilha, which traverses the western limits of the country. It
                    flows with a rapid and disturbed current interrupted by continued cataracts for
                    nearly a hundred miles, receiving fourteen streams from the south and fifteen
                    from the north, and falls into the lake about the middle of its western side, by
                    five different channels, formed by four small islands. The Jacuhy, sometimes
                    called the Rio Pardo, which is one of its tributaries, is a river of still
                    greater value. It rises in the province of St Paulo, and after traversing the
                    southern declivity of the general ridge for a few leagues, it turns eastward,
                    describing innumerable windings for a course of thirty leagues, during which it
                    collects the water of a number of smaller rivers, many of them being navigable.
                    It then suddenly bends towards the south, and after running fifteen miles in
                    this direction, enters the western side of the lake about four leagues below its
                    northern extremity. It is a fine, broad and deep river, with lofty and
                    diversified banks, and is full of little islands. To the south-west of the Lagoa
                    dos Patos lies another sheet of water, called Lake Mirim, or Mirin. It is ninety
                    miles in length by about twenty in breadth, and discharges itself into the Lagoa
                    dos Patos by means of a channel called the river of St Gonzales. Lake Mirim is
                    very shallow, and in the rainy season it widely extends its borders. The
                    Gonzales is fifty miles in length: it is wide and handsome, and navigable for
                    small vessels, which by this channel pass into Lake Mirim, and thence by means
                    of rivers penetrate into the fertile interior, and distribute their cargos to
                    the large towns <pb break="no" facs="ht:wu.89119129625&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=256"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0719-0256-0246"/>on the coast. There are other large lakes running
                    parallel with the shore, but these are the most important.</p>
                <p>On the northern bank of the Jacuhy, twenty-five miles from its mouth, stands the
                    town of Portalegre, the capital of tile country. It is situated on a declivity,
                    and commands a fine view of the river and the surrounding country. The houses
                    are well built, the streets well laid out, and altogether it is a very neat and
                    flourishing place. The government-house and public offices are placed on a hill.
                    It has several churches, schools, what appear to be the rudiments of a
                    university, a dock-yard, and other public establishments and institutions. In
                    1812 Mr Luccock thus spoke of it: “As a capital, its influence is wide; as a
                    seat of commerce, it commands <hi rend="italic">a</hi> large tract of country,
                    and many navigable rivers.” It has subsequently made very great advancement.
                    Englishmen have long been established here; and not only commerce, but
                    agriculture, has been much benefited by their exertions. One great bar to
                    improvement is, that much of the interior is still in the hands of the native
                    tribes, whose animosity to white people is of the bitterest description.
                    Portalegre contains above 12,000 inhabitants.</p>
                <p>Being situated at the head of the great lake, it has constant intercourse with St
                    Pedro do Sul, which lies at the foot of it. Up to the year 1763 this town was
                    the capital of the province, and was usually called Rio Grande, from its
                    harbour, which forms the entrance to the Lagoa dos Patos, and is, with the same
                    impropriety as the bay of Rio de Janeiro, termed a river. The town was begun a
                    league to the south-west of where it now stands, in the situation called
                    Estreito, near the head of the bay or harbour. It stood on a bank about twenty
                    feet in height, and was surrounded with a parapet of sods, as a barrier against
                    the encroaching sands. <note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>Mr Luccock mentions some circumstances very interesting in a geological
                    point of view; and as his remarks convey a correct idea of the nature of the
                    coast in this quarter, we shall quote them. He informs us that by a careful
                    examination of the coast, it will convincingly appear that a very considerable
                    portion of it has been formed by sand driven up by the ocean. “The two lakes
                    which form the chief features of this part of the country have probably been
                    created by the rivers which flow into them repelling the sand accumulated at
                    their mouths by the occasional impetuosity of their currents, until the bar was
                    formed in the dead water produced by the stream and the ocean. Here the hank
                    would gradually rise above the high-water mark, and compel the river to bend its
                    course; and by constant acquisition would grow broader and longer, and at length
                    form an estuary within it.” In this manner he thinks the Jacuhy, Camapuam, and
                    other rivers, were compelled by accumulation of sand to take a southern course,
                    and thus produced the great lake. In confirmation of this view, he states that
                    the bar of the Rio Grande is still proceeding southward. </p></note> Yet by a
                    slow but sure progress they appear to have gained ground, so as almost to have
                    overwhelmed the town, and occasioned its removal to the present site. It is now
                    situated on a level plain, a little above high-water mark; but, like its
                    predecessor, it suffers much from the accumulation of sand. Its public buildings
                    comprise a cathedral, the plainness of which externally and internally does not
                    prevent it from being a handsome edifice. It has several public buildings, and
                    is defended by a fort. Its commercial importance appears to be considerable.
                    Many towns along the coast mainly depend upon this part of the continent for
                    their supply of food. Immense quantities of wheat, hides, tallow, dried beef,
                    cheese, and other articles are shipped from this port, and commerce is rapidly
                    increasing. We have no means of ascertaining the amount of its population; but
                    it is certainly not less than that of the capital, for it was the great mart of
                    Southern Brazil while the country formed an integrant part of the empire. Near
                    this town is the fertile island of Marinheiros, which contains some of the
                    highest land and the best cultivated spots in the neighbourhood.</p>
                <p>This country, we have said, is chiefly distinguished for cattle-breeding. The
                    proprietors of land are divided into two classess, viz. fazendeiros or farmers,
                    and lavradores or husbandmen. The latter, who breed only what is necessary for
                    their own consumption, possess generally about two square leagues of land; the
                    former will farm from eight to ten leagues, but some of these fazendas are
                    reported to extend to a hundred square leagues, or nearly 600,000 acres. To each
                    three square leagues are allotted four or five thousand head of cattle, six men,
                    and a hundred horses. The proportion of horses will appear a very large one; but
                    <hi rend="subscript"/> it is to be kept in view that, in this pastoral country,
                    they cost nothing in keeping, and even short journeys of half a mile are made on
                    horseback. About one hundred cows are allowed for the supply of milk, butter,
                    cheese, and veal, to a farm of the average size. Hogs, although abundant, are
                    but little valued: sheep might be multiplied to any extent, in consequence of
                    their producing generally two lambs at a birth, but do not appear to attract
                    much attention. Droves of horses and mules are bred to a great extent; the
                    latter are, however, found to be much more profitable than the former, a mule
                    being double the value of a horse. Horses are trained for tile exercises of the
                    field, in a manner peculiarly well adapted to fortify them against fear. They
                    are much used in capturing cattle, which, as is the universal custom in South
                    America, is effected by the lasso. Cattle form the grand staple of Rio Grande,
                    and the beef, hides, and tallow which they yield are the chief articles of
                    export. An extensive tract, famous for its fine cattle, is comprehended under
                    the name of Charqueados, derived from the “charqued” beef, which is prepared in
                    this district for exportation. When the cattle are killed and skinned, the flesh
                    is taken off from the sides in one broad piece, something like a flitch of
                    bacon; it is then slightly sprinkled with salt, and dried in the sun. In that
                    state it forms the common food of the peasantry. Some idea of the immense
                    quantity thus prepared may be formed from the fact, that in one year a single
                    individual slaughtered 54,000 head of cattle, and charqued the flesh.</p>
                <p>The history of this portion of South America presents little but a gloomy picture
                    of Spanish aggression and Portuguese retaliation. Lying on the confines of
                    Brazil, where the latter bordered on the possessions of Spain, it was convenient
                    for hostile inroad on the part of the latter power and it was unfortunate for
                    these colonies that the animosities of the mother countries in Europe were
                    communicated across the Atlantic, and perpetually embroiled their settlements,
                    so that the bloody and ever-losing game of war played between the powers was
                    maintained in both hemispheres at once. Into details of mutual hostilities we
                    shall not enter; it is sufficient to state that this country was finally
                    incorporated with the empire of Brasil, and so continued, till its recent
                    assertion of independence. The population of Rio Grande do Sul is estimated at
                    160,000. (r. r. r.)</p>
