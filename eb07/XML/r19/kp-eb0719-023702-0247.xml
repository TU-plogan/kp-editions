                <p><label type="entry">RICHELIEU</label> John Armand du Plessis de, cardinal of
                    Richelieu and Fronsac, bishop of Lucon, &amp;c. was born at Paris in 1585. He
                    was possessed of excellent parts; and at the age of twenty-two he had the
                    address to obtain a dispensation to enjoy the bishopric of Lucon. He applied
                    himself in a particular manner to the function of preaching; and his reputation
                    procured him the office of almoner to the queen Mary de’ Medicis. His abilities
                    in the management of affairs advanced him to be secretary of state in 1616; and
                    the king soon gave him the preference to all his other secretaries. The death of
                    the marquis d’Ancre having produced a revolution in state affairs, Richelieu
                    retired to Avignon, where he employed himself in composing books of controversy
                    and piety. The king having recalled him to court, he was made a cardinal in
                    1622; and, two years after, first minister of state, and grand-master of the
                    navigation. In 1626, the Isle of Rhee was preserved by his care; and in 1628
                    Rochelle was taken, the haven having been enclosed by the famous dyke which he
                    ordered to be raised. He accompanied the king to the siege of Cazal, and
                    contributed not a little to the raising of it in 1629. He also obliged the
                    Huguenots to the peace at Alets, which proved the ruin of that party. He took
                    Pamerol, and succoured Cazal, besieged by Spinola. In the mean time the <pb

                    xml:id="kp-eb0719-0248-0238"/>nobles found fault with his conduct, and persuaded
                    the king to discard him. The cardinal, for his part, was unmoved, and by his
                    reasonings overthrew what was thought to be determined against him; so that,
                    instead of being disgraced, he from that moment became more powerful than ever.
                    He punished all his enemies in the same manner as they would have punished him;
                    and the day which produced this event, so glorious to Cardinal de Richelieu, was
                    called the <hi rend="italic">day of dupes.</hi> This able minister had from
                    thence forward an ascendency over the king’s mind; and he now resolved to humble
                    the excessive pride of the house of Austria. For that purpose he concluded a
                    treaty with Gustavus Adolphus king of Sweden, for carrying the war into the
                    heart of Germany. He also entered into a league with the duke of Bavaria;
                    secured Lorraine; raised a part of the princes of the empire against the
                    emperor; treated with the Dutch to continue the war against Spain; favoured the
                    Catalans and Portuguese till they shook off the Spanish yoke; and, in short,
                    took so many different measures, that he accomplished his design; and after
                    having carried on the war with success, was thinking of concluding it by a
                    peace, when he died at Paris on the 4th of December 1642, aged fifty-eight. He
                    was interred in the Sorbonne, where a magnificent mausoleum is erected to his
                    memory. This great politician made the arts and sciences flourish; formed the
                    botanical garden at Paris, called the <hi rend="italic">king’s garden;</hi>
                    founded the French academy; established the royal printing-house; erected the
                    palace afterwards called <hi rend="italic">Le Palais Royal,</hi> which he
                    presented to the king; and rebuilt the Sorbonne with a magnificence that appears
                    truly royal. Besides his books of controversy and piety, there pass under the
                    name of this minister, a Journal, in 2 vols. 12mo; and a Political Testament, in
                    12mo; all treating of politics and state affairs.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Richelieu, or</hi><hi rend="italic">Sorell,</hi> a river of
                    Lower Canada, flowing in a northerly direction from Lake Champlain to the great
                    St Lawrence. It is the principal channel by which the waters of the lake are
                    conveyed to the latter river; and by being made navigable for vessels of large
                    size throughout its whole extent, it would afford a most convenient means of
                    commercial intercourse with the interior of New York, and form a direct chain of
                    communication with the great western republic. This river is remarkable for
                    being much narrower at its embouchure than at the place from which it flows.
                    From its mouth to the basin of Chamblay it is about two hundred and fifty yards
                    wide; thence to the Isle du Portage the breadth is five hundred yards; beyond
                    this it expands to double that size, and continues to enlarge up to St John’s,
                    from which there is a ship-navigation to the towns on Lake Champlain. From
                    Chamblay downwards to the St Lawrence the current is regular and gentle; but
                    from Lake Champlain to the basin it is hurried, in some places violent, and in
                    others broken by rapids. The channel is, however, of great value and importance,
                    and the medium of considerable trade.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Richelieu</hi><hi rend="italic"> Islands,</hi> a cluster of
                    islands, about a hundred in number, in the river St Lawrence, situated at the
                    southwest entrance of Lake St Peter. They lie low, and are liable to be
                    overflowed in spring, when the lake is swelled by the melting of snow and ice.
                    Some of them afford good pasturage for cattle, and they all abound with wild
                    fowl.</p>
