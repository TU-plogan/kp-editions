                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra

                <p><label type="entry">ROSLIN or Rosslyn</label>, a village in the county of
                    Mid-Lothian, Scotland, about seven miles south from Edinburgh, celebrated for
                    the picturesque ruins of its castle, the architectural grace of its chapel, and
                    the sequestered but variegated scenery of the vale in which they are placed.
                    Roslin was formerly a place of some note, being next to Edinburgh and Haddington
                    in importance, and was made a burgh of barony by James II. of Scotland, and
                    privileged by holding fairs and markets. The sole dependence of the inhabitants
                    at the present time is on agriculture and the bleaching of linen. The castle is
                    situated on a peninsular rock, round which the South Esk river pursues its
                    course; and is connected with the adjacent ground by an old narrow bridge thrown
                    over a deep chasm cut in the solid rock. The original castle was most likely
                    erected in the eleventh century. It must have been increased from time to time
                    in after years, as we learn that when the Earls of St Clair were in their glory,
                    the castle was not only a massive and extensive building, but characterized by
                    great splendour in its internal decorations. All that now remain are some high
                    fragments of the walls and battlements, and a triple tier of vaults. Amidst the
                    ruins, and partly above these vaults, was built a more modern house, bearing the
                    date of 1622, which is still inhabited.</p>
                <p>The chapel was founded in the year 1446, by William St Clair, prince of Orkney
                    and lord of Rosslyn, for a provost, six prebendaries, and two choristers, and
                    consecrated to St Matthew. Tradition states that the design of the building,
                    which was intended for a large collegiate church, was drawn at Rome; and that
                    the prince employed the best workmen that could be procured, both from the
                    Continent and at home, in the erection. The chapel, which is merely the chancel
                    and part of the transept of the original design, is unique in style, and cannot
                    be said to belong to any order of architecture. It however combines the solidity
                    of the Norman with the elegance and minute profusion of ornament characteristic
                    of the latest species of the Tudor age. The interior is sixty-eight feet in
                    length, thirty-four feet in breadth, and forty feet in height. It is divided
                    into a centre and aisles, by two ranges of clustered pillars, eight feet in
                    height, adorned with sculptured foliage and figures of human beings and animals,
                    of the most exquisite workmanship. The pillars are so arranged that their
                    ceilings are thrown into one, so as to form a continued arch along the centre of
                    the building. One pillar, conspicuous for its elaborate decorations, is called
                    the “prentice pillar,” from its having been sculptured by an apprentice, who is
                    said to have lost his life from having thus excited the professional jealousy of
                    his master. At the reformation in 1688 this chapel was, like many other sacred
                    edifices of taste, defaced by a mob from Edinburgh; but it was repaired in the
                    following century by General St Clair. The present Earl of Rosslyn is
                    judiciously, and with great taste, restoring this venerable structure to its
                    original state. Beneath this chapel lie the barons of Roslin, all of whom were,
                    till the time of James VII., buried in armour. Near this was fought, in February
                    1302, the three celebrated battles of Roslin, where the Scots, under the regent
                    Sir John Cornyn, and Sir Simon Frazer, attacked and defeated three divisions of
                    the English army in one day.</p>
