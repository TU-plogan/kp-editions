                <p><label type="entry">RHUBARB</label>. The drug well known by this name is the root
                    of some species of <hi rend="italic">Rheum,</hi> an important genus of the
                    natural order <hi rend="italic">Polygonacece,</hi> Juss., and referred to <hi
                    rend="italic">Enneandria Trigynia</hi> in the Linnsean classification. The roots
                    of all the species are thick and fleshy, generally a good! deal branched, and
                    striking deep into the earth. The leaves and stems are annual. The leaves, which
                    are radical and petiolate, rise in spring, coming up in a thick head folded
                    together, and gradually expanding. The footstalks of the leaves are thick,
                    fleshy, and juicy, varying in length in the different species from a few inches
                    to two feet. The leaves themselves are spreading, and very large, being
                    sometimes two feet in diameter. The flowering stems begin to rise at the end of
                    spring, come into flower in June, and ripen their seeds in August and September.
                    The flowers are in a large terminal panicle or compound raceme. They consist of
                    a coloured six parted perianth. The seeds are three cornered, winged, and have
                    the withered perianth adhering to their base. The rhubarbs are extensively
                    cultivated in this country for the sake of the footstalks, and likewise for the
                    medicinal roots.</p>
                <p>When grown for the sake of the latter, they should be sown <pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:wu.89119129625&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=237" xml:id="kp-eb0719-0237-0227"
                    />in the place where they are intended to remain, that the growth of the roots
                    may not be interfered with; but when meant to be used for culinary purposes, or
                    as ornamental plants, the seedlings may be transplanted in autumn. The most
                    important use of the plants of this genus is to furnish the medicinal substance
                    rhubarb.</p>
                <p>It is not a little singular, that though this valuable medicine has been in use
                    for centuries, we are still ignorant as to the precise species which yields it.
                    Many endeavours have been made to ascertain this point, both by investigation of
                    the countries from which the commercial rhubarb is brought, and by cultivating
                    the known species and comparing their roots with the rhubarb of the shops, but
                    none of these attempts hitherto has proved successful. Previous to 1732, rhubarb
                    was believed to be yielded by the <hi rend="italic">Rheum rhaponticum,</hi>
                    Linn. This species is distinguished by its leaves being roundish ovate, obtuse,
                    pale green, with a few hairs beneath on the nerves and margins. The footstalks
                    are pale green, striated, channelled above, with rounded edges. The roots are
                    large and thick, much divided, and, like those of most of the other species,
                    reddish brown without, yellow within. It is not found, however, that in
                    cultivated specimens the roots yield a product at all resembling true rhubarb;
                    and as this species is a native of the wild land to the north of the Caspian
                    Sea, between the Volga and Ural rivers, and not, so far as is known, of the
                    country from which rhubarb is believed to come, the opinion that it is the true
                    rhubarb plant has long been abandoned. It is chiefly this species, or hybrids of
                    it, which is so commonly cultivated in gardens for the sake of the leafstalks,
                    which are used extensively in the spring for making tarts and preserves. They
                    have an agreeable acidity, owing to their containing, like some other plants of
                    the same natural order, a considerable proportion of oxalic acid.</p>
                <p>In 1732, some seeds sent to Paris and Chelsea as those of the true rhubarb plant
                    were grown, and found to be <hi rend="italic">Rheum undulatum.</hi> This species
                    is distinguished by its leaves being oval, obtuse, extremely wavy, of a
                    dark-green colour, and by the footstalks being downy, blood-red, with the upper
                    edges elevated. It is a native of China and Siberia, and was long cultivated by
                    the Russians in the latter country as true rhubarb. The culture, however, is now
                    abandoned, and it is well known that the roots which it yields are widely
                    different from those of the genuine drug.</p>
                <p>In 1750, Kaaw Boerhaave obtained some seeds which were said to be those of the
                    true rhubarb; and on being grown, they produced both <hi rend="italic">Rh.
                    undulatum</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Rh. palmatum.</hi> The latter species is
                    distinguished from all the others by its leaves being palmated, with acuminate
                    segments; and its roots on cultivation have been found by M. Guibour to bear the
                    nearest resemblance, in colour, taste, and smell, to the true rhubarb. It
                    appears, however, from the inquiries of Pallas, that the Bucharian rhubarb
                    merchants knew nothing of such a leaf as that of <hi rend="italic">Rh.
                    palmatam,</hi> and described the true rhubarb plant as having round leaves with
                    waved edges. This has been supposed to come near to another species, <hi
                    rend="italic">Rh. compactum,</hi> which is also occasionally cultivated in our
                    gardens, but its roots are found to differ from true rhubarb in many
                    particulars. Notwithstanding the doubts raised by Pallas, however, the idea that
                    <hi rend="italic">Rh. palmatum</hi> is the true rhubarb plant is still
                    extensively entertained, and it has been stated as such in the new edition of
                    the London Pharmacopoeia. It is very doubtful, however, if a decided opinion
                    upon this point is admissible in the present state of our knowledge regarding
                    this subject.</p>
                <p>In the state of uncertainty to which these conflicting opinions gave rise as to
                    the origin of rhubarb, the Empress Catherine U. of Russia, in 1790, sent an
                    apothecary of the name of Sievers into Siberia, to endeavour to penetrate into
                    the rhubarb country and ascertain the true plant; but after four years’ attempts
                    he was ultimately foiled, and returned with no further information than that
                    nothing certain appeared to be known upon the subject</p>
                <p>More recently the <hi rend="italic">Rh. Emodi</hi> of Dr Wallich (flΛ. <hi
                    rend="italic">Australe,</hi> Don), and <hi rend="italic">Rh. Webbianum,</hi>
                    both natives of the Hima-layah Mountains, have been found to be valuable as
                    purgatives, and the former was supposed to be the true source of Chinese
                    rhubarb; but Mr Pereira has found that the Hi-malayah rhubarb was quite
                    different from the rhubarb of the shops.</p>
                <p>It thus appears that the source of true rhubarb is still unascertained; nor is it
                    at all certain that it is not yielded by more than one species. Professor Royle
                    of King’s College is of opinion, and apparently correctly, that it is obtained
                    in the heart of Thibet, in about 95° east longitude, and 35° north latitude, a
                    country into which as yet no scientific botanist has ever penetrated. It is
                    worthy of remark, that this agrees with the statements of Pallas and other
                    travellers, that the Russian rhubarb is gathered on the mountains surrounding
                    Lake Kokonor, and that this is part of what has been assigned by Murray as the
                    native country of <hi rend="italic">Rh. palmatum.</hi></p>
                <p>Here, therefore, an excellent subject for investigation is still open; and it is
                    to be hoped that this desideratum in our knowledge of the botanical materia
                    medica may soon be supplied. Several circumstances however combine to render the
                    attainment of this object difficult. The labour of penetrating into the wild
                    country where the true rhubarb probably grows is not to be overlooked; and
                    jealousy on the part of the dealers in this profitable article of commerce will
                    likewise lead to much inconvenience. It is said that the trade in Russian
                    rhubarb is monopolized by one Buc-hαrian family, who farm it from the Chinese
                    government; and it is not improbable that, in order to prevent the establishment
                    of a rival trade elsewhere, they may already have embarrassed the subject, by
                    purposely furnishing as the seeds of true rhubarb, those of different and
                    inferior species. In attempting to ascertain the true officinal species by
                    cultivation, we are likewise met by this difficulty, that the different species
                    hybridise so readily that their distinctive characters are very readily lost.
                    This is very apparent in the rhubarbs cultivated in our gardens, which, though
                    commonly referred to <hi rend="italic">Rh. rhapontieum,</hi> are in great
                    measure made up of hybrids between that species, <hi rend="italic">Rh.
                    compactum,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Rh. hybridum.</hi></p>
                <p>Though the true rhubarb plant has not been seen by any scientific botanist, we
                    have some interesting information from other travellers respecting its growth
                    and production. The best accounts appear to be those given by Mr Bell in his
                    journey from St Petersburg to Pekin. Sievers, in his attempts to discover the
                    true rhubarb plant, likewise obtained some information respecting it, and the
                    statements of these travellers differ only in some unimportant particulars. It
                    appears that the plant is not made the subject of special culture, but that
                    enough grows spontaneously to keep up the supply of this valuable drug. The
                    marmots, which breed extensively in this country, contribute in a great measure
                    to the propagation of the plant; for it seems that the seeds germinate almost
                    exclusively on the loose earth turned up by these animals in making their
                    burrows. The natives gather the roots in spring and autumn, and, after removing
                    the cortical part, cut them in small pieces to facilitate the drying. They cut a
                    hole through each piece, and then string them upon a small cord, by which they
                    hang them up to dry on poles or trees, or more commonly about their tents, and
                    occasionally, it seems, upon the horns of their sheep. By this last practice a
                    considerable amount of loss is sustained, as, from the prolonged exposure to
                    moisture, much of the root becomes decayed and useless. According to Sievers,
                    the roots are dried under sheds, out of the rays of the sun, and they sometimes
                    take a whole year to dry.</p>

                <p>Several varieties of rhubarb occur in commerce. The first and most esteemed is
                    <hi rend="italic">Turkey</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Russia</hi> rhubarb, which
                    was formerly brought to Europe chiefly through the Turkish provinces of Asia
                    Minor, but is now imported through Russia. It is brought from the native country
                    to the frontier town of Kiachta in Siberia, where it is examined by a Russian
                    government officer. All the pieces which are of bad quality are rejected and
                    burned, and those which are good are transmitted to Moscow and St Petersburg,
                    where they are again inspected, and any inferior pieces picked out. From this
                    careful examination Russian rhubarb is always of good quality, and bears a
                    higher price than any other kind.</p>
                <p>The pieces of Russian rhubarb are generally from one and a half to two inches
                    broad, sometimes of a flat shape, but more commonly two or three inches long,
                    and somewhat conical. The external surface is always irregular and angular, the
                    bark apparently having been removed in slices. They are always perforated by one
                    large hole, through which the cord has been passed in drying them; occasionally
                    some smaller holes are observed, not passing completely through, which have been
                    made in Russia, for the purpose of examining the interior of the specimens. The
                    colour externally is of a bright golden-yellow, owing to the pieces being
                    covered by powder, formed by their friction upon each other. When broken across
                    they present an irregular and rough surface, having a mottled appearance, owing
                    to the interlacing of yellow and brownish-red veins, which are more distinctly
                    seen when the surface is cut smooth. The smell of the rhubarb is strong and
                    peculiar, and the taste is bitter, astringent, and slightly aromatic. Under the
                    teeth good Russia rhubarb feels gritty, owing to the presence of small crystals
                    of oxalate of lime, which are dispersed in tufts through the root, and which may
                    be seen under the microscope, in a piece which has been boiled in water.</p>
                <p>The second variety of rhubarb, though commercially distinct from the Russian, is
                    perhaps originally derived from the same source. It is called <hi rend="italic"
                    >East India</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Chinese</hi> rhubarb, being imported
                    chiefly from Canton or Singapore. It is distinguished from Russian rhubarb by
                    the pieces being larger and heavier, and by their surface being not angular, but
                    rounded, the bark having apparently been removed by scraping, and not by
                    slicing. The holes by which it is perforated are generally smaller than those of
                    the Russian rhubarb, and the portions of the root surrounding the perforation
                    are frequently decayed. The fracture is uneven, and has a mottled appearance,
                    but is usually of a darker colour than the Russian kind. The smell and taste of
                    the Chinese is inferior to that of the Russian, but not in a very marked degree;
                    and it is generally equally gritty under the teeth. The powder of Chinese
                    rhubarb has rather a darker tint than that of the Russian; but the latter is
                    seldom found in the shops pure, and the difference generally is not very
                    apparent. As the Chinese rhubarb is not subjected to the same rigid examination
                    and selection as that brought through Russia, it is of inferior quality, and
                    brings a much lower price in the market. Thus, whilst Russia rhubarb in bond is
                    quoted in the official returns of the prices current, at eight shillings and
                    threepence per pound, the East India is stated to bring only from two shillings
                    and sixpence to four shillings. It does not appear, however, that the Chinese
                    rhubarb is in any essential respect inferior as a medicine to the Russian.</p>
                <p>Another variety of rhubarb has been described under the name of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Dutch trimmed,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Batavian,</hi> which, like the
                    Chinese, is brought from Canton or Singapore, and is always quoted in the prices
                    current as a distinct commercial kind. It is said to resemble the Russia rhubarb
                    in external characters, but is not superior in value to the common Chinese sort,
                    as it appears from the official returns that it brings the same price in the
                    market.</p>
                <p>The third commercial variety of rhubarb is the <hi rend="italic">English,</hi>
                    or, as it might more appropriately be called, <hi rend="italic">European;</hi>
                    for what is called in France <hi rend="italic">French</hi> rhubarb is merely an
                    equivalent sort grown in that country. The English rhubarb appears to be chiefly
                    the roots of <hi rend="italic">Rh. palmatum;</hi> it is cultivated to a large
                    extent, especially at Banbury in Oxfordshire, where it was first extensively
                    grown about the year 1780, by a Mr Hayward. Towards the end of last century many
                    attempts were made to cultivate the rhubarb in England for medicinal use,
                    accounts of which have been preserved in the Transactions of the Society for the
                    Encouragement of Arts, Manufactures, and Commerce. The expectations which were
                    then formed, and the opinions entertained, of the qualities of the English
                    rhubarb were very sanguine; but though it is still cultivated to a considerable
                    extent for this purpose, it is well known to be very inferior to the foreign
                    kinds. In France a great many varieties of rhubarb are cultivated at a place
                    called Rheumpole, in the department of Morbihan: they are chiefly <hi
                    rend="italic">Rh. undulatum, RA. rhaponticum,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Rh.
                    compactum.</hi> The cultivation of <hi rend="italic">Rh. palmatam</hi> there has
                    been abandoned, but for what reason is not very apparent. The produce of this
                    cultivation is what is sold in France as <hi rend="italic">French</hi>
                    rhubarb.</p>
                <p>English rhubarb is found in the shops under two forms; either in pieces cut so as
                    to resemble some of the Asiatic kinds, in which case it is called <hi
                    rend="italic">dressed</hi> or <hi rend="italic">trimmed;</hi> or in cylindrical
                    pieces four or five inches long, and about one inch thick, which are obviously
                    the smaller portions of the root dried entire or longitudinally split. This last
                    kind is termed <hi rend="italic">stick</hi> rhubarb. The first of these is the
                    only one which can be mistaken for foreign rhubarb, but it may at once be
                    distinguished by its being very much lighter than any of the Asiatic kinds, and
                    by its being, especially towards the centre, of a much softer texture. Its
                    fracture, like that of the Russian and Chinese rhubarb, is marked by the
                    reticulated veins, but it has generally rather a pinkish tint. It is sometimes,
                    though not commonly, gritty under the teeth; it has much less astringency and
                    bitterness to the taste than the Asiatic rhubarb, being generally somewhat
                    mucilaginous; and its smell, though often equally strong, is much less aromatic
                    and agreeable. The external appearance of European rhubarb is often very
                    deceptive, for it is a common practice to rub the pieces over with the powder of
                    the Turkey rhubarb, to make it pass for the more valuable drug; but its pinkish
                    colour is easily observed on Brushing the specimen, and its light weight and
                    softer texture at once proclaim the difference.</p>
                <p>In selecting rhubarb, the pieces should be found to have a good colour and smell,
                    and to be of a considerable specific gravity. Those which are worm-eaten, or are
                    of a dirty-brown or blackish colour, should be rejected; and, to ascertain these
                    points, brushing the surface should never be neglected, as inferior kinds are
                    very frequently disguised by unprincipled dealers, by covering the surface with
                    powder of good rhubarb; and worm holes are sometimes concealed by stopping them
                    with a paste made of the powder of genuine rhubarb and water.</p>
                <p>The chemical analysis of rhubarb is still very imperfect A yellowish
                    crystallizable principle has been obtained from it, to which the names of
                    Rheine, Rhaponticine, and Rhabarbarine have been given; but these various terms
                    have obviously been applied by different chemists to the same substance. This
                    appears to be merely the colouring matter of rhubarb, and not its active
                    principle, which may still be regarded as unknown. Whatever be the nature of the
                    active part of rhubarb, as it exists in the plant it is soluble both in water
                    and alcohol. Water takes up more of the purgative and less of the astringent
                    principles of rhubarb than alcohol; hence infusion is a good liquid form for
                    administering this medicine as a laxative. The watery preparations of rhubarb,
                    however, should always be made <pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:wu.89119129625&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=239" xml:id="kp-eb0719-0239-0229"
                    />by infusion, and not by decoction, as a high temperature impairs its purgative
                    property. It is for this reason that the common extract of rhubarb of the shops
                    is of no use as a laxative. Rhubarb, from its astringency, has been supposed to
                    contain tannine, but this has not been satisfactorily demonstrated by chemical
                    experiment. The r∞ts contain a certain proportion of starch. This is most
                    abundant in the English sort, which accounts for its generally having a somewhat
                    mucilaginous taste.</p>
                <p>The medicinal action of rhubarb varies according to the dose in which it is
                    administered. In small quantities, as three or four grains, it is a gentle
                    stomachic and astringent, and as such is employed in many cases of indigestion,
                    and a relaxed state of the bowels. In cases of diarrhoea in children, which are
                    generally attended with superabundant acidity of the <hi rend="italic">primae
                    viae,</hi> there is no safer or more effectual remedy than three or four grains
                    of rhubarb, with twice that quantity of prepared chalk, which may be taken two
                    or three times in the day.</p>
                <p>In larger doses, as in quantities from fifteen to thirty grains, rhubarb is a
                    mild and easy laxative, and, from its possessing no irritating qualities, is
                    valuable in all cases where the bowels might be injured by more active
                    substances. It is consequently well adapted to the more irritable constitutions
                    of children and females. Where there is derangement of the stomach or bowels
                    from indigestible matter, or from acidity, rhubarb is a very valuable laxative;
                    and in such cases its action is very much improved by its being combined with
                    magnesia. The well-known <hi rend="italic">Gregorfs powder,</hi> introduced by
                    the late professor of physic at Edinburgh, consists of two parts of rhubarb,
                    three of calcined magnesia, and one of ginger, and is one of the best remedies
                    which can be employed in such cases. The usual dose of this for an adult is a
                    tea-spoonful, which may be taken in water, combined with some aromatic tincture,
                    or with a little of the tincture of rhubarb itself.</p>
                <p>The colouring matter of rhubarb, and probably its purgative principle, are
                    absorbed into the circulation during its action on the system. That the
                    colouring matter is absorbed, is demonstrated by its presence in the urine, to
                    which it communicates a reddish-brown colour; a circumstance always to be borne
                    in mind in forming an opinion of any case in which rhubarb may have previously
                    been taken. The absorption of the purgative principle is inferred from the fact,
                    that the milk of nurses who are using this medicine sometimes exerts a laxative
                    influence on children at the breast.</p>
                <p>In the year 1835, the quantity of rhubarb imported into Great Britain amounted to
                    81,100 lbs., and in 1836 to 122,142 lbs., of which in the former year 44,522
                    lbs., and in the latter 44,468 lbs., were retained for home consumption; the
                    duty being one shilling per lb., yielded a net revenue of L.2220 in the one
                    year, and L.2236 in the other. (b. m.)</p>
