                <p><label type="entry">RICE</label>. “Rice <hi rend="italic">bras,"</hi> says Mr
                    Marsden, “whilst in the husk, is in Indian called <hi rend="italic">paddee,</hi>
                    and assumes a different name in each of its other various states. We observe no
                    distinction of this kind in Europe, where our grain retains through all its
                    stages, till it becomes flour, its original name of barley, wheat, or oats. The
                    following, besides many others, are names applied to rice in its different
                    stages of growth and preparation: <hi rend="italic">paddee,</hi> original name
                    of the seed; <hi rend="italic">oossay,</hi> grain of last season; <hi
                    rend="italic">bunnce,</hi> the plants before removed to the sawoors; <hi
                    rend="italic">bras,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">bray,</hi> rice, the husk of the
                    paddee being taken off; <hi rend="italic">charroop,</hi> rice cleaned for
                    boiling; <hi rend="italic">nassee,</hi> boiled rice; <hi rend="italic"
                    >peerang,</hi> yellow rice; <hi rend="italic">jambar,</hi> a service of rice,
                    &amp;c.</p>
                <p>“Among people whose general objects of contemplation are few, those which do of
                    necessity engage their attention are often more nicely discriminated than the
                    same objects among more enlightened people, whose ideas, ranging over the
                    extensive field of art and science, disdain to fix long on obvious and common
                    matters. <hi rend="italic">Paddee,</hi> in Sumatra and the Malay Islands, is
                    distinguished into two sorts; <hi rend="italic">laddang</hi> or upland paddee,
                    and <hi rend="italic">sawoor</hi> or lowland, which are always kept separate,
                    and will not grow reciprocally. Of these, the former bears the higher price,
                    being a whiter, heartier, and better-flavoured grain, and having the advantage
                    in point of keeping. The latter is much more prolific from the seed, and liable
                    to less risk in the culture, but is of a watery substance, produces less
                    increase in boiling, and is subject to a swifter decay. It is, however, in more
                    common use than the former. Besides this general distinction, the paddee of each
                    sort, particularly the laddang, presents a variety of species, which, as far as
                    my information extends, I shall enumerate and endeavour to describe. The common
                    kind of dry ground paddee; colour light brown; the size rather large, and very
                    little crooked at the extremity. Paddee <hi rend="italic">undal-long;</hi> dry
                    ground; short round grain; grows in whorls or bunches round the stock. Paddee
                    <hi rend="italic">Mass;</hi> dry ground; large grain; common. Paddee <hi
                    rend="italic">galloo;</hi> dry ground; light coloured; scarce. Paddee <hi
                    rend="italic">sennce;</hi> dry ground; deep coloured; small grain; scarce.
                    Paddee <hi rend="italic">ejoo;</hi> dry ground; light coloured. Paddee <hi
                    rend="italic">kooning;</hi> dry ground; deep yellow; fine rice; crooked and
                    pointed. Paddee <hi rend="italic">coocoor badium;</hi> dry ground; much
                    esteemed; light coloured: small, and very much crooked, resembling a dove’s
                    nail, from whence its name. <hi rend="italic">Paddee pesang;</hi> dry ground;
                    outer coat light brown; inner red; longer, smaller, and less crooked than the
                    <hi rend="italic">coocoor ballum,</hi> Paddee <hi rend="italic">santong;</hi>
                    the finest sort that is planted in wet ground; small, straight, and light
                    coloured. In general it may be observed that the larger grained rice is the
                    least esteemed, and the smaller and whiter the most prized. In the Lampoon
                    country they make a distinction of paddee <hi rend="italic">crawrang</hi> and
                    paddee <hi rend="italic">jerroo;</hi> the former of which is a month earlier in
                    growth than the latter.”</p>
                <p>The following is the Chinese method of cultivating rice, as it is stated by Sir
                    George Staunton: “Much of the low grounds in the middle and southern provinces
                    of the empire are appropriated to the culture of that grain. It constitutes, in
                    fact, the principal part of the food of all those inhabitants who are not so
                    indigent as to be forced to subsist on other and cheaper kinds of grain. A great
                    proportion of the surface of the country is well adapted for the production of
                    rice, which, from the time the seed is committed to the soil till the plant
                    approaches to maturity, requires to be immersed in a sheet of water. Many and
                    great rivers run through the principal provinces of China, the low grounds
                    bordering on those rivers are annually inundated, by which means is brought upon
                    their surface a rich mud or mucilage that fertilizes the soil, in the same
                    manner as Egypt receives its fecundative quality from the overflowing of the
                    Nile. The periodical rains which fall near the sources of the Yellow and the
                    Kiang rivers, not very far distant from those of the Ganges and the Burumpooter,
                    among <pb break="no" facs="ht:wu.89119129625&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=245"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0719-0245-0235"/>the mountains bounding India to the north and
                    China to the west, often swell those rivers to a prodigious height, though not a
                    drop should have fallen on the plains through which they afterwards flow.</p>
                <p>“After the mud has lain some days upon the plains in China, preparations are made
                    for planting them with rice. For this purpose a small piece of ground is
                    enclosed by a bank of clay; the earth is ploughed up; and an upright harrow,
                    with a row of wooden pins in the lower end, is drawn lightly over it by a
                    buffalo. The grain, which had previously been steeped in dung diluted with
                    animal water, is then sown very thickly upon it. A thin sheet of water is
                    immediately brought over it, either by channels leading to the spot from a
                    source above it, or, when below it, by means of a chain-pump, of which the use
                    is as familiar as that of a hoe to every Chinese husbandman. In a few days the
                    remainder of the ground intended for cultivation, if stiff, is ploughed, the
                    lumps broken by hoes, and the surface levelled by the harrow. As soon as the
                    shoots have attained the height of six or seven inches, they are plucked up by
                    the roots, the tops of the blades cut off, and each root is planted separately,
                    sometimes in small furrows turned with the plough, and sometimes in holes made
                    in rows by a drilling stick for that purpose. The roots are about half a foot
                    asunder. Water is brought over them a second time. For the convenience of
                    irrigation, and to regulate its proportion, the rice-fields are subdivided by
                    narrow ridges of clay into small enclosures. Through a channel in each ridge the
                    water is conveyed at will to every subdivision of the field. As the rice
                    approaches to maturity, the water, by evaporation and absorption, disappears
                    entirely; and the crop, when ripe, covers dry ground. The first crop or harvest,
                    in the southern provinces particularly, happens towards the end of May or
                    beginning of June. The instrument for reaping is a small sickle, dentated like a
                    saw, and crooked. Neither carts nor cattle are used to carry the sheaves off
                    from the spot where they were reaped; but they are placed regularly in frames,
                    two of which, suspended at the extremities of a bamboo pole, are carried across
                    the shoulders of a man, to the place intended for disengaging the grain from the
                    stems which had supported it. This operation is performed, not only by a flail,
                    as is customary in Europe, or by cattle treading the corn in the manner of other
                    orientalists, but sometimes also by striking it against a plank set upon its
                    edge, or beating it against the side of a large tub scolloped for that purpose;
                    the back and sides being much higher than the front, to prevent the grain from
                    being dispersed. After being winnowed, it is carried to the granary.</p>
                <p>“To remove the skin or husk of rice, a large strong earthen vessel, or hollow
                    stone, in form somewhat like that which is used elsewhere for filtering water,
                    is fixed firmly in the ground; and the grain, placed in it, is struck with a
                    conical stone fixed to the extremity of a lever, and cleared, sometimes indeed
                    imperfectly, from the husk. The stone is worked frequently by a person treading
                    upon the end of the lever. The same object is attained also by passing the grain
                    between two flat stones of a circular form, the upper of which turns round upon
                    the other, but at such a distance from it as not to break the intermediate
                    grain. The operation is performed on a large scale in mills turned by water; the
                    axis of the wheel carrying several arms, which by striking upon the ends of
                    levers, raise them in the same manner as is done by treading on them. Sometimes
                    twenty of these levers are worked at once. The straw from which the grain has
                    been disengaged is cut chiefly into chaff, to serve as provender for the very
                    few cattle employed in the Chinese husbandry.</p>
                <p>“The labour of the first crop being finished, the ground is immediately prepared
                    for the reception of fresh seeds. The first operation undertaken is that of
                    pulling up the stubble, collecting it into small heaps, which are burnt, and the
                    ashes scattered upon the field. The former processes are afterwards renewed. The
                    second crop is generally ripe late in October or early in November. The grain is
                    treated as before; but the stubble is no longer burnt. It is turned under with
                    the plough, and left to putrefy in the earth. This, with the slime brought upon
                    the ground by inundation, are the only manures usually employed in the culture
                    of rice.”</p>
