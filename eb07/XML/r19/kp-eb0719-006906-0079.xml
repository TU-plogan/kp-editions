                <p><label type="entry">RANGOON</label> a city and principal sea-port of the Bur-man
                    empire, in the province of Pegu. It is situated on the Rangoon river, one of the
                    mouths of the great Irrawaddy, about twenty-four miles from its mouth. The river
                    is broad, deep, and navigable. At its entrance it is nearly a mile in width, and
                    is distinguished by a clump of trees called the Elephant, which stands on the
                    western point. It gradually narrow’s to about a quarter of a mile opposite
                    Rangoon. There is a depth of from six to eight fathoms water in the river, and
                    no shoals; and there are four fathoms water on the bar at half flood. About
                    three miles below the town is the mouth of the Syriam or Pegu river, where it
                    joins the Rangoon. The country above is level, and agreeably variegated with
                    clumps of trees; although it appears to be much depopulated, from the frequent
                    wars between the Burmese and Peguers. The town, with the exception of the public
                    offices, and one or two houses, is built of wood, extends along the bank of the
                    river about a mile, and is about half or three quarters of a mile in breadth. It
                    is built in the form of a square, surrounded by a stockade fifteen feet high,
                    and on the north side it is farther strengthened by an indifferent fosse, across
                    which a wooden bridge is thrown. The fort or stockade is an irregular square,
                    the north and south faces of which were found to measure 1145 yards, the east
                    598, and the west 187. On the north face there arθ two gates and a sally-port,
                    on the south three gates and three sally-ports, on the east two gates, and on
                    the west one gate and one sally-port. The stockade is fifteen feet high, and is
                    composed of heavy beams of teak timber. The city and its suburbs are divided
                    into eight wards, superintended by an officer, whose business it is to maintain,
                    watch, and ward within his division. The palisaded fort or stockade is a town
                    composed of three wide and clean streets running east and west, and three
                    smaller ones crossing them, and fronting the gates of the south face. The most
                    populous part of the town is the suburb called TackalIy, immediately on the west
                    face of the stockade. Wooden stages are erected within the stockade for
                    musketeers to stand on in case of attack. A battery of twelve pieces of cannon,
                    raised on the banks, commands the river; but it has fallen into disrepair. The
                    town has by no means an imposing appearance. The wooden buildings along the
                    banks of the river resemble barns, though the great temple of Shoe Da-goon, in
                    the midst of its intermediate spires, forms a splendid object. This temple is a
                    well-known place of pilgrimage; it is frequented by many strangers during the
                    vernal festival in March, when, as it is usual in the East to connect commerce
                    and religion, a great fair is held near it. It is the only temple frequented as
                    a common place of worship by the inhabitants of Rangoon and its vicinity. The
                    principal part of the city is situated within the stockade; the streets are wide
                    and at right angles; and one or two houses only are built of brick and chunam,
                    the chief of which is the custom-house. The dwellings of the common people are
                    constructed of posts driven into the ground, at the distance of two or three
                    feet, from which there is a bamboo grating forming the floor. The roof is
                    covered with the leaves of the palmyra, or long grass twisted round and sewed to
                    slips of bamboo. The houses of the priests are large buildings of teak, with
                    substantial tiled roofs; the floors are commonly eight or twelve feet from the
                    ground, and many of them are carved. In these are contained the marble or gilded
                    wooden images of Gaudma, seated on an oak, in which their sacred books are
                    contained. The suburb of Tackally, inhabited by the lower classes, is more
                    populous than the town itself. Almost all the houses here, as in other parts,
                    are composed of the cheapest and frailest materials, and are peculiarly liable
                    to destruction by fire. In March 1826, Mr Crawford, who was sent on an embassy
                    to Ava, saw the whole suburb burned to the ground in a few hours, from the
                    accident of a pot boiling over. It was reconstructed in less than a month, and
                    the houses were far more numerous than before the accident. The great pagoda or
                    golden temple is situated two and a half miles in the rear of Rangoon; the road
                    to it is through one of the northern gates, by a causeway across the fosse. The
                    road then ascends between two rows of smaller pagodas, until the eminence is
                    reached upon which the temple is situated, occupying the highest of three
                    platforms. The building is octagonal at the base and spiral at the top, and is
                    estimated at 330 feet in height. It is highly gilt on the top, and is an
                    umbrella of open iron work, surmounted by a vane, and a small globe of glass.
                    Bells are hung round the lower part. There are no apertures in the building,
                    which is solid throughout. It has small niches all around, that formerly
                    contained images of marble and wood. But these were mostly removed by the
                    English when they occupied the town during the Burmese war. The smaller pagodas
                    were also mostly pillaged by the soldiery. On the southern side of the pagoda is
                    a beautiful pavilion, gilt and painted, containing an image of Gaudma, of
                    gigantic dimensions. The river Rangoon is extremely commodious for
                    ship-building, which is carried on to a great extent. The spring-tides rise to
                    the perpendicular height of twenty feet. The banks are soft, and so flat that
                    there is need of little labour for the formation of <pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:wu.89119129625&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=80" xml:id="kp-eb0719-0080-0070"/>1
                    docks, and vessels of any burden may be built. It is estimated that vessels can
                    be built at Rangoon for one third less than at Bombay. This capital of the
                    Burmese empire is the resort of traders from all nations; and it is also an
                    -asylum for less respectable characters, such as insolvent debtors from
                    different settlements of India, foreigners of desperate fortunes, who are
                    received in the most friendly manner by the Burmans, and generally support
                    themselves by some petty traffic. Malabars, Moguls, Persians, Parsees,
                    Armenians, Portuguese, French, and English, men of all countries and of all
                    complexions, are here seen mingled together on the exchange; and all meet with
                    the most perfect toleration for their religion, provided they do not meddle with
                    the worship of the Burmese divinity, Guadma, or with the ceremonies of any other
                    sect. A considerable portion of the inhabitants are Chinese, who are merchants,
                    shopkeepers, artisans, and constitute the most industrious portion of the
                    community. A share of the trade is also engrossed by the Parsees, Armenians, and
                    a small portion of the Mahommedans, who ∙are also selected by government to fill
                    offices of trust that relate to the trade and the transactions of
                    foreigners.</p>
                <p>The imports from the British settlements consist chiefly of coarse piece-goods,
                    glass, hardware, and broad cloth. The returns are chiefly made in timber, with
                    which Madras is mostly supplied from Rangoon. The trade is carried on in boats,
                    about ten or twelve of which are annually fitted out, and about thirty more from
                    various towns on the Irrawaddy river. These proceed by the way of the Bassein
                    river, through the channels which divide the great Negrais from the continent,
                    along the coast of Arracan, to Luckipore, Dacca, Calcutta, Bogwandola, and even
                    to Patna and Benares. They caιτy each a crew of from twenty to twenty-five men;
                    and on an average 4000 rupees in bullion, the remainder of the cargo consisting
                    of sheathing boards, sticks of copper from China, Sticklac, cutch, ivory, and
                    wax.</p>
                <p>The inhabitants are stout and athletic, the men being about five feet eight
                    inches in height, with straight muscular limbs; the women rather diminutive, but
                    well formed in every respect, except the nose, which is flat. Both sexes are of
                    a copper colour; they are lively and inquisitive; almost all of them read and
                    write, and have no prejudices that obstruct the progress of improvement. The
                    women are not immured at home like those of Hindustan, but superintend the
                    domestic economy, and weave the clothes worn by the men. Their own dress is
                    scanty, and scarcely affords them a decent covering. They are not strict in
                    their morals; and the men are in the practice of selling their wives and their
                    daughters. The population is estimated at 30,000; but Crawford, on a census
                    which he directed to be made whilst in the country, states it at 181,000. Long.
