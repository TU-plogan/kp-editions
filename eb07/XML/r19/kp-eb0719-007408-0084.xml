                    which the ships of war are divided, according to their force and magnitude.</p>
                <p>Ships of the first rate mount a hundred guns, having forty-two pounders on the
                    lower deck, twenty-four pounders on the middle deck, twelve-pounders on the
                    upper deck, and six-pounders on the quarter-deck and forecastle. They are manned
                    with 850 men, including officers, seamen, marines, and servants.</p>
                <p>Ships of the second rate carry ninety guns upon three <pb break="no"

                    />decks, of which those on the lower battery are thirty-two-’ pounders; those on
                    the middle eighteen-pounders; on the upper deck twelve-pounders; and those on
                    the quarter-deck six-pounders, which usually amount to four or six. Their
                    complement of men is 750, in which there are six lieutenants, four master’s
                    mates, twenty-four midshipmen, and four surgeon’s mates, fourteen
                    quarter-masters and their mates, eight boatswain’s mates and yeomen, six
                    gunner’s mates and yeomen, with twenty-two quarter-gunners, two carpenter’s
                    mates with ten assistants, and one steward and steward’s mate.</p>
                <p>Ships of the third rate carry from sixty-four to eighty cannon, which are
                    thirty-two, eighteen, and nine-pounders. The eighty-gun ships, however, begin to
                    grow out of repute, and to give way to those of seventy-four, seventy, &amp;c.
                    which have only two whole batteries; whereas the former have three, with
                    twenty-eight guns planted on each, the cannon of their upper deck being the same
                    as those on the quarter-deck and forecastle of the latter, which are
                    nine-pounders. The complement in a seventy-four is 650, and in a sixty-four 500
                    men; these have in peace four lieutenants, but in war five, and, when an admiral
                    is aboard, six. They have also three master’s mates, sixteen midshipmen, three
                    surgeon’s mates, ten quarter-masters and their mates, six boatswain’s mates and
                    yeomen, four gunner’s mates and yeomen, with eighteen quarter-gunners, one
                    carpenter’s mate with eight assistants, and one steward and steward’s mate under
                    the purser.</p>
                <p>Ships of the fourth rate mount from sixty to fifty guns, upon two decks and the
                    quarter-deck. The lower tier is composed of twenty-four pounders, the upper tier
                    of twelve-pounders, and the cannon on the quarter deck and forecastle are
                    six-pounders. The complement of a fifty-gun ship is 350 men, in which there are
                    three lieutenants, two master’s mates, ten midshipmen, two surgeon’s mates,
                    eight quartermasters and their mates, four boatswain’s mates and yeomen, one
                    gunner’s mate and one yeoman, with twelve quarter-gunners, one carpenter’s mate
                    and six assistants, a steward and steward’s mate.</p>
                <p>All vessels of war under the fourth rate are usually comprehended under the
                    general name of <hi rend="italic">frigates,</hi> and never appear in the line of
                    battle. They are divided into the fifth and sixth rates; the former mounting
                    from forty to thirty-two guns, and the latter from twenty-eight to twenty. The
                    largest of the fifth rate have two decks of cannon, the lower battery being of
                    eighteen-pounders, and that of the upper deck of nine-pounders; but those of
                    thirty-six and thirty-two guns have one complete deck of guns, mounting
                    twelve-pounders, besides the quarter-deck and forecastle, which carry
                    six-pounders. The complement of a ship of forty-four guns is 280 men, and that
                    of a frigate of thirty-six guns 240 men. The first has three and the second two
                    lieutenants; and both have two master’s mates, six midshipmen, two surgeon’s
                    mates, six quarter-masters and their mates, two boatswain’s mates and one
                    yeoman, one gunner’s mate and one yeoman, with ten or eleven quarter-gunners,
                    and one purser’s steward.</p>
                <p>Frigates of the sixth rate carry nine-pounders, those of twenty guns having
                    three-pounders on their quarter-deck, with 200 men for their complement; and
                    those of twenty-four 160 men. The former has two lieutenants, the latter one;
                    and both have two master’s mates, four midshipmen, one surgeon’s mate, four
                    quarter-masters and their mates, one boatswain’s mate and one yeoman, one
                    gunner’s mate and one yeoman, with six or seven quarter-gunners, and one
                    purser’s steward.</p>
                <p>The sloops of war carry from eight to eighteen cannon, the largest of which have
                    six-pounders; and the smallest, that is, those of eight or ten guns,
                    four-pounders. Their officers are generally the same as in the sixth rates, with
                    little variation; and their complements of men vary from 60</p>
                <p>to 120, in proportion to their force or magnitude. Bomb-vessels are on the same
                    establishment as sloops; but fireships and hospital-ships are on that of fifth
                    rates.</p>
