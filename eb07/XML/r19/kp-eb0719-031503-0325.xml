                <p><label type="entry">ROMAN CATHOLICS</label> Under the head History
                    (EcclesiasticaD will be found an account of the rise and progress of that
                    religious system which, before the sixteenth century, held undisputed sway in
                    what was called the Christian world. Under the head Reformation is given a
                    history of the successful struggles made by sevetal of the states of Europe to
                    deliver themselves from priestly domination; and for a view of the theological
                    tenets of the Roman Catholics, we may refer to the articles Pope, Popery,
                    Purgatory, &amp;c. It only remains that we shortly notice the extent to which
                    the Roman Catholic faith prevails in the world at the present day, and the
                    political state of its adherents in our own country.</p>
                <p>There is no country where popery is the established reli gion, in the same sense
                    in which the Churches of England and Scotland are the established religion of
                    Britain. The Catholic clergy everywhere claim <hi rend="italic"
                    >independent,</hi> if not supreme authority, and never form any political
                    alliance with the state. In some countries, however, popery is not only the
                    religion of the government, but also exclusively, or almost exclusively, of the
                    people; and to that extent it may be called the <hi rend="italic">established
                    religion</hi> of the state. In others, the people are divided between the
                    catholic and the protestant faith, and both are recognised by the government.
                    The cruelty and oppression which have been perpetrated by religious zealots,
                    ambitious priests, and crafty rulers, under the sacred name of religion, have
                    given occasion to the infidel and the scoffer to cast on Christianity itself the
                    reproach which is due only to fanaticism and bigotry. Tothisreproach both
                    Catholic and Protestant are liable; but there can be no doubt, that in the
                    efforts,of the Church of Rome to maintain its ancient dominion over the human
                    mind, it has been more unscrupulous in the use of persecution than the
                    Protestant powers. Happily, however, the fierceness of persecution has now
                    greatly abated in catholic countries; and, on the other hand, Catholics are
                    tolerated in every protestant state.</p>
                <p>In France the <hi rend="italic">Charte</hi> gives freedom of worship to all
                    religions; butabout 14-15ths of the people belong to the Catholic Church, the
                    small remainder being Protestants.</p>
                <p>In Switzerland, outer Appenzell, almost the whole of Berne, Basel, Schaffhausen,
                    Vaud, and Neufchatel, the greater part of Glarus, Grisons, Aargau, Thurgau, and
                    Geneva, and the minority in Friburg, Soleure, and St. Gall, profess Calvinism.
                    <hi rend="italic">Catholicism</hi> is professed exclusively in Lucerne, Uri,
                    Schwitz, Unterwald, Zug, inner Appenzell, Fessin, and Valais; by the majority in
                    Friburg, Soleure, and St. Gall; and by the minority in theother cantons. About
                    12-20ths of the Swiss are Protestant; the remainder Catholics.</p>
                <p>In Belgium all religions are freely professed; butcatho-licism is the religion of
                    almost the entire nation.</p>
                <p>In Holland all religions are professed with equal freedom; but Calvinism is the
                    religion of the state. The Catholics are comparatively few.</p>
                <p>In Germany catholicism and protestantism are so mixed, that it is scarcely
                    possible to assign them definite limits, or approximate to their relative
                    numbers. Protestantism, however, prevails mostly in the northern and
                    south-western parts of the country; popery in the south-east, south, and west.
                    Their numbers are not far from being equal.</p>
                <p>In the Austrian empire popery is the dominant religion, and professed by the
                    great majority of the inhabitants.</p>
                <p>In Prussia protestantism is the government religion; but the professors of all
                    religions enjoy freedom of worship, and almost equal rights. Lutheranism is
                    professed by the great majority in East Prussia, Brandenburg, Pomerania, and
                    Saxony; popery in the Westphalian and Rhenish provinces, and the grand-duchy of
                    Posen. Silesiaand West Prussia are almost equally divided.</p>
                <p>In Denmark, Sweden, and Norway, Lutheranism is the <pb break="no"

                    />State religion, but all others are tolerated. The Catholics are few in
                    number.</p>
                <p>Catholics abound in Russia, but mostly in the Polish provinces, where they are
                    not only freely tolerated, but enjoy every political right in common with other
                    subjects. Their number may amount to about 12,000,000, or l-5th of the
                    population of the empire.</p>
                <p>In Italy, Spain, and Portugal, popery is dominant and exclusive; but other
                    religions, though not legally tolerated, are not now persecuted.</p>
                <p>In Turkey and Greece popery is fully tolerated, but professed by few if by any of
                    the natives.</p>
                <p>In America popery is the dominant religion of all the late Spanish and Portuguese
                    colonies. In some of them no other religion is tolerated <hi rend="italic"> by
                    law,</hi> but nobody is persecuted for professing any other. In the United
                    States of North America, there are about 800,000 Catholics. In Lower Canada,
                    they form the majority of the population.</p>
                <p>In Great Britain popery is now not merely tolerated, but Roman Catholics are
                    admitted to equal, or nearly equal, political rights with Protestants.</p>
                <p>In 1837, the total number of Catholics throughout the world, was reckoned by
                    Adrien Balbi at 1.39,000,000, out of 737,000,000, which he considers to be the
                    total population of the globe.</p>
                <p>Before the passing of tile various Roman Catholic Emancipation Acts, the
                    Catholics in Great Britain and Ireland were subjected to a system of stringent
                    penal laws. The laws in force against them, previously to the Act 18 Geo. III.
                    cap. 60; and 31 Geo. III. cap. 32, may be divided into three classes: 1. Those
                    respecting persons professing popery. 2. Those respecting popish recusants
                    convict. 3. Those respecting popish priests.</p>
                <p>I. Persons professing popery, besides the penalties for not attending their
                    parish church, were disabled from taking their lands by either descent or
                    purchase, after eighteen years of age, until they renounced their errors; were
                    obliged at twenty-one to register their estates before acquired, and all future
                    conveyances and wills relating to them; were incapable of presenting to any
                    advowson, or granting to any other person any avoidance of the same; might not
                    keep or teach any school under pain of perpetual imprisonment; and if they
                    willingly heard or said mass, they forfeited for the one 100, and tor the other
                    200 marks, and were to suffer a year’s imprisonment. If any evil industry was
                    used to rivet the errors of popery upon those who already professed it; if any
                    person sent another abroad to be educated in popery, or to reside in any
                    religious house for that purpose, or contributed to his maintenance when there,
                    the sent, the sender, and the contributor, were disabled to sue in law or
                    equity, to be executor or administrators to any person, or to bear any office in
                    the realm, and forfeited all their goods and chattels, and likewise all their
                    real estate for life. Where these errors were aggravated by apostacy or
                    perversion, where a person was reconciled to the see of Rome, or procured others
                    to be reconciled, the offence amounted to high treason.</p>
                <p>II. Popish recusants convicted in a court of law of not attending the service of
                    the Church -of England, were subject to the following disabilities, penalties,
                    and forfeitures, over and above those before mentioned. They were considered as
                    persons excommunicated; they could hold no office or employment; if they kept
                    arms in their houses, the same might be seized by the Justices of the Peace;
                    they might not come within ten miles of London, under the penalty ol’L 100;
                    could bring no action at law or suit in equity; were not allowed to travel above
                    five miles from home, unless by licence, upon pain of forfeiting all their
                    goods; and they might not come to court under the penalty of L.100. No marriage
                    or burial of such recusant, or baptism of his child, should be had otherwise
                    than by the ministers of the Church of England, underother severe penalties. A
                    married woman, when recusant, forfeited two-thirds of her dower or jointure, and
                    might not be executrix, or administratrix to her husband, or have any part of
                    his goods; and during the coverture might be kept in prison, unless her husband
                    redeemed her at the rate of L.l 0 a month, or the third part of all his lands.
                    And, lastly, as <hi rend="italic">a femme couverte</hi> (married woman) recusant
                    might be imprisoned, so all others must, within three months after conviction,
                    either submit, and renounce their errors, or, if required so to do by four
                    justices, abjure and renounce the realm; and if they did not depart, or if they
                    returned without the king’s licence, they should be guilty of felony, without
                    benefit of clergy. There was also an inferior kind of recusancy, (refusing to
                    make the declaration against popery enjoined by Act 30 Car. II. cap. 2, when
                    tendered by the proper magistrate,) which, if the party resided within ten miles
                    of London, made him an absolute recusant convict; or, if at a greater distance,
                    suspended him from having any seat in Parliament, keeping arms in his house, or
                    any horse above the value of L.5.</p>
                <p>III. Popish priests were placed in a still more slavish situation. For, by
                    statute 11 and 12 Wil. III. c. 4, popish priests or bishops celebrating mass,
                    and exercising any part of their functions in England, except in the houses of
                    ambassadors, were liable to perpetual imprisonment. And by the statute 27 Eliz.
                    c. 2, any popish priest born in the dominions of the crown of England, who
                    should come hither from beyond sea, or should be in England without conforming,
                    and taking the oaths, was guilty of high treason; and all persons harbouring him
                    were guilty of felony without benefit of clergy.</p>
                <p>The first amendment of these inhuman laws, which affix an everlasting stain on
                    the British name, was effected by the statute 18 Geo. III. c. 60. With regard to
                    such papists as should duly take the oath therein prescribed, of allegiance to
                    his Majesty, abjuration of the Pretender, renunciation of the Pope’s civil
                    power, and abhorrence of the doctrines of destroying and not keeping faith with
                    heretics, and deposing or murdering princes excommunicated by authority of the
                    see of Rome, the statute 11 and 12 W. III. was repealed, so far as it disabled
                    them from purchasing or inheriting, or authorized the apprehending or
                    prosecuting of the popish clergy, or subjected them or any teachers of youth to
                    perpetual imprisonment. By the statute 31 Geo. III. c. 32. all the restrictions
                    and penalties above enumerated, were removed from those Catholics who were
                    willing to comply with the requisitions of that statute, which were, that they
                    must appear at some of the courts of Westminster, or at the quarter sessions
                    held for the county, city, or place where they might reside, and make and
                    subscribe a declaration that they professed the Roman Catholic religion, and
                    also an oath exactly similar to that required by 18 Geo. III. c. 60. On this
                    declaration and oath being duly made by any Roman Catholic, the officer of the
                    court was authorised to grant him a certificate; and such officer was required
                    yearly to transmit to the Privy Council lists of all persons who had thus
                    qualified themselves within the year in his court. Roman Catholics thus
                    qualified were not to be prosecuted under any statute for not repairing to a
                    parish church, nor for attending or performing mass or other ceremonies of the
                    Church <hi rend="italic">οi'</hi> Rome. But no Roman Catholic minister was to
                    officiate in any place of worship having a steeple and bell, or at any funeral
                    in a churchyard, or was to wear the habits of his order, except in a place allow
                    ed by the statute, or in a private house where there should not be more than
                    five persons besides the family. No person who had qualified was to be
                    prosecuted for instructing youth, except in an endowed school, or in one of the
                    English universities; or in the case of receiving into his school the child of
                    any Protestant father; and no Roman Catholic was to keep a school until his or
                    her name should be recorded as a teacher at the sessions.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="ht:wu.89119129625&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=327"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0719-0327-0317"/>
                <p>But no religious order was to be established; and every endowment of a school or
                    college by a Roman Catholic should still be superstitious and unlawful. And no
                    person should thenceforth be summoned to take the oath of supremacy, and the
                    declaration against transubstantiation. Nor should Roman Catholics who had
                    qualified, be removable from London and Westminster; neither should any peer who
                    had qualified be punishable for coming into the presence or palace of the king
                    or queen. No papist whatever should be any longer obliged to register their
                    names and estates, or to enrol their deeds and wills; and every Roman Catholic
                    who had qualified, might be permitted to act as a barrister, attorney, or
                    notary. Still, however, Roman Catholics could not sit in parliament, because
                    every member of parliament was required to take the oath of supremacy, and
                    repeat and subscribe the declaration against transubstantiation. Nor could they
                    vote at elections for members of the House of Commons in Great Britain, because,
                    before voting, they must have taken the oath of supremacy. But Roman Catholics
                    in Ireland were permitted to vote at elections, though they could not sit in
                    parliament.</p>
                <p>Most of the remaining restrictions upon Roman Catholics were removed by the Act
                    10 Geo. IV. cap. 7, entitled, “An Act for the relief of his Majesty’s Roman
                    Catholic subjecte,” and passed 13th April 1829. By this act it was provided that
                    all the preceding enactments (except as hereinafter excepted) should be
                    repealed; and that from and after the commencement of the act, it should be
                    lawful for any person professing the Roman Catholic religion, being a peer, or a
                    member of the House of Commons, to sit and vote in either House, upon taking and
                    subscribing the following oath, instead of the oath of supremacy, allegiance,
                    and abjuration:</p>
                <p>“I, A, B, do sincerely promise and swear, that I w ill be faithful, and bear true
                    allegiance to his Majesty, King , and will defend him to the utmost of my power,
                    against all conspiracies and attempts whatever, which shall be made against his
                    person, crown, or dignity; and I will do my utmost endeavour to disclose and
                    make known to his Majesty, his heirs and successors, all treasons and traitorous
                    conspiracies which may be formed against him or them; and I do faithfully
                    promise to maintain, support, and defend, to the utmost of my power, the
                    succession of the crown, which succession, by an Act entitled, ‘ An Act for the
                    further limitation of the Crown, and better securing the rights and liberties of
                    the subject,’ is, and stands limited to the Princess Sophia, Electress of
                    Hanover, and the heirs of her body, being Protestants; hereby utterly renouncing
                    and abjuring any obedience or allegiance unto any other person claiming or
                    pretending a right to the crown of this realm: and I do further declare, that it
                    is not an article of my faith, and that I do renounce, reject, and abjure the
                    opinion, that princes excommunicated or deprived by the pope, or any other
                    authority of the see of Rome, may be deposed or murdered by their subjects, or
                    by any person whatsoever; and I do declare that I do not believe that the pope
                    of Rome, or any other foreign prince, prelate, person, state, or potentate, hath
                    or ought to have any temporal or civil jurisdiction, power, superiority, or
                    pre-eminence, directly or indirectly, within this realm. I do swear that I will
                    defend to the utmost of my power, the settlement of property within this realm,
                    as established by the laws: and I do hereby disclaim, disavow, and solemnly
                    abjure any intention to subvert the present church establishment, as settled by
                    law within this realm; and I do solemnly swear that I will never exercise any
                    privilege to which I am or may become entitled, to disturb or weaken the
                    Protestant religion or Protestant government in the United Kingdom; and I do
                    solemnly, in the presence of God, profess, testify, and declare, that I do make
                    this declaration, and every part thereof, in the plain and ordinary sense of the
                    words of this oath, without any evasion, equivocation, or mental reservation
                    whatsoever. So help me God.”</p>
                <p>The other principal provisions of the Act are in substance as follows.</p>
                <p>Roman Catholics, upon taking the oath above recited, shall be entitled to vote at
                    elections for members of the House of Commons.</p>
                <p>Roman Catholics may hold civil and military offices under his Majesty, except the
                    office of Lord High Chancellor of Great Britain and, Ireland, Lord Lieutenant of
                    Ireland, or High Commissioner to the General Assembly of the Church of
                    Scotland.</p>
                <p>Roman Catholics to be eligible to become members of lay corporations, upon taking
                    the oath hereby appointed, and such other oaths as may now by law be required of
                    persons becoming members of such corporations; but such members are not to vote
                    or join in the presentation or appointments to any ecclesiastical benefice.</p>
                <p>No oath to be required from any Roman Catholic to enable him to hold any real or
                    personal property, other than such as may be tendered to any other subjects; and
                    the oath to be taken by Roman Catholic naval and military officers, to be taken
                    at the same time, and in the same manner as the oaths now required by law from
                    other subjects.</p>
                <p>The Roman Catholic faith in Ireland is professed by more than four-fifths of the
                    people, or, as ascertained in 1834, 6,427,712, out of a total population of
                    7,943,940; and in Great Britain, though the numbers are not precisely known,
                    they are believed, according to the most moderate calculation, to fall little
                    short of 1,000,000; by some they are even estimated at little short of
                    2,000,000; and according to the Catholic Directory, the number of Roman Catholic
                    chapels in England and Wales, in 1839, amounted to 453; in Scotland, to79; or,
                    altogether in Great Britain, to 532. Of that number no less than 90 are in
                    Lancashire alone, and 29 in Yorkshire; while Rutland and Huntingdon are the only
                    counties of England where there is none. Besides numerous smaller seminaries,
                    they possess ten colleges; viz. St. Edmund’s, Old Hall Green, Ware, in
                    Hertfordshire; Ushawy Durham; St. Mary’s, Birmingham; St. Peter’s and St.
                    Paul’s, both at Prior Park, Bath; Stonyhurst, Lancashire; Ampleforth, York; St
                    Gregory’s, Downside, Bath; German College, Broadway, Worcestershire; St. Mary’s,
                    at Blairs, on Deeside, Aberdeenshire; and a new college has been nearly finished
                    at Sutton Coldfield, Lancashire. They already number eighteen nunneries and
                    convents: Mecklegate bar, York; Hammersmith, Middlesex; Bishop’s House,
                    Winchester; Taunton Lodge, Somerset; New Hall, Chelmsford, Essex; Spettisbury
                    House, Blandford; Stanbrook Hall, Worcester; Caverswall Castle, Staffordshire;
                    Clare Lodge, Yorkshire; St. Mary’s Priory, Leamington, Warwickshire; Ashton
                    Hall, Staffordshire; Llanherne, South Cornwall; Carmel House, Darlington,
                    Durham; Court House, Bridgewater, Somerset; Sales-house, Westbury, Wiltshire;
                    Hartbury Court, Gloucester; Presentation, Manchester; St. Margaret’s,
                    Edinburgh.</p>
                <p>In Ireland the Roman Catholics have a regular hierarchy of archbishops, bishops,
                    deans, &amp;c., and have under them an establishment of upwards of 2000
                    parochial clergy. England is divided into four, and Scotland into three
                    districts, each under the superintendence of a vicar apostolic, bearing the
                    title of a bishop <hi rend="italic">in partibus ethnicoum.</hi></p>
