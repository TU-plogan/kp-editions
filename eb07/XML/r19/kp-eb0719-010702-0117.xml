                    significant corrections to the OCR text, predominantly in cases of confusing "c"
                    and "e." Isolates 90 entries that were mistakenly included at the end of prior
                    entries in v1 and v2. Normalizes ordinal numbers. Separates metadata in
                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra
                    space around the <gi>pb</gi> tag. Where a word is hyphenated at a <gi>pb</gi>,
                    the end fragment is now joined to the start fragment, making a machine-readable

                <p><label type="entry">REISKE</label> John James, a profound scholar and eminent
                    critic, was born in the year 1706, at a small town in the duchy of Anhalt, in
                    Germany. His connections, it would appear, were in a humble situation of life;
                    and, in consequence of the narrow circumstances in which he was placed, he had
                    many difficulties to struggle with during the early part of his education.
                    These, however, he surmounted by unabating perseverance; and in 1733 went to
                    Leipsic, where he remained during five years in the ardent pursuit of his
                    studies. Here he acquired an extensive knowledge of the Arabic, and engaged in
                    the translation of a book from that language, which was afterwards published.
                    With the view of prosecuting to greater advantage the study of Arabic, which had
                    become with him a favourite object of pursuit, he travelled on foot to Leyden,
                    where new difficulties attended him. Whilst he remained there he was employed in
                    arranging the Arabic manuscripts belonging to the university; and for this
                    labour he received a very small compensation. During his residence at Leyden,
                    part of his time was occupied in the translation of various essays from the
                    German and French languages into Latin. These essays afterwards appeared in the
                    <hi rend="italic">Miscellanea Critica.</hi> About the same time, also, our
                    learned author translated into Latin the whole of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Chariton</hi> from the Greek, and the Geography of Abul-feda from the
                    Arabic.</p>
                <p>Having spent eight years at Leyden, Reiske was driven from this place by jealousy
                    and calumny, which, it is said, were excited against him chiefly by the younger
                    Burmann, in consequence of his critical strictures on the edition of Petronius
                    published by that author; but before his departure from this learned seminary,
                    he had obtained the degree of doctor of physic, which was conferred in a manner
                    highly to his honour. He afterwards visited different parts of Germany, and at
                    last settled a second time at Leipsic, where he remained for twelve years. But
                    although he had received the appointment of professor of Arabic, the emoluments
                    of his office were so scanty, that he had still to struggle with all the
                    difficulties attendant on poverty, and, merely to procure a subsistence, was
                    obliged to engage in the humble employments of literary labour, and submit to
                    the severe and ill-requited drudgery of editing works for booksellers, or
                    contributing detached papers to periodical publications. About this time the <hi
                    rend="italic">Acta Eruditorum</hi> were greatly indebted to the labours of
                    Reiske. But in the midst of all the difficulties and hardships now alluded to,
                    he prepared and published a work of profound learning and great merit. This
                    work, which extended to five volumes, appeared under the title of <hi
                    rend="italic">Animadversiones in Auctores Groe-cos,</hi> and added much to our
                    author’s reputation.</p>
                <p>In the year 1758, in consequence of the death of HaI-tausius, he obtained a
                    situation, which was not only honourable, but lucrative. This was the place of
                    rector of the academy of Leipsic, in which he continued during the remainder of
                    his life. He was now raised above want, and being free from the difficulties and
                    embarrassmentswhich had hitherto constantly attended him, he was thus enabled,
                    in the midst of learned ease, to prosecute his favourite studies.</p>
                <p>In the year 1764 Reiske married E. C. Muller, a woman of great learning, and of
                    whom it is said that her knowledge, especially in Greek literature, was little
                    inferior to that of her husband. In all his literary labours she was an useful
                    associate; but the assistance which she contributed to his great work, the
                    edition of the Greek Orators, was particularly valuable. Thus passed the latter
                    period of the life of this learned man. He died in 1774, possessing a very
                    distinguished reputation as a scholar and a critic. The number of the works
                    which he superintended and published is very great. The most approved are the
                    following, viz. Remarks upon Greek Authors; an Edition of the Greek Ora<pb
