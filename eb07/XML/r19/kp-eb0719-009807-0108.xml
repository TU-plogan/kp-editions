                    Deaths, and Burials, in England and Wales. The first known public authority
                    under which registers recording births or baptisms, marriages, deaths or
                    burials, were systematically kept in England, was an injunction issued in
                    September 1538 (30 Hen. VIII.), by Thomas Lord Cromwell, lord privy seal and
                    vicegerent to the king, which enjoined, that in every parish a register-book
                    should be kept in a coffer with two locks, by the parson, vicar, or curate, and
                    churchwardens; and that every Sunday, in the presence of one of the
                    churchwardens, the parson, &amp;c. should enter in a register-book a written
                    record of the dates and names of the weddings, christenings, and burials, of the
                    preceding week; by neglect of which duty he incurred a fine of three shillings
                    and fourpence, to be employed in the repair of the church.</p>
                <p>In 1547, an injunction was issued by Edward VI. similar to that of 1538,
                    excepting only that the penalty was directed “to be employed to the poore-box”
                    of the parish.</p>
                <p>Inquiry was directed, at the instance of Cardinal Pole, under Philipand Mary, in
                    the years 1555 and 1557, whether the clergy had complied with these directions;
                    and in the first year of Queen Elizabeth, 1559, a further injunction was issued,
                    which differed from that of Edward VI. in 1547 only in directing that the
                    penalty should be divided between the poor-box and the repair of the church.
                    These injunctions were not very strictly observed, as appears by the preamble of
                    a bill to “authorize every archbishop and bishop to erect one office of
                    registership of all the church-books, to be kept in every diocese,” which, in
                    March 1563, was read a first time in the House of Commons, but did not pass.</p>
                <p>The great importance of registration was in 1590 represented to the
                    Lord-treasurer Burghley, who, impressed with the force of the representation,
                    communicated a plan to the Archbishop of Canterbury. Nothing, however, appears
                    to have been done in consequence until October 1597, when a constitution was
                    made by the archbishop, bishops, and clergy of the province of Canterbury, and
                    approved by the queen; which notices the very great utility of parish-registers,
                    and gives minute directions for keeping them, and for the transmission of a
                    transcript yearly to the diocesan registrar. It appears, too, that persons were
                    appointed for the purpose of ascertaining if the several orders had been
                    complied with; and that every minister, at institution, was required to declare
                    that he would “keep the register-book according to the queen’s majesty’s
                    injunctions.”</p>
                <p>In 1603, the first year of the reign of James I. another <pb break="no"

                    />injunction was issued similar to that of 1597, with the important addition of
                    a clause, appointing that the ancient registers, so far as they could be
                    procured, but especially since the beginning of the reign of Elizabeth, should
                    be copied into a parchment-book, to be provided by every parish; after which,
                    nothing more appears to have emanated, either from the ecclesiastical or civil
                    authorities, on this subject, till the time of the Long Parliament, when the
                    following entry in the Journal of the House of Commons gives evidence of
                    attention to the importance of registration.</p>
                <p>“Anno 1644, Dec. 6. Ordered, that it be referred to the committee for bringing in
                    the ordinance for the establishing the directory, to bring in a clause in that
                    ordinance, for registering the time of baptizing of children, and their parents’
                    names, and for registering of burials.” In the same year an ordinance was made,
                    directing, that in every parish or chapelry in England and Wales, the minister
                    and other church-officers should keep a register of birth and baptism, of
                    marriage, and of burial; and that all persons reasonably desiring it might
                    search therein and obtain copies.</p>
                <p>In August 1653, in pursuance of the recommendations of a law-reform committee
                    appointed in the preceding year, and including many eminent persons, an act was
                    passed, which directed that in every parish a register-book shall be provided
                    for registering all marriages, births, and burials in the parish; and that the
                    custody of such book, and the duty of registration, shall be given to a person,
                    to be called the parish registrar, appointed by the parishioners chargeable to
                    the poor, and approved by a justice of the peace. It was also enacted, that
                    extra-parochial places, or small parishes, might be united, for the purposes of
                    registration, to other parishes, by the justices at their sessions; and that all
                    existing register-books should be kept by the registering officers appointed
                    under that act.</p>
                <p>This act was not confirmed at the Restoration, and the business of registration
                    reverted to the clergy of the established church. During the reigns of Charles
                    II. and James II. nothing was done with respect to registers, except that, by a
                    clause in the act of 30 Car. II. c. 3, entitled “an act for burying in woollen,”
                    it was enacted that all clergymen “do, within their respective parishes,
                    precincts, and places, take an exact account, and keep a register, of all and
                    every person or persons buried in his or their respective parishes or precincts,
                    or in such common burial-places as their respective parishioners are usually
                    buried.”</p>
                <p>In the reign of William III. registration was rendered a source of revenue. The
                    act of 6 and 7 William III. c. 6, granted duties on births, marriages, and
                    burials, and compelled the clergy, under a penalty of L.100, to keep an exact
                    register of all persons born, christened, married, or buried in their respective
                    parishes, to which register the collector of the tax, and all persons concerned,
                    might have free access without fee. It thus imposed on the clergyman the onerous
                    duty of acting gratuitously as a civil functionary, and collecting information
                    of all births within his parish, without distinction of sect, and irrespective
                    of baptism, a duty the difficulty of which was rendered greater by the attempts
                    of the parents to conceal the birth, in order to elude the payment of the tax.
                    With a view to obviate this objection, an act was passed in the following year
                    (7 and 8 William III. c. 35), which provided that parents should, within five
                    days after birth, give notice of the day of the birth to the clergyman, under a
                    penalty of forty shillings, and that the clergyman should, under a like penalty,
                    register such birth, for which the parents were to pay sixpence; and by the 4th
                    of Anne, c. 12, the clergy were relieved from the ruinous penalties incurred
                    under the act of 6 and 7 William III. c. 6, in all cases where the duties
                    ha&lt;¼ been really paid.</p>
                <p>The 26th Geo. II. c. 33, an act “to prevent clandestine marriages,” directed the
                    church-wardens of every parish to provide books of vellum, or good and durable
                    paper, for the registration of marriages. By the 23d of Geo. III. c. 67, a
                    stamp-duty of threepence was imposed upon every registered entry of burial,
                    marriage, birth, or christening, to be demanded by the clergyman from the
                    undertaker, or from the parties married, or from the parents of the child whose
                    birth or christening had been registered. By 25 Geo. III. c. 75, the provisions
                    of that act were extended to dissenting ministers. These measures excited much
                    objection, and were repealed in 1794.</p>
                <p>The next legislative measure affecting registers was the 52d Geo. III. c. 146,
                    entitled “an act for the better regulating and preserving parish and other
                    registers of births, baptisms, marriages, and burials, in England.” After
                    reciting that “the amending the manner and form of keeping and of preserving
                    registers of baptisms, marriages, and burials of his majesty’s subjects in the
                    several parishes and places in England, will greatly facilitate the proof of
                    pedigrees of persons claiming to be entitled to real or personal estates, and be
                    otherwise of great public benefit and advantage,” it enacts, that, after the
                    31st of December 1812, registers of baptisms, marriages, and burials, according
                    to the rites of the established church, shall be made and kept by the
                    officiating minister of every parish and chapelry, in books to be provided by
                    the king’s printer, at the expense of the respective parishes, according to the
                    forms contained in schedules annexed to that act. These schedules contain the
                    following particulars: In case of <hi rend="italic">baptism,—</hi> when
                    baptized; child’s Christian name; parents’ Christian names and surnames; abode;
                    quality, trade, or profession; by whom the ceremony was performed. In case of
                    <hi rend="italic">marriage,—</hi> the name and parish of the man; the same of
                    the woman; when married; whether by banns or license; whether by consent of
                    parents or guardians; when; by whom; signature of officiating minister of the
                    parties married, and of two witnesses. In case of <hi rend="italic"
                    >burial,—</hi> the name; abode; when buried; age; by whom the ceremony was
                    performed.</p>
                <p>The registers of baptism, marriage, and burial were to be kept in separate books,
                    and signed within seven days after each ceremony had been performed. Annual
                    copies were to be made, verified, and signed by the officiating minister, and
                    attested by the church-wardens, and transmitted by them yearly to the registrar
                    of the diocese; which registrar must report thereon to his bishop; must deposit
                    such copies in a safe receptacle, arranged for reference; and cause alphabetical
                    lists of persons and places to be made, kept, and opened for search.</p>
                <p>It is to be observed that this act, which referred in its title to registers of
                    births, made no provision for recording the date of birth. Neither did it
                    provide a record of the date of death. It only provided records of the
                    performance of the religious ceremonies of baptism, marriage, and burial,
                    according to the rites of the Established Church. It therefore afforded an
                    insufficient register, even for members of the Established Church, whilst for
                    those who dissented from the Established Church, and therefore did not avail
                    themselves of its ordinances for baptism or burial, it provided no register at
                    all.</p>
                <p>The inadequacy of this system, even if frllly carried into effect, and the
                    insufficient manner in which it was complied with, called loudly for
                    investigation and remedy, and became the subject of inquiry before a select
                    committee of the House of Commons, appointed in March 1833, who, having, as they
                    state, received evidence on registration “from clergymen of the established
                    church, and from parish-clerks; from gentlemen of the legal profession; from
                    authors devoted to antiquarian research; from persons of different religious
                    denominations, including Catholics, Dissenters, Jews, and Quakers; from
                    gentlemen eminently scientific, and attached to statistical inquiries; from
                    medical audio<pb break="no" facs="ht:wu.89119129625&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=110"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0719-0110-0100"/>rities, who have long desired ampler and more
                    accurate information on the extent and causes of mortality; from an eminent
                    foreigner, distinguished for extensive and accurate statistical intelligence;
                    and others, whose wide-spread inquiries in foreign countries, and peculiar
                    facilities of information, entitled them to respect ;” unanimously agreed to a
                    report, which expressed the following opinions as the conclusions at which they
                    had arrived.</p>
                <p>“1. That the subject is urgently important.</p>
                <p>“2. That it involves matters of great public and national interest, as well as
                    individual satisfaction, and rights and claims to property; and deserves the
                    attention of the humblest artisan as well as of the most philosophical and
                    states-man-like inquirer.</p>
                <p>“3. That the existing law is imperfect and unjust, and requires not merely
                    partial amendment, but real fundamental reform.</p>
                <p>“4. That the present plan, even if improved and perfected, as applicable to the
                    members of the established church, being founded on religious rights, is
                    exclusive and intolerant, as it would not include a very considerable portion of
                    the reflecting, intelligent, and influential population of the country, who are
                    Protestant and Catholic dissenters from that church, and 1100 congregations who
                    disapprove infant baptism, and must practically punish them (including, too, the
                    community who may purchase or derive property from them) for claiming the rights
                    of conscience, and believing what their judgments direct.</p>
                <p>“5. That even to many pious and worthy clergymen of the established church the
                    system is productive of pain and regret, as it often induces a compliance, from
                    mere secular motives, with sacraments which they highly estimate and devoutly
                    revere. But,</p>
                <p>“6. That even as to the members of the church it is detrimental and absurd, since
                    the registers are mere registers of baptisms and not of births, of burials and
                    not of deaths; since they supply no adequate proof of pedigrees, or means of
                    proving or tracing ancestral descent; since they are often falsified, stolen,
                    burnt, inaccurately inscribed, and carelessly preserved; since the securities
                    intended to be given by the last general register act (52 Geo. III.), by
                    directing the yearly and universal transcription of the registers, their deposit
                    with the diocesan records, and the preparation of indexes to facilitate
                    searches, have all experienced only the most limited fulfilment, as, while one
                    fourth of the parishes make no returns, the returns that have been sent are
                    never indorsed, and are subject to fire and decay, and the directions of the act
                    have not and cannot be enforced; and since the value of property is diminished
                    by the difficulties incident to its transfer, and the insecurity by which it is
                    so often held and acquired. And,</p>
                <p>“7. That great trouble, vast expense, utter uncertainty, capricious charges, and
                    local and general evils exist, while no means are supplied to obtain the
                    information other countries possess, and justly value, as to the state of
                    disease, the operation of moral and physical causes on the health of the people,
                    the progress of population, and other matters on which accurate Knowledge can
                    scarcely be too highly appreciated or too intensely pursued.”</p>
                <p>The committee further recommended, that, as a remedy for the defects before
                    mentioned, “a national civil registration of births, marriages, and deaths,
                    should be established,” including “all ranks of society, and religionists of
                    every class.”</p>
                <p>In pursuance of these recommendations, measures for effecting a better
                    registration were laid before parliament; and in August 1836 the act for
                    registering births, deaths, and marriages in England, and the act for marriages
                    in England, became law. Their operation was suspended for a limited time by the
                    act of 7 Will. IV <hi rend="subscript">υ</hi> chap. 1, and they were amend ed by
                    the act of 1 Vict. chap. 22, and thus amended they came into operation on the
                    1st of July 1837.</p>
                <p>These acts leave untouched the act of 1812 so far as it relates to the
                    registration of baptisms and burials, but repeal what relates to the
                    registration of marriages, and provide a new registration of marriages, of <hi
                    rend="italic">births,</hi> and of <hi rend="italic">deaths.</hi></p>
                <p>The circumstances recorded in the register-book under the new law are, in case of
                    <hi rend="italic">birth,</hi> the time and place; the name, if any; sex; name
                    and surname of father; name and maiden surname of mother; rank or profession of
                    father; signature, description, and residence of the informant; and the
                    baptismal name, if added after registration of birth. In case of <hi
                    rend="italic">death,</hi> the time and place; name and surname; sex; age; rank
                    or profession; <hi rend="italic">cause of death;</hi> signature, description,
                    and residence of the informant. Every entry must be signed by the informant and
                    by the registrar, who discharges this duty without any immediate expense to the
                    parties requiring registration, but is remunerated by a moderate fee on each
                    entry paid quarterly out of the poor’s rates. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >informant,</hi> in a case of <hi rend="italic">birth,</hi> must be one of the
                    parents, or the occupier of the house or tenement in whlch the child was born;
                    or, if it be a foundling, the overseer of the poor. In a case of <hi
                    rend="italic">death,</hi> it must be some person present at the death, or in
                    attendance during the last illness; or, in default of such person, the occupier;
                    or, in default of the occupier, an inmate of the house in which the death
                    occurred; or, if there be an inquest, the coroner. Persons so qualified <hi
                    rend="italic">must</hi> inform under pain of indictment, and sign the register
                    on being requested so to do; and without such signature no birth or death can be
                    duly registered, and the entry cannot be given in evidence.</p>
                <p>The new form for registration of marriages, applicable alike to all
                    Teligiousdenominations, records the place and time of marriage; names and
                    surnames of the parties; whether they are of full age or minors; their condition
                    (that is, whether bachelor or spinster, widower or widow); their rank or
                    profession; residence at the time of marriage; father’s name and surname; rank
                    or profession of father; by what rites and ceremonies, after what preliminary
                    forms (that is, whether license, banns, or certificate), and by whom solemnized;
                    and must also contain the signatures of the parties and of two witnesses.</p>
                <p>One of the most important circumstances not previously recorded, for which
                    provision is made in the new register, is the “cause of death,” to which a
                    column is assigned in the registers of death, and where it is exhibited in
                    juxtaposition with the period, locality, sex, age. and occupation, thus
                    affording valuable data of the highest importance to medical science. In order
                    to attain the utmost accuracy in the returns of the causes of death, a printed
                    circular has been sent by the registrar-general to all medical practitioners in
                    England and Wales, wherein it is recommended, under the hand of the President of
                    the Royal College of Physicians, the President of the Royal College of Surgeons,
                    and the Master of the Society of Apothecaries, “that every practising member of
                    any branch of the medical profession who may have been present at the death, or
                    in attendance during the last illness, of any person, shall, immediately after
                    such death, place in the hands of such other persons as were in attendance, of
                    the occupier of the house in which the death occurred, and of some inmate who
                    may probably be required to give information, <hi rend="italic">written
                    statements of the cause of death,</hi> which such persons may show to the
                    registrar, and give as their information on that subject.”</p>
                <p>The recent registration act is peculiarly distinguished from other previous
                    measures on that subject, by the provision of a central office in London, called
                    the General Register Office, for the deposit of certified copies of all
                    registers, and general superintendence over everything relat<pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:wu.89119129625&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=111" xml:id="kp-eb0719-0111-0101"
                    />ing to registration. It is presided over by an officer named the
                    Registrar-General, appointed under the great seal, under whom in the office is
                    an assistant registrar, a chief clerk, three first clerks, and forty-three
                    others, who are appointed by the Lords of the Treasury, or by the
                    Registrar-General with their approval. Instructions emanate from this office to
                    all the local officers charged with the various duties of registration under
                    this act, namely, superintendent registrars, with their deputies; registrars of
                    births and deaths, with their deputies; and registrars of marriages; all of whom
                    act within their respective districts under the directions of the
                    Registrar-General, in whom is vested the power of dismissal.</p>
                <p>• The duties of the Registrar-General are to make regulations, subject to the
                    approval of the Secretary of State, for the management of the General Register
                    Office, and for the duties of all registrars and superintendent registrars; to
                    appoint superintendent registrars for temporary districts; to examine and
                    sanction the formation of registrars’ districts, submitted by the various boards
                    of poor-law guardians for his approval; to examine and sanction, if approved,
                    the plans for local register offices, to be provided by the poor-law guardians,
                    and submitted by them for his approval; to furnish the various books, forms,
                    &amp;c. requisite for registration, to the various parties requiring them; to
                    register certified places of worship for solemnization of marriage; to decide,
                    in cases of doubt, upon all caveats referred to him by the superintendent
                    registrars, and to adjudicate on an appeal from the superintendent registrar’s
                    decision on a caveat; to hear and settle all matters of doubt, dispute, and
                    complaint, respecting the business of registration, and the duties and conduct
                    of the various officers employed therein; to annex extraparochial places to
                    registrars’ districts; to unite two or more superintendent registrars’
                    districts, or to divide one superintendent registrar’s district into two, with
                    the approval of the Secretary of State; to appoint registrars or superintendent
                    registrars if the guardians neglect to do so; and to send once in every year a
                    report and abstract of all registered births, deaths, and marriages, for the
                    preceding year, to the Secretary of State, to be laid before parliament.</p>
                <p>The superintendent registrar is a local officer created by the registration and
                    marriage acts, acting solely within his ' district, which is either identical
                    with a poor-law union, or consists, as in a few instances, of two or more unions
                    formed into one district by the authority of the Registrar-General, or is a
                    temporary district consisting of several temporary registrars’ districts united
                    by the Registrar-General where there is no poor-law board of guardians. In the
                    latter case, the superintendent registrar is appointed by the Registrar-General.
                    Inthe former, he is either the clerk of the guardians, who, as such, is entitled
                    <hi rend="italic">ex officio</hi> to take the office, or he is some person whom,
                    the clerk not accepting, the guardians may have appointed, subject in either
                    case to such qualifications as the Registrar-General may by any general rule re
                    quire.</p>
                <p>The principal duty of the superintendent registrar is to receive quarterly, from
                    the registrars of births and deaths, and registrars of marriages, within his
                    district, the certified copies of births, deaths, and marriages registered by
                    them for the preceding quarter, and, having verified them by comparison with the
                    original entries in the register-books, to certify their correctness, and
                    transmit them to the Registrar-General; to receive also and transmit, but not
                    also to verify, certified copies of marriages registered by all clergymen of the
                    Established Church within his district, or by any registering officer of the
                    Quakers, or secretary of a Jewish synagogue, if there be any within or assigned
                    to his district. He has also the care of the register office of his district,
                    where are deposited all register-books within the district when filled; and he
                    is to make indexes of these, and permit searches, and give copies of entries in
                    the register-books on payment of certain fixed fees. He may appoint registrars
                    of marriage within his district; and, previous notice having been already given,
                    he may grant certificates for marriage, and, within his district, licenses for
                    marriage, provided such license be not for marriage to be solemnized according
                    to the forms of the Established Church.</p>
                <p>The registrar of births and deaths is a local officer acting within his district,
                    which has either been formed, with the∣ approval of the Registrar-General, by a
                    board of guardians <hi rend="superscript">1</hi> established under the poor-law
                    amendment act, or is a temporary district formed by the Poor-law Commissioners
                    where there is no such board established. In the former case, the registrar is
                    appointed by the board of guardians, in the latter by the Poor-law
                    Commissioners, subject, in both cases, to such qualifications as the
                    Registrar-General may by any general rule declare to be necessary.</p>
                <p>His duties, which are the same in both cases, are to register, in the books
                    provided for that purpose, every birth and death occurring within his district;
                    and four times in every year to make, on forms furnished for that purpose,
                    copies of all such entries of births and of deaths for the quarter immediately
                    preceding; to certify that such copies are correct, and to deliver them to the
                    superintendent registrar of his district, who, on comparing them with the
                    register-book, which the registrar must also produce, will certify their
                    correctness, and transmit them to the Registrar-General. He also delivers an
                    account of the number of entries so copied, which the superintendent registrar
                    verifies, and sanctions if correct, and which the registrar then presents, and
                    obtains payment of the fees due thereupon from the guardians or overseers of the
                    poor.</p>
                <p>The registrar of marriages is a local officer appointed by the superintendent
                    registrar, with the approval of the guardians, or, if there be no board of
                    guardians, of the Poor-law Commissioners, and acts solely within his district,
                    which is the same as that of the superintendent registrar by whom he was
                    appointed.</p>
                <p>His duty is to be present at marriages not according to the forms of the Church
                    of England, solemnized either in registered places of worship within his
                    district, or in the superintendent registrar’s office; to register the same in a
                    book provided for that purpose; and to deliver quarterly to the superintendent
                    registrar certified copies of such registered entries, in like manner as is done
                    by the registrar of births and deaths.</p>
                <p>Marriages according to the forms of the Established Church are registered, as
                    before, by the officiating clergyman, who delivers certified copies quarterly to
                    the superintendent registrar of his district, to be transmitted to the
                    Registrar-General. The marriages are also registered at the time <hi
                    rend="italic">in duplicate;</hi> and one of the books, when filled, is to be
                    deposited immediately in the superintendent registrar’s office.</p>
                <p>Marriages according to the ceremonies of the Quakers and of the Jews are
                    registered respectively in duplicate by the registering officer of the Quakers
                    and the secretary of the synagogue, and certified copies are given quarterly to
                    the superintendent registrar for transmission.</p>
                <p>The number of persons by whom the registration of births, deaths, and marriages
                    under the existing law is conducted (exclusive of the central establishment of
                    the General Register Office) is as follows :—</p>
                <p>There are 618 superintendent registrars, each of whom may appoint a deputy, with
                    the approval of the Registrar-General, to act for him in case of his illness or
                    absence. Of these, 562 have accepted the office as clerks of boards of
                    guardians, or have been appointed by the guardians; and fifty-six are temporary,
                    and have been appointed by the Registrar-General.</p>
                <p>There are 2193 registrars of births and deaths, each of whom may appoint a
                    deputy, with the approval of the guardians or of the Poor-law Commissioners. Of
                    these, 1926 <pb break="no" facs="ht:wu.89119129625&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=112"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0719-0112-0102"/>are appointed by the guardians established under
                    the poor-law amendment act, and 267 are registrars of temporary ' districts,
                    appointed by the Poor-law Commissioners.</p>
                <p>The number of registrars of marriages who had been appointed and held such office
                    on the 3lst of December 1838 was 817, of whom 419 are also registrars of births
                    and deaths. The foregoing, being in number 3209, act under the directions of the
                    Registrar-General, and are removeable by him.</p>
                <p>The number of other persons by whom registration of marriage is effected is as
                    follows:—hi, 11,694 officiating ministers of the Established Church, to whom
                    register-books have been furnished; 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>, ninety
                    registering officers of Quakers; 3rf, thirty-six secretaries of synagogues. All
                    these are in communication with the Registrar-General with respect to the duties
                    of registration.</p>
                <p>One of the most important features of the new measures is the provision that
                    certified copies shall be deposited quarterly in the General Register Office in
                    London, there to be arranged and indexed for facility of reference; a provision
                    by means of which henceforth a copy of an entry of any registered birth, death,
                    or marriage, in any part of England or Wales, may be obtained by application at
                    a single office, at the trifling cost of 3s. 6d., which includes the fee for
                    search.</p>
                <p>The certified copies thus transmitted from the clergy, registrars, registering
                    officers, and secretaries (amounting together to more than 15,000 persons), are
                    all made on separate leaves of durable paper, of an uniform size and peculiar
                    texture, having a distinguishing water-mark for the prevention of forgery, and
                    furnished by the Registrar-General to every one of the foregoing persons, on
                    whom the duty of registration devolves. They are sent by the superintendent
                    registrars by the general post, each class of return (i. <hi rend="italic"
                    >e.</hi> birth, death, and marriage) being sent separate, and in a cover
                    denoting by a mark the nature of the contents, and bearing the name of the
                    district to which it belongs. Thus, on their reception at the General Register
                    Office, the confusion which would Otherwuse ensue is avoided, by its being
                    rendered possible to classify the certified copies to a considerable extent even
                    before they are taken out of their covers.</p>
                <p>They are then arranged and examined <hi rend="italic">seriatim,</hi> and all
                    defects are noted; and letters on the subject of such defects as are of any
                    importance are addressed to the persons from whom the defective copies come, and
                    who are required to furnish either other copies, or such explanations as may
                    remove doubt. The copies are then paged, and inserted in books for
                    reference.</p>
                <p>Means of immediate reference to any one of the entries of births, deaths, and
                    marriages deposited in the General Register Office, which will amount yearly to
                    almost 1,000,000, are provided in the alphabetical indexes which are made there.
                    This vast work, far exceeding in magnitude anything of a similar kind ever
                    before attempted in this country, is performed in the following manner. The few
                    particulars requisite for the index are copied from each entry <hi rend="italic"
                    >seriatim,</hi> on forms prepared for that purpose, containing space for as many
                    entries as there are in one page of a certified copy. These, after having been
                    checked, are cut into separate slips, each containing the reference to one
                    entry; and the slips are then sorted and arranged alphabetically on files, from
                    whence they are then taken off one by one by the indexing clerks, and the
                    contents of each copied into the index. In this manner nearly a million of names
                    will be indexed alphabetically in the course of each year, the processes of
                    transcribing, sorting, and indexing being per» formed by between thirty and
                    forty persons. There is a separate index for each class of entries (births,
                    deaths, and marriages), and for each quarter, or twelve separate indexes for the
                    year. Any person, on payment of one shilling, may search these indexes, and, on
                    finding the name sought, may obtain, for two shillings and sixpence, a copy of
                    the entry of birth, death, or marriage referred to; which copy, being stamped
                    with the official seal, will be “received as evidence of the birth, death, or
                    marriage to which the same relates, without any further or other proof of such
                    entry.” Thus not only are means afforded of obtaining for legal purposes, by
                    application at one central office, certified copies of registers from every part
                    of England and Wales, but the copies so obtained have the additional advantage
                    of being sufficient evidence, without an affidavit, of their being correct,
                    which is often required for the confirmation of extracts given from church
                    registers.</p>
                <p>It is stated in the preface to the Population Abstract for 1831, as the result of
                    an inquiry respecting parochial registers in England, “that eight hundred and
                    twelve English parish registers commence in the year 1538, about forty of which
                    contain entries (copied probably from family bibles and tomb-stones), anterior
                    to the date of Cromwell’s injunction; 1822 parish registers commence from a. d.
                    1538 to 1558, when Queen Elizabeth required a protestation from the clergy; 2448
                    parish registers commence from a.d. 1558 to 1603, when the canons authorized by
                    King James directed a copy of all extant parish registers to be made and
                    preserved; and nearly one half of them (5082) have been preserved accordingly,
                    and are now extant. Parish registers to the number of 969 commence between that
                    time to the year 1650; 2757 from a. d. 1650 to 1700; 1476 parish registers from
                    a. d. 1700 to the year 1750; the rest (six or seven hundred) since that
                    time.”</p>
                <p>In addition to the registers heretofore and now kept under the sanction of
                    ordinances and acts of parliament, there is a vast number of non-parochial
                    registers and records of marriages, births and baptisms, deaths, or burials,
                    which have been kept in some instances from a very remote period by various
                    dissenting congregations, and in many cases with great care and correctness, but
                    in no form produced by authority, and under no legal sanction; and which were
                    therefore not admitted in evidence as registers in courts of justice.</p>
                <p>In September 1836, a commission was issued, which has been renewed in the present
                    reign, directing certain commissioners to inquire into the state, custody, and
                    authenticity of such registers or records; “and to inquire whether any or what
                    measures could be beneficially adopted for collecting and arranging all or any
                    of such registers or records, and for depositing the same, or copies thereof, in
                    the office of the registrar-general of births, deaths, and marriages, or for
                    otherwise preserving the same; and also to consider and advise the proper
                    measures to be adopted for giving full force and effect in evidence, in all
                    courts of justice, to all such registers as might be found accurate and
                    faithful, and for facilitating the production and reception of the same.” The
                    commissioners have reported the result of their labours, from which report it
                    appears, that about 7000 non-parochial registers have been transmitted to them
                    for inspection from 3630 religious congregations, namely,</p>
                <p>Foreign Protestant churches......................37</p>
                <p>Presbyterians, Independents, and Baptists...2264</p>

                <p>Swedenborgians.....................................21</p>
                <p>Total..................3430</p>
                <p>“Each of these registers,” says the Report, “was authenticated by a certificate
                    under the signature of the minister, or of some officer of the church or
                    denomination, from whom it was received; and this certificate was generally
                    accompanied by answers to the questions which had been circulated by the
                    commissioners.” After being “classed <pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:wu.89119129625&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=113" xml:id="kp-eb0719-0113-0103"
                    />in lists according to the several counties in England and Wales, and entered
                    in a book, with a careful annotation of any particulars applicable to their
                    state or custody,” they were “submitted to the inspection of the board, by whom
                    the question as to their admissibility was discussed and recorded; and in every
                    instance the chairman, or the commissioner representing the chairman,
                    authenticated such inspection and examination, by affixing his initials to the
                    first and last entry in each register; or if some parts of the register appeared
                    to be copies, or not to bear marks of authenticity, he affixed his initials to
                    such parts only as were deemed original or authentic.” With respect to all such
                    registers as have thus been examined and deemed authentic, wholly or in part,
                    the commissioners recommend, “that they be kept together in some secure place of
                    deposit, under the care of the Registrar-General, or of some other officer to be
                    appointed for that purpose, that, under certain conditions, they be receivable
                    in evidence in all courts of justice:” that the authorized custos of these
                    registers shall permit searches, and grant certified extracts, on payment of
                    moderate fees; and that on payment of a reasonable fee he shall produce any
                    original register deposited with him, on <hi rend="italic">Subpeena</hi> or
                    order of a competent tribunal: “that all criminal proceedings shall be by
                    production of the original: that in all other cases, copies or extracts,
                    certified by the officer having custody of the original, shall, after notice, be
                    receivable as evidence of the birth, baptism, marriage, death, or burial to
                    which it relates, subject to the following regulations: that in courts of law,
                    or at quarter-sessions, any party intending to use any certified extract from
                    any register before mentioned, in evidence, on the trial of any cause, or
                    hearing of any appeal, shall give notice in writing to the opposite party, his
                    attorney or agent, of his intention to use such certified extract as evidence at
                    such trial or hearing, and at the same time shall deliver to him a copy of the
                    extract, and of the certificate thereof, in order that there may be a full
                    opportunity to ascertain whether the authenticity, genuineness, or correctness
                    of the entry may be liable to objection; and in proof of such notice and
                    delivery, or on admission of the receipt of such notice and copy, such certified
                    extract shall be received in evidence at the trial or hearing, provided the
                    judge or court shall be of opinion that such service had been made a reasonable
                    time before such trial: that in case any party, instead of making proof by
                    certified extract, intends to produce any original register in evidence, he
                    shall nevertheless, within a reasonable time, give to the opposite party notice
                    of his intention, together with a copy of a certified extract of the entry which
                    he intends to offer in evidence.” The recommendations respecting the admission
                    of registers, or certified extracts, in courts of equity, and in ecclesiastical
                    courts, are: similar in character, containing only such variations as the
                    different practice of those courts requires.</p>
                <p>The registration of births, and deaths, and marriages in <hi rend="italic"
                    >France</hi> is conducted under the provisions of the: <hi rend="italic">Code
                    Civil</hi> of Napoleon. The <hi rend="italic">maire</hi> of each <hi
                    rend="italic">commune,</hi> of which there are about 37,300 in France, is the
                    registering officer charged with the duty of registering, in books provided for
                    the purpose, all births, deaths, and marriages, occurring within his commune.
                    Births and deaths are registered in duplicate, the former upon information, in
                    the presence of two witnesses, and are signed in duplicate by the informant, the
                    two witnesses, and the registering officer; in the case of deaths, one of the
                    witnesses may be also the informant. Marriages are registered in the presence of
                    four witnesses, and signed by the parties, the witnesses, and the registering
                    officer. The register of births records the year, day, hour, and place of birth;
                    the sex and name of the child; the names, surnames, professions, and residences
                    of parents, witnesses, and informant; the date of registration, and the name and
                    quality of the registering officer; and must be signed by him, by the witnesses,
                    and by the informant. When the child is illegitimate, the name of the father
                    cannot be given except by the authority of the father himself.</p>
                <p>The register of deaths records the year, day, hour, and place of death; the name,
                    surname, age, profession, and residence of the deceased person; the names,
                    surnames, ages, professions, and residences of the parents of the deceased, and
                    of the witnesses; and the name and surname of the husband or wife, if the
                    deceased was married; also the date of registration, and the name and quality of
                    the registering officer.</p>
                <p>The register of marriages records the names, surnames, ages, professions, places
                    of birth, and residences of the parties; the names, surnames, professions, and
                    residences of their respective parents, and of the four witnesses, with the
                    relation in which they stand to the parties; the consent of the parents; whether
                    the marriage has been opposed; time and place of solemnization and registration;
                    and the name and quality of the registering officer.</p>
                <p>Registration of births is secured by a provision, which requires, under pain of
                    fine and imprisonment, from the father of the child, or, in default of the
                    father, from some person present and assisting at the birth, a declaration
                    thereof, within three days afterwards, to the registering officer, to whom the
                    child must also be shown.</p>
                <p>The registration of deaths is secured by a provision rendering it penal for a
                    burial to take place without the registering officer having first seen the body
                    and registered the death.</p>
                <p>The registers are closed at the end of every year, with formalities which
                    preclude interpolation. Alphabetical indexes are annually formed in duplicate
                    for each. One of the duplicate registers, with its index, remains in the commune
                    to which it belongs; the other is transmitted to the tribunal of the district,
                    where it is examined and placed under the superintendence of the <hi
                    rend="italic">procureur du roi,</hi> or the local officer of the c∙ <hi
                    rend="superscript">,</hi> awn. Abstracts are made by the registering officer of
                    each commune, a copy of which is transmitted to the sub-prefevt, who from thence
                    frames an abstract for his arrondissement, a copy of which he sends to the
                    prefect; he also from the abstracts of the arrondissement makes an abstract for
                    his department; and copies of such abstracts are sent by the prefects of
                    departments to be deposited in a central office at Paris.</p>
                <p>The system of registration observed in France was introduced into Belgium,
                    Geneva, and the Rhenish provinces of Prussia when under the dominion of France,
                    and is still retained in those countries.</p>
                <p>In Austria, registers of births, deaths, and marriages are kept by each minister
                    of the church for his parish, and also by the Jewish rabbin for those of their
                    own persuasion.</p>
                <p>The register of births records the year, month, and day of birth; the number of
                    the house in which the birth occurred; the name of the child and its sex, and
                    whether it be born in wedlock or illegitimate; the names and surnames of the
                    parents; their religion; and the names, and surnames, and condition of the
                    sponsors. In the case of illegitimate children, the name of the father cannot be
                    entered unless he acknowledges the paternity.</p>
                <p>The register of deaths records the year, month, and day of death; the number of
                    the house in which it occurred; the name, religion, sex, and stated age of the
                    deceased; and, when the information of a physician or surgeon can be supplied,
                    the name of the fatal disease. For this purpose medical men are required to
                    inform the minister, in writing, of the cause of death of such patients as they
                    have attended.</p>
                <p>The register of marriages records the year, month, and day of the marriage; the
                    place of solemnization; the names and surnames of the parties; their religion,
                    age, and whether single or widowed; and the names, and surnames, and condition
                    of the witnesses.</p>

                <p>Bishops, on every visitation of their dioceses, are obliged to call for the
                    production of the registers of births, deaths, and marriages. The provincial
                    authorities are also required to ascertain whether these registers are kept in
                    all places as prescribed by law.</p>
                <p>Annual abstracts must be made by the ministers and the rabbin, of which copies
                    must be sent to the district of the conscriptions, and to the office of the
                    circle.</p>
                <p>In <hi rend="italic">Prussia,</hi> except the Rhenish provinces, registration is
                    committed to the clergyman of the parish amongst Christians, and to the elders
                    amongst Jews. The clergyman is bound to enter the births, marriages, and deaths,
                    of persons who are not of the established church, but who are “simply
                    tolerated,” on the declaration of the parties or their ministers, and to include
                    these declarations in his annual returns. Duplicates of the registers are to be
                    made, and at the end of each year deposited, when examined and verified, in the
                    local civil court, being “the tribunal of the place.”</p>
