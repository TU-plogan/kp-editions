                    Henry IV. of France, was a native of Angoulême, and, at the time of his
                    execution, about thirty-two years of age. Ravaillac was the son of parents who
                    lived upon alms. His father was one of those inferior retainers of the law to
                    whom the vulgar give the name of pettifoggers, and his son had been bred up in
                    the same line. The latter had set up a claim to an estate, but the cause went
                    against him; and this disappointment affected his mind deeply. He afterwards
                    taught a school, and, as he himself said, received charitable gifts, though but
                    of very small value, from the parents of those whom he taught. Yet his distress
                    was so great that he had much ado to live. When he was seized for the murder of
                    the king, he was very loosely guarded; and all were permitted to speak with him
                    who pleased. He was removed next day from the house of Espernon to the
                    Conciergerie, the proper prison of the parliament of Paris. When he was first
                    interrogated, he answered with great boldness, that he had done it, and would do
                    it if it were to be done again. When he was told that the king, though
                    dangerously wounded, was living, and might recover, he said that he had struck
                    him home, and that he was sure he was dead. In his subsequent examinations he
                    owned that he had long had an intention to kill the king, because he suffered
                    two religions in his kingdom; and that he endeavoured to obtain an audience of
                    him, in order to admonish him. He also said that he understood the king’s great
                    armament to be against the pope; and that in his opinion, to make war against
                    the pope was to make war against God. We have no distinct account of the last
                    three examinations; but he is said to have persisted in the most solemn
                    asseverations that he had no accomplices, and that nobody had persuaded him to
                    the fact. He appeared surprised at nothing so much as at the universal
                    abhorrence of the people, which, it seems, he did not expect. They were forced
                    to guard him strictly from his fellow-prisoners, who would otherwise have
                    murdered him. The butchers of Paris desired to have him put into their hands,
                    affirming that they would flay him alive, and that he should still live twelve
                    days. When he was put to the torture, he broke out into <pb break="no"

                    />horrid execrations, and always insisted that he did the fact from his own
                    motive, and that he could accuse nobody. On the day of his execution, after he
                    had made the <hi rend="italic">amende</hi> before the church of Nôtre Dame, he
                    was carried to the Grève; and, being placed upon a scaffold, was tied to a
                    wooden engine in the shape of a St Andrew’s cross. The knife with which he did
                    the murder being fastened in his right hand, it was first burned in a slow fire;
                    then the fleshy parts of his body were torn with red-hot pincers, and melted
                    lead, oil, pitch, and rosin poured into the wounds. The people refused to ray
                    for him; and when, according to the sentence that had cen pronounced upon him,
                    he came to be dragged to pieces by four horses, one of those that were brought
                    appearing to be but weak, a spectator offered his own, with which the criminal
                    was much moved. He was very earnest for absolution, which his confessor refused,
                    unless he would reveal his accomplices. “Give it me,” said he, “upon condition
                    that I have told the truth ;” which the priest eventually did. His body was so
                    robust that it resisted the force of the horses; and the executioner was at
                    length obliged to cut him into quarters, which the people dragged through the
                    streets. Such was the miserable fate of this fanatical assassin, who deprived
                    France of one of her best and greatest kings. He was believed by the populace to
                    have been set on by the Jesuits, although, whilst suffering the most horrible
                    torments, he declared that he had no accomplices, and had done the deed from
                    motives of his own.</p>
