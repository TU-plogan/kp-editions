                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra
                    space around the <gi>pb</gi> tag. Where a word is hyphenated at a <gi>pb</gi>,

                <p><label type="entry">REAUMUR</label> Rene Antoine Ferchaolt, Sieor de, a person
                    distinguished for his laborious researches in natural science, was born at
                    Rochelle in 1683, being descended of a family belonging to the law. After having
                    finished his early studies in the place of his birth, he began a course of
                    philosophy at Poitiers, and one of civil law at Bourges; but he soon
                    relinquished the latter to apply himself to mathematics, physics, and natural
                    history. Having come to Paris, he was received into the Academy of Sciences in
                    1708. From that hour he was wholly employed in natural history, to which his
                    inclination particularly led him; and his inquiries were not confined to any one
                    part of the subject. His memoirs, his observations, his discoveries on the
                    formation of shells, spiders, muscles, the marine flea, the berry which affords
                    the purple colour, and on the cause of the numbness of the torpedo, excited the
                    curiosity of the public, and early procured our author the character of an able,
                    curious, and entertaining naturalist. Filled with zeal for the welfare and
                    advantage of society, and for the progress and perfection of arts, he
                    endeavoured in all his researches to promote the public good. The public were
                    indebted to him for the discovery of the turquois mines in Languedoc. He also
                    foιmd out a substance, now used to give false stones a colour, which is obtained
                    from a certain fish called in the French <hi rend="italic">able</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">ablete</hi> on account of its whiteness, and which is the <hi
                    rend="italic">bleak</hi> or <hi rend="italic">blay</hi> of our writers. His
                    experiments on the art of turning iron into steel obtained him a pension of
                    twelve thousand livres; and this reward was to be continued to the Academy to
                    support the expense which might accrue in this art.</p>
                <p>He continued his inquiries on the art of making tin and porcelain, and
                    endeavoured to render our thermometers more useful than those of former times.
                    He composed a curious history of rivers where gold-dust is found in France; and
                    he gave so simple and so easy a detail of the art of gathering this dust, that
                    persons have been employed for that purpose. He also made curious and important
                    observations on the nature of flints; on the banks of fossil shells, whence is
                    obtained in Touraine an excellent manure for land; and likewise on birds and
                    their preservation, on their method of building nests, on insects, and a great
                    number <hi rend="italic">of</hi> other subjects, not less curious than
                    useful.</p>
                <p>He at first imagined that a certain varnish would keep eggs fresh; but the waste
                    of time and money showed him the inconvenience of such a process. He afterwards
                    adopted the method practised from time immemorial in Greece and the islands of
                    the Archipelago, which is to steep or im<pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:wu.89119129625&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=91" xml:id="kp-eb0719-0091-0081"
                    />merse eggs in oil or melted fat; by which means, not being exposed to the air
                    or to frost, they are well preserved, and contract no bad taste or smell.
                    Another experiment, still more important, made by our author, was to introduce
                    into France the art of hatching fowls and birds, as practised in Egypt, without
                    covering the eggs. Active, sedulous, and attentive, he was early in his study,
                    often at six in the morning. Exact in his experiments and observations, he let
                    no circumstance escape him. His writings must be of great use to future
                    philosophers. In society he was distinguished through life for his modest and
                    agreeable behaviour. His probity, benevolence, goodness of heart, and other
                    amiable qualities, as well natural as acquired, endeared him to his countrymen.
                    He died in the seventy-sixth year of his age, on the 18th of October 1757, and
                    left this world filled with sentiments of piety. His death was the consequence
                    of a fall, which happened at the castle of Bar-nardière on the Maine, where he
                    went to pass his vocation. He bequeathed to the Academy of Sciences his
                    manuscripts and all his natural productions. His works are, 1. A very great
                    number of memoirs, and observations on different parts of natural history,
                    printed in the collections of the Academy of Sciences; and, 2. A large work
                    printed separately in six vols. 4to, entitled a Natural History of Insects. This
                    important work contains a description of vast numbers of caterpillars, moths,
                    gall-insects, flies with two and four wings, lady-birds, and those ephemeron
                    flies which live only in that form a few hours; and, lastly, of those singular
                    and wonderful insects which are called <hi rend="italic">polypes,</hi> which
                    being cut into several pieces, each piece lives, grows, and becomes an insect,
                    and affords to our eyes a great number of prodigies. The works of M. de Reaumur
                    are exact, curious, interesting, and exceedingly ingenious. They are written
                    with much candour, clearness, and elegance; but it must be acknowledged that his
                    manner is somewhat too diffuse. We must not deceive the reader. He often raises
                    our expectations, and does not give us all the satisfaction which we promise
                    ourselves from his writings. His method of raising poultry, in particular,
                    rather disappoints us. He spared neither care, time, nor expense, to render it
                    practicable. He flattered himself and his countrymen with the greatest hopes;
                    but, notwithstanding his assiduous industry and vast charges, it proved
                    abortive. M. PAdvocat recommended him to ob tain from Egypt better information
                    on the subject, and if possible to procure a person versed in the art to
                    instruct him in it; but his death prevented the completion of the scheme. If any
                    native of Egypt had arrived, showed M. de Reaumur a better method than his own,
                    and practised it with success, as in his country, the community would have been
                    benefited; on the other hand, he would have seen, if it had tailed, that the
                    climate of France was not proper for such experiments. M. Maillet, consul at
                    Cairo, to whom the regent had written to obtain the art, offered to send over a
                    native of Egypt, if the government would pay the expense of his voyage, and
                    allow him a pension of 1500 livres. M. Mailletjudged rightly when he preferred
                    this method of proceeding. M. de Reaumur was not ignorant of the design, but he
                    flattered himself that his efforts would be successful without further aid, and
                    thought he should acquire some honour. He certainly had great talents, industry,
                    sagacity, and every other requisite which is necessary in such attempts; but it
                    is morally impossible that a single man, in a different climate, can attain such
                    knowledge in an art as those who live in a more favourable country, and have had
                    the experience of many ages to profit by. Yet, however unsuccessful M. de
                    Reaumur may have been, posterity is indebted to him for his repeated trials. He
                    has removed some difficulties in the road, and those who travel it may discover
                    what he only saw at a distance.</p>
