                    security, food, clothing, or pastime, have been amongst the occupations of men
                    in all ages, since the primeval <hi rend="italic">brueré</hi> overspread the

                <p>Before the more refined arts are introduced into any country, the chase is a
                    necessity, and the chief business of life. The stronger and more noxious animals
                    are destroyed for individual safety; the weaker for food. It is not until
                    civilization and her handmaid luxury have seated themselves, that the chase
                    becomes a pastime. It does not appear when the sportsman first sprang into
                    existence. There is no corresponding word in any ancient language, since that
                    could not be called a sport which was a necessity. It is probable that in the
                    earliest ages of society the dog was the sole agent employed by the hunter.
                    Afterwards various weapons, manual, missile, and projectile, as the club, the
                    dart, the arrow, were used by the hunter and fowler. Then would follow springes,
                    traps, nets, and all that class of devices for the capture of beasts and birds
                    <hi rend="italic">ferae naturae,</hi> comprehended in the term toils. As dogs
                    were employed to hunt quadrupeds, so, in process of time, hawks were trained to
                    bring down birds for the service of their master. The arbalest, or cross-bow,
                    preceded the matchlock, which, however, could scarcely be called an implement of
                    the chose, but which, in the order of succession, brings us down to the rifle,
                    and original fowling-piece with its long heavy barrel and flint and steel lock;
                    and, lastly, we arrive at the double barrels and detant locks of the modern
                    shooter.</p>
                <p>In the days of the Saxon and Norman kings, and long previously, the Britons were
                    famous for their skill in archery, both in war and in the chase. The feats of
                    the bow were often introduced into the songs of the bards of the ancient
                    Britons, and into the ballads of the Troubadours.</p>
                <p>Archery is now confined to shooting at the target. Ladies not unfrequently
                    contend for the prize in this elegant amusement. Their bows, however, are not
                    such as were used by the amazons of yore, nor are those of the gentlemen of the
                    archery clubs such as decided the battle of Cressy.</p>
                <p>Falconry, coeval with, and subsequent to the decline of archery, occupied that
                    rank in British field sports which is now enjoyed by shooting. Falconry is of
                    high antiquity; but at what time hawks were first trained to the sport does not
                    appear. Aristotle informs us that “there was a district in Thrace, in which the
                    boys used to assemble at a certain time of the year, for the sake of
                    bird-catching; that the spot was much frequented by hawks, which were wont to
                    appear on hearing themselves called, and would drive the little birds into the
                    bushes, where they were caught by children; and that the hawks would even
                    sometimes take the birds and fling them to these young fowlers, who, after
                    finishing their diversion, bestowed on their assistants part of their prey.”
                    Martial has the following epigram on the fate of a hawk:</p>
                <lg part="N">
                    <l part="N">Praedo fuit volucram, famulas nunc aucupis, idem</l>
                    <l part="N">Decipit, et captas non sibi, mcerit, aves.</l>
                </lg>
                <p>There is no record of trained hawks previous to the timeorEthelred. Under the
                    Welsh laws of Hoel Dha, <hi rend="smallcaps">(a.D.</hi></p>
                <p>940), “the falconer has a privilege, the day that the hawk shall bill a bittern,
                    or a heron, or a curlew. Three services shall the king perform for the falconer
                    on such a day; hold his stirrup whilst he dismounts; hold the horse whilst he
                    goes after the birds; and hold his stirrup whilst he mounts again. Three times
                    shall the king that night compliment him at table.” Shakspeare often uses the
                    language of falconry. It is chiefly employed in a scene in the second part of
                    Henry VI., wherein the king, queen, lord protector, and cardinal, are the chief
                    speakers; which goes to prove, that the falconer’s terms were, at one time,
                    household words at the English court.</p>
                <p>Hunting and archery, which were then almost synonimous terms, (for the sport was
                    somewhat similar to what deer-stalking now is, the rifle being substituted for
                    the how,) were in high repute with the Danish, Saxon, and Norman kings, whence
                    arose the forest laws. Wolves and boars, which formerly infested the forests,
                    were nearly exterminated in king Edgar’s time, when that monarch prohibited the
                    killing of deer and game in his woods. The punishment depended upon the will of
                    the king, until the celebrated forest laws of Canute, which defined the rights
                    and privileges of the monarch and others; but those laws were little regarded by
                    succeeding kings, whose arbitrary will afterwards regulated the laws of the
                    forest. “Besides other prerogatives of the Saxon kings,” says Selden, “they had
                    a franchise for wild beasts for the chase, which we commonly call forest, being
                    a precinct of ground, neither parcel of the county, nor the diocese, nor the
                    kingdom, but rather appendant thereto.” And these prerogatives, he quaintly
                    observes, were maintained, “that the world might see the happiness of England,
                    where beasts enjoy their liberty as well as men.” Another old writer says, that
                    “the Saxon kings and the Danish king Canute made no new forests, but were
                    contented with the woods that were their own demesnes, and were never granted
                    to, or possessed by the subject; but the kings of the Norman race, not being
                    satisfied with sixty-eight old demesne woods or forests, depopulated well-built
                    towns and villages, to make to themselves places appropriated to their own
                    diversion only. William the Conqueror laid waste thirty-six towns in Hampshire
                    to make a forest, which still retains the name of the New Forest; and his forest
                    officers exercised such arbitrary rule, as to abridge even the great barons of
                    the privileges they enjoyed under the Saxon and Danish kings, not at all
                    regarding the liberties given to the subject by Canute’s forest laws. His son
                    William Rufus is recorded in history for the severity of his proceedings against
                    all that hunted in his forests, inflicting the punishment of death upon such as
                    killed a stag or buck in his forests, without any other law than that of his own
                    will.” The killing of deer was punished with loss of sight by William the
                    Conqueror.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>John
                    Selden.</p></note><hi rend="superscript"> l</hi> William Rufus “did so severely
                    forbid hunting a deer, that it was felony and a hanging matter to have taken a

                    of Malmsbury.</p></note> In Coeur de Lion’s time, the law was very severe
                    against offenders taking the king’s venison; it was even unlawful to carry a
                    bow, or take dogs through a royal forest. “Qui arcus vel sagittas portaverint
                    vel canes duxerint sine copulâ per forestam Regis, et inde attaintus fuerit,
                    erit in miserecordiâ Regis.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                <p>The forest laws professed to be for the protection of “vert and venison.” <hi

                    >venison</hi> ' signified such beasts of the forest or the chase as were the
                    food of man. When reading old books, it is necessary to keep in mind this
                    acceptation of the word venison.</p>
                <p>This state of things continued until by the Charta de Foresta the forest laws
                    were better defined and the penalties mitigated. The vast importance attached to
                    the Forest Charter may be inferred from the fact, that although granted by king
                    John at Runnymede, at the same time as the Great Charter, it was not
                    incorporated in it, but was made the subject of a separate and distinct
                    document. The Forest Charter was likewise confirmed by Henry III.,
                    contemporaneously with the Great Charter. On the latter occasion the Forest
                    Charter was counter-signed by sixty-four bishops, abbots, and barons; and
                    sentence of excommunication against all persons who should violate it was, with
                    great ceremony, denounced in Westminster Hall, by the archbishop, in the
                    presence of the king, bishops, and nobles, the bishops being robed and bearing
                    torches.</p>

                <p>After the Forest Charter was granted any one was allowed to kill game, except in

                    forty shillings per annum became necessary to entitle a person to keep “any
                    greyhound, hound, dog, ferret, net, or engine, to destroy deer, hares, conies,
                    or any other gentleman’s game.” The qualification required was increased with
                    the improved value of land, from time to time, until, in Charles the Second’s
                    reign, it was enacted, that persons not having L.100 per annum arising from
                    freehold, or L.150 from leasehold property, or not being of the degree of
                    esquire, or otherwise privileged, should not keep or use “any guns, bows,

                    hare-pipes, guns, snares, or other engines for taking or killing game.”</p>
                <p>It was not until the early part of the reign of Geor III. that killing game was
                    taxed as a luxury, and made a source of revenue to government· A tax of two
                    guineas was first imposed on all persons who should go out in pursuit of game;
                    but the price of the certificate was afterwards raised to three guineas, and
                    subsequently to three and a half guineas. The property qualification is
                    abolished, and now any person who has taken out a certificate and obtained
                    permission from the owner or tenant of the land, in which soever the right at
                    the time may happen to be, is privileged to kill game at all seasonable times.
                    During a long period the sale of game was prohibited, which gave a peculiar
                    value to it, as it was not attainable by any but qualified and certificated
                    persons and their friends, except by indirect means. It is now publicly sold by
                    persons taking out licences for the purpose, and such licenced persons are
                    liable to penalties, and are incapacitated from renewing their licences, should
                    they purchase game from any but duly certificated sportsmen. The licenced
                    dealers are, however, largely supplied by poachers, notwithstanding the
                    penalties to which they subject themselves by trading with uncertificated
                    persons.</p>
                <p>Falconry fell into dissuetude in the days of the Georges. It is now scarcely
                    known but by name, although the honorary distinction of hereditary Grand
                    Falconer of England is still extant. As falconry fell into disuse, another kind
                    of sport, which is now considered as disreputable, and practised only by
                    poachers, was pursued by the country gentlemen; the capturing of birds of the
                    game species by means of nets and setting dogs. The dogs were trained to lie
                    down when near to game, and to suffer the net to be drawn over them, so that
                    both dog and birds were entangled in the toil. In this manner partridges are
                    still frequently taken by poachers in the night. A poacher’s dog is sometimes
                    known by his habit of crouching when close upon game, and this circumstance not
                    unfrequently leads to a detection of the practices of his master. Netting was
                    considered as a fair mode of taking game until the fowling-piece came into
                    general use.</p>
                <p>On the accession of the house of Hanover to the throne of Great Britain,
                    falconry, netting, and shooting, were contemporary amusements. The number of
                    shooters was very limited, the inferiority of the guns and ammunition being such
                    as not to induce their general adoption; hawking was going out of favour; and,
                    of the three sports, netting was the most commonly practised, until the
                    beginning of the reign of George III., after which time it was no longer deemed
                    the sport of gentlemen. At what time the fowling-piece first came into use is
                    uncertain. We learn from Pope that pheasant shooting was in vogue in Windsor
                    forest during the reign of Anne.</p>
                <p>Shooting, as practised with guns to which flint and steel locks were attached,
                    may be said to have risen and fallen with the Georgian era. During the latter
                    part of that period, great improvements were made in all the implements and
                    materials of shooting. Double barrels came into use, horse-nail stubs were
                    employed in the manufacture of<pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:chi.28490924&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=364" xml:id="kp-eb0720-0364-0302"/>
                    barrels, the patent breech and percussion-cap were invented, and the
                    wire-cartridge has since been introduced. Not the least improvement has been
                    that in the manufacture of gunpowder. The excellence of our guns and dogs has
                    tended much to spread the love of shooting, which has become the most popular
                    and universal of British field sports.</p>
                <p>It has been remarked, that England (Great Britain) is peculiarly the land of
                    sportsmen, the very name being unknown in all other countries. The observation
                    is in a great measure true, for, if we look around the globe, we find that
                    wherever wild animals are killed for the sake of sport, it is mostly by the
                    Englishman. In Sweden the Englishman alone kills the bear for sport. The natives
                    kill it for the sake of reward, or to rid themselves of a noxious neighbour.
                    Their method is generally thus: The strength of the country is summoned <hi
                    rend="italic">en masse,</hi> and several hundreds of people armed, form a circle
                    many miles in circumference, and march forward until they meet in the centre, by
                    which means great numbers of bears, wolves, and lynxes are destroyed. But this
                    is not done for sport; it is a compulsory matter, and the people engaged in it
                    are paid by the <hi rend="italic">government</hi>; it is a species of feudal
                    duty, which the ablebodied are called upon to perform whenever public safety
                    requires it. In Asia, the only sportsman that encounters the royal tiger is the
                    Englishman; the native shekerrie shoots the tiger for profit. There also the
                    buffalo and the boar are hunted by the Englishman alone. In Africa, it is the
                    Englishman who hunts the lion, the hippopotamus, and the giraffe. And in
                    America, it is the Englishman, or English settler, who hunts the panther, the
                    bison, and the bear, for sport; the natives do so from necessity. Since, then,
                    the Englishman is the universal sportsman, it behoves the officer, the emigrant,
                    and the tourist, to make themselves acquainted not only with what may be called
                    the first principles of sporting, but more especially with the sports peculiar
                    to the countries to which they are proceeding, a theoretical knowledge of which
                    may be gleaned from the volumes which annually proceed from the pens of our
                    adventurous countrymen.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">The Rifle.</hi> The only fire-arms used by the sportsman are
                    the rifle, the musket, and the fowling-piece; the latter may be classified into
                    the swivel-gun, which is fired from a rest, and the shoulder-gun. A short,
                    wide-bored musket, charged with a round or oval iron ball, was formerly used for
                    the destruction of such animals as the lion, tiger, or bear. In modern times,
                    the musket has been superseded by the rifle, and the iron ball by a leaden one,
                    hardened with tin and weighted with quicksilver. A short piece is said to be
                    pre-lerred to a long one for shooting tigers, bears, and the like, as it may be
                    more readily loaded, and is more easily managed in cases of emergency; indeed we
                    apprehend the shooter should seldom fire, except when the animal is so near to
                    him that if he aim coolly, he can scarcely fail to lodge a ball. We subjoin the
                    method of taking aim at wild beasts from practical sporting writers. Captain
                    Williamson gives the following instructions for shooting tigers:<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Oriental Field Sports by
                    Captain Thomas Willamson. London, 1805.</p></note> “If the motion of an animal
                    through the grass be perceived, the nearest elephant should be halted; and its
                    left shoulder being pointed towards the moving object, is the most favourable
                    position for taking a good aim. The hunter should fire without hesitation,
                    observing to proportion his level as far within the space between himself and
                    the tops of the yielding grass as the height of the cover may dictate; by this
                    precaution, equally necessary when shooting fish that are in any degree beneath
                    the surface of the water, the iron ball will, in general, take effect.” Mr.
                    Lloyd says,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Field Sports
                    of the North of Europe, by L. Lloyd. Esq. London, 1828.</p></note> “If a man
                    purposes attacking a bear at close quarters, a double gun is decidedly the best;
                    if it be in the winter season, a detonator is very preferable. Owing to having
                    flint locks, both my barrels, on one occasion, missed fire, which might have
                    been attended with most serious consequences; a large ball is very desirable.
                    The best points to hit a bear, or any other animal, are in the forehead, in the
                    breast, under the ear, or at the back of the shoulder; bullets placed in other
                    parts of the body of an old bear usually have little immediate effect. If the
                    snow be deep, and the bear is crossing a man, he should always aim very low; he
                    must often, indeed, fire into the snow, if he expects to hit the heart of the
                    beast.”</p>
                <p>In 1826 it was found necessary to destroy an elephant in Exeter ’Change. A
                    detachment of foot guards were called in, and directed by surgeons where to
                    fire; and 152 bullets were fired before it was disabled. This proves how utterly
                    ineffectual the leaden musket ball would be in the forest. Captain Harris, in
                    his South African tour, in 1837, took with him a double-barrelled rifle,
                    carrying balls two ounces weight, and thus armed, no beast could stand before
                    him. Speaking of the forehead of the elephant, he says,<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Wild Spurts of Southern Africa, by Captain
                    william Cornwallis. Harris. London. 1839.</p></note><hi rend="italic">“A</hi>
                    ball hardened with tin or quicksilver readily penetrates to the brain, and
                    proves instantaneously fatal.” He gives instances of his killing large elephants
                    at a single shot, and seems to have had no difficulty with the “king of beasts,”
                    which he has slain “in every stage from whelphood to imbecility.” According to
                    Captain Harris, travelling through countries infested by wild beasts is not so
                    dangerous as it is commonly thought to be. He says, indeed, that during part of
                    his journey, “scarcely a day passed without our seeing two or three lions, but,
                    like the rest of the animal creation, they uniformly retreated when disturbed by
                    the approach of man. However troublesome we found the intrusions of the feline
                    race during the night, they seldom, at any other time, shewed the least
                    disposition to molest us, unless we commenced hostilities.” He, however, does
                    justice to the terrors of the maned monarch when he says, “those who have seen
                    the monarch of the forest in crippling captivity only, immured in a cage barely
                    double his own length, with his sinews relaxed by confinement, have seen but the
                    shadow of that animal which ‘ clears the desert with his rolling eye.’”</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Fallow-Deer Shooting.</hi> There are only three kinds of
                    deer in Great Britain; the red, the fallow, and the roe. The fallow deer, which
                    was the dun deer of the days of Robin Hood, is the common deer of the parks. The
                    positions of a stag at rest when tired at may be reduced to three, for each of
                    which a different aim should be adopted. First, when presenting his side to the
                    shooter, the aim should be low behind the shoulder. Secondly, when standing
                    obliquely from the shoot-cr, the aim should be just under the ear, which is a
                    vital part; there is too the chance, when this aim is selected, of reaching the
                    brain through the upper or back part of the cheek, or of striking the animal in
                    some other part of the neck, which will generally bring him down or so disable
                    him that he will be readily recovered. It may be observed here, that the
                    quickest mode of dispatching a dog, horse, or any other domestic animal is to
                    shoot them through the neck, just under the ear. Thirdly, when standing or
                    moving directly from the shooter, the aim should be at the back of the head;
                    thus a chance is secured, should the part aimed at not be struck, of lodging a
                    ball in the neck or spine. When a deer is approaching the shooter, or standing
                    with its head towards him, he should wait until he can have a cross, an oblique,
                    or a driving shot. When a deer is wounded, however slightly, one or more dogs
                    should be instantly slipped. The dogs for this purpose should, as far as
                    practicable, com<pb break="no" facs="ht:chi.28490924&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=365"

                    the greyhound. A kind of wiry-haired greyhound is used for this purpose in the
                    Highlands.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Deer Stalking.</hi> The red deer, which is larger, and the
                    roe-buck, which is smaller than the fallow deer, are found chiefly in the
                    uncultivated mountainous districts of the North. To destroy the deer of an
                    adversary was once a mode of annoyance. Chevy Chase, it would seem, from the
                    three first stanzas of the famous ballad of that name, was an expedition of this

                <p>The pursuit of deer with the rifle is termed deer-stalking. To kill the
                    semi-domesticated fallow deer requires little skill beyond that possessed by a
                    good marksman. The skill of the deer-stalker, in pursuit of the red deer, is not
                    only dependant on a good use of the rifle, but is shewn in his ability to find
                    and approach deer; to do which successfully requires the most unwearied
                    perseverance. Many of the Scottish forests wherein the stalking of deer in their
                    wild state is practised, are of immense extent, It is on such tracts of land as
                    the forests of Mar and A thole that the red deer is sought. The forest of Athole
                    alone is said to be more than forty miles long, and in one part eighteen broad,
                    of which about 30,000 imperial acres are devoted to grouse, 50,000 partly
                    togrouse and partly to deer, and there are reserved solely for deer-stalking
                    52,000 imperial acres. In these vast solitudes, the Highlander stalks the
                    antlered monarchs of the herd, harts which, a century ago, bore the scars of the
                    weapons of his ancestors. An old Celtic rhyme which has been thus Englished,
                    shews the great age to which the deer and the eagle are supposed to arrive.</p>
                <lg part="N">
                    <l part="N">Thrice the age of a dog is that of a horse;</l>

                    <l part="N">Thrice the age of a deer is that of an eagle.</l>
                </lg>
                <p>So far as regards the age of the eagle, these lines contain an assertion which
                    can neither be proved nor negatived. It is different as regards deer. There has
                    long existed a custom of marking fauns that have been caught, and as each
                    forester has a distinct mark known us his own, the age of a marked deer can
                    generally be nearly ascertained.</p>
                <p>The deer-stalker has recourse to a thousand manoeuvres to approach a herd or
                    solitary stag. The animals are usually descried at a long distance, either by
                    the naked eye, or by the aid of an achromatic telescope, and the mode of
                    approaching them entirely depends upon the situation in which they are
                    discovered. Should it seem impracticable to steal upon them while at rest, the
                    stalkers, armed with rifles, wait in the defiles through which the deer are
                    expected to pass, whilst the attendants make a circuitous movement to get beyond
                    the deer and drive them in the direction required. The deer-stalker, besides
                    being an excellent shot, should have good judgment of ground and a hardy frame,
                    combined with the patience and power to undergo extreme fatigue and
                    privation.</p>
                <p>When the red deer is fired at, he is usually at a conside rable distance, and
                    perhaps bounding away at full speed. Behind the shoulder, therefore, is the
                    favourite mark. “In killing deer,”<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    directly behind the shoulder. A bodywound may eventually destroy the animal, but
                    the chances are that he will carry off the ball.” Mr. Scrope,<note

                    by William Scrope, Esq., F.L.S. London, 1839.</p></note> whose experience and
                    success in deer-stalking render his remarks valuable, says, “the most perfect
                    shots and celebrated sportsmen never succeed in killing deer without practice;
                    indeed, at first, they are quite sure to miss the fairest running shots. This
                    arises, I think, from their firing at distances to which they have been wholly
                    unaccustomed, and is no reflection upon their skill. It is seldom that you fire
                    at a less distance than a hundred yards, and this is as near as you would wish
                    to get. The usual range will be between this and two hundred yards, beyond
                    which, as a general rule, I never think it prudent to fire, lest I should hit
                    the wrong animal, though deer may be killed at a much greater distance. Now the
                    sportsman who has been accustomed to shot guns, is apt to fire with the same
                    sort of aim that he takes at a grouse or any other common game; thus he
                    invariably fires behind the quarry; for he does not consider that the ball,
                    having three, four, or perhaps five times the distance to travel that his shot
                    has, will not arrive at its destination nearly so soon; consequently, in a cross
                    shot, he must keep his rifle more in advance. The exact degree, as he well
                    knows, will depend upon the pace and remoteness of the object. Deer go much
                    faster than they appear to do, and their pace is not uniform, like the flying of
                    a bird; but they pitch in running, and this pitch must be calculated upon.”</p>
                <p>The interest and anxiety attending this sport must be as intense as the pursuit
                    is laborious. After climbing for hours the mountain side, with the torrent
                    thundering down the granite crags above him, and tremendous chasms yawning
                    beneath him, the stalker, with his glass, at length descries in some remote
                    valley, a herd too distant for the naked eye. He now descends into the
                    tremendous glen beneath, fords the stream, wades the morass, and by a circuitous
                    route threads the most intricate ravines to avoid giving the deer the wind.
                    Having arrived near the brow of the hill, on the other side of which he believes
                    them to be, he approaches on hands and knees, or rather vermicularly, and his
                    attendant, with a spare rifle, does the same. A moment of breathless suspense
                    ensues. He may be within shot of the herd, or they may be many miles distant,
                    for he has not had a glimpse of them since he first discovered them an hour ago.
                    A moment, and the antlers appear; another, and the herd is in sight. Resting his
                    rifle on the heather, he takes a cool shot at the finest hart, which falls; the
                    rest bound away; a shot from the spare rifle follows, the “smack” of the ball is
                    heard, and the glass tells that another noble hart must die. The dogs, which had
                    been kept far back, are slipped, and are out of sight in a moment. The sportsman
                    follows; he again climbs a considerable way up the heights; he applies the
                    telescope, but nothing of life can he behold, except his few followers on the
                    knolls around him. With his ear to the ground he listens, and amidst the roar of
                    innumerable torrents, faintly hears the dogs baying the quarry, but sees them
                    not; he moves on from hill to hill towards the sound, and eventually another
                    shot makes the hart his own. The deer is then gralloched, and partially covered
                    with peat; the horns are left upright, and a handkerchief is tied to them to
                    mark the spot, that the attendants may find it at the close of the day. Let the
                    reader imagine how much the interest of all this is enhanced by the majestic
                    scenery of an immense, trackless, trceless forest, to which domesticated life is
                    a stranger, where mountain, corrie, cairn,<pb break="no"

                    and glen, thrown promiscuously together, present the grandest of savage
                    landscapes, which, as the field of wild adventure, cast into shade what Mr.
                    Scrope calls “the tame and hedge-bound country of the south.”</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Τηε Fowling-piece.</hi> Before making choice of a gun, the
                    shooter should determine what weight he can conveniently carry. The heaviest
                    gun, as regards shooting, will be most effective, but he should recollect that
                    unless he be a very robust person, a light gun will, on the whole, bring him
                    more game, as a few additional pounds in the weight of a gun makes a deal of
                    difference in the distance a person can travel in a day. and, moreover, he
                    cannot shoot as well when fatigued.</p>
                <p>The most approved guns under the system which prescribes a heavy charge of
                    powder, and a light one of very small shot, are double barrels, weighing,
                    according to the fancy of the shooter, from six to nine pounds, and bearing the
                    following relative proportions of length to guage: fourteen guage, thirty-four
                    inches long; seventeen guage, thirty-two inches long; twenty guage, thirty
                    inches long. Taking the season throughout, we are convinced, that the most
                    effective gun is a short, wide-bored one, each barrel being charged with rather
                    less than 1 ½ drams avoirdupois weight of powder, and full 2 oz. of No. 2 shot,
                    containing 220 pellets. This is the general charge, but it may be varied
                    according to circumstances. When game is wild, we would charge the reserve
                    barrel, and, on some occasions, both barrels, with 2 <hi rend="superscript">
                    1</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> drams of powder, and a No. 5 blue
                    cartridge for partridges, and with a No. 4 or 5 red cartridge for grouse
                    shooting. No. 7 shot is best for snipe shooting. Small shot may be used for
                    partridge sh∞ting in September, though we do not see any reason for not adhering
                    to No. 2, except that birds very near the gun are liable to be more disfigured
                    by it.</p>
                <p>Barrels twenty-six or twenty-eight inches long, and fourteen or sixteen guage,
                    are of convenient size. We think it will not be questioned that these barrels
                    are as efficient as long narrow-bored ones for short distances, viz. under
                    thirty-five yards, and nine-tenths of game brought to the bag is killed within
                    that distance. And for making long shots, the wire-cartridge has obviated the
                    necessity of using long guns. A most material advantage attending the use of a
                    short gun is, the comparative ease with which it may be carried. A pound
                    additional weight at the breech is not so fatiguing to the arm as half that
                    weight added to the end of the barrel; it is the top-heavy gun that distresses
                    the shooter.</p>
                <p>Different proportions of powder and shot are required for different sizes of
                    shot. The following may be the proper proportions for a gun not exceeding eight
                    pounds:</p>

                <p>These proportions cannot be materially deviated from without destroying the
                    effect. If the powder is decreased, the discharge is weakened; if the powder is
                    increased, the shot spreads; if the weight of shot is decreased, there will not
                    be a sufficient number of pellets for effective shooting; if the weight of shot
                    is increased, the discharge is weakened.</p>
                <p>The usual objection to large shot is, that after it has travelled thirty yards it
                    becomes dispersed; but let the powder be reduced to less than 1½ dram, and that
                    objection fails. If it is not overcharged with powder, a gun will shoot No. 2
                    shot close enough to kill at from thirty-five to fifty yards, with more
                    certainty than if charged with small shot, and two or three drams of powder.</p>
                <p>It is not so much the velocity as the momentum of a shot that renders it
                    effective. The momentum of a shot increases in a direct ratio with its weight.
                    The momentum of a No. 2 shot much more than compensates for the diminished
                    weight of powder and additional weight of lead that we have recommended. Large
                    shot droops more than small, and sooner comes to the ground, as it is not
                    carried with the same velocity. It is the momentum, and not the velocity, that
                    the shooter must look to.</p>
                <p>We do not suppose that feathers or fur of game present any serious obstacle to
                    either large or small shot; but if they did, the fact that large shot is most
                    effective for shooting wild fowl armed with down, at once tells that it must be
                    so for shooting game which is not so protected. Another advantage of large shot
                    is, that when the aim taken is not quite correct, a single outside pellet will
                    often bring down a bird, when it would require many small shots to do so.</p>
                <p>The shooting of barrels depends mainly on three things, viz., the metal of which
                    they are made, the boring, and the breeching. The quality of the metal is of
                    much importance. All barrels expand when fired; and those made of inferiormetal
                    expand more than those made of stub-twist. Mr. Greener, in his excellent
                    treatise on the “Gun,”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>The Gun, by William Greener. London. 1835</p></note> says, “that a barrel is
                    a spring on an extended scale, and the more we can make it partake of the nature
                    of a spring, the better. If we must have expansion, let us have it in its most
                    beneficial form; an expansion that will aid the powder in expelling the lead.
                    This cannot be entirely obtained, nor can the quantity of expansion be entirely
                    destroyed, though you were to make your barrels of the weight of a twenty-four
                    pounder. We must, therefore, decrease it, by making our iron as elastic and
                    tenacious as possible. The qualities of elasticity and tenacity can only be
                    obtained by hammer-hardening the iron. Barrels hammer-hardened will shoot as
                    well without any artificial friction, as those whose friction is extreme, yet
                    have not yet been benefited by the process.”</p>
                <p>The term friction implies a gradual contraction of the barrel towards the muzzle,
                    which retards the progress of th∣ shot, that more time may be allowed to the
                    powder to burn. “The shooting of all barrels,” says Mr. Greener, “depends on a
                    certain degree of friction. The degree of friction necessary varies according to
                    the nature and substance of the metal. Those metals that requiro least shoot
                    best. The object of the friction is to create a greater force, by detaining the
                    charge longer in the barrel. If, then, there should not be an extra quantity of
                    powder to consume, the friction would be a decided evil." A greater degree of
                    friction is generally allowed to a short barrel than to a long one. A gradual
                    expansion of the barrel towards the muzzle is termed relief. Relief accelerates
                    the progress of shot through the barrels. What is the proper degree of relief or
                    friction for different descriptions of barrels, is a subject fruitful of much
                    controversy; as is also the form of the breech. The best breech is that which
                    will cause the greatest quantity of powder to consume in the barrel.</p>
                <p>Mr. Greener would not prevent the barrel expanding when fired, by increasing its
                    thickness, but by improving the quality of the metal. When the barrel expands
                    much, or is held loosely when fired, a loss of strength is induced, as that
                    power which, if possible, should be exerted on the shot, is uselessly expended
                    in a contrary direction, whereas, when the barrel is firmly fixed, and made of
                    metal that only<pb break="no" facs="ht:chi.28490924&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=367"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0720-0367-0305"/> expands in a trifling degree, or, as Mr. Greener
                    observes, operates as a spring, that portion of the explosive force which
                    strikes in any direction, except against the shot, is forced back, or rebounds
                    upon the shot, and consequently becomes a portion of the available strength of
                    the charge. Much of the force that is thrown on a solid fixed surface is
                    returned, but not that which is expended on an yielding one.</p>
                <p>Mr. Greener shews that much loss of strength is induced by barrels not being
                    firmly held when fired; and argues that the mode of proving barrels by allowing
                    them to fly back into sand is defective, as, by reason of the projectiles giving
                    way in one direction and the barrels in the other at the same time, there is not
                    a sufficient strain on the barrels to prove them effectively. On this subject he
                    says, “Let any one take his gun and load it as usual; suspend it by two ropes so
                    as it can fly back; place a quire of brown paper as directly in front of it as
                    possible; fire it, by squeezing the trigger and the back side of the guard
                    together, so as not to displace the gun; examine the impression the shot has
                    made in the paper. If they have stuck in at the distance of forty yards, they
                    have done well. Load again, and fire from the shoulder, and you will find the
                    shots driven through a great number of the sheets. Load again, but first, take
                    the barrels from the stock, lest you should happen to break your stock, as I
                    have seen done by a gentleman placing his gun on a stone wall; while he rested,
                    the gun by accident went off and shivered the stock into many pieces, and
                    severely cut his hand by the splintering. (So severe is the recoil from a gun on
                    being fired, when resisted by a solid, unyielding substance. When fired from the
                    shoulder it is different, as the body yields to the recoil, and thus prevents
                    that which would inevitably be inflicted, if the shoulder were placed against a
                    solid substance.) Secure the barrels on a piece of wood, and behind place
                    anything firm; for instance, a piece of lead sufficiently heavy, and that will
                    not injure the end of the breeches, technically called the buts, when they
                    strike it. Having secured them perfectly, fire the barrel in any way you can,
                    and then examine the force of the shots in the paper, and if you do not find
                    that they have penetrated further than they did when fired from the shoulder,
                    say my doctrine is false. It follows, as a matter of course, from these
                    experiments, that in shooting, the more firmly a gun is held to the shoulder,
                    the better it will shoot.</p>
                <p>“It is upon these experiments that I found ray objections to the practice of
                    allowing best barrels, when proved, to. fly back into sand. Such a mode of proof
                    is of no use. Were they fixed like common barrels, the force of the proof would
                    be increased one-half. I doubt whether the present method be any test at all. I
                    am satisfied that the force exerted in this mode of proof on the barrel, is not
                    equal to the pressure of a large sporting charge, when fired from the
                    shoulder.</p>
                <p>“The fact that the shooting powers of a gun are increased by its being fixed in
                    an immoveable frame, is proved with the practice of mortars. Mortars op iron
                    beds, and these firmly embedded in the earth, will throw a shell farther when on
                    the ground, than when placed on a platform, or on board a ship. It is for the
                    purpose of destroying the recoil, that mortars for sea-service, though of the
                    same calibre as those intended for land-service, are made three times the
                    weight. Dr. Hutton states, that he found no advantage by retarding the recoil in
                    practice with artillery. He means, that no advantage is gained by stopping at
                    three feet a gun accustomed to recoil to the distance of six. The statement is
                    perfectly true. If he were to allow a gun to recoil only an inch, and then
                    strike against a solid substance, he would gain nothing. For if it recoil ever
                    so little, the shooting force is as much weakened as if it recoiled twice as
                    far.</p>
                <p>“To increase that force, a steady fixed resistance is required. The velocity of
                    the projectile depends on the force of the immediate impulse. Before a gun,
                    suffered to recoil, could rebound from striking some solid substance in its
                    recoil, the charge would be gone, and could, therefore, receive no additional
                    impetus from that rebound. The truth of this fact may be illustrated by throwing
                    a hand-ball against any loose body with sufficient force to displace it. However
                    hard or elastic that body might be, the ball would not rebound from it, but
                    would fall perpendicularly down. Fix and secure that same body, and then the
                    ball will rebound with little less force than that with which it was thrown
                    against it. So it is with gunpowder. If it meet with a firm resistance, it will
                    rebound and project the ball or shot with additional force.”</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">On Charging the Following-piece.</hi> It may be premised
                    that all powder, before being put into the barrel, is more or less damp; and
                    most barrels, especially if they have been only imperfectly cleaned, or have
                    been fired and laid by since being cleaned, are also more or. less liable to
                    damp. A portion, therefore, of powder should be flashed off in each barrel
                    immediately before charging, for the triple purpose of expelling damp, proving
                    whether the passage through the pivots on which the caps are to be placed, is
                    open, and warming the barrels, so that any little moisture in the charge of
                    powder may be absorbed. The barrels are then held perpendicularly and the powder
                    poured in, in such manner that the whole charge may reach the bottom; and a
                    wadding is then pressed down upon it. The shot is next poured in and another
                    wadding pressed upon it. The shooter next removes the remains of the caps, and
                    looks whether the powder has found its way to the orifice of the pivots, and if
                    it has, he places fresh caps on. If the powder is not visible at the orifice of
                    the pivots, he removes any obstacle with a pen-knife or pricker, and contrives
                    to push down a few grains of powder.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Wire</hi>- <hi rend="smallcaps">Cartridges.</hi> The
                    wire-cartridge (fig. 1.) was invented in 1828 by Mr. Jenour. It consists of a
                    cylindrical case or network of wire, the meshes of which are somewhat more than
                    an eighth of an inch square; at the lower end the wire partially, closes; the
                    wire case is then enveloped in fine paper, and at the upper end a cork wadding,
                    cut so as to fit the guage of the gun, is affixed; the case is then filled with
                    shot and bone dust. The first cartridges made, though,, ingenious in
                    construction, were defective in operation. It was a matter of no ordinary
                    difficulty to fabricate them in such a manner that the shot should leave the
                    case at the precise distance required. This at first, could not be done so that
                    they might be trusted in every instance. Every alternate cartridge might fire
                    well; but the rest would fire irregularly, being liable to ball; that is, the
                    shot would not leave the case until fifty or sixty yards from the gun, and such
                    cartridges were, of course, not only useless but dangerous. They have been from
                    time to time improved, and almost every difficulty has been overcome. The
                    sporting cartridges now made never ball; they act with a considerable degree of
                    precision and certainty; and that they may be safely trusted may be inferred
                    from the fact that they are often preferred by persons engaged in pigeon
                    matches. Various materials were used cx-perimentally to fill up the interstices
                    between the pellets, but nothing seems to answer so well as the material now
                    used. Another difficulty in their construction presented itself. It was
                    requisite to accommodate them to the various methods of boring pursued by
                    different gunmakers, and the unequal length of barrels, the object in view being
                    to produce a cartridge that would suit all barrels of the same guage; and this
                    has been, in a great measure, if not wholly, accomplished. The liability to ball

                    not effectually obviated for many years, during which they were tried, and in
                    many instances prematurely condemned, either from real defects, or from the
                    parties not knowing how to use them. They were not brought to perfection until
                    the year 1837.</p>
                <p>The wire-cartridges possess two principal advantages over loose shot; they are
                    propelled with greater velocity, and thrown more evenly. A loose charge is
                    always thrown in patches; the shots of a cartridge, as seen on a target, are
                    comparatively equidistant from each other. There are four classes of
                    wire-cartridges, which the patentees have named the <hi rend="italic"
                    >battue,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">blue,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">red,</hi>
                    and the <hi rend="italic">green;</hi> each intended for a different range. There
                    is some little difference in the construction of each of the three kinds; the
                    meshes of the frame-work are larger in the battue and the blue than in the red,
                    and in the red than in the green, and there are doubtless other differences not
                    perceptible to the uninitiated. The battue and the blue cartridges are intended
                    for general use; the battue for the shortest distance; the blues will kill
                    several yards further than loose shot of the same size, and of the four kinds,
                    are, in our opinion, decidedly to be preferred; each blue cartridge being thrown
                    more nearly alike, they are more certain in their operation than the red and the
                    green, which are intended for longer distances. The red may be serviceable in
                    open places, when game is wild, and the shooter is provided with a gun of not
                    less than fourteen guage, or with a very short barrel, which does not throw its
                    shot very strongly. The green cartridges are intended chiefly for wild-fowl
                    shooting; these should be used in barrels of not less than twelve guage. The red
                    and green cartridges retain the shot in the case longer than the others, and are
                    carried with an astonishing force to an incredible distance, and at the same
                    time very closely. The red may generally be trusted for long distances,
                    especially from barrels of large calibre; but at short distances the smallness
                    of the circle they describe renders them objectionable. The green cartridges
                    should never be used for shooting game. The blue and battue only should be used
                    in barrels of small guage.</p>
                <p>The wire-cartridges do not require either a greater or less charge of powder than
                    loose shot, but there is this peculiarity attending them. A heavy charge of
                    powder throws the shot from the cartridge more closely than a small charge, by
                    reason of its allowing more time for the escape of shot from the net-work. This
                    is exactly the reverse of the manner in which the loose charge acts. The greater
                    the charge of powder when loose shot and wadding are used, the more is the shot
                    dispersed, and <hi rend="italic">vice versa.</hi> Either loose shot or cartridge
                    shot is projected with greater force and velocity when a heavy charge of powder
                    is used. When birds lie well, we would recommend the shooter who adopts the
                    cartridge to charge lightly with powder, to give the shots time to spread well;
                    when moderately wild, we would charge lightly with powder in the first barrel,
                    and heavily in the reserve barrel; but when birds are very wild, both barrels
                    should be charged with as much powder as the shoulder can conveniently bear, so
                    as to give the charge the greatest possible force, and at the same time the
                    greatest practicable degree of closeness. It is at long distances that the
                    superiority of the cartridge is conspicuous; when the loose charge is used, the
                    increase of force that is obtained by loading heavily only tends to dispersing
                    the shot, thereby rendering the increased momentum of little avail.</p>
                <p>Amongst the advantages attending the adoption of wire-cartridges, it may be
                    mentioned, that the recoil is not so severe, and consequently a lighter gun may
                    be used, than with the loose charge, and this is a great relief to the shooter
                    in a heavy country, and especially on the hills in August, when the heat of the
                    sun is frequently overpowering. The cartridges act well when fired from short
                    barrels, perhaps more satisfactorily than when fired from long ones. The
                    increased facility and expedition of loading is another advantage which should
                    not be overlooked.</p>
                <p>The main objection to wire-cartridges, and it is a material one to a person who
                    is an indifferent marksman, is, that they do not describe a sufficient circle at
                    short distances. When game is wild they are invaluable for the reserve barrel of
                    a double gun.</p>
                <p>The wire-cartridges usually kept on sale contain, for the different guages, the
                    following weight of shot.</p>

                    they should only be used for wild-fowl shooting, for which sport they may answer
                    very well when fired from a reserve barrel. We would not recommend their
                    adoption, even for wild-fowl shooting, to a person using a common-sized single
                    gun, since by so doing he would hazard missing when the most favourable

                    necessary; if not discharged, it should be put back to the half cock, and the
                    left re-loaded.</p></note> * but should the birds rise at a considerable
                    distance, to save time he need only cock one barrel, as in this case, he has
                    only to fire once. He should never be in haste. It is more prudent to let the
                    bird escape than to fire hastily. If on open ground, he should not fire until
                    the bird is at least twenty-five paces distant, by which means he avoids, on the
                    one hand, the hazard of mangling it, and, on the other, a probability of
                    missing; for at the distance of from twenty-five to thirty yards, whether the
                    piece be charged with loose shot or the wire-cartridges, the range of the whole
                    charge will be wide, yet the pellets will be so close together that nothing can
                    escape, if the aim be true, and, what is of no less moment, the finger also
                    obedient to the eye. He should be deliberate in bringing up the piece to his
                    shoulder, and in making it to bear on the object, but the moment he has brought
                    it to bear, the finger should act in co-operation with the eye, the eye being
                    kept open the while, so that<pb break="no"

                    the shooter may see whether the bird falls, or feathers fly from it; for if he
                    does not, he may rely that there is something defective in his system of
                    managing the fowling-piece. A shooter only requires coolness, a very little
                    mechanical knowledge, and a gun properly mounted. Possessing these requisites,
                    he will not be deficient in any other which he will not be easily able to
                    supply. The novice should learn to shoot high enough at winged, and low enough
                    at footed game, and well forward at both. He should seldom shoot directly at the
                    object; but at the wing, if the bird is moving obliquely from him, the head, if
                    the bird is rising, the legs, if descending; but if crossing, or flying
                    obliquely at a considerable angle, he should make an allowance of a few inches
                    according to the distance of the object from him. It is not usual to shoot at
                    any object approaching the shooter. It should be allowed to pass, when he turns
                    round and fires at it as it moves from him.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">The Rook.</hi> We commence our notice of the different kinds of
                    shooting with the fowling-piece now chiefly practised, with a few observations
                    on those birds, not coming under the denomination of game, which occasionally
                    afford the first lessons to the younger brethren of the trigger, and which
                    therefore may properly take precedence, in description, of the more difficult
                    branches of the art.</p>
                <p>Young rooks, in the month of May, are generally shot whilst sitting on the
                    branches, near their nests, on the tops of the loftiest trees, so that it
                    requires a steady aim, and hard-stricken shot to bring them down with certainty;
                    for if only wounded, they will frequently cling to the bough with their claws,
                    and die suspended in that manner. The rook should be fired at with a small
                    charge of rather large shot, and a heavy charge of powder. Rooks are gregarious,
                    and feed on grain, worms, and insects. It is only during the season of
                    incubation, and until the young ones can fly, that they frequent the rookery,
                    which is mostly a small plantation, or clump of old trees, and near to some
                    habitation. When rooks choose any particular cluster of trees, or plantation to
                    build in, the same trees will, if standing, be tenanted again the next year by
                    the same rooks and their offspring, notwithstanding they may have been much
                    fired at, or in some other way disturbed. This opinion is not universal. In some
                    counties there exists a prejudice against the practice of firing at rooks with
                    gunpowder, especially when the rooks are few, and the number of trees limited,
                    lest the rooks should desert the rookery; and, therefore, that as little alarm
                    as possible may be created, they are fired at with balls from the air-gun, and
                    sometimes the young shooter will try his skill with the cross-bow. The old rook
                    is distinguished from the young one by the thick end of either mandible being
                    white; and the beak of the young rook is black to the insertion. They are
                    distinguished from other birds of a somewhat similar appearance, by a slight
                    variation of colour; the rook has a blue, the carrion-crow a brown tinge, the
                    jackdaw is partially grey, the raven is jet black.</p>
                <p>After young rooks have been fired at several times, some of the strongest and
                    best-fledged will quit the rookery, and alight on hedges or trees at some
                    distance, where the shooter flushes them, and they afford good sport to the tyro
                    learning to shoot birds on the wing. A warm sunny day is best for rook-shooting.
                    In cold weather, particularly on windy days, young rooks will not quit their
                    nests.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">The Wood-pigeon.</hi> The wood-pigeon is little regarded by the
                    sportsman. A shot may he obtained by lying in ambush early in the morning, near
                    to some wheat stubble, or field of newly-sown grain, where the birds feed; but
                    the best sport the wood-pigeon affords is at the roosting places, where the
                    shooter ought to take his station an hour before sunset. It is difficult to
                    obtain a shot in any other manner, except when the birds are young, when they
                    are sometimes killed in trees, in the same manner as young rooks.</p>
                <p>The shooter in pursuit of game often sees them, but rarely obtains a shot at
                    them. Sometimes, but it is usually when he is not aware of them, they will
                    suffer him to approach close to the tree in which they are perched. The tree is
                    generally a large one, and perhaps in full foliage, and the shooter hears the
                    rustling of the wings of the decamping birds, but seldom secures a shot.
                    Whenever u wood-pigeon leaves a tree, the shooter should prepare for others,
                    since, when there are several in the same tree, they will not leave it
                    simultaneously, but move off in succession. They are large strong birds, and
                    require heavy shot to bring them down.</p>
                <p>Shooting tame pigeons is becoming a very common amusement; but it is offener
                    practised to decide a wager, than prove the skill of the parties. The Red House
                    at Battersea, near London, is the scene of the principal matches. The birds are
                    sprung from a trap, which is usually placed twenty-one yards from the gun; the
                    birds of each person are provided by his opponent; blue rocks are the
                    favourites; very heavy guns are used, but the weight of shot is usually limited.
                    The birds must fall within a limited distance from the trap, or they are not
                    counted amongst the successful shots.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">The lark, field-fare, lapwing, golden plover, and dottrel.</hi>
                    Larks and field-fares are often the object of the young shooter’s pursuit.
                    Field-fares, the blue-backs and red-wings, arrive in October, and remain during
                    winter. They are easily approached during a frost, or when the ground is covered
                    with snow. They will then be found in search of the berries of the mountain-ash,
                    the holly, and the hawthorn, and are killed in great numbers. Like wood-pigeons,
                    field-fares do not leave a tree, or rise from the ground simultaneously, so that
                    when one bird flies off, if the shooter will hasten to the spot, he will, in all
                    probability, meet with a lagger.</p>
                <p>The lapwing or pewit is a bird much sought for by the juvenile shooter. Lapwings
                    are commonly found on marshes, or wet land abounding in rushes. Except during
                    the season of incubation, they collect in flocks, and are so very wary as to be
                    difficult of approach. They are often killed for the sake of their toppings,
                    which are useful to the angler. As they wing round the shooter, it is extremely
                    difficult to decide whether they are within range or not; they should be within
                    a moderate distance when fired at, or they will escape in the interstices of the
                    charge, as the size of the body bears a small proportion to the apparent size of
                    the bird when on the wing. It is not uncommon to see several feathers cut out of
                    the wings, and the bird fly away as if unhurt.</p>
                <p>All these birds afford amusement chiefly to schoolboys. The sportsman in pursuit
                    of game does not think them worthy attention; but the golden or whistling
                    plover, and the dottrel, which are birds often met with in hilly districts, are
                    generally considered as worth firing at, if they accidentally come in the way,
                    but are not worth the trouble of following.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">The Land-rail.</hi> The land-rail or corn-crake is a bird of
                    passage. It may be found with pointers or spaniels early in spring, in hedges or
                    long grass. The dogs for this sport should not be staunch; such as will foot the
                    birds are best as it is with great difficulty they can be made to rise. It is
                    only during the first fortnight after their arrival that they may be fairly
                    killed in spring; after that time they begin to pair. In August and September,
                    the sportsman sometimes casually meets with a land-rail, whilst beating for
                    other birds.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Wild-fowl.</hi> Wild-fowl shooting is practised in various
                    ways. The method of proceeding depends entirely on the situation in which the
                    shooter expects to find the birds. In some of the inland counties, except during
                    hard frosts, they are not met with anywhere but on large pools and ri<pb
                    break="no" facs="ht:chi.28490924&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=370"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0720-0370-0308"/> vers, and are only to be approached by having
                    recourse to some stratagem, as waiting in a shed, or on an island, or on the
                    banks of a pool, or stalking behind a horse trained to the purpose. The largest
                    shoulder gun that is at hand may be used charged with the red or green
                    wire-cartridges, the size of shot being regulated by the bore of the piece.</p>
                <p>During a severe frost, wild-fowl are compelled to leave the pools, and are then
                    found in small rivers., brooks, or in drains where there are springs of fresh
                    water. The flights being broken, ducks are found singly or only few in number,
                    and are consequently easy of access, and may be shot with a common
                    fowling-piece. The size of shot should be No. 2, or. 3. Wild-fowl are so
                    fortified with down on some parts as to resist any but hard-stricken shot. Their
                    back is the most vulnerable part, and all kinds of wild-fowl present it to the
                    shooter as they rise. They are also easily brought down when they present a
                    cross shot; but when approaching it is not advisable to fire at them. If a dog
                    accompany the shooter, it should follow at heel. As the shooter pursues the
                    course of a river or brook, he should keep out of sight as much as possible, and
                    come suddenly on every turn or winding. When there is a mist during a frost,
                    wild ducks will remain in the brooks and gutters all day. The earlier in the
                    morning the better for this sport. Ducks may also be killed on the wing, on the
                    verge of night, by the shooter lying hid near to fresh water springs. If it be a
                    dark evening, he need only wait about a quarter of an hour, but if moonlight he
                    may wait about an hour. They may also be walked up on a moonlight night, when,
                    if they rise above the horizon, they may be killed almost as easily as in the
                    day time. The objection to night shooting is, that birds knocked down are often
                    lost. These are the principal methods by which ducks are killed by any but
                    professed wild-fowl shooters.</p>
                <p>The larger kinds of wild-fowl, such as hoopers <hi rend="italic">(wild
                    swans)</hi> and geese, can rarely be brought down by the common fowling-piece,
                    unless, struck on the head or back. Wild-fowl shooting, in creeks and harbours
                    on the sea-coast, is conducted in a very different manner, and on a larger
                    scale-of operations. There are two kinds of guns used for the purpose, the
                    shoulder-gun and the punt-gun; the latter being fired from a rest, or frame, or
                    carriage, either in a boat or some other floating craft. Mr. Greener, to whose
                    work we have already referred, says, “Never make duck guns (shoulder-guns) above
                    seven-eighths in the. bore, if you wish them to kill at a great distance, and
                    not less than fifteen or sixteen pounds weight, and full four feet long.”
                    Colonel Hawker,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>Instructions to Young Sportsmen. Eighth edition. London, 1838.</p></note> ’
                    who has devoted nearly one hundred and fifty pages to the subject of wild-fowl
                    shooting, says, “The barrel of a punt-gun, to be in good proportion, should, I
                    conceive, (including the patent plug, of about six pounds weight, and from two
                    to three inches in length), be about seventy or eighty pounds weight, from seven
                    to nine feet long, and from an inch and a quarter, to an inch and a half bore,
                    according to the one length and weight, or the other. The smaller the bore is,
                    in reason, the further you can kill at a small number of birds; but the larger
                    size of thesetwo shoots the best, and is the most regular pattern. Any thing
                    beyond that size seldom answers.” Both these writers seem to agree that the
                    common punt-gun, though it weigh eighty or one hundred pounds, cannot be charged
                    to the extent of its shooting powers, by reason of the tremendous recoil that
                    would result; but each advises that the additional weight should be gained by
                    using the barrels double. Thus more than a double advantage would be secured,
                    for not only would there be two barrels at command, but the discharge from each
                    barrel would be more effective. The charge of shot for a punt-gun averages from
                    ten to twenty ounces; the shot is much larger than any used for shooting
                    game.</p>
                <p>The Colonel, and we apprehend he is the only practical writer on this department
                    of the subject, describes the various kinds of punts (which are flat-bottomed
                    boats or canoes, so constructed as to be manageable either on sands, or in mud,
                    or water,) used in several different counties, and gives the following
                    directions for shooting wild-fowl, from a punt, with a large shoulder-gun. “Sit
                    down on some straw or rushes, with your gun by your side, and take with you a
                    small Newfoundland dog. Row about, till you can see or hear a flock of wild-fowl
                    on the mud. To find them sitting, if by night, look at first Very low, so as to
                    bring the surface of the mud in contrast with the horizon, by which means you
                    will overlook the black edges of the creeks and holes, instead of seeing, and
                    perhaps mistaking them for birds.:</p>
                <p>“When you have rowed within two or three gun-shots of the fowl, take in your
                    oars, and reconnoitre the creeks. Having ascertained which is likely to be the
                    best, he down, and push along with the <hi rend="italic">setting pole</hi> or
                    <hi rend="italic">gunning spread,</hi> and while the mud banks stand above the
                    little channels, you are so completely hid, that you will seldom fail to get a
                    shot, provided there is a creek within reach of the birds, and you do not go
                    directly to windward of them.</p>
                <p>“On arriving sufficiently near, should the water be so low that you cannot
                    present your gun at the birds without kneeling or standing up, you must get
                    aground at the side of the creek, or steady your canoe by means of forcing each
                    oar from between the <hi rend="italic">thowls</hi> into the mud, otherwise the
                    recoil of the gun will set her rocking, and thus you might probably be tipped
                    out. Having made all fast, rise up and fire. Take care, however, to rise high
                    enough to be well clear of the mud, or not a feather will you touch; and present
                    as follows: By day, or moonlight, if the birds are close, directly at them; or
                    if beyond forty yards, shoot at their heads; unless they are feeding in a
                    concave place, where the tide has left a kind of plash, in which case you must
                    level rather under them, or you will only graze their back feathers. In
                    star-light, take your aim just at the top of the narrow black line, in which
                    birds always appear to one who is low down; and when so dark that you cannot see

                    enable the party to walk Or wade through mud), taking the setting pole to
                    support him, and assist the dog in collecting the killed and wounded; taking
                    care to secure first the outside birds, lest they should escape to a creek.
                    During this time you are left in charge of the punt; and should, if possible,
                    keep a look out, in order to see if any more birds fall dead or wounded from the
                    company, before they have flown out of sight.</p>
                <p>“The gunner generally calculates on bringing home the half only of what he
                    shoots, from the difficulty of catching the whole of his winged birds, which he
                    calls <hi rend="italic">cripples,</hi> and those that (to use the pigeon phrase)
                    fall out of bounds, which he calls <hi rend="italic">droppers.</hi> If the birds
                    fly up, he generally declines firing, knowing that the moment they are on the
                    wing, they become so much more spread·, that he could seldom get more than three
                    or four, for which it would be hardly worth while to disturb the mud;
                    particularly as<pb break="no" facs="ht:chi.28490924&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=371"

                    weather, pro- 'bably settle again at no great distance.</p>
                <p>“In following wild-fowl, it is easier to get within twenty yards of them by going
                    to leeward, than a hundred and fifty if directly to windward, so very acute is
                    their sense of smelling.</p>
                <p>“The best time, therefore, to have sport with a canoe and a shoulder-gun,
                    (provided it be low water, or half ebb, while you are hid in the creeks), is in
                    clear, frosty, moonlight nights, when the wind happens to blow towards you as
                    you face the moon. It is' then impossible for the wildfowl to smell you; and you
                    may, by getting them directly under the light, have the most accurate outline of
                    every bird, and even distinctly see them walking about, at a much greater
                    distance than a gun would do execution. From thus being on the shining
                    mud-banks, they appear quite black, except some of the old cock widgeons, on the
                    wings of which the white is often plainly to be seen.</p>
                <p>“It does not follow, however, that nothing can be done without a bright moon. So
                    far from it, that some of the best shoulder-gunners in the kingdom prefer but
                    very little moon even for the mud. Here, by constant habit, they can easily
                    distinguish the black phalanxes of widgeons from the shades on the places they
                    frequent, and particularly if they are feeding among the puddles which have been
                    left by the tide. In this pursuit, and when not favoured by the best of light,
                    there are a few cautions to be given to an inexperienced shooter. First, to
                    ascertain that the black patch to be seen <hi rend="italic">is a</hi> flock of
                    birds, which he will do, by observing the occasional change of feature in the
                    outside of it. Secondly, on approaching them, to be careful that their enormous
                    masses and tremendous noise do not deceive him in the distance, and tempt him to
                    fire out of shot. And, thirdly, not to be too eager in getting his dead birds,
                    as it sometimes happens, in hard weather, that the remainder of the flock will
                    again pitch down among them, particularly if he has winged some of the younger
                    birds, which have not the cunning to make off for a creek, like the old ones. In
                    this case, a reserved gun would, probably, more than double the produce of his
                    first shot. It should be understood, that this night shooting is chiefly at the
                    widgeon, as the geese, of late years, (since there have been so many shooters),
                    have seldom ventured much in harbour by night, except sometimes at high spring
                    tides, with a full moon; and the greater part of the ducks, teal, dunbirds, and
                    such like, repair inland to the ponds and fresh springs, unless driven to the
                    salt feeding ground by severe frost.</p>
                <p>“A company of widgeons, when first collecting, may be heard at an immense
                    distance, by the whistling of the cocks and purring noise of the hens; but when
                    they are quietly settled, and busy at feed, you sometimes can only hear the
                    motion of their bills, which is similar to that of tame ducks.”,</p>
                <p>Geese, ducks, widgeons, hoopers, curlews, and other wildfowl, are killed in this
                    manner; but the most destructive method of killing them is with the heavy
                    stanchion or swivel punt-gun, used by the persons on the coast who make a trade
                    of wild-fowl shooting. When a fair shot can be obtained by this method, from
                    twenty to fifty birds may be killed at one discharge; but it is laborious,
                    wearisome work, and, except for a single occasion, can scarcely be called sport.
                    This kind of shooting is carried on in the night, usually in frosty weather, at
                    which time sailing about on water, or working the canoe through mud, cannot be
                    accompanied with very agreeable sensations.</p>
                <p>The size of shot for punt-shooting should, in some measure, be regulated by the
                    size of the birds expected to be met with, and their degree of tameness; yet it
                    is well to be prepared With shot of sufficient size, as hoopers, geese, and
                    other large birds, are sometimes found when least expected <hi rend="italic">The

                    on the wing, and are killed without difficulty when they can be made to rise.
                    When shot at swimming, the shooter takes aim, and fires instantaneously, or they
                    will be under water whilst he is drawing the trigger.</p>

                    game which, are the object pf the shooter’s pursuit, a few observations on
                    sporting dogs may not be irrelevant. The shooter’s dogs are pf four kinds; the
                    pointer, setter, spaniel, and. retriever.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Pointers and Setters.</hi> If flogs were, unknown in Europe,
                    and some traveller from a distant part of the southern hemisphere were to.
                    relate that he had seen a new species of quadruped with wonderfully fine
                    olfactory nerves, by the aid of which it was enabled to hunt to death the bare,
                    stag, fox, or jackal, the tale would readily be credited; for the instinct of
                    the hound, as compared with that of other animals, is. not such as to excite
                    surprise. But were the traveller to relate that he had seen a quadruped which,
                    untaught, would stand motionless, as if converted into a statue, on coming in
                    contact with the slightest scent of game, he would not be believed; it would
                    appear incredible, such is the extraordinary instinct of the pointer and setter.
                    We use the term <hi rend="italic">extraordinary</hi> advisedly. There are other
                    animals, and indeed other dogs, which possess a degree of instinct more nearly
                    approaching to reason, but none possessing so extraordinary an instinct, an
                    instinct not analogous to that of any other living creature that we are aware
                    of. The pointer seems to be endued with it for the exclusive service of man;
                    whereas the instincts of all other animals are conducive to the supply of their
                    individual wants, and their usefulness to man is secondary thereto. It would be
                    difficult to controvert the argument that this instinct was given to the pointer
                    for the purpose of aiding men to capture or kill game, by means of such engines
                    as nets or guns.. This, we are aware, may be a doubtful position to maintain;
                    but who can say for what other apparent purpose this peculiar faculty was given?
                    It may, indeed, be urged, that the propensity to point, in the pointer, is a
                    means ordained by providence for his subsistence in a wild state, by enabling
                    him to approach within reach of. his prey, and thus to accomplish, by another
                    species of stealth, what the tiger and other animals of the cat tribe effect by
                    ambuscade. Such, an argument, however, is presumptively rebutted by the fact,
                    that all existing races of wild dogs are gregarious, and resort to the chase for
                    food; nor is there any record of the existence of dogs in a state of nature,
                    except those calculated for the chase. It is therefore gratuitous to assert,
                    that the instinct or faculty of pointing was bestowed upon the pointer as a
                    means of subsistence, since he has ever been dependant on man for food.</p>
                <p>It is strongly argued, that all dogs have descended from one common stock, and
                    that by difference in food, climate, and training,, they have become what they
                    are at present; nor is. it more improbable that such is the fact, than that the
                    human race are descended from one common parent; for dogs are not more
                    dissimilar than the various tribes of men. who differ not only ip outward form,
                    but morally and intellectually, as much as dogs vary in size, shape, temper, and
                    sagacity. Those animals which can be domesitcated improve by acquaintance with
                    man, as the wild fruits by cultivation. All wild dogs have some qualities in
                    common; but their instincts are somewhat limited, or not called forth. It is
                    only in its domesticated state that we find the various qualities which render
                    the dog so useful a servant to man. Wild dogs are, in comparison with
                    domesticated dogs, w hat savages (for wherever they have been found, savages
                    bear some resemblance to each other, and are engaged in similar pursuits) are to
                    civilized society. It<pb break="no"

                    is inconceivable that the mastiff, terrier, cur, and numberless other dogs
                    besides the pointer, could ever have been in a wild state, as they do not seem
                    to be possessed of any instincts or faculties that could enable them to subsist
                    unattached to the human race.</p>
                <p>The long received opinion that the lion, as the king of brutes, is possessed of
                    the highest degree of physical courage, is exploded. The palm of courage is now
                    awarded to the dog. Courage, however, in the common acceptation of the term, is
                    not a characteristic trait of the pointer or setter, which are, perhaps, except
                    the cur, the least courageous of the canine race. The dog is the only brute
                    animal that prefers the society of man to that of its own species; and no dog is
                    more affectionate or faithful to man than the pointer or the setter.</p>
                <p>England is not less famous for its horses than for its sporting dogs. Our
                    grey-hounds, fox-hounds, and harriers are unequalled, and that they are so
                    results from the care that has been taken to keep each species distinct. All our
                    pointers are, in some degree, of Spanish extraction; and such of them as have
                    most Spanish blood in their veins are unquestionably the best. The Spanish
                    pointer is about twenty-one inches in height. He has a large head, is heavily
                    made, broad-chested, stout-limbed, with a large dew-lap; his eyes are full, and
                    widely apart, and his nose is broad; his tail is straight, short, and thick, and
                    his ears large, pendulous, and fine; he should have a round, and not a flat
                    foot. When pointing, he stands on three legs, one of the fore legs being raised,
                    and his face and tail are in a line with his back. This is his invariable
                    position when he comes gradually upon the scent; but whenever, by running with
                    the wind, or from any other circumstance, he comes suddenly upon game, he will
                    stand in the most picturesque and sometimes indeed grotesque attitude,
                    frequently with his body almost doubled. A pointer may be sometimes seen
                    standing with all four feet collected together on the surface of a small stone
                    on a wall when the birds are almost under him. A very old dog of this
                    description, when fatigued with ranging and too enfeebled to maintain his point
                    long in the natural position, will sit down on his haunches with his face
                    towards the game, yet ever and anon turning his head wistfully to see whether
                    the gun be approaching. Notwithstanding however the vaunted excellence of
                    British pointers, the generality of them are not such as they ought to be. It is
                    much to be lamented that the same care is not taken in the breeding of pointers
                    and setters as of hounds. Scarcely two pointers are to be seen so much alike
                    that a naturalist would pronounce them to belong to the same class of dogs,
                    inasmuch as they are dissimilar in size, weight, and appearance. There are,
                    properly speaking, but two classes, the Spaniard and the mongrel. Nearly all the
                    pointers we see are, in fact, mongrels, although each may have more or less of
                    the original Spanish blood. Such, however, is the force of nature that a dog
                    having in him very little of the blood of the pointer may prove a very
                    serviceable dog to the shooter. We frequently meet with very good dogs, dogs
                    deemed by their owners first-rate, which bear little resemblance, in point of
                    shape and appearance, to the true pointer. Some have the sharp nose of the fox,
                    others the snubbed nose of the bull-dog; some are slenderly formed; some
                    long-legged, others short-legged; some heavy-bodied, others light; in short,
                    there is every possible diversity.</p>
                <p>The attempt to lay down a written rule whereby to distinguish between a good and
                    an indifferent pointer would be futile. How much of the blood of the pointer a
                    dog has in him will be read in his countenance, rather than inferred from his
                    general shape and appearance. There is an indescribable something in the
                    countenance of a thoroughbred or nearly thorough-bred pointer, which a little
                    habit of observation will enable the sportsman to detect with to-</p>
                <p>lerable accuracy, so that he may judge of the capabilities of a dog, as a
                    physiognomist will read at a glance a person’s disposition and ability in his
                    countenance. It is to the disciplined eye only that these all but infallible
                    tokens are discernible.</p>
                <p>The instinct of pointing, we apprehend, is an inextinguishable and indestructible
                    principle in the blood of the pointer, which, however it may be mingled with
                    inferior blood, will always, in some degree, manifest itself; and on this ground
                    we build our theory that the further any dog is removed from the original
                    Spanish pointer the worse the dog is; and, consequently, that all attempts to
                    cross the pointer with any other blood must necessarily deteriorate the breed.
                    The grey-hound is seldom or never crossed to give him additional fleetness, nor
                    the hound to improve his nose; why then should the pointer be crossed with dogs
                    which, in so far as the sports of the field are concerned, scarcely inherit one
                    quality in common with him? Attempts, however, are constantly made to improve
                    the pointer by a cross with the blood-hound, fox-hound, Newfoundland dog, or
                    mastiff, sometimes with a view of improving his appearance, and bringing him to
                    some fancied standard of perfection; but in reality inducing a deformity. One of
                    these imaginary standards of perfection is, that to one part thorough Spanish
                    blood, the pointer should have in him an eighth of the fox-hound, and a
                    sixteenth of the blood-hound. A cross will sometimes produce dogs which are, to
                    some eyes, the <hi rend="italic">beau idéal</hi> of beauty; but however handsome
                    such dogs may be, they will necessarily possess some quality not belonging to
                    the pointer; for instance, a cross with the hound gives the propensity to trace
                    hares, if not to give tongue. A thorough-bred pointer carries his head well up
                    when ranging; he will not give tongue, nor has he much desire to chase footed
                    game. The hound pointer may be sometimes detected by his coarse ears, by his
                    tail being curled upwards, and being carried high, or by his rough coat. An
                    occasional cross with the mastiff or Newfoundland dog is said to increase the
                    fineness of nose, but it is converting the pointer into a mere retriever. The
                    pointer, as we before observed, is naturally cowardly, as compared with other
                    dogs; therefore, whenever a pointer is ferocious or courageous, it may be
                    inferred that the blood of some of the larger or stronger dogs runs in his
                    veins. Another and the main source of the unsightliness of sporting dogs is the
                    allowing an indiscriminate intercourse between pointers and setters. Good dogs
                    may be thus obtained sometimes, but they are invariably misshapen; they have
                    generally the head and brush tail of the setter, with the body of the pointer,
                    and their coats are not sleek, and instead of standing at their point, they will
                    crouch. When the sire is nearly thorough-bred, dogs of a superior description,
                    but certainly not the best dogs, are sometimes produced by the Newfoundland or
                    some other bitch not strictly a pointer. We are not willing to allow that the
                    pointer is improved in any quality that renders him valuable to the sportsman,
                    by a cross with the hound or any other sort of dog; though we cannot deny that
                    the setter is materially improved in appearance by a cross with the Newfoundland
                    dog, but what it gains in appearance, it loses in other respects.</p>
                <p>Breeding mongrels, especially crossing with hounds, has given the gamekeepers and
                    dog-breakers an infinity of trouble which might have been avoided by keeping the
                    blood pure. The best pointer is the offspring of a pointerbitch by a
                    pointer-dog; such a dog is nearly broken by nature. The Spanish pointer seldom
                    requires the whip; the hound pointer has never enough of it. One of the main
                    sources of the sportsman’s pleasure is to see the dogs point well. A deal is
                    said about this and that dog being remarkably fine-looking; the only time to
                    appreciate the beauty of a dog is when he is ranging and pointing; then let the
                    sportsman compare the real pointer with the spurious one.<pb break="no"

                    applied to the pointer, signifies a willingness and determination to range; it

                    horses.</p></note> is another attribute of the pointer; a high-couraged pointer
                    will continue ranging till he has not, as the saying is, a leg to stand upon,
                    even though he should not meet with game.</p>
                <p>The usual price paid for breaking a dog is from two to five guineas. The breaker
                    runs the dogs in spring, and again in August, but without the gun; this,
                    followed by a week’s shooting in September, renders their education complete,
                    but unless they have sufficient practice afterwards, the initiatory lessons will
                    soon be forgotten. Young dogs will learn more in six successive days, than in
                    six weeks, if taken out only at the rate of one day per week. The dog-breaker
                    should be a person of discriminating judgment, and possessed of a good temper;
                    and the art of winning, not by brute force, but by judicious management, an
                    ascendancy over the dogs entrusted to his care. Breaking dogs, when many young
                    ones are taken out together, is a very difficult and tiresome task. One or more
                    old staunch dogs are usually allowed to accompany the young ones, to induce them
                    to back. A dog pointing is conscious of the presence of game. A dog which backs
                    another is not aware of the proximity of game at the time, otherwise than by
                    inference. Whenever the dog in advance points, it is the breaker’s duty to make
                    all the rest that acknowledge the scent to point, and all that do not
                    acknowledge the scent should be shewn the dog pointing, and be made to back,
                    which is done by the breaker holding up his hand, and crying, in an under tone,
                    “to-ho.” The dogs are taught to fall the moment the game rises, or on the report
                    of a gun. They should come in on hearing their names or the whistle, and should
                    never be allowed to pass a fence before their master. The efficiency of the
                    training which a dog has received may be conjectured from his manner of
                    quartering his ground. He should range at a short distance in advance of the
                    shooter, alternately to the right and left; and this should be taught rather by
                    the motion of the hand than by the voice. An offence should never be overlooked
                    if the dog seems conscious of it; but the breaker’s knowledge of the disposition
                    of the dog should be his guide in regulating the punishment. Some dogs will not
                    bear the whip, or even rating, but require encouragment and good words on all
                    occasions. When it is necessary to flog a headstrong dog, it should be done
                    severely, the blows falling on the side, from the shoulder to the flank. The
                    lash or switch with which the dog is punished, should not be made to lap round
                    the body, nor should the dog be kicked. When the dog is in fault, and is very
                    eager in pursuing the sport, no punishment that will be longer remembered, can
                    he administered, than making him crouch five or ten minutes. In common with
                    other sports, shooting has a vocabulary of its own. We have elsewhere given a
                    list of some of the words made use of by the breakers and sportsmen to the dogs,
                    which we transcribe, many of them being anything but euphonious to the
                    unaccustomed ear. <hi rend="italic">“To-ho</hi> spoken in an under tone, when
                    the dog is ranging, is a warning to him that he is close upon game, and is a
                    direction to him to stand. There is no necessity for using it to a dog that
                    knows his business. Spoken in a peremptory manner, it is used to make the dog
                    crouch when he has flushed game, or been otherwise in fault. <hi rend="italic"
                    >Down-charge,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">down-to-charge,</hi> is used to make the
                    dog, whether it be near or at a distance, to crouch when the shooter charges,
                    that the dog may not flush game when the shooter is unprepared. When the dog
                    will not crouch, but continues beating, the leg-strap may be put on. <hi
                    rend="italic">Take-heed,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">be-careful,</hi> are used
                    when the dog ranges over ground where it is customary to find birds. <hi
                    rend="italic">Take-heed,</hi> is a word of correction; <hi rend="italic"
                    >be-careful,</hi> of encouragement. The former is used by way of caution or
                    notice to prevent the dog flushing birds by running over the ground too fast;
                    the latter is likewise a caution, but used when the dog beats slowly or
                    carelessly. <hi rend="italic">’ Ware fence</hi> is used to prevent dogs passing
                    a fence before the gun. The dog should never, on any account, leave an enclosure
                    until its master has left it. <hi rend="italic">’Ware,</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >beware,</hi> is used to rate a dog for giving chase to a hare, birds, or
                    cattle, pointing larks, or approaching too near the heels of a horse. <hi
                    rend="italic">Seck,</hi> is a direction to the dog to look for a dead or wounded
                    bird, hare, or rabbit. <hi rend="italic">Dead</hi> is used to make a dog
                    relinquish his hold of dead or wounded game. The dog should retain possession of
                    wounded game until it is taken from him; for should he suffer a bird that is
                    only slightly wounded to disengage itself from his grasp, another <hi
                    rend="italic">seek</hi> becomes necessary, and the bird is either lost, or
                    despoiled of its plumage by the catching and re-catching. Some dogs are taught
                    to bring the game to their master. The breaker should teach the dog, in all
                    cases, to retain game until it is taken from him, or until he hear the word <hi
                    rend="italic">dead,</hi> when he should instantly drop it. The dog should be
                    punished if he break the skin with his teeth.”<note anchored="true"

                <p>The most useful dogs are those which are best broken. As much depends on the
                    breaking as the breed of a dog. Dogs should be constantly shot over during the
                    season by a successful shot, and exercised during the shooting recess, by some
                    person who understands well the management of them, otherwise they will fall off
                    in value. The half-bred ones will become unmanageable, and even the
                    thorough-bred ones will acquire disorderly habits.</p>
                <p>We look upon the setter to be an inferior kind of pointer, perhaps originally a
                    cross between the pointer and the spaniel, or some such dog as the Newfoundland,
                    for it has some qualities in common with each. The pointer has the finer nose,
                    and is more staunch than the setter. Pointers are averse to water; setters
                    delight in it; hence the advantage of the latter on marshes to the snipe
                    shooter. The setter will face briars and gorse bushes better than the pointer,
                    which is in this respect a tender dog; and for this reason the setter is
                    preferred to the pointer for cover shooting. Besides, his being not so staunch
                    as the pointer is an additional advantage in heavy covers. The sportsman who
                    shoots over well-broken pointers, frequently passes game in the woods, while the
                    pointers, which are not seen by him, are at their point; the setter, being more
                    impatient to run in, affords the shooter many shots in cover, which the
                    overstaunch pointer would not. The pointer is always to be preferred on open
                    grounds. In hot weather the pointer will endure more fatigue than the
                    setter.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">The Spaniel or Cock Dog.</hi> The spaniel is the best dog for
                    beating covers, provided he can be kept near the gun. He is generally expected
                    to give tongue when game is flushed; some spaniels will give notice of game
                    before it springs, which may be very well where wood-cocks only are expected to
                    be found. Wood-cock and pheasant sh∞ting are usually combined; where covers are
                    limited, pheasant shooting cannot be conducted too quietly. Wherever the
                    underwood is so thick that the shooter cannot keep his eye on the dogs, spaniels
                    are to be preferred to pointers or setters, whatever species of game the shooter
                    may be in pursuit of. If spaniels cannot be kept near the shooter, they are the
                    worst dogs he can employ.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Retrievers.</hi> The business of the retriever is to find lost
                    birds. Newfoundland dogs are the best for the purpose. They should have a
                    remarkably fine sense of smelling, or they will be of little use in tracing a
                    wounded pheasant, or other game, through a thick cover, where many birds<pb
                    break="no" facs="ht:chi.28490924&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=374"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0720-0374-0312"/> have been running about. A good retriever will
                    follow the ’bird on whose track he is first put, as a blood-hound will that of a
                    human being or deer. They should be taught to bring their game, or in many
                    instances their finding a wounded bird would be of no advantage to the
                    shooter.</p>
                <p>We proceed next to give some description of the art of shooting game, in the
                    course of which we shall endeavour to confine our obseravtions to such of the
                    habits and peculiarities of the birds and quadrupeds under notice, as it is
                    essential the shooter should be made acquainted with, and at the same time to
                    detail the means of proceeding most likely to ensure success in the pursuit of
                    them.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">The Partridge.</hi> We commence with the partridge, as shooting
                    that bird is generally the young shooter’s first lesson at game, although in the
                    order of the season grouse shooting takes precedence. Partridge shooting
                    commences on the first of September, and ends on the first of February.</p>
                <p>The habits of the partridge at different seasons should be closely understood and
                    studied by the shooter, that he may be able, with a tolerable degree of
                    certainty, to find them at any given time. In the early part of the season, they
                    will be found, just before sunrise, running to a brook, a spring, or marsh, to
                    drink; from which place they almost immediately fly to some field where they can
                    find abundance of insects, or else to the nearest corn-field or stubble-field,
                    where they w ill remain, according to the state of the weather, or other
                    circumstances, until nine or ten o’clock, when they go to bask. The basking
                    place is commonly on a sandy bank-side facing the sun, where the whole covey
                    sits huddled together for several hours. About four or five o’clock, they return
                    to the stubbles to feed, and about six or seven they go to their jucking-place,
                    a place of rest for the night, which is mostly in aftermath, or in a rough
                    pasture field, where they remain huddled together until morning. Such are their
                    habits during the early part of the season; but their times of feeding and
                    basking varies much with the length of the days. While the corn is standing,
                    unless the weather be very fine or very wet, partridges will often remain in it
                    all day; when fine, they bask on the outskirts; when wet, they run to some bare
                    place in a sheltered situation, where they will be found crowded together as if
                    basking, for they seldom remain long in corn or grass when It is wet. Birds lie
                    best on a hot day. They are wildest on a damp or boisterous day.</p>
                <p>The usual way of proceeding in search of partridges in September is, to try the
                    stubbles first, and next the potato and turnip field. Birds frequently bask
                    amongst potatoes or turnips, especially when those fields are contiguous to a
                    stubble-field. The best partridge shooting is obtained in potato and turnip
                    fields. It not unfrequently happens that' potatoes or turnips are grown on a
                    headland in a corn field; in that case the headland will be a favourite resort
                    of birds.</p>
                <p>After the middle of October it is ever uncertain where birds will be found; the
                    stubbles having been pretty well gleaned, birds do not remain in them so long as
                    in the early part of the season. When disturbed at this time they will sometimes
                    take shelter in woods, when they are flushed one by one. The best shots that can
                    be obtained at partridges in winter, are when the birds are driven into
                    woods.</p>
                <p>When a covey separates, the shooter will generally be able to kill many bfrds,
                    but late in the season it is seldom that the covey can be broken. In November
                    and December the shooter must not expect to hate his birds pointed, but must
                    remain content with firing at long distances. We transcribe the following
                    observations on dispersing coveys: “In the early part of the season, when the
                    shooter <hi rend="italic">breaks</hi> a covey, he should proceed without loss of
                    time in search of the dispersed birds, for the parent birds begin to call '
                    almost immediately on their alighting, the young ones answer, and in less than
                    half an hour, if not prevented by the presence of the shooter and his dogs, the
                    whole covey will be re-assembled, probably in security in some snug corner,
                    where the shooter least thinks of looking for them. As the season advances birds
                    are longer in re-assembling after being dispersed. It is necessary to beat very
                    closely for dispersed birds, as they do not stir for some time after alighting,
                    on which account dogs cannot wind them until nearly upon them, especially as
                    they resort to the roughest places when dispersed. Birds dispersed afford the
                    primest sport. The pointing is often beautiful, the bird being generally in a
                    patch of rushes, or tuft of grass or fern, and close to the dog. When a bird has
                    been running about some time, dogs easily come upon the scent of it; but when it
                    has not stirred since alighting, and has perhaps crept into a drain, or run into
                    a hedge-bottom, or the sedgy side of a ditch, no dog can wind it until close
                    upon it, and the very best dogs will sometimes flush a single bird. In the month
                    of October, and afterwords, the shooter will find it difficult to approach
                    within gun-shot of a covey, nor can he disperse them, except by firing at them
                    when he chances to come close upon them. Should he then be so fortunate as to
                    disperse a covey, he may follow them leisurly, for they will then lie several
                    hours in their lurking place, which is chosen with much tact, as a patch of
                    rushes, a gorse bush, a holly bush, the bottom of a double bank fence, or a
                    coppice or wood. The length of time that will transpire before a dispersed covey
                    will re-assemble, depends, too, on the time of the day, and state of the
                    weather. In hot weather, they will lie still for several hours. A covey
                    dispersed early in the morning, or late at night, will soon re-assemble. A covey
                    dispersed between the hours of ten and two, will be some time in re-assembling.
                    A covey found in the morning in a stubble field, and dispersed, will next
                    assemble near the basking place. A covey dispersed after two o’clock, will next
                    assemble in the stubble field at feeding time. A covey disturbed and dispersed
                    late in the afternoon, or evening, will next re-assemble near the jucking-place.
                    A covey being disturbed on or near to their jucking-place, will seek a fresh
                    one, perhaps about two fields distant; and if often disturbed at night on their
                    jucking-place, they will seek another stubble field to feed in, and change their
                    quarters altogether. The most certain method of driving partridges from a farm,
                    is to disturb them night after night at their jucking-place, which is usually in
                    a meadow, adjoining to a corn field, where the aftermath is suffered to grow, or
                    in a field rough with rushes, fern, thistles, or heather. When a covey is
                    dispersed on a dry hot day, it is necessary to search much longer, and beat
                    closer, for the dispersed birds, than when the day is cool, and the ground
                    moist. A dog should be only slightly rated for flushing a bird on a hot
                    day.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>‘ The Oakleigh
                    Shooting Code.</p></note></p>
                <p>The number of birds in a covey varies much, perhaps the average may be from ten
                    to fifteen. In some years, when the coveys are large after a fine hatching
                    season, it is not uncommon to see upwards of twenty birds in a covey; and
                    sometimes after a wet season, ten birds may be deemed a fair covey. Birds are
                    always most numerous after a dry summer. When there are thunder-storms about
                    midsummer, great numbers of young birds are drowned. The young birds have many
                    enemies besides the elements, such as cats, young dogs, hawks, foxes, and vermin
                    of different descriptions. When the eggs are taken, or the young birds destroyed
                    soon after leaving the shell, there will be a second hatch. Sportsmen often meet
                    with second hatches in September, when the old birds rise screaming, and
                    generally alight within fifty yards, as if to induce the young birds to follow.
                    In that case the fair sportsman will not fire at the old birds, but will coll in
                    his dogs and leave<pb break="no" facs="ht:chi.28490924&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=375"

                    after the young dogs, as, when they see the birds running, they are apt to snap
                    up such of them as cannot get out of the way. The very young birds are called
                    cheepers, from their uttering a scream as they rise. Full grown birds never
                    scream as they rise, except when the young ones are helpless, nor do young birds
                    after they are large enough for the table.</p>
                <p>The cock partridge is distinguished from the hen by the brown feathers which form
                    a crescent, or horse-shoe, as it is sometimes called, on the breast.</p>
                <p>The pointer is decidedly the best dog for partridge shooting. Markers and
                    retrievers will be of much service to the shooter whose object is to kill a
                    great quantity of birds, rather than to enjoy the sport.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">The Pheasant.</hi> The pheasant is the most splendidly arrayed
                    of undomesticated British birds. It is deservedly in high request amongst
                    sportsmen, and it claims the first attention of the game-preserver. The
                    numberless plantations and coppices which are everywhere springing up, afford
                    yearly additional shelter. The pheasant prefers woods of oak and beech, that it
                    may feed on the acorns and mast. The fine old woods consisting of these trees
                    may perhaps be diminishing, but they are more than replaced by plantations of
                    larch or other quick-growing trees. Pheasants generally choose the larch or
                    sprucefir to roost in, and plantations of this description, if near corn,
                    turnip, or potato fields, afford sufficient cover for them. They are, in many
                    counties, allowed to become so numerous, as to do serious mischief to the
                    labours of husbandry’. ,</p>
                <p>During August and the early part of September, pheasants will remain nearly all
                    day in potato and corn fields. Pheasant shooting commences on the first of
                    October, and ends on the first of February. In October, the shooter usually
                    meets with them in potato and turnip fields, deep stubbles and rushy fields near
                    covers, but especially under hedges, holly trees, or in coppices near to covers.
                    In such situations they will suffer the shooter to approach very near to them;
                    they are generally pointed by the dogs, and, a large majority of them being
                    young birds, are easily killed; but in that month the trees are so full of
                    foliage, and the briars and brushwood are so annoying, that it is seldom
                    possible to beat the woods with any degree of pleasure, for not only are they
                    almost impervious, but the pheasants are seldom seen when they rise, or if seen
                    and shot, are very frequently lost, or not found without considerable loss of
                    time. It is in November, when the birds have moulted, and when the leaves have
                    fallen, and the brambles are decaying, and the paths in the woods are beginning
                    to be worn, that pheasant shooting is in perfection. The birds are then full
                    grown, and also better fed than later in the season.</p>
                <p>It is not usual to kill the hens wherever pheasants are strictly preserved; but
                    it is necessary to kill the cocks where they are too numerous. Pheasants do not
                    pair, and as it is better that there should be but few cocks, the shooter’s
                    being able to single them out and kill them, tends ultimately to the increase,
                    and not to the diminution of the number of birds in cover. At the commencement
                    of the season the shooter will frequently flush a nide of pheasants, but in the
                    after part of the season he will oftener find solitary birds. Pheasants will
                    occasionally wander a considerable distance from the wood to which they belong,
                    especially during winter, in search of food, and in wet and foggy weather. The
                    pheasant basks at the root of a tree, or under a hedge, in the same manner as
                    the partridge, but each bird nestles itself separately. Pheasants approach
                    nearer to domesticated poultry than any other kind of game. Pheasant shooting is
                    most destructive where the plantations are not more than forty yards wide; when
                    the shooters remain on the outside, while the beaters and dogs rouse the game
                    within. The pheasant shooter does not expect set shots; his object is to cause
                    the birds to rise as near to him as he can. Having no notice of them, he should
                    ever be on the alert for snap shots.</p>
                <p>A short double-barrelled fowling-piece, of wide bore, is preferable to a long
                    one. The shot should be large, and it is well to use plenty of it. A
                    close-shooting gun is not to be recommended to the pheasant shooter. The birds
                    should rarely be fired at in cover when more than thirty yards from the gun, or
                    they will escape wounded in the underwood. They are generally brought down
                    within twenty yards from the gun. Pheasants are most plentiful in Norfolk,
                    Suffolk, and some of the adjoining counties. There are some in every county in
                    England, and in most of the counties in Scotland. A perfect bird has a white
                    annular space on the neck, but this mark is often wanting.</p>
                <p>The pheasant makes a considerable noise when rising, sufficiently so to unnerve
                    the young and over-anxious shooter. The bird should be allowed to rise clear of
                    the bushes, and to its full height, before the shooter fires at it, or it is
                    probable he will fire too low; and again, the short fan-like feathers on either
                    side of the tail appear, as the bird is rising, to be part of the bird, making
                    the body seem longer and larger than it really is; and this circumstance,
                    together with the rapidity of the movement of the bird when rising, is the cause
                    of the shooter firing too low. The aim should always be at the head, unless the
                    bird is crossing, and then well forward. Firing too soon, lest the bird should
                    be out of reach, is a very common error, particularly with young sportsmen.</p>
                <p>For reasons which we have before adverted to, the setter, or cock-dog, is to be
                    preferred to the pointer for pheasant shooting. Pheasants will sometimes lie
                    very close, so that it is with great difficulty they can be made to rise;
                    therefore dogs that will dash into the thicket are most useful. Beaters and
                    retrievers are indispensable to the pheasant shooter.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">The Hare.</hi> The shooter seldom beats purposely for hares.
                    Birds are mainly the object of his pursuit. He chooses his ground, and regulates
                    the charge of his fowling-piece with reference to the birds he expects to meet
                    with. Hares are started casually, as it were, while he is in quest of birds.
                    Leveret shooting often commences with grouse shooting, on the 12th of August,
                    though it is not uncommon, nor is it considered unfair, to kill leverets during
                    the summer months. Hares are not in season until September. The shooter should
                    desist from killing them in February, but he is not prevented from killing them
                    at any season, by any legislative enactment, if he have taken out a game
                    certificate. It is the prescriptive law of the chase, held sacred by sportsmen,
                    that prevents him.</p>
                <p>In September, hares lie close, in hedges, in woods, or in growing com, and are
                    somewhat difficult to be found. They are scared from the woods by the leaves
                    falling in autumn, and they are then found, particularly after stormy weather,
                    in pasture and stubble fields. Dogs will frequently point them. In November and
                    December, they are often seen on their seats, or forms, as they are sometimes
                    called, by the shooter keeping his eyes on the ground about eight or ten<pb
                    break="no" facs="ht:chi.28490924&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=376"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0720-0376-0314"/> yards from him. It is usual, however, to allow
                    the hare a chance of escape, by starting her before firing at her; it is
                    accounted unsportsmanlike to kill puss on her seat. In January, hares are found
                    on fallows, marshes, or in pastures, or in or near to gardens.</p>
                <p>The shooter should fire well forward at a hare, and not too high. He should not
                    fire at a long distance, as the probability of his wounding her would be greater
                    than that of killing her. If running direct from him, a hare should not be fired
                    at, unless within twenty-five paces from the gun, or she will often run off,
                    though severely wounded in the hind-quarters. A beater will render essential
                    service to the shooter in quest of hares, in the early part of the season; the
                    beater walks on the contrary side of the hedge to the shooter, and a few yards
                    in advance, so that the hare, to avoid the former, jumps out on the side of the
                    latter. When beating hedges in the vicinity of covers, the shooter should take
                    care to place himself on that side nearest the covers. When shooting at the edge
                    of a cover, if the hare fired at is not quite deprived of the use of her legs,
                    it would be advisable to fire again immediately, for should she crawl through
                    the hedge, the chances would be against her being retrieved.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">The Rabbit.</hi> Rabbits are alternately deemed game and
                    vermin. They are sometimes shot for sport, sometimes for profit, and sometimes
                    on account of the mischief they do to trees and other vegetation. They sometimes
                    seat themselves all day long, after the manner of hares, but more frequently
                    they remain the greater portion of the day in their burrows. As they are shy of
                    approach, and run under ground on the least alarm, the shooter frequently finds
                    it expedient to hide himself at a little distance from the warren, and wait
                    until they come out. Where rabbits are numerous, as in most warrens they are,
                    some will be continually playing within a few yards of the entrance of the
                    burrows, and when found in such situations (for they are very tenacious of
                    life), they should be struck very hard, or they will contrive to crawl, or
                    rather roll into their earths, before the shooter can pick them up. It is
                    astonishing what efforts they will make to escape, though three legs be broken,
                    when near to the entrance of a burrow. It is of little use firing at them when
                    they are more than twenty paces distant from the gun. Rabbits afford more what
                    are termed snap-shots than any other game, as they are mostly found in or near
                    to plantations, or amongst brambles, hollies, gorse or deep fern, in places of
                    extreme difficulty. It requires a quick eye and steady hand to stop a rabbit
                    running across furrows, or over uneven ground. Rabbits for sale, or when
                    destroyed as vermin, are oftener taken by means of ferrets and nets, than killed
                    by the gun. A short gun, having a large bore, and charged heavily with powder,
                    and a small quantity of No. 4 shot, is best for rabbit shooting. It would be
                    well that a companion or servant should lead a dog in a slip—a terrier is as
                    good as any—to be loosed the moment the gun is fired; thus many a rabbit will be
                    secured, that would else have run into its hole. When earthed, it frequently
                    happens that a rabbit is not able to crawl more than three or four feet deep
                    from the surface, where it dies, when it may be recovered by thrusting a bramble
                    down the hole, and twisting it so as to entangle the rabbit; but a more certain
                    method, if the rabbit is not too far down, is to screw the worm of the ramrod
                    into its body, and so drag it out, as a cartridge is drawn from the barrel of a
                    gun The best time for rabbit shooting is in the evening, or during sunshine just
                    after a shower, when great numbers of the rabbits venture from their
                    burrows.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">The Bustard.</hi> The bustard is a rare but valuable
                    acquisition to the game-bag. As it cannot be approached unless the shooter takes
                    advantage of some adventitious circumstances, it is seldom an object of pursuit
                    to the sportsman. Bustard shooting commences on the first of September, and ends
                    on the first of March.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">The Snipe.</hi> There are three kinds of snipes, viz. the
                    solitary or double snipe, the full or whole snipe, and the jack or half snipe.
                    The last is considered to be scarcely worth powder and shot; it is the full
                    snipe which principally engages the shooter’s attention. We have before given
                    directions for shooting this bird. “The common or full snipe is a shy bird when
                    in company, but when alone will allow the shooter to approach within a dozen
                    paces of it before it springe. When it does spring, however, it moves with a
                    velocity that defies the epithet <hi rend="italic">slow!</hi> It is best to
                    shoot as soon as possible. The shooter will bring down a snipe with much less
                    difficulty at from fifteen to twenty paces than at any other distance. The aim
                    is thus taken before the bird begins to make its cross flights, and before it
                    has attained its full speed. The irregularity of its flight is of little
                    consequence during the first and second twirling, before the bird is safely on
                    the wing, since its flight is then comparatively tardy. But let the snipe fly
                    ten yards from whence it sprang,—let it be, for instance, twenty-five paces
                    distant from the gun, it is then at the top of its speed, and in the very midst
                    of its sidelong, elliptical gyrations, and more than a match for the majority of
                    shooters, especially if the day be windy. A snipe killed at fifteen or twenty
                    paces distance, with No. 7 shot, the aim being true, will be struck by twenty or
                    thirty pellets, but the chances are more than twenty to one against the aim
                    being true. The snipe, when struck, is generally three or four inches from the
                    centre of the cone which the shot forms as it flies, which is very different
                    from being in the exact centre. A section of the body of a snipe does not
                    present a surface as large as that of a penny-piece. If any person will fire at
                    a target at fifteen yards distance, he will find that a snipe would not be cut
                    to pieces even at that distance, unless it chanced to be precisely in the centre
                    of the charge as thrown. When speaking of a snipe presenting no larger a surface
                    as a mark than a penny-piece, we of course mean a snipe flying directly from the
                    shooter. It would be imprudent to shoot at a snipe flying across at less than
                    twenty-five paces distance, as it then presents more than double the surface of
                    one going straight from the shooter Thirty paces is the distance we should
                    prefer for a cross or oblique shot. At thirty, or even at twenty-five yards,
                    unless the barrel throws shot remarkably close, there are interstices in the
                    charge as thrown, in which a snipe would escape untouched. Provided the flight

                    his own distance, a snipe would have the least chance for its life at twenty
                    yards. But there are two points to be attended to in determining the proper
                    distance—the flight of the bird, and the manner in which the shot is thrown. In
                    snipe-shooting the latter is subservient to the former. The few full snipes
                    occasionally found on heathery and rush-clad hills, as well as in the enclosed
                    grounds, he much more dispersed than the gregarious birds of the marsh. Hence
                    those found on the uplands are easy, and those on the fens difficult of
                    approach. It is, however, the same description of bird that is found in both
                    situations.” When the shooter uses wire cartridges, which, by the bye, are not
                    precisely calculated for snipe-shooting, it would be prudent to allow the bird
                    to move to a considerable distance before firing. It is scarcely necessary to
                    add, that the shot used for snipeshooting should be very small. When several
                    snipes rise together, they are styled a wisp.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">The Woodcock.</hi> There is a proverb current among sports-
                    men, that to kill a woodcock is to perform a day’s work, which doubtlessly
                    originated in the circumstance of a woodcock being seldom found until a very
                    large extent of wood has been closely beaten by both men and dogs. In the month
                    of November, however, when woodcocks are most abundant, it would not be a
                    difficult task, according to that standard of labour, to do the work of a week
                    in a day, in any noted cover, for every cover frequented by woodcocks, (or cocks
                    as they are called in the sportsman’s nomenclature), acquires a notoriety which
                    it seldom loses, since any wood well frequented with cocks one year, has
                    generally a fair supply the next. But whether the same cocks that frequent a
                    wood this year, return the next, with their offspring, or whether an entirely
                    new set of occupants take possession, we leave the ornithologist to decide. A
                    certain description of woods are seldom known to fail of woodcocks during the
                    winter months; these woods or plantations are such as are swampy, or have a
                    stream of water running through them, or woods abounding in springs, or where,
                    from the nature of the ground, or want of draining, the top water encourages the
                    growth of moss. The woodcock is rarely found where moss is not abundant. During
                    a frost, cocks are found near fresh water springs; at other times, they are most
                    commonly flushed in the open glades of the densest woods, or rather in those
                    parts of the woods not choked up at the bottom with fern, rushes, or brambles,
                    but where they can freely run about, and in those parts where willows, osiers,
                    hazel-trees, or crate-wood is plentiful. In such places it will readily be
                    ascertained whether there are cocks or not, by the borings in the moss or dead
                    leaves, and by the droppings. Should the cock not be brought down, it will not
                    fly far after being fired at; it should, when practicable, be marked down, as by
                    this means several successive shots may be obtained at it when the gun is
                    unsuccessful. It is seldom that the skilful shooter springs a cock which he does
                    not eventually kill. The difficulty of woodcock shooting arises, for the most
                    part, from the birds springing in the thickest part of woods, and contriving to
                    wing their flight through the trees, in such a manner as to baffle the
                    sportsman’s aim. After being fired at in a wood, cocks will frequently alight
                    amongst hedge-rows on the outskirts, especially under a hedge running close to
                    and parallel with a water-course, when they are easily killed, as they will not
                    rise until the shooter is close upon them; and their flight is not difficult to
                    master when there are no trees to obstruct the aim. Woodcocks are found in
                    October on moors, and in covers near the sea. About the last week in October
                    they find their way to the inland covers, where they remain during the early
                    part of the winter, and they are sometimes found there again in March. A sharp
                    frost, or a dense fog, at the end of October or beginning of November, is
                    usually the shooter’s first intimation of the arrival of cocks; and if he is
                    ambitious of the fame of killing them, he must fag hard during the month of
                    November, or it is probable that his return for the season of the numbers bagged
                    will not be satisfactory. November is unquestionably the best month for cock
                    shooting.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">The Red Grouse.</hi> Grouse shooting commences on the 12th of
                    August. We have already alluded to the vast extent of the northern moors. The
                    number of birds killed on the opening day, on some parts, is very great. It is
                    not uncommon for an experienced and skilful shooter, on the best moors, to bag
                    fifty brace on the 12th of August. What may be termed a good day’s sport,
                    differs much on different moors. On well-preserved moors, the average may be
                    from ten to twenty brace. On subscription moors, the shooter should not be
                    dissatisfied if he has the opportunity of killing from three to five brace per
                    day, during the first week of the season, though this would be deemed a low
                    average for the Scottish moors. After the first week, few sportsmen, except
                    those residing in the immediate neighbourhood of the hills, ever trouble the
                    moor game.</p>
                <p>Many causes contribute to the popularity of grouse shooting, amongst which may be
                    enumerated the following. It oommences during the parliamentary recess, and long
                    vacation—the legislator’s, lawyer’s, and collegian’s holiday; and it is no
                    wonder that after being cooped up all summer, these, or any other classes of
                    society, should seek relaxation in the sports of the field. August is the season
                    when every one, from the peer to the shopkeeper, who can afford the indulgence,
                    either rusticates or travels. In that month the casual tourist, the laker, and
                    the angler, are often in the North, when the temptation to draw a trigger is
                    irresistible. Grouse shooting fascinates the young shooter more than any other
                    kind of sport, inasmuch as the season commences with it. The opening day is
                    looked forward to with pleasing anticipation all summer. To the more practised
                    sportsman, grouse shooting recommends itself by reason of the superiority of the
                    sport over every other kind of shooting. Partridge shooting is a comparatively
                    tame and uninteresting amusement. Partridge sh∞ting, as compared with grouse
                    shooting, may be termed domestic sporting. To the majority of sportsmen, a
                    grouse shooting excursion only occurs once a year, and then lasts only a few
                    days. The sport therefore seldom palls; but during the long interval of time
                    that elapses between each, the coming season is ever looked forward to with
                    additional interest. <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> Grouse shooting is, in many
                    respects, a source of greater expenditure to the sportsman: it requires more
                    preparation, and is attended with more difficulties than any other kind of
                    shooting; but these circumstances, whatever some people may imagine to the
                    contrary, so far from detracting from, serve to enhance the enjoyment of the
                    sport; for we are apt to estimate whatever is obtained with difficulty and
                    expense at a higher rate than what is gratuitously afforded us. To the lover of
                    the romantic and the picturesque, grouse shooting has attractions of the highest
                    order. It is the sport of all others peculiarly British: the partridge, the
                    pheasant, the black-cock, are widely dispersed over other countries; but the red
                    grouse is only found in the British Islands.<pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:chi.28490924&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=378" xml:id="kp-eb0720-0378-0316"/>
                    There are seldom more than a dozen grouse in a brood; rarely indeed so many.
                    Towards the end of autumn, the broods congregate together, and are seldom seen
                    afterwards until pairing time in January or February, except in great numbers.
                    Broods thus associated are termed packs. When it happens that the birds are well
                    grown at the opening of the season, and much fired at in August, they will pack
                    before September. When there is fine weather in August, grouse, until the broods
                    are packed, will suffer the shooter to approach very near to them before they
                    rise. In wet or windy weather they are wild. Very few grouse are killed by the
                    sportsman after August; they are then scarcely approachable. Grouse delight in
                    tall young heather, when there are plenty of bare places or pads or tracks.
                    Hares also, and cocks, and we may perhaps add, pheasants, in their respective
                    covers, delight in those parts where they can run about freely. The brow of a
                    hill is more likely ground than either extreme heights or valleys, or flats.
                    Solitary birds lie better than broods. When birds are wild, the shooter should
                    follow an individual rather than a brood. It is well understood by sportsmen,
                    that the fewer birds there are in a brood, nide, or covey, the better will they
                    lie. Grouse bask on the sunny hill-side, oftentimes under a rock, or in a stone
                    pit, during the middle of the day, at which time the task of ranging for them is
                    toilsome in the extreme. Grouse shooters should be accompanied by a guide and
                    markers. The former is indispensable to a person not intimately acquainted with
                    every turn and knoll, during the mist that nine mornings out of ten envelopes
                    the hills in August. It is inconceivable how completely bewildered a person who
                    fancies he is acquainted with every inch of ground may be when surrounded by the
                    haze. Neither sun, moon, nor stars are visible; nor is there a fence, road, or
                    building to direct him. A stone pit, or mountain rill, are often the only
                    objects that present themselves, except the interminable-heather. The distant
                    hills that would else be his guides, are shut out from his view, which does not
                    extend beyond the range of his fowling-piece. At such times it requires no
                    ordinary precaution to prevent losing young dogs, which can scarcely be
                    prevented running off when a gun is fired in the distance. During the
                    continuance of the mist, which generally disappears about eight o’clock, markers
                    can be of but little use, except that they may be employed in carrying a basket,
                    extra guns and shot, or leading dogs, of which it is well to have a change. No
                    dog can range two days successively for grouse. Pointers, for reasons we have
                    before given, are preferable to setters, or any other kind of dogs, for grouse
                    shooting. Grouse shooters should separate and range singly; they should have no
                    noisy attendants; nor any dogs that require rating. The sport cannot be carried
                    on too quietly. If the shooter throws off before eight o’clock, which it is not
                    prudent to do unless there are many guns on the moors or foul weather is
                    expected in the afternoon, he should run only one dog as long as the heather is
                    wet, afterwards two, and in the afternoon three dogs. In wet weather one dog is
                    quite sufficient. If hot weather, we advise rest from eleven to two. If the
                    shooter have not exhausted himself during the middle of the day he will best
                    fill his bag in the afternoon; he may net, indeed, then find so many, but those
                    he does find will be dispersed birds that will almost lie to be trodden on. An
                    old sh∞ter thus on a dry afternoon following a wet morning will sometimes load
                    himself or his attendant, after the less experienced have left the moor
                    disgusted, with scarcely a bird in their possession. Shooters are generally
                    recommended to carry as heavy a gun as they can conveniently manage on the
                    moors. It should be borne in mind that the heaviest gun will do most execution;
                    but none except those accustomed to such exercise, can carry a heavy gun with
                    comfort all day long, exposed to an autumnal sun. We would therefore not
                    recommend barrels more than thirty inches long, nor of a larger guage than
                    sixteen, on account of the excessive heat of the weather at this season. As the
                    sportsman, in grouse shooting, has ever an opportunity of choosing his own
                    distance when birds rise near to him, he will be more certain of killing if he
                    let the birds fly twenty-five yards from him before he fires the first barrel,
                    when, if he have both barrels cocked, he will have ample time to throw in the
                    reserve barrel while the birds are within reasonable distance. In nothing is the
                    superiority of the detonating over the flint lock more apparent than in its
                    allowing the shooter to fire the second so soon after the first barrel. We
                    suspect that the habit of taking the gun from the shoulder after the first
                    barrel was fired, originated in the necessity of waiting until the smoke from
                    the pan was blown away, which nuisance no longer exists. A person who is a
                    decidedly bad shot should not use the cartridge in the first barrel, as the
                    loose charge gives a larger circle at a short distance, and consequently
                    increases the chance of killing.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">The Blackcock.</hi> Black game shooting commences on the 20th
                    of August, and ends, with red grouse shooting, on the 10th of December. Black
                    game frequent moors covered with heather, but they are as often found in rushy
                    fields, or even in stubbles adjoining to moors. They are not met with at any
                    great altitude, but confine themselves chiefly to the lower hills, or the base
                    of the loftier mountains. They are seldom found, except where there are
                    plantations or forests of fir trees. Black game do not frequent the central
                    parts of large wastes so much as those parts bordering on inclosed lands. Red
                    grouse recede where civilization progresses; and they are consequently in a fair
                    way, at no very distant period, of being banished from England. As a vast extent
                    of heath-land is not requisite for black game, there is no room to fear their
                    extinction for some centuries to come. Although not so numerous as red grouse,
                    they are more widely scattered over England. Even in the south of England there
                    is cover congenial to them. Should both black and red game become extinct in
                    England, the hills of Scotland will long afford shelter to each. With the
                    exception of the pheasant, black game is the only species of game not yearly
                    diminishing in number in Britain. A full-grown blackcock weighs the same as a
                    fine pheasant cock, about three pounds and a half. The female, which is called
                    the grey-hen, and ought never to be fired at, is much smaller. Black game
                    shooting on moors resembles red grouse shooting, and in the woods, pheasant
                    shooting. The black cock is a magnificent bird, and an old one is ever deemed a
                    valuable addition to the contents of the game bag. Black game have increased
                    very considerably in England during the last few years, still they are much more
                    abundant in Scotland. Sweden is perhaps the country best suited to them.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">The capercailzie.</hi> Similar to the blackcock, in many
                    respects, is the capercailzie, or cock of the wood, once the native, and now the
                    denizen of the Highland forests. The<pb break="no"

                    capercailzie cock weighs sixteen pounds. Speaking of this bird, as it exists in
                    Sweden, Mr. Lloyd says,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>Field Sports of the North of Europe.</p></note> “The favourite haunts of the
                    capercali are extensive fir woods; in coppices or small cover he is seldom or
                    never found. The principal food of the capercali, when in a state of nature,
                    consists of the leaves of the Scotch fir; he very rarely, however, feeds upon
                    those of the spruces; he also eats juniper berries, cranberries, blaeberries,
                    and other berries common to the northern forests; and occasionally also, in the
                    winter time, the buds of the birch, &amp;c. The young capercali feed principally
                    at first on ants, worms, insects, &amp;c.” It was the felling of the timber,
                    aided, perhaps, by the cross-bow, which is not ill-adapted to the purpose, that
                    exterminated this primeval habitant of the old Caledonian forests. Some years
                    since an attempt was made to re-introduce this bird to its ancient haunts in
                    Scotland, but without success. “It is a pity,”; continues Mr. Lloyd, “that
                    attempts are not made once more to introduce the capercali into the United
                    Kingdom, for, if the experiment was undertaken with judgment, it would most
                    probably be attended with success; the climate, soil, &amp;c. in Scotland, at
                    least, not being very disimilar, in many respects, to the south of Sweden. In
                    Scotland, besides, independently of the natural forests, there are now
                    considerable tracks of land planted with pines, from which trees, when the
                    ground is covered with snow, those birds obtain nearly the whole of their
                    sustenance.” Since this was written, several brace of these birds have been sent
                    over from Sweden; and on the estates of the Marquis of Bread-albane the
                    experiment of localising them is in course of trial. We believe they were
                    procured by Mr. Lloyd himself, and under his auspices, from his knowledge of the
                    habits of the bird, we doubt not that the cock of the wood will become
                    permanently established in the Highlands. It may be inferred that the same
                    description of country (the heaths and forests being on a more extended scale,)
                    which suits the blackcock, would likewise suit the capercailzie, since, as Mr.
                    Lloyd observers, “the capercali occasionally breed with the black game; the
                    produce of which partake of the leading characteristics of both species. Their
                    size and colour, however, greatly depend upon whether the connexion was between
                    the capercali cock and the grey hen, or <hi rend="italic">vice versâ.”</hi> In
                    winter, the male birds congregate in packs after the manner of black game. In
                    Sweden the capercailzie is usually shot with the rifle.</p>

                <p>It may be admissible in poetry to give the highest cliffs to the king of birds,

                    begin at last to feel alone, severed entirely from the world of society, of
                    life, and of growth, and committed to the solitude of the ancient hills and
                    immeasurable sky. The snow lies thick on the side of the summit, and even peers
                    over the top, defying the utmost efforts of solstitial heat. There is no plant
                    under your feet, save lichen on the rock, apparently as hard and as strong as
                    that to which it adheres—it can hardly be said to grow—and moss in some crevice,
                    undistinguishable from the dull and cold mud into which the storms of many
                    winters have abraded the granite. You are above the reach of all sound from the
                    inhabited parts of the country.” And what do we find in this region of snow? “A
                    few mottled pebbles, or at least what appear to be such, each about twice the
                    size of your hand, he at some distance, where the decomposed rock, and the
                    rudiments of what may be called the most elevated mountain vegetation, just
                    begin to ruffle the surface. By and by a cloud shadows the sun, the air blows
                    chill as November, and a few drops fall, freezing or melting in their descent,
                    you cannot well tell which. The mottled pebbles begin to move; you throw a stone
                    at them to shew that you can move pebbles as well as the mountain. The stone
                    hits beyond them; they run toward your feet, as if claiming your protection;
                    they are birds, ptarmigan, the uppermost tenants of the island, whom not even
                    winds, which could uproot forests, and frosts, which could all but congeal
                    mercury, can drive from these their mountain haunts. It has often been observed,
                    that of all the human inhabitants of the earth, the mountaineer, be his mountain
                    ever so barren, is the last to quit; and the same holds true of the mountain
                    bird.” The same writer traces the different elevations at which various species
                    of game is found, beginning with the pheasant, as the tenant of the lowermost
                    woods; the partridge, of the plain; the blackcock, of the confines of
                    cultivation; the grouse, of the lesser hills and mountain-side; and the
                    ptarmigan, of the snow-crowned summits. He also adds, “in these birds we trace a
                    sort of resemblance to the general colour of the places which they inhabit,
                    though we know not well the cause of the colour in either case. The ptarmigan is
                    mossy rock in summer, hoar frost in autumn, and snow in winter. Grouse are brown
                    heather, black game are peat-bank and shingle, and partridges are clods and
                    withered stalks all the year round.” And we will add, the capercailzie is the
                    black branch of the pine. A similar scale is applicable to the seasons at which
                    these birds are hatched. Although, taking each species individually, we find the
                    earliest birds in the warmest country and on the richest land: collectively, the
                    order is reversed; the higher their location, the earlier do they arrive at
                    their full growth. The ptarmigan is ready for the table before the period at
                    which it may be legally shot, the twelfth of August. Descending the hill, we
                    find the red grouse not three parts grown at that period. A little lower, and
                    the scarcely-fledged black-cock rises almost helpless, on the twentieth of
                    August. Lower still, on the fertile plain, the young partridge does not assume
                    his grey mantle and purple crescent until long after the first of September. And
                    in the warm woods the pheasant does not don his panoply of gold until the fall
                    of the leaf.</p>
                <p>Few are the sportsmen who climb the granite cliffs, and wade the winter snows in
                    which ptarmigan delight to bury themselves. A ramble there, is a journey of
                    curiosity or observation, rather than a sporting excursion. It is a pilgrimage
                    to the loftiest Highland altitudes. The fowling-piece becomes converted into the
                    palmer’s staff; and the sportsman merges in the adventurer, the enthusiast, the
                    worshipper of Nature! <hi rend="smallcaps">(b. x.)</hi><pb break="no"
