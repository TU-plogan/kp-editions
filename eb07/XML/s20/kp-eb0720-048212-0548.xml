                <p><label type="entry">SOUND</label>. So many things relating to this subject have
                    been already treated at considerable length under the arti cle <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Acoustics</hi>, that what we now propose shall be chiefly
                    confined to the propagation of sound in the atmosphere, which, as Laplace
                    observes, affords the most important ap plication which has yet been made of the
                    theory of elastic fluids. In this we shall first give the results of the princi
                    pal attempts which have been made with the view of determining the velocity of
                    sound experimentally; and shall notice more particularly some of them which are
                    of a later date, and were made with far greater precautions than any of those
                    mentioned under the article just cited. We shall then advert to various
                    important oversights and imperfections which still attach to this department of
                    science, and to certain improvements of which it seems to be susceptible.</p>

                    xml:id="kp-eb0720-0549-0483"/> From a close examination of the twenty-eight
                    principal experiments made in Holland in 1823, Professor Miller has, in the
                    Philosophical Magazine for July 1839, deduced the following as the correct means
                    of the results. The mean interval of the time in which sound travelled 17,669·28
                    metres is 51∙9873 seconds. The mean temperature during these experiments was
                    11°∙01 cent. The mean pressures of the atmosphere, and of the vapour in it,
                    were∙74018 and ∙00889 metres at 0° cent. respectively. Now, from Rudberg’s
                    experiments (Poggendorff’s <hi rend="italic">Annalen,</hi> xli. 558 and xliv.
                    119), which perhaps require to be repeated by others, it appears that on heating
                    dry air from 0° cent. to 100°, under a constant pressure, its volume was
                    increased from 1 to 1·365; hence, at the temperature 6 cent., the pres sure of
                    the atmosphere and of the vapour in it being <hi rend="italic">p</hi> and <hi

                <p>This, owing to its depending on a smaller rate of expan sion, exceeds 1089∙5, the
                    number in the table; but it is chiefly to be regarded as a general expression
                    for the experimental results. The theoretical formula will be found farther
                    on.</p>
                <p>With the exception of Benzenberg, who had long ago used the species of clock
                    described below with a conical pendulum, the most of the experimenters were
                    formerly very ill provided with any adequate means of accurately measuring the
                    intervals of time which elapse between the flash and report of the guns, as
                    observed at the opposite station. In 1822, the French academicians employed the
                    stopwatch of Breguet and the chronograph of Ricussec, a species of watch, one of
                    whose hands revolves in one se cond, and can, without needing to stop, be made
                    to touch with its extremity the dialplate at any instant, so as to leave there a
                    dot of ink, merely by suddenly pressing a small lever. In the experiments made
                    in Holland in 1823, a clock was used with a conical pendulum which revolved
                    69∙433 times in a minute, and was supposed capable of determining intervals to
                    the 100th of a second, by suddenly arresting the index without stopping the
                    clock. By means of these machines it was supposed quite practicable to determine
                    the interval between the sight of the flash and the arrival of the report of a
                    gun, with such precision as to obviate all material error which might arise from
                    this cause. The importance of this, if realized, is evident from the
                    circumstance that each tenth of a second corresponds to 110 feet of
                    distance.</p>
                <p>But there is too good reason to suspect that all such ideas of attaining great
                    accuracy in any direct measurements of the intervals of time are perfectly
                    illusory, and that observations made with these machines can scarcely be
                    depended on within a tenth of a second. The machines themselves may be possessed
                    of all the perfection ascribed to them; but it would seem that the man has yet
                    to be made who would be competent to use them. In Holland, only one centrifugal
                    clock being employed at each station, we have no means of judging of the
                    correctness of the observations made with it. But whoever examines the tables of
                    results given in the <hi rend="italic">Connaissance des Terns</hi> for 1825
                    (pages 364—367) will find that three and as often four machines, with as many
                    first-rate observers, were generally employed simultaneously in determining the
                    interval for each shot; and that instead of their results agreeing within an
                    inconsiderable fraction, as the above ideas of great correctness would imply,
                    they often differ by three, sometimes by four, and in one case by five tenths of
                    a second. Some thing farther illustrative of this will be found under the arti
                    cle <hi rend="smallcaps">Clock and Watch Work</hi> (vol. vi. p. 783), where a ma
                    chine has been described for determining, by indirect means, but to almost any
                    degree of exactness, the interval in which sound passes over a small distance.
                    The principal part is a strong clock, without compensation or other refinement,
                    and requiring no extraordinary sort of being to observe with it.</p>
                <p>Although many eminent philosophers have laboured] much to improve and perfect the
                    various reductions which ‘ it is considered necessary to make on the
                    experimental results, there is still a mistake regarding the exact influence of
                    the wind. It seems always to be supposed that the effects of a steady wind are
                    entirely obviated or compensated by taking the mean of the velocities of such
                    sounds as are simultaneously produced at the two opposite stations, and also
                    reciprocally observed at these respectively. This is in effect the view of the
                    matter taken by Professor Moll. (Philosophical Transactions for 1824, p. 426.)
                    Many other philosophers express the same opinion, and in particular Sir John
                    Herschel, who recommends that all experiments on the velocity of sound be made,
                    if possible, either in calm weather or in a direction at right angles to that of
                    the wind. But so far is the result under this last arrangement from being
                    entirely unaffected by the wind, that the error to which we now allude is then a
                    maximum; and indeed in every case in which the direction of the wind is inclined
                    to the base line, there is still a small error, which cannot be obviated by the
                    reciprocal method.</p>
                <p>The earlier experimenters gave themselves no concern about the influence of the
                    wind; but its effect was in some degree eliminated by the arrangements adopted
                    by the French academicians in 1738, though in so imperfecta manner as to leave
                    c∙nsiderable doubt regarding the accuracy of their result. In order to clear up
                    this point, the Marquis Laplace requested the board of longitude to repeat the
                    experiments, with the precaution of exciting sounds more nearly at the same
                    instant from both ends of the base, in the expectation that the effects of the
                    wind would be there by completely obviated. The experiments were accordingly
                    repeated in June 1822, though with no greater precision in this respect than
                    that the times of firing the oppo site shots still differed about five minutes
                    from being simultaneous. In the experiments made in Holland in 1823, matters
                    were so much better arranged, that the difference in the times scarcely ever
                    amounted to a second. How ever, M. Arago has remarked, that when the wind is
                    very unsteady, or comes in sudden gusts, it may still affect the mean result,
                    especially since a sudden gust may interfere with the one sound, and yet miss
                    the other altogether. But even when the wind is perfectly steady, the reciprocal
                    method cannot be quite correct, unless the wind also blows directly from the one
                    station to the other. In every other case it is more or less inaccurate, owing
                    to the circumstance that sound is not propagated in parallel lines, but issues
                    from its source in lines which radiate or diverge to every side; so that the
                    same sonorous ray which, during a calm, would pass directly from the one station
                    to the other, will not reach the latter at all when deflected by the wind into a
                    different direction. Had our limits permitted, we should have endeavoured to
                    show that, by applying to this the well known principles of the composition of
                    forces, the mean of the velocities of tire reciprocal sounds will, owing to the
                    action of the wind, come short of the true velocity, by a quantity which will in
                    all cases be nearly expressed by — sin. <hi rend="superscript"> 8</hi> A; where
                    W is the velocity of the wind, S that of</p>
                <p>∣⅛u sound in still air, and A the angle which the direction of the wind makes
                    with the base line. This correction, though generally very small, may often be
                    several times greater than some which are usually taken into account, especially
                    that arising from the effect of the difference of latitude and of the height of
                    the place above the sea, on the force of gra vity. For such we beg to refer to
                    the Philosophical Trans<pb break="no"

                    actions for 1824, 1828, and 1830. The pendulum, how ever, seems a more certain
                    means of determining the differences in the force of gravity, than any merely
                    theoretical formula, which cannot be expected to provide for particular local
                    attractions. Besides, we suspect that during experiments on the velocity of
                    sound, attention has not always been paid to the velocity and direction of the
                    wind; and still more rarely have these been registered and published, so as to
                    afford data for applying the requisite correction.</p>
                <p>In the Reports of the British Association for 1833 and 1836, we find two able and
                    interesting articles by Professor Challis, on the mathematical theory of fluids.
                    Among other things, he treats at considerable length on the theory of sound,
                    giving an analysis and notices of various essays on that subject. But these the
                    learned professor seems, after all, never to have thoroughly examined, otherwise
                    he could not have failed to discover that, in the mathematical investigations
                    employed in several of the papers on which he has bestowed the largest share of
                    commendation, there are various fundamental errors and inconsistencies, which
                    naturally enough have led their authors into results which, independently of
                    every other consideration, are more or less erroneous, because palpably
                    incompatible with each other and with the premises from which they are
                    professedly de duced. Fallacies of the sort in question have been pointed out in
                    the Edin. Phil. Journ. (for Oct. 1826, p. 335, and July 1827, p. 153), as also
                    in various numbers of the Quarterly Journal of Science for 1829. Some of the
                    same errors have been likewise noticed, though not so early as in the
                    firstmentioned journal, by an eminent Italian philosopher, Mr Avogadro, in the
                    <hi rend="italic">Memorie dell' Academia realle della Scienze di Torino</hi>
                    (vol. xxxiii. p. 237), and also in a sepa rate tract of his. Several notable
                    instances of the like sort have been discussed and exposed in the article <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Ηυgrομεtry</hi>; but it is only one or two examples which we
                    can notice here.</p>
                <p>With the view of accounting for the excess of the actual velocity of sound over
                    that given by Newton’s formula, it was very ingeniously suggested, in a general
                    way, by the Marquis Laplace, about the beginning of the present cen tury, that,
                    in the propagation of sound, the minute rises and falls of temperature
                    occasioned by the alternate condensations and dilatations of the air, should
                    tend to augment the disturbance in the equilibrium of the pressure, and
                    consequently to accelerate the transmission of sound. He did not, however, till
                    long after, assign the form or amount of the correction for such acceleration.
                    The first attempt toward this seems to be that of Biot in 1802 <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Journal de Physique,</hi> tome 1v. p. 173). But M. Poisson both claims and
                    gets the no small credit of having very considerably anticipated Laplace in
                    giving the precise form of the correction. This he is alleged to have done in a
                    formula for the velocity of sound, communicated to the Institute as early as the
                    year 1807, and shortly after published in the <hi rend="italic">Journal de
                    I'Ecole Polytechnique</hi> (cahier xiv.), and which is meant to consist of
                    Newton’s formula multiplied by a constant factor √1+ <hi rend="italic">k</hi>.
                    But whilst it must be admitted that no one has written to better purpose on the
                    theory of sound than M. Poisson has done, there seems to be a very general
                    mistake regarding that factor. The formula is</p>
                <p>In this he defines <hi rend="italic">g</hi> to represent the force of gravity;
                    <hi rend="italic">h</hi> the height of the barometer; D the ratio of the density
                    of the air to that of mercury; <hi rend="italic">θ</hi> the temperature of the
                    air; <hi rend="italic">w</hi> the augmentation of that temperature occasioned by
                    a condensation <hi rend="italic">γ,</hi> and so small as to be considered
                    proportional to y; also <hi rend="italic">a =</hi> ∙00375 for the coefficient of
                    the dilatation of the gases. But these evidently cannot make <hi rend="italic"
                    >k</hi> constant, as the sequel requires it to be. After introducing the same
                    for mula and explanation of symbols in another memoir insert ed in <hi
                    rend="italic">Annales de Chimie</hi> for May 1823, he proceeds to show that the
                    factor 1+ .. <hi rend="superscript"> αu</hi>,, , which for greater brevity he
                    there calls simply <hi rend="italic">k,</hi> is equal to the ratio of the
                    specific heat of air under a constant pressure to its specific heat under a
                    constant volume; which would identify √ <hi rend="italic">k</hi> with the
                    above-mentioned correction given by Laplace himself, for the first time only, in
                    the same <hi rend="italic">Annales</hi> for November 1816,, and even then
                    without demonstration. But it is worthy of particular notice, that the reason
                    why the factor <hi rend="italic">k</hi> in this case comes to be a correct
                    expression for the ratio of the specific heats, is entirely owing to M.
                    Poisson’s there using <hi rend="italic">aw</hi><hi rend="italic">γ</hi> as
                    proportional, not to <hi rend="italic">w,</hi> as above defined, but to .</p>
                <p>This will be readily seen on examining the <hi rend="italic">Annales</hi> for May

                    adopted, with implicit confidence, into almost every subsequent essay on the
                    theories of heat and sound. In particular, it forms a leading feature in the
                    works of Poisson, in Professor Kelland’s Theory of Heat, and in Mr Lubbock’s
                    recent essay On the Heat of Vapours, which seems to have been hastily compiled,
                    or, at any rate, from very incongruous materials.</p>
                <p>When reviewing the first four volumes of the <hi rend="italic">Mécanique
                    Céleste,</hi> Professor Playfair expressed great doubts if there were then a
                    dozen of persons in Britain qualified to peruse them. But whatever may now be
                    the number of those who are content with merely reading the ordinary letterpress
                    of that celebrated work, it is certain that almost none give themselves the
                    trouble of thoroughly sifting the mathematical investigations, otherwise the
                    serious oversights and inconsistencies which occur in some of them would be
                    better known and appreciated, particularly the inaccuracies which pervade the
                    greater part of the long chapter devoted to the velocity of sound. Of these,
                    however, we shall here, for brevity’s sake, take only one instance, which is
                    selected, not so much on its own account, but because it unfortunately lies at
                    the foundation of many of the formulae and results with which the seventeen
                    quarto pages following it are chiefly occupied. In the passage referred to (tome
                    v. p. 127), there occurs an equation of the form</p>

                    difference between the total quantity of heat which a given mass of air may then
                    contain, and that which it contains at a temperature and pressure chosen
                    arbitrarily. Also <hi rend="italic">k</hi> is still a constant, expressing the
                    ratio of the specific heats. We here state the matter in something like the more
                    simple language and notation of M. Poisson, who, in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Annales de Chimie for</hi> August 1823, has readily deduced that equation from
                    the two leading principles employed for it by Laplace, and which alone are
                    essential to it, viz. the law of Ma riotte, and the <hi rend="italic"

                    it has been attempted to deduce the same equation from these two principles,
                    incongruously coupled with a third, but with which they are utterly
                    incompatible; and that is the needless assumption, that, under a constant pres
                    sure, the variations of absolute heat in air are proportional to those of its
                    temperature by the common scale. But so much does the resulting equation savour
                    of the incongruity of the data, that it has been accompanied with an admission
                    of its being only true in one particular state of the variables, and therefore
                    totally unfit fur integration. All this might have been allowed to pass, had it
                    not been done with the view of palming the same fatal defect upon the production
                    of Laplace and Poisson, which however is of an essentially different character.
                    For the equation which has been deduced from the two leading principles alone,
                    by the accurate and consistent method of Poisson, as abov cited, and also given
                    in the Philosophical Magazine for November 1823, neither involves the needless
                    assumption, nor has any dependence on a particular state of the variables, and
                    so is equally true in every case. Nor was it till after having legitimately
                    obtained that equation, that Poisson adopted any such assumption at all on this
                    occasion, though, as we shall presently see, he unfortunately has done so in the
                    sequel of bis memoir, and thereby introduced all manner of
                    inconsistencies.</p></note></p>
                <p>From integrating the preceding equation on general principles only, and without
                    having regard to the subject in hand, it could only be inferred that <hi

                <p>nate or arbitrary function of —. But such eminent mathematicians as Laplace and
                    Poisson, instead of being content with this general view of the matter, ought to
                    have perceived that the conditions of the question, particularly the two
                    principles just specified, and with which they had set out for the purpose of
                    finding <hi rend="italic">q</hi> in terras of <hi rend="italic">p</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">g, necessarily</hi> required <hi rend="italic">q</hi> to be of the
                    form A + B Q log·/?—Iθg∙g)&gt; where A and B are constants; because this
                    expression, independently of its being the first to present itself in the
                    integration, is the only form or function of the above general integral which
                    would be free from inconsistency or compatible with those two leading
                    principles. So far, how ever, were they from attending to or being aware of this
                    circumstance, that supposing themselves perfectly at liberty ι</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">J)IC ,</hi> to adopt any particular function of —, they made

                    been eliminated by the law of Mariotte. This form was adopted by these
                    philosophers, that it might agree, as they supposed, with the hypothesis that
                    the expansions of air under a constant pressure are proportional to the
                    corresponding increments of absolute heat. But it is easily shown that such <hi
                    rend="italic">a</hi> hypothesis is quite incompatible, not only with the two
                    leading principles, but with that very form which was on its account purposely
                    given to <hi rend="italic">q,</hi> as was first point ed out in the Edinburgh
                    Philosophical Journal (for October 1826, p. 335), and afterwards more explicitly
                    in article <hi rend="smallcaps">Hygrometry</hi> (vol. xii. p. 113), where a
                    similar question has been consistently solved by a far more simple process of
                    rea soning.</p>
                <p>The precise value of the abovementioned ratio of the specific heats is considered
                    an important element in the theory of sound. The experiments of Desormes and
                    Clement give 1·354; those of Gay Lussac and Welter, 1·3748; and those described
                    under the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Hygrometry,</hi> 1·3333; all of which
                    seem to be smaller than what would reconcile the theory with the actual velocity
                    of sound. But we shall afterwards see reason for supposing that there is still
                    another source of acceleration, which has hitherto been over looked. In the <hi
                    rend="italic">Annales de Chimie</hi> for June 1829, and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Mémoires de l’Academie</hi> (tome x. p. 147), M. Dulong treats at considerable
                    length on the specific heat of elastic fluids; and with the view of obtaining
                    the ratio in question for each of them, he assumes as demonstrated, that the
                    actual velocity of sound, in any elastic fluid whatever, has to the velocity
                    computed by Newton’s formula the subduplicate ratio of the specific heat of that
                    fluid under a constant pressure to its specific heat under a constant volume.
                    But since it is only in air that the velocity of sound can be obtained by direct
                    means, Dulong availed himself of a method previously employed by others, though
                    by no means with complete success, as is evident from the discordance of their
                    results. It consists in determining the velocity of propagation from the musical
                    note rendered by a given cylindrical tube, and from the measured distance
                    between two consecutive nodal sections or positions of minimum vibration. The
                    pitch of the note gives the number of vibrations in a given time, and
                    consequently the time of propagation over the measured interval, and therefore
                    the velocity of the sound. By following a particular process, Dulong was enabled
                    to give great precision to this method, which he practised first on atmospheric
                    air, with the view of testing the soundness of the scheme; and by many
                    successive trials he obtained a series of results, each of which, instead of
                    exceeding, fell short of the velocity determined by direct observation. On
                    finding therefore that this method failed in affording quite so great a ratio as
                    he had expected or wished, Dulong abandoned it altogether, and finally adopted
                    1∙421 as the ratio for air. This he obtained merely from taking the mean of a
                    great number of the direct experiments which have been made on the velocity of
                    sound in the open atmosphere, though it is usually quoted by others as the
                    result of Dulong’s own experiments with the musical notes from tubes. The same
                    empirical mode of determining the ratio, which, however, does nothing for
                    clearing up the theory, has been prosecuted still more closely by Dr Simons, in
                    the Philosophical Transactions for 1830. When the number thus obtained is
                    substituted in the formula, it certainly answers admirably; and no wonder, for
                    it is just obtained by reasoning in a circle, which is fit to reconcile every
                    sort of discordance.</p>
                <p>There can be no question that great ingenuity and superior analytical skill have
                    frequently been displayed in theoretically investigating the velocity of sound;
                    but an important oversight, and which probably is the principal source of the
                    remaining discrepancy between the observed and the theoretical velocities, seems
                    to attach to all the researches of this kind with which we are acquainted, in
                    that they are conducted upon two assumptions which are so very incompatible with
                    each other that both cannot be true, if indeed any of them is strictly so. In
                    the first place, it is assumed that the particles of the air, at least during a
                    calm, vibrate accurately in the direction in which the sound is propagated.
                    Secondly, that the air, during these vibrations, preserves or acts strictly in
                    its fluid character. That the investigations involve the first of these
                    assumptions, is what no one will for a moment dispute; and that they also
                    proceed upon the second, is evident from the circumstance that the pressure of
                    the air in such researches is always taken as<pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:chi.28490924&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=552" xml:id="kp-eb0720-0552-0486"/>
                    strictly proportional to some particular power of the density, viz. either to
                    the simple density, as was done by Newton, or to some higher power of it, as was
                    in effect done by Laplace and his followers. Now, such proportionality of the
                    fluid pressure to any uniform power of the density, would obviously require the
                    particles constantly to observe the same uniform arrangement during their
                    vibrations, so as to have the like distances between the adjacent particles of
                    any small portion of the air everywhere to vary inversely as the cube root of
                    the density, with, perhaps, the mere exception of as much difference of
                    arrangement as is unavoidably due to the density being different in different
                    parts of a wave of air. But it is easy to see that the two assumptions are so
                    inconsistent that only the one of them could be strictly true; because
                    vibrations performed accurately in the direction of the sound necessarily imply
                    that (abstracting from the very insignificant change of distance due to the
                    sound’s being propagated in lines which are slightly diverging, because
                    radiating from the source of sound) the distances of the particles of the air,
                    estimated perpendicularly to the direction of the sound, would not be altered by
                    or during these vibrations; and consequently that the density of any minute
                    volume of the air, instead of varying alike in all its three dimensions, would
                    vary in only one of them, namely, in the direction alone in which the sound is
                    propagated through it.</p>
                <p>But, independently of the incompatibility of the two as sumptions, the extreme
                    rapidity or short duration of the vibrations, whilst it gives some probability
                    to the first, throws as much doubt on the second. Nay, any thing like a strict
                    fulfilment of the second assumption seems, on this and various other accounts,
                    to be extremely improbable, particularly because, in order to preserve a uniform
                    arrangement, it would require the most of the particles, notwithstanding the
                    rapidity of their vibrations, to describe lines deviating <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >so</hi> much and in all manner of ways from the direction in which a clear
                    sound is understood to be propagated, that, granting such interwoven vibrations
                    to be possible, they could be expected to produce nothing but a very confused
                    noise. Nor is it easy to conceive how, on that supposition, two different sounds
                    could ever cross each other’s paths without seriously interfering, which does
                    not appear to be the fact. On the other hand, if we may not strictly adhere to
                    the first assumption, yet, by taking a mean between the two, it would follow
                    that the increase of the repulsion due to condensation, and the diminution of it
                    due to dilatation, being both of them principally if not entirely confined to
                    the direction of the sound, they would both be so much the greater in that
                    direction; and by thus constituting an increased disturbance in the equilibrium
                    of the repulsion reckoned in that same direction, they would have a precisely
                    similar effect on the result, as if the pressure of the air in its otherwise
                    supposed strictly fluid character had followed the ratio of a higher power of
                    the density than it really does. Now, such an effect would obviously tend to
                    shorten the duration of the vibrations, or to increase the theoretical velocity
                    of sound, which is just the thing required in order to make it agree with
                    observation.</p>
                <p>The preceding remarks become far more striking with respect to the attempt which
                    Poisson has always been considered to have made successfully (<hi rend="italic"
                    >Journal Polytechnique,</hi> tome vii. p. 364), to show that the velocity of
                    sound would still be the same, although the vibrations were considerable, and
                    confined to a single straight line.</p>
                <p>Doubts have been started if the air really consists of par ticles, and whether it
                    may not rather have some undefinable constitution; but such vague considerations
                    cannot materially alter the case, whilst there can be no question that the air,
                    like all other matter, has inertia when at rest, and momentum when in motion;
                    and also that as long as it is considered to preserve or act strictly in its
                    fluid character, the matter of which any minute volume of it consists must be
                    uniformly distributed. For it is upon properties essentially the same with these
                    that the above remarks are founded. <hi rend="smallcaps">(e. ε. ε.)</hi><hi

                    principal part of an organ, and that which makes the whole machine play. It is a
                    reservoir, into which the wind, drawn in by the bellows, is conducted by a
                    portvent, and thence distributed into the pipes placed over the holes of its
                    upper part. The wind enters them by valves, which open by pressing on the keys,
                    after the registers are drawn, by which the air is prevented from passing into
                    any of the other pipes besides those in which it is required.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic smallcaps"> Sound</hi><hi rend="italic">Board</hi> also denotes
                    a thin broad board placed over the head of a public speaker, to enlarge or
                    extend and strengthen his voice. Soundboards are found by experience to be of no
                    use in theatres, as their distance from the speaker is too great to be impressed
                    with sufficient force. But soundboards over a pulpit have frequently a good
                    effect, when the case is constructed of a proper thickness, and according to
                    particular principles.</p>
