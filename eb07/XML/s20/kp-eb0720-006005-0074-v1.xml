                <p><label type="entry">SEBASTIAN</label>, Sτ, a considerable and strongly fortified
                    city of Spain, the capital of the province of Guipuscoa. It is built on a tongue
                    of land projecting into the sea. The north point of the mountain Orgullo, being
                    the high land of St Sebastian, is about three miles to the west of Port Passage,
                    on which is built the castle of Mota, which serves as a guide on one side, as
                    the light-house does on the other entrance to the bay, which is a very narrow
                    strait, not admitting through it more than two vessels at a time; but the bay,
                    when entered, is secure for vessels furnished with good ground-tackle, which
                    sunken rocks make very necessary.</p>
                <p>For the protection of vessels trading with the town, there are piers, within
                    which ships of 300 tons may enter at low water; but when the tide is out they
                    lie dry on a hard bottom.</p>
                <p>The city is defended by strong works on the land side, and has only two gates. St
                    Sebastian is better built than most Spanish towns, the streets being wide,
                    straight, and well paved. The houses, also, are large and well built. The town
                    contains, besides warehouses, about 700 houses, three parish churches, five
                    monasteries, a hospital, and about 12,000 or 13,000 inhabitants. The plaza, or
                    square, is a very fine object.</p>
                <p>This place was the seat of the Guipuscoa Society, one of the largest trading
                    associations in Spain, which formed a junction with the Manilla Company; and
                    these had almost a monopoly of the trade with Caraccas in the western colonies
                    of Spain, and with the Philippine Islands in the East Indies. It was then a port
                    of vast commercial importance, having, besides those branches, a considerable
                    share <hi rend="italic">of</hi> the export trade of wool. At that period there
                    were large establishments for making ropes and cables, many anchor-smiths and
                    nail-smiths, and such other occupations as are connected with the equipment of
                    ships; but political circumstances have changed and much diminished the commerce
                    of this place.</p>
                <p>The important position of this place has drawn upon it much of the calamity of
                    war. In former times it had been frequently besieged and occupied by opposing
                    parties. It was treacherously seized by the French in 1808, and was occupied by
                    them till 1813. When the battle of Vittoria had been gained by the Duke of
                    Wellington on the 21st of June, a way was opened for the British army to attack
                    this city, into which the French had thrown a powerful garrison, who defended it
                    with great bravery and skill. The British army invested the place, and attempted
                    to storm it on the 25th July; but having been repulsed, they besieged it in
                    regιdar form, and with the loss of many lives it was stormed and carried on the
                    31st of August. During the assault the town was set on fire and nearly
                    destroyed; and a scene of misery was exhibited to the unfortunate people, in the
                    rage of the storming soldiery, as well as in the progress of the flames, which
                    will long be recollected with horror by the wτetched sufferers. The city was,
                    however, speedily rebuilt, and commerce gradually returned. The civil war in
                    some measure centred here, it being the chief point by which the queen’s party
                    received their supply of warlike stores from England. Its trade has, however,
                    received a most disastrous check. The castle of Mota is in lat. 43. 19. N., and
                    long. 1. 59. W.</p>
