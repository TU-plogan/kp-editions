                <p><label type="entry">SENSIBILITY</label> is a nice and delicate perception of
                    pleasure or pain, beauty or deformity. It is very nearly allied to taste, and,
                    as far as it is natural, seems to depend upon the organization of the nervous
                    system. It is capable, however, of cultivation, and is experienced in a much
                    higher degree in civilized than in savage nations, and among persons liberally
                    educated than among boors and illiterate mechanics. The man who has cultivated
                    any of the fine arts has a much quicker and more exquisite perception of beauty
                    and deformity in the execution of that art, than another of equal or even
                    greater natural powers, who has but casually inspected its productions. He who
                    has been long accustomed to that decorum of manners which characterizes the
                    polite part of the world, perceives almost instantaneously the smallest
                    deviation from it, and feels himself almost as much hurt by behaviour harmless
                    in itself as by the grossest rudeness; and the man who has long proceeded
                    steadily in the paths of virtue, and often painted to himself the deformity of
                    vice, and the miseries of which it is productive, is more quickly alarmed at any
                    deviation from rectitude than another who, though his life has been stained by
                    no crime, has yet thought less upon the principles of virtue and consequences of
                    vice.<pb break="no" facs="ht:chi.28490924&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=114"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0720-0114-0100"/> Every thing which can be called sensibility, and
                    is not bom with man, may be resolved into association, and is to be regulated
                    accordingly; for sensibilities may be acquired which are inimical to happiness
                    and to the practice of virtue. The man is not to be envied who has so accustomed
                    himself to the forms of polite address as to be hurt by the unaffected language
                    and manners of the honest peasant with whom he may have occasion to transact
                    business; nor is he likely to acquire much useful knowledge, who has so
                    sedulously studied the beauties of composition, as to be unable to read without
                    disgust a book of science or of history, of which the style comes not up to his
                    standard of perfection. That sensibility which we either have from nature, or
                    necessarily acquire, of the miseries of others, is of the greatest use when
                    properly regulated, as it powerfully impels us to relieve their distress; but if
                    it by any means become so exquisite as to make us shun the sight of misery, it
                    counteracts the end for which it was implanted in our nature, and only deprives
                    us of happiness, while it contributes nothing to the good of others. Indeed
                    there is reason to believe that all such extreme sensibilities are selfish
                    affectations, employed as apologies for withholding from the miserable that
                    relief which it is in our power to give; for there is not a fact better
                    established in the science of human nature, than that passive perceptions grow
                    gradually weaker by repetition, while active habits daily acquire additional
                    strength.</p>
                <p>It is of great importance to a literary man to cultivate his taste, because it is
                    the source of much elegant and refined pleasure; but there is a degree of
                    fastidiousness which renders that pleasure impossible to be obtained, and is the
                    certain indication of expiring letters. It is necessary to submit to the
                    artificial rules of politeness, for they tend to promote the peace and harmony
                    of society, and are sometimes a useful substitute for moral virtue; but he who
                    with respect to them has so much sensibility as to be disgusted with all whose
                    manners are not equally polished with his own, is a very troublesome member of
                    society. It is every man’s duty to cultivate his moral sensibilities so as to
                    make them subservient to the purposes for which they were given to him; but if
                    he either feel, or pretend to feel, the miseries of others to so exquisite a
                    degree as to be unable to afford them the relief which they have a right to
                    expect, his sensibilities are of no good tendency.</p>
                <p>That the man of true sensibility has more pains and more pleasures than the
                    callous wretch, is universally admitted, as well as that his enjoyments and
                    sufferings are more exquisite in their kinds; and as no man lives for himself
                    alone, no man will acknowledge his want of sensibility, or express a wish that
                    his heart were callous. It is, however, a matter of some moment to distinguish
                    real sensibilities from ridiculous affectations, those which tend to increase
                    the sum of human happiness from such as have a contrary tendency; and to
                    cultivate them all in such a manner as to make them answer the ends for which
                    they were implanted in us by the beneficent Author of nature. This can be done
                    only by watching over them as over other associations (see <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Metaphysics)</hi>; for excessive sensibility, as it is not the gift of nature,
                    is the bane of human happiness. “Too much tenderness,” as Rousseau well
                    observes, “proves the bitterest curse instead of the most fruitful blessing;
                    vexation and disappointment are its certain consequences. The temperature of the
                    air, the change of the seasons, the brilliancy of the sun, or thickness of the
                    fogs, are so many moving springs to the unhappy possessor, and he becomes the
                    wanton sport of their arbitration.”</p>
