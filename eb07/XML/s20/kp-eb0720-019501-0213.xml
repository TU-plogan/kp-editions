                <p><label type="entry">SHEFFIELD</label>, an ancient, large, and flourishing
                    markettown in the west riding of the county of York, 160 miles north-north-west
                    from London. It derives its name from the river Sheaf, which here flows into the
                    Don. These rivers descend from the boldly swelling hills west of the town, and
                    form, with their mountain-tributaries, interesting features in that beautiful
                    scenery for which the neighbourhood has always been noted. The town itself,
                    which used formerly to be described as built upon a gentle hill, rising within
                    an ample valley, has long since stretched over the ascending slopes on every
                    side of its original site, particularly to the west, which is a large suburb of
                    beautiful villas. The inequalities of the ground have not been compensated,
                    either by the regularity of the streets, or by any thing like uniformity in the
                    buildings. The town has been said to be black; and certainly the smoke emitted
                    from upwards of one hundred steam-engine chimneys, and ten times that number of
                    forges, workshops, &amp;c., to say nothing of what issues from so many
                    dwellings, in a place where coal is cheap, does occasionally form a considerable
                    cloud; but the houses are not more dingy, and the streets generally much
                    cleaner, than in other manufacturing towns of the same size. Few persons have
                    approached the town in any direction, without being struck with the beauty of
                    the surrounding neighbourhood, resembling, in many respects, the varied
                    character of a nobleman’s park; and it would be difficult to find a single
                    street from which a glimpse of the landscape cannot be obtained. Many of the
                    neighbouring villas are built of a light-coloured stone, while those in the town
                    are mostly of a dark-red brick. A great proportion of the latter, particularly
                    in the newer streets, are small, being the residences of the artisans and
                    working classes generally, almost every family living in a separate dwelling.
                    This independent occupancy, added to the fact that in few cases are the labours
                    of the workmen carried on at home, bespeaks a degree of comfort and cleanliness
                    scarcely to be looked for in buildings where a single room serves at once as the
                    workshop of the industrious man and the residence of his family.</p>
                <p>Sheffield is the modern capital of a somewhat undefined district, which for ages
                    has been called Hallamshire, the present Hallam, a hamlet west of the town,
                    having been considered the site of the ancient capital, where stood the <hi
                    rend="italic">aula,</hi> or chief residence of the Saxon lord.</p>
                <p>Since the sixteenth century, the records of the place show a singularly rapid
                    increase of the population. In 1615 the town contained 2207 souls, in 1755 this
                    number was multiplied sixfold, in 1796 the census was 29,013, in 1821 the
                    population of the entire parish of Sheffield was 65,275, and in 1831 the
                    inhabitants wore 91,692; at present they are estimated at 110,000. Of these,
                    about 96,000 may be said to reside in the town and suburbs, the remainder in the
                    out townships. A proportionate increase has taken place in the number of houses.
                    These in 1831 were stated to be 19,700; they are now 25,000.</p>
                <p>Sheffield has no municipal head, no stipendiary magistrate, or other paramount
                    local governor. Some of the west-riding magistrates, generally those nearest,
                    for none of them reside within the township, sit in the town-hall twice a week
                    for the current disposal of offenders and other business. In the same building
                    is held the manor court for the recovery of small debts; and here too are the
                    offices of a night and day police. An attempt was made in 1838 to obtain a
                    corporation, in conformity with the recent act of parliament; but a great
                    majority of the inhabitants opposing the design, it was abandoned.</p>
                <p>The vicinity of Sheffield abounds with the natural elements of prosperity; and of
                    these the inhabitants were prompt to avail themselves, long before the means of
                    a perfect intercommunication throughout the country had generalized these
                    advantages. On every side of the town coal has been got, and actually within the
                    town itself, the seams, although wrought for centuries, appearing in some places
                    almost inexhaustible. With the coal is found ironstone, which is smelted in the
                    neighbourhood; while clay, slate, and sandstone are abundant, and of excellent
                    quality. A navigable canal, opened in 1819, completed a water-communication
                    between Sheffield and the German Ocean; and in 1838, a railway to Rotherham (six
                    miles) was finished. The line of a railway between Sheffield and Winchester is
                    in progress, including a tunnel of three miles under the English Apennines. The
                    number and rapid descent of the streams west of the town afford innumerable
                    waterfalls, on which grinding establishments have been built, and in which,
                    previous to the introduction of steam power, all the edgetools and cutlery made
                    in the district were ground and polished.</p>
                <p>Sheffield has long been celebrated, not only throughout Great Britain, but all
                    over the world, for its cutlery manufactures. The origin of this celebrity dates
                    as far back as the reign of Edward III., when “Sheffield whittles,” as certain
                    common kinds of knives were then and afterwards called, appear to have been in
                    repute. As early as the middle of the sixteenth century, the staple trade was
                    fostered by the feudal lords of Hallamshire, there being still extant the
                    various “acts and ordinances agreed upon by the whole fellowship of cutlers, and
                    by the assent of George earl of Shrewsbury.” About a century afterwards, when,
                    in consequence of the growing reputation of the various articles manufactured at
                    Sheffield, and the insufficiency of the manor court to restrain the making and
                    vending of spurious wares, the credit of the trade was likely to be endangered,
                    an act of parliament was obtained, by which, under certain regulations, the
                    cutlers of Sheffield were constituted a body corporate. This important act,
                    which bears date April 1624, was designed “for the good order and government of
                    the makers of knives, sickles, shears, scissors, and other cutlery wares in
                    Hallamshire, in the county of York, and parts adjoining ;" the latter words
                    having reference to a part of Derbyshire immediately south of Sheffield, where
                    vast quantities of scythes and sickles have been made ever since the reign of
                    Elizabeth.</p>
                <p>The Cutlers’ Company consisted of a master elected annually, two warders, six
                    searchers, twenty-four assistants, and the commonalty. Their duties were
                    generally to register apprentices, grant corporate marks to be struck on the
                    wares of the members, and by other means to maintain the integrity of the staple
                    trades. This corporation continued in force, with a slight modification, until
                    the year 1814, when, by an act (54th Geo. III.), the local manufac-<pb
                    break="no" facs="ht:chi.28490924&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=214"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0720-0214-0196"/> tures of Sheffield were placed on an entirely new
                    footing; the liberty of engaging in any of the heretofore incorporated trades,
                    either as masters or journeymen, being extended indifferently to all persons,
                    whether freemen or strangers. The act which thus abolished the old corporation
                    influence and jurisdiction still perpetuated its formal continuance, with power
                    to grant marks, <hi rend="italic">&amp;c.,</hi> the “master-cutler” being also
                    the returning officer in the election of the two members of parliament for the
                    borough of Sheffield, under the reform act. The corporation have a very handsome
                    hall in Church Street.</p>
                <p>Although the throwing open the old corporate trades to unrestrained competition
                    had a considerable effect in multiplying manufacturers, yet the peculiar nature
                    of the handicrafts generally limited in some degree the changes which, under
                    other circumstances, might have resulted from the sudden rush of capital into a
                    new channel. In the first place, a workmanlike expertness in any branch of
                    cutlery cannot be acquired without a considerable period of probation. In the
                    second place, the application of machinery could only be applied, except in the
                    department of grinding, to a very limited extent; and, with this exception,
                    manual labour can hardly be said to be superseded, but rather assisted, by water
                    or steam power. There are other circumstances which have operated in the same
                    direction, especially the division of labour in the production of a single
                    article, which has given the artisans in one branch a control over the others.
                    This has led the workmen generally to act in concert in all questions touching
                    their respective departments of labour, as wages, apprentices, engagements with
                    masters, &amp;c. To maintain what they have considered their rights, or at least
                    their interests, recourse has been had to various compacts formed under the
                    designation of “Trades’ Unions,” frequently exhibiting all the melancholy
                    results of illegal combinations. Nor has the mischief of these confederations
                    been confined to portentous “strikes,” contests between the masters and the
                    journeymen; but nonjuring or suspected individuals among the latter have
                    sometimes become victims to the vigilance and the vengeance of their banded
                    fellows. What has been the entire effect of this system upon the trade of the
                    town generally, and upon the present condition of the parties, it is not very
                    easy to say. It may have kept up wages, but it has more certainly broken down
                    that good understanding which formerly existed between masters and workmen, and
                    driven numerous customers to foreign markets. The number of persons employed in
                    the cutlery workshops is about 10,000.</p>
                <p>About 700 tons of Swedish iron are annually landed at the canal wharf, which are
                    converted in the town into the steel which is used in the manufacture of knives,
                    scissors, razors, files, saws, axes, and various other cutting instruments. Of
                    this really “precious metal,” however, the greater part is exported to the
                    United States in the form of tilted <hi rend="italic">cast steel;</hi> that is,
                    steel which, after carbonization in the original bars, is broken up and melted
                    in a crucible, afterwards cast into a mould, and then reduced at the forges into
                    rods of such sizes as the trade requires. Besides, three or four thousand tons
                    of British iron are annually brought into the town, and some portion of it
                    converted into steel for inferior purposes. There are several large
                    establishments for the manufacture of the finer kinds of stoves, grates, and
                    fenders. These articles are often executed in the most superb style, modellers
                    and other artists being constantly employed in devising new patterns.</p>
                <p>About a century ago, the art of plating upon copper with silver was discovered in
                    Sheffield; and thus originated a trade of immense importance to the town. For
                    many years past the quantity of wares executed in this beautiful and
                    comparatively cheap material has been very great, including particularly urns,
                    salvers, dishes, epergnes, candelabras, and indeed almost every article which
                    had formerly been made of silver. The silver-plating establishments are among
                    the most respectable in the town; their interests have also been the least
                    fluctuating. These circumstances are due mainly to the fact, that in works of
                    this kind a large capital must be sunk in stamps, dies, and other tools; added
                    to which is the expense of creating new designs, and involving the consideration
                    of taste as well as cost. Sheffield plate, for richness of design, the strength
                    of its more precious material, and for excellence of workmanship, is everywhere
                    in high estimation.</p>
                <p>Manufactures in Britannia metal, which are likewise indigenous to the town, are
                    carried on to a great extent, and to a singular degree of perfection. Nearly
                    every one of the articles made in silver-plate are elegantly imitated in this
                    cheap material; with the addition of vast quantities of spoons, which are first
                    cast in metal moulds, and afterwards polished by brushing.</p>
                <p>Latterly both the foregoing lucrative branches of trade have encountered some
                    competition from the use of what has been terme&lt;l German silver, a kind of
                    brass, which combines the colour, lustre, and durability of silver, at a cost
                    not greatly above that of manufactured copper.</p>
                <p>Here are two or three large establishments for the manufacture of optical
                    instruments, including especially curious works for the grinding of
                    spectacle-glasses, the greater part of the trade throughout the country being
                    supplied from Sheffield. Several of the manufacturers have show-rooms on their
                    premises for the display of their brilliant wares, which are celebrated for the
                    variety and beauty of the cutlery-goods which they contain; and visiters may
                    here witness the various operations carried on in the workshops.</p>
                <p>The town of Sheffield, in every branch of its productive industry, not only
                    carries on a considerable home trade, but its leading wares find a market in
                    every quarter of the globe. It is, however, to the United States of America that
                    the largest and most constant consignments are made; and hence Sheffield
                    participates very largely in every fluctuation which affects Transatlantic
                    mercantile interests.</p>
                <p>The inhabitants of Sheffield are largely provided with places for the promotion
                    of religion, education, philanthropy, and intelligence. There are in the parish
                    twelve churches, seven in the town and five in the rural townships, containing
                    in all 15,160 sittings. Holy Trinity, or the parish church, is a noble Gothic
                    structure, enclosing a parallelogram 240 feet in length by 130 feet in width.
                    From near the centre rises a tower, containing ten very well-tuned bells, and
                    surmounted by a lofty spire of handsome proportions. That part of the church now
                    used for divine service was, in 1800, rebuilt from the foundation, and the
                    interior fitted up in a solid, handsome, and commodious manner, so that the
                    chancel alone presents any traces of antiquity.</p>
                <p>The living is a vicarage, two parties presenting in turn, as representatives of
                    the original grantees of the advowson in 1544. Independently of the vicarial
                    patronage, three assistant ministers are appointed and maintained by the church
                    burgesses.</p>
                <p>In addition to the churches and chapels of the establishment, the Methodists,
                    Independents, Baptists, Quakers, and Roman Catholics, have respectively large,
                    handsome, and commodious places of worship, in the whole not fewer than twenty.
                    Of these, six belong to the Wesleyans, and include some of the largest and most
                    ornamental chapels in the connection.</p>
                <p>Here is an old endowed grammar-school; a collegiate school, recently built by
                    shareholders, at an expense of L.3000; and two charity schools, one for sixty
                    boys, and the other for sixty girls, all conducted in conformity with the
                    principles of the Church of England. The Wesleyan Methodists have just erected,
                    outside the town, and at a cost of about L. 15,000, a splendid proprietary
                    school, ca-<pb break="no" facs="ht:chi.28490924&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=215"

                    boys. Besides these establishments, all the religious denominations have
                    week-day and Sunday schools in different parts of the town. A literary and
                    philosophical society was instituted in 1822; they have a museum in the
                    music-hall, containing handsome cabinets of fossils, minerals, objects of
                    natural history, apparatus, &amp;c. and a capital full-length portrait of the
                    poet Montgomery, who has long been regarded as one of the chief ornaments of the
                    town.</p>
                <p>There is a large theatre, erected in 1762; and under the same roof a commodious
                    assembly-room; and adjacent, the music-hall, in which concerts and public
                    lectures are usually delivered. A short distance outside the town, on the west,
                    are the botanical gardens, comprising a well-enclosed plot of eighteen acres of
                    ground, laid out in a style of elegance, and commanding an extensive prospect.
                    The glazed conservatories present a frontage of 300 feet. On the opposite slope
                    is a beautiful cemetery.</p>
                <p>The general infirmary, which was opened in 1797 for “the sick and lame poor of
                    any nation,” is a large and handsome edifice, on the north-west side of the
                    town. A subscription of L.5000 has just been raised for the purpose of adding a
                    fever-hospital to this noble institution. Sheffield has also a medical and
                    anatomical school, a public dispensary, and a capital bath establishment. On a
                    fine eminence, just outside the town, stands the Shrewsbury Hospital, a charity
                    founded in 1673, and consisting of neat houses for eighteen men and eighteen
                    women, the former receiving ten and the latter eight shillings a week, besides
                    coals, coats, &amp;c. Holliss’s Hospital, in the town, contains sixteen houses
                    for poor cotters’ widows, who have each seven shillings a week. There are
                    various other smaller charities.</p>
                <p>From the earliest period of authentic history, the Lovetots, Furnivals, Talbots,
                    and Howards, names of stirring interest in English annals, were successively
                    chiefs of Hallamshire, the present Duke of Norfolk being lord of the manor of
                    Sheffield. With the transactions of these illustrious families, the older
                    records of their ample domain and its industrious inhabitants are so intimately
                    mixed up, that it is hardly possible to give any history of the one without
                    involving details concerning the other. One circumstance especially has given a
                    universality of interest to this association, namely, the committal of the
                    unfortunate Mary Queen of Scots to the custody of George the sixth earl of
                    Shrewsbury, and the fact that she spent the greater part of fourteen years of
                    her troubled life at Sheffield. The residence of the royal prisoner here was
                    chiefly at the castle, a place of strength, formerly standing at the confluence
                    of the rivers Sheaf and Don, at the northern angle of the town, but which was so
                    utterly demolished after the civil wars, that its situation is at present only
                    indicated by the historian, or by the ineffaceable names of adjacent localities.
                    The Talbots had likewise a summer residence, called the “Manour,” built on a
                    fine eminence in the ancient “Lark,” a mile east of the town: of this residence
                    a shattered and far-conspicuous fragment remains. And here, too, the ill-fated
                    Mary occasionally resided during her captivity; and the spot is often visited by
                    curious or sympathizing individuals on that account. An enthusiastic admirer and
                    apologist of Mary, Samuel Roberts, Esq. has recently erected, at an expense of
                    several thousand pounds, and in a beautiful situation, in Sheffield Lark, a
                    small castlc, of the most exquisite architecture, which he calls “Queen’s
                    Tower.”</p>
                <p>The inhabitants of Sheffield are indebted for an elegant and most elaborate
                    history of the ancient and modern state of their town and neighbourhood, to the
                    Reverend Joseph Hunter, a native of the place, who, in 1819, published his
                    “Hallamshire," in one volume folio.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sheffield,</hi><hi rend="italic">John,</hi> Duke of
                    Buckinghamshire, an eminent writer of the seventeenth and eighteenth century, of
                    great personal bravery, and an able minister of state, was born about 1650. He
                    lost his father at nine years of age; and his mother having married Lord
                    Ossulston, the care of his education was left entirely to a governor, who did
                    not greatly improve him in his studies. Finding that he was deficient in many
                    parts of literature, he resolved to devote a certain number of hours every day
                    to his studies; and thereby improved himself to the degree of learning which he
                    afterwards attained. Though possessed of a good estate, he did not abandon
                    himself to pleasure and indolence, but entered as a volunteer in the second
                    Dutch war, and was in that famous naval engagement where the Duke of York
                    commanded as admiral; upon which occasion his lordship behaved so gallantly,
                    that he was appointed commander of the Royal Catharine. He afterwards made a
                    campaign in the French service under M. de Turenne. As Tangier was in danger of
                    being taken by the Moors, he offered to head the forces which were sent to
                    defend it, and accordingly was appointed to command them. He was then Earl of
                    Mulgrave, and one of the lords of the bed-chamber to Charles II. The Moors
                    retired on the approach of his majesty’s forces; and the result of the
                    expedition was the blowing up of Tangier. He continued in several great posts
                    during the short reign of James II. till that unfortunate prince was dethroned.
                    Lord Mulgrave, though he paid his respects to King William before he was
                    advanced to the throne, yet did not accept of any post in the government until
                    some years afterwards. In the sixth year of William and Mary he was created
                    Marquis of Normanby in the county of Lincoln. He was one of the most active and
                    zealous opponents of the bill which took away Sir John Fenwick’s life; and
                    exerted the utmost vigour in carrying through the Treason Bill, and the bill for
                    Triennial Parliaments. He enjoyed some considerable posts under King William,
                    and possessed much of his favour and confidence. In 1702 he was sworn lord
                    privy-seal; and in the same year was appointed one of the commissioners to treat
                    of an union between England and Scotland. In 1703 he was created Duke of
                    Normanby, and soon after Duke of Buckinghamshire. In 1711 he was made steward of
                    her majesty’s household, and president of the council. During Queen Anne’s reign
                    he was but once out of employment; and then he voluntarily resigned, being
                    attached to what were called the Tory Principles. Her majesty offered to make
                    him lord chancellor, but he declined the office. He was instrumental in the
                    change of the ministry in 1710. A circumstance that reflects the highest honour
                    on him, is the vigour with which he acted in favour of the unhappy Catalans, who
                    were afterwards so inhumanly sacrificed. He was survived by only one legitimate
                    son, who died at Rome in 1735; but he left several natural children. He died in
                    1721. He was admired by the poets of his age; by Dryden, Prior, and Garth. His
                    Essay on Poetry was applauded by Addison, and his Rehearsal is still read with
                    pleasure. His writings were splendidly printed in 1723, in two volumes 4to, and
                    have since been reprinted in 1729, in two volumes 8vo. The first contains his
                    poems on various subjects; the second, his prose works, consisting of historical
                    memoirs, speeches in parliament, characters, dialogues, critical observations,
                    essays, and letters. It may be proper to observe, that the edition of 1729 is
                    castrated; some particulars relating to the revolution having given offence.</p>
