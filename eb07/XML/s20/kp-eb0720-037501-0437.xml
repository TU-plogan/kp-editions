                    significant corrections to the OCR text, predominantly in cases of confusing "c"
                    and "e." Isolates 90 entries that were mistakenly included at the end of prior
                    entries in v1 and v2. Normalizes ordinal numbers. Separates metadata in
                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra
                    space around the <gi>pb</gi> tag. Where a word is hyphenated at a <gi>pb</gi>,

                    article <hi rend="smallcaps">Bridge.</hi> Till lately, any other form of arch
                    was rarely to be met with. But there are cases of frequent occurrence, in which
                    various sorts of passages and courses necessarily cross each other obliquely, as
                    well as on different levels;<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Indeed to avoid interruptions and accidents, it is always
                    desirable that any crossings with a railway should take place on different

                    of moveable bridges, be crossed closely above by any sort of road, and in fact
                    can only be crossed quite on the same level by some water course; not to say any
                    thing of fording or wading through them.</p></note> and where, on account of the
                    difficulty or impossibility of constructing a square bridge, which should both
                    have sufficient strength, and, at the same time, leave the lower passage quite
                    clear, a different form of arch, placed obliquely to the abutments, and yet
                    exerting its thrust in the direction of the upper passage, is almost the only
                    practicable alternative. Such a structure is called a <hi rend="italic"
                    >shew</hi> bridge, and is very frequently required since the more general
                    introduction of railways, in which it is of great consequence to preserve as
                    direct or straight a line as possible. Nay, it is not uncommon for a railway to
                    have to traverse districts in which it may neither be allowable nor practicable
                    to use any means of avoiding the obliquity with which it may have to cross
                    canals, roads, &amp;c.; its course being so much controlled by conflicting
                    interests, and by the natural features of the country.</p>
                <p>If a common square bridge were to be employed in the circumstances just supposed,
                    namely, in which the passages mutually intersecting obliquely, cannot be so
                    diverted as to cross at right angles, then the arch must either be built
                    stretching in the direction of the upper passage, and of sufficient span to
                    allow the lower passage, with its course unaltered, to pass uninterruptedly
                    under it; or, it must be built stretching at right angles to the lower passage,
                    and having its embankments and abutments so much extended, that the whole
                    structure may both stand securely, and furnish sufficient area above for the
                    upper passage to continue its oblique course over it unaltered. An arch
                    partaking of both these forms might, it is true, be employed; but to such
                    expedients, a proper skew bridge is in general greatly preferable, and is indeed
                    sometimes the only allowable form of construction that will serve the purpose
                    required. As for any alteration in the old courses, they would often be
                    incompatible with the particular or vested rights of proprietors, and especially
                    with the provisions which are generally inserted in the acts of Parliament
                    expressly prohibiting any alteration to be made in the original courses of
                    canals, &amp;c.; and even were there no such restrictions, the diversion of the
                    courses might be attended with great expense, and might occasion much
                    inconvenience to the traffic. The wide or broad arch again, is a most
                    unscientific mode of overcoming the difficulty. Room for it, with the requisite
                    embankments, could not always be had, and it would, besides, great<pb break="no"

                    ly increase the expense, owing to the necessity of constructing a bridge of much
                    larger dimensions than would be required were a proper oblique arch introduced,
                    which, from its exerting its thrust in the most advantageous direction, is
                    stronger than any other of the same magnitude. For, besides endeavouring to
                    preserve a certain degree of equilibrium amongst the several parts of an
                    arch,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The mode of
                    attaining an equilibrium in an oblique arch, is a subject on which no one, so
                    far as we know, bas entered. It seems generally to be taken for granted, that
                    the obliquity makes no difference; but though in this we cannot acquiesce, our
                    limits will not admit of attempting to discuss the question</p></note> it is
                    considered still more necessary to the insuring the greatest strength,
                    especially where the span is considerable, and the upper passage narrow, that
                    the beds of the courses of the stones should be everywhere at right angles, both
                    to the soffit or under surface of the arch, and also to every vertical plane
                    running in the direction of the road or other passage carried over the bridge.
                    There is no difficulty in fulfilling or combining these conditions in a square
                    bridge, but it is very different with the oblique sort.</p>
                <p>Writers on the theory of bridges for the most part say nothing of the oblique
                    arch; and the few who do mention it, generally content themselves with slurring
                    it over in such brief, vague, or general terms, as to he nearly unintelligible.
                    Those again who have professedly drawn up, what they reckon practical rules for
                    workmen, have, for the most part, tacitly assumed it as perfectly ascertained
                    and indisputable, that the conditions above mentioned may, with only a little
                    more labour, be equally well attained in the case of the oblique, as in that of
                    the square bridge, by merely making the courses of the stones to form portions
                    of the thread of a square threaded screw, or rather, perhaps, of a thread
                    somewhat of the dovetailed form; the highest part of each thread, or that on the
                    crown of the arch, being at right angles to the direction of the road. Such, in
                    particular, is the doctrine laid down by Mr. Nicholson, and also by Mr. Fox; and
                    it is not a little amusing, that the honour of inventing this supposed valuable
                    theory has been warmly disputed between these gentlemen, or at least their
                    friends.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>’ See
                    Philosophical Magazine for April 1836, January and March 1837, and Reports of
                    British Association for 1838.</p></note> When the soffit is to be a cylindrical
                    surface, the side of the screw-thread may, it is true, be readily formed so as
                    to be everywhere at right angles to the soffit; and, as all the beds of the
                    courses of the stones would have the same curvature, the stones might be
                    conveniently prepared beforehand, which is a great recommendation to the scheme.
                    But unfortunately, the other, and by far the more important condition of the
                    two, namely, to have the beds of the courses everywhere at right angles to the
                    direction of the upper passage, can by no means be accurately fulfilled by the
                    figure of the screw; for no two parallel planes can both of them cut the same
                    thread of the screw at right angles, if they intercept a less portion of it than
                    a revolution, so that a thread which has the proper position or direction at the
                    crown of the arch, can have it at no other point; its direction on the one side
                    of the crown being too much inclined to the course of the under passage, whilst,
                    on the other side, it is too little inclined.</p>
                <p>However, although it thus appears that the principle of the screw thread cannot
                    well serve the purpose of the skew bridge, especially when the obliquity is
                    great; yet there can be no question that the beds of the courses of the stones
                    might always be formed with such a curvature as would make them very nearly
                    fulfil both the conditions above specified; but as the several parts of this
                    curved surface, if different from that of a screw, would necessarily be far from
                    being uniform, the stones, owing to their requiring to be of so many different
                    shapes, could not, without immense labour of measurements, drawings, and
                    innumerable patterns, be prepared beforehand; and, therefore, most probably, the
                    easiest way of putting such a scheme in practice, would be to prepare the stones
                    no faster than they are required in building, and then it would be easy to form
                    each stone in such a manner, that two of its opposite sides, or at least the
                    middle parts of these sides, should be as nearly as possible at right angles,
                    both to the soffit, and also to the direction of the passage over the bridge. In
                    this way of working, the soffit need not be restricted to the cylindrical form,
                    because it may suit equally well though of a very different figure. We are
                    aware, that something similar to the method just mentioned has been already
                    acted on, and has also been heartily ridiculed as unscientific and unsystematic;
                    but it will be quite in time to condemn it when once a better shall have been
                    substituted in its stead: for, most assuredly, if closely followed up, it should
                    form an incomparably more perfect structure than that with the screw thread. The
                    like remarks are equally applicable when the material is brick.</p>
                <p>Some bridges may be said to consist generally of a platform supported by a set of
                    curved iron ribs, which either abut like a stone arch against the piers, or, if
                    the curvature be small, and especially if there be nothing to abut against, each
                    rib has its extremities connected and kept from spreading, by a straight rod
                    crossing the span underneath. Ribs of this last construction are often used as
                    beams for supporting floors in large buildings; for, being in effect beams of
                    great depth, they only rest or press downwards upon the piers or walls
                    supporting them, and so have no horizontal thrust. Curved iron ribs, whether
                    with or without the rods, are equally applicable to the oblique as to the square
                    arch, since each rib may always be placed in a plane, which is both vertical,
                    and runs in the direction of the upper passage. The horizontal rods, though
                    generally of unnecessarily great strength throughout the most part of their
                    length, are commonly rendered very weak near their extremities, owing to their
                    either being very needlessly pierced with large holes near the ends, or by being
                    very much reduced there, for the purpose of being formed into a screw. Common
                    sense, one would think, could not fail to hint to even the most inexperienced,
                    that to resist a longitudinal pull, there is no use in having one part of the
                    rod stronger than another; because one weak part will render it as likely to
                    fail, as if the whole were equally weak. Neither is it necessary that such rods
                    should be stronger at the middle to sustain their own weight, since they are
                    commonly suspended there by a vertical strap.</p>
                <p>It is evident that the opposite horizontal thrusts of an arch, formed of any
                    other materials as well as iron, might, in a similar manner, be made to
                    annihilate or counteract each other by means of horizontal rods beneath, so that
                    a common square arch, having the thrusts obviated in this way, could be used
                    instead of a skew bridge, wherever there is sufficient head-room for the
                    horizontal rods, and likewise space for carrying out a mere wall as far as will
                    square the faces of the arch, and support its weight at the two projecting
                    corners; no additional embankment being required where there is no thrust.</p>
                <p>An elegant mode of constructing arches of brick, without requiring the aid of
                    anything like ordinary centring on the great scale, has been introduced by Mr.
                    Brunel, and is equally applicable to the oblique as to the square bridge. The
                    principle of this, as originally adopted, and its sufficiency tested in
                    constructing the shaft of the Thames Tunnel, depends on the cohesive power of
                    Roman cement, coupled with a system of ties, the most eligible material for
                    which Mr. Brunel found to be hoop iron. After the piers have been constructed in
                    the usual manner, a mould, curved according to the figure of the arch, is fixed
                    to, and stretched<pb break="no" facs="ht:chi.28490924&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=439"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0720-0439-0377"/> between these piers, and upon this a narrow arch
                    or rib of brick is carried over and keyed, using cement, with the occasional
                    insertion of ties. The adhesion of the cement to the brick being greater than
                    the cohesion of the brick itself, enables the rib to be carried to any extent of
                    which the strength of the material will admit. When once a sufficient number of
                    such ribs have been successively constructed, side by side, like so many beams
                    stretched between the piers, they will be in a state to receive and support all
                    the other materials necessary to complete the structure.</p>
                <p>The bridge of the Santissima Trinita at Florence, though of ruble construction,
                    affords a magnificent example of the strength of cementitious architecture, and
                    of the durability of the materials; the arches being composed of a mass of
                    irregular stones so strongly united by mortar, as to have the consistence of a
                    single stone. It is evidently a matter of perfect indifference whether such
                    arches were square or oblique. A very ancient bridge, said to have been built by
                    the Romans, over the Danube at Ratisbon, has wonderfully resisted the ravages of
                    time. It consists of gray freestone and thin bricks, firmly united by pozzolano
                    cement.</p>
                <p>On several lines of railway, an ingenious mode of constructing arches of
                    laminated ribs of wood or iron has been introduced by Mr. Green, and is alike
                    applicable to the oblique as to the square arch. At the Ouseburn, close to the
                    east side of the town of Newcastle, is one of the great viaducts constructed in
                    this manner by Mr. Green, on the Shields railway. The piers and abutments are of
                    stone, with large projecting buttresses on each side, whilst the arches, which
                    are circular, are of Memel timber. Each arch is one hundred and sixteen feet in
                    span, and consists of three separate and parallel curved ribs, and each rib,
                    which is four feet in depth by twenty-two inches in thickness, is composed of
                    sixteen layers of three-inch planks laminating over each other, and these again,
                    whilst being bent over a curved frame or centre into the form of the required
                    arch, were firmly fixed together by means of oaken pins and iron straps. The
                    three ribs of each arch are connected by diagonal braces, and their ends rest in
                    large iron sockets fixed on the stone piers or abutments. From the upper sides
                    of tl&gt;e ribs a series of very strong struts, braces, and framing, bound with
                    iron straps and bolts, is carried up, filling the spandrils, to support the
                    platform or roadway, which is formed of longitudinal beams; these again are
                    covered with three-inch planks to carry the rails. Hitherto almost all wooden
                    bridges had been constructed of straight timbers, upon the same principles as
                    are used in roofing; and on account of the shrinkage from the frequent joggles
                    and the weight of the structure, the roadway and framing generally became bent
                    or crippled. But the ribs constructed by Mr. Green make a very close approach to
                    solid pieces of timber. Their strength is very little impaired by the joining of
                    the planks, which are from twenty to forty-five feet in length by eleven inches
                    in breadth; particularly since great care has been taken that no two junctions
                    of their ends might occur at the same place. In forming a rib, the first layer
                    of planks consists of two whole deals in breadth, and the next of one whole and
                    two half deals, and so on alternately, until the rib is completed. This
                    construction is supposed to be better able to resist the load which it may have
                    to bear at a given point, than can be done by the same quantity of materials in
                    a different form. The struts which discharge the weight from the spandril beams
                    upon the ribs, stand at right angles to the latter, and divide them into equal
                    parts. The strength, durability, and beauty, can only be exceeded by arches of
                    stone. The whole of the timber was subjected to Kyan’s process, and between
                    every two deals was introduced a layer of brown paper dipped in tar, to exclude
                    moisture. The bridge across the Ousebum has five wooden arches of one hundred
                    and sixteen feet span, and four of stone of forty-three feet span. Each of the
                    wooden arches required three centres, which were made so light as to admit of
                    being shifted from one arch to another without being taken to pieces. The total
                    length of this bridge is nine hundred and fifty feet, and greatest height one
                    hundred and eight feet. At Willington, four miles farther east, on the same
                    railway, is a still longer bridge of the same construction.</p>
                <p>Mr. Green has applied the same principle to the construction of iron bridges with
                    laminated ribs of that metal. Wrought iron bars from 1∙5 to 4 inches square,
                    according to the span of the arch, and from fifteen to twenty-five feet in
                    length, grooved on the under, and tongued on the upper side, are laid one over
                    another, and bent over a centre until the rib is formed. The bars are bound
                    together with iron straps at intervals of from four to six feet apart. A
                    considerable saving of expense, and great lightness, as compared with stone or
                    ordinary iron bridges, may thus be attained.</p>
