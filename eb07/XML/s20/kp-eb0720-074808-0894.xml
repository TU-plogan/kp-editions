                    >In</hi><hi rend="italic">Mechanics,</hi> is a subject of so much importance,
                    that in a nation so eminent as this for invention and ingenuity in every species
                    of manufacture, and in particular so distinguished for its improvements in
                    machinery of every kind, it is somewhat singular that no writer has treated it
                    in the detail which its importance and difficulty demand. The man of science who
                    visits our great manufactories is delighted with the ingenuity which he observes
                    in every part, the innumerable inventions which come even from individual
                    artisans, and the determined purpose of improvement and refinement which he sees
                    in every workshop. Every cotton-mill appears an academy of mechanical science;
                    and mechanical invention is spreading from these fountains over the whole
                    kingdom. But the philosopher is mortified to see this ardent spirit cramped by
                    ignorance of principle, and many of those original and brilliant thoughts
                    obscured and clogged with needless and even hurtful additions, and a
                    complication of machinery which checks improvement even by its appearance of
                    ingenuity. There is nothing in which this want of scientific education, this
                    ignorance of principle, is so frequently observed, as in the injudicious
                    proportion of the parts of machines and other mechanical structures; proportions
                    and forms of parts in which the strength and position are nowise regulated by
                    the strains to which they are exposed, and where repeated failures have been the
                    only lessons.</p>
                <p>The strength of materials arises immediately or ultimately from the cohesion of
                    the parts of bodies. Our examination of this property of tangible matter has as
                    yet been very partial and imperfect, and by no means enables us to apply
                    mathematical calculations with precision and success. The various modifications
                    of cohesion, in its different appearances of perfect softness, plasticity,
                    ductility, elasticity, hardness, have a mighty influence on the strength of
                    bodies, but are hardly susceptible of measuremerit. Their texture, whether
                    uniform like glass and ductile metals, crystallized or granulated like other
                    metals and freestone, or fibrous like timber, is a circumstance no less
                    important; yet even here, although we derive some advantage from remarking to
                    which of these forms of aggregation a substance belongs, the aid is but small.
                    All we can do in this want of general principles is, to make experiments on
                    every class of bodies. Accordingly philosophers have endeavoured to instruct the
                    public in this particular. The Royal Society of London, at its very first
                    institution, made many experiments at their meetings, as may be seen in the
                    first registers of the society; and since then a vast multitude of experiments
                    have been made by public bodies and private individuals. The best of these,
                    perhaps, up to the date of the present edition, are those of Mr Barlow.</p>
                <p>But to make use of any experiments, there must be employed some general principle
                    try which we can generalize their results. They will otherwise be only
                    narrations of detached facts. We must have some notion of that intermedium, by
                    the intervention of which an external force applied to one part of a lever,
                    joist, or pillar, occasions a strain on a distant part. This can be nothing but
                    the cohesion between the parts. It is this connecting force which is brought
                    into action, or, as we more shortly express it, excited. This action is modified
                    in every part by the laws of mechanics. It is this action which we call the <hi
                    rend="italic">strength</hi> of that part, and its effect is the strain on the
                    adjoining parts; and thus it is the same force, differently viewed, that
                    constitutes both the strain and the strength. When we consider it in the light
                    of a resistance to fracture, we call it <hi rend="italic">strength.</hi><pb

                    xml:id="kp-eb0720-0895-0749"/> We call every thing a <hi rend="italic"
                    >force</hi> which we observe ever to be accompanied by a change of motion; or,
                    more strictly speaking, we infer the presence and agency of a force wherever we
                    observe the state of things in respect of motion different from what we know to
                    be the result of the action of all the forces which we know to act on the body.
                    Thus when we observe a rope prevent a body from falling, we infer a moving force
                    inherent in the rope, with as much confidence as when we observe it drag the
                    body along the ground. The <hi rend="italic">immediate action</hi> of this force
                    is undoubtedly exerted between the immediately adjoining parts of the rope. The
                    immediate effect is the keeping the particles of the rope together. They ought
                    to separate by any external force drawing the ends of the rope contrariwise; and
                    we ascribe their not doing so to a mechanical force really opposing this
                    external force. When desired to give it a name, we name it from what we conceive
                    to be its effect, and therefore its characteristic, and we call it <hi
                    rend="italic">cohesion.</hi> This is merely a name for the fact; but it is the
                    same thing in all our denominations. We know nothing of the causes but in the
                    effects; and our name for the cause is in fact the name of the effect, which is
                    <hi rend="italic">cohesion.</hi> We mean nothing else by gravitation or
                    magnetism. What do we mean when we say that Newton understood thoroughly the
                    nature of gravitation, of the force of gravitation; or that Franklin understood
                    the nature of the electric force? Nothing but this; Newton considered with
                    patient sagacity the general facts of gravitation, and has described and classed
                    them with the utmost precision. In like manner, we shall understand the nature
                    of cohesion when we have discovered with equal generality the laws of cohesion,
                    or general facts which are observed in the appearances, and when we have
                    described and classed them with equal accuracy.</p>
                <p>Let us therefore attend to the more simple and obvious phenomena of cohesion, and
                    mark with care every circumstance of resemblance by which they may be classed.
                    Let us receive these as the laws of cohesion, characteristic of its supposed
                    cause, the force of cohesion. We cannot pretend to enter on this vast research.
                    The modifications are innumerable; and it would require the penetration of more
                    than Newton to detect the circumstance of similarity amidst millions of
                    discriminating circumstances. Yet this is the only way of discovering which are
                    the primary facts characteristic of the force, and which are the modifications.
                    The study is immense, but it is by no means desperate; and we entertain great
                    hopes that it will ere long be successfully prosecuted; but, in our particular
                    predicament, we must content ourselves with selecting such general laws as seem
                    to give us the most immediate information of the circumstances that must be
                    attended to by the mechanician in his constructions, that he may unite strength
                    with simplicity, economy, and energy.</p>
                <p>1. Then, it is a matter of fact that all bodies are in a certain degree perfectly
                    elastic; that is, when their form or bulk is changed by certain moderate
                    compressions or distractions, it requires the continuance of the changing force
                    to continue the body in this new state; and when the force is removed, the body
                    recovers its original form. We limit the assertion to <hi rend="italic">certain
                    moderate</hi> changes. For instance, take a lead wire of one fifteenth of an
                    inch in diameter and ten feet long; fix one end firmly to the ceiling, and let
                    the wire hang perpendicular; affix to the lower end an index like the hand of a
                    watch; on some stand immediately below let there be a circle divided into
                    degrees, with its centre corresponding to the lower point of the wire; now turn
                    this index twice round, and thus twist the wire. When the index is let go, it
                    will turn backwards again, by the wire untwisting itself, and make almost four
                    revolutions before it stops; after which it twists and untwists many times, the
                    index going backwards and forwards round the circle, diminishing, however, its
                    arch of twist each time, till at last it settles precisely in its original
                    position. This may be repeated for ever. Now, in this motion, every part of the
                    wire partakes equally of the twist. The particles are stretched, require force
                    to keep them in their state of extension, and recover completely their relative
                    positions. These are all the characters of what the mechanician calls <hi
                    rend="italic">perfect</hi> elasticity. This is a quality quite familiar in many
                    cases, as in glass, tempered steel, &amp;c., but was thought incompetent to
                    lead, which is generally considered as having little or no elasticity. But we
                    make the assertion in the most general terms, with the limitation to moderate
                    derangement of form. We have made the same experiment on a thread of pipe-clay,
                    made by forcing soft clay through the small hole of a syringe by means of a
                    screw, and we found it more elastic than the lead wire; for a thread of one
                    twentieth of an inch diameter and seven feet long allowed the index to make two
                    turns, and yet completely recovered its first position.</p>
                <p>2. But if we turn the index of the lead wire four times round, and let it go
                    again, it untwists again in the same manner, but it makes little more than four
                    turns back again; and after many oscillations it finally stops in a position
                    almost two revolutions removed from its original position. It has now acquired a
                    new arrangement of parts, and this new arrangement is permanent like the former;
                    and, what is of particular moment, it is perfectly elastic. This change is
                    familiarly known by the denomination of a <hi rend="italic">set.</hi> The wire
                    is said to have <hi rend="italic">taken a set.</hi> When we attend minutely to
                    the procedure of nature in this phenomenon, we find that the particles have, as
                    it were, slid on each other, still cohering, and have taken a new position, in
                    which their connecting forces are in equilibrio; and in this change of relative
                    situation, it appears that the connecting forces which maintained the particles
                    in their first situation were not in equilibrio in some position intermediate
                    between that of the first and that of the last form. The force required for
                    changing this first form augmented with the change, but only to a certain
                    degree; and during this process the connecting forces always tended to the
                    recovery of this first form. But after the change of mutual position has passed
                    a certain magnitude, the union has been partly destroyed, and the particles have
                    been brought into new situations; such, that the forces which now connect each
                    with its neighbour tend, not to the recovery of the first arrangement, but to
                    push them farther from it, into a new situation, to which they now verge, and
                    require force to prevent them from acquiring. The wire is now in fact again
                    perfectly elastic; that is, the forces which now connect the particles with
                    their neighbours, augment to a certain degree as the derangement from this new
                    position augments. This is not reasoning from any theory. It is narrating facts,
                    on which a theory is to be founded. What we have been just now saying, is
                    evidently a description of that sensible form of tangible matter which we call
                    <hi rend="italic">ductility.</hi> It has every gradation of variety, from the
                    softness of butter to the firmness of gold. All these bodies have some
                    elasticity; but we say they are not perfectly elastic, because they do not
                    completely recover their original form when it has been greatly damaged. The
                    whole gradation may be most distinctly observed in a piece of glass or hard
                    sealing-wax. In the ordinary form glass is perhaps the most completely elastic
                    body that we know, and may be bent till just ready to snap, and yet completely
                    recovers its first form, and takes no set whatever; but when heated to such a
                    degree as just to be visible in the dark, it loses its brittleness, and becomes
                    so tough that it cannot be broken by any blow; but it is no longer elastic, it
                    takes any set, and keeps it. When more heated, it becomes as plastic as clay;
                    but in this state is remarkably distinguished from clay by a quality which we
                    may call <hi rend="italic">viscidity,</hi> which is something like elasticity,
                    of which clay and other bodies purely plastic exhibit no appearance. This<pb
                    break="no" facs="ht:chi.28490924&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=896"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0720-0896-0750"/> is the joint operation of strong adhesion and
                    softness. When a rod of perfectly soft glass is suddenly stretched a little, it
                    does not at once take the shape which it acquires after some little time. It is
                    owing to this that, in taking the impression of a seal, if we take off the seal
                    while the wax is yet very hot, the sharpness of the impression is immediately
                    destroyed. Each part drawing its neighbour, and each part yielding, the
                    prominent parts are pulled down and blunted, and the sharp hollows are pulled
                    upwards and also blunted. The seal must be kept on till the wax has become not
                    only stiff, but hard.</p>
                <p>This viscidity is to be observed in all plastic bodies which are homogeneous. It
                    is not observed in clay, because clay is not homogeneous, but consists of hard
                    particles of argillaceous earth sticking together by their attraction for water.
                    Something like it might be made of finely powdered glass and a clammy fluid such
                    as turpentine. Viscidity has all degrees of softness, till it degenerates to
                    ropy fluidity like that of olive oil. Perhaps something of it may be found even
                    in the most perfect fluid with which we are acquainted, as we observed in the
                    experiments for ascertaining specific gravity.</p>
                <p>When ductility and elasticity are combined in different proportions, an immense
                    variety of sensible modes of aggregation may be produced. Some degree of both
                    are probably to be observed in all bodies of complex constitution; that is,
                    which consist of particles made up of many different kinds of atoms. Such a
                    constitution of a body must afford many situations permanent, but easily
                    deranged.</p>
                <p>In all these changes of disposition which take place among the particles of a
                    ductile body, the particles are at such distance that they still cohere. The
                    body may be stretched a little; and on removing the extending force, the body
                    shrinks into its first form. It also resists moderate compressions; and when the
                    compressing force is removed, the body again swells out. Now the corpuscular <hi
                    rend="italic">fact</hi> here is, that the particles are acted on by attractions
                    and repulsions, which balance each other when no external force is acting on the
                    body, and which augment as the particles are made, by any external cause, to
                    recede from this situation of mutual inactivity; for since force is requisite to
                    produce either the dilatation or the compression, and to maintain it, we are
                    obliged, by the constitution of our minds, to infer that it is opposed by a
                    force accompanying or inherent in every particle of dilatable or compressible
                    matter; and as this necessity of employing force to produce a change indicates
                    the agency of these corpuscular forces, and marks their kind, according as the
                    tendencies of the particles appear to be toward each other in dilatation, or
                    from each other in compression; so it also measures the degrees of their
                    intensity. Should it require three times the force to produce a double
                    compression, we must reckon the mutual repulsions triple when the compression is
                    doubled; and so in other instances. We see from all this that the phenomena of
                    cohesion indicate some relation between the centres of the particles. To
                    discover this relation is the great problem in corpuscular mechanism, as it was
                    in the Newtonian investigation of the force of gravitation. Could we discover
                    this law of action between the corpuscles with the same certainty and
                    distinctness, we might with equal confidence say what will be the result of any
                    position which we give to the particles of bodies; but this is beyond our hopes.
                    The law of gravitation is so simple, that the discovery or detection of it amid
                    the variety of celestial phenomena required but one step; and in its own nature
                    its possible combinations still do not greatly exceed the powers of human
                    research. One is almost disposed to say that the Supreme Being has exhibited it
                    to our reasoning powers as sufficient to employ with success our utmost efforts,
                    but not so abstruse as to discourage us from the noble attempt. It seems to be
                    otherwise with respect to cohesion. Mathematics informs us, that if it deviates
                    sensibly from the law of gravitation, the simplest combinations will make the
                    joint action of several particles an almost impenetrable mystery. We must
                    therefore content ourselves, for a long time to come, with a careful observation
                    of the simplest cases that we can propose, and with the discovery of secondary
                    laws of action, in which many particles combine their influence. In pursuance of
                    this plan, we observe,</p>
                <p>3. That whatever is the situation of the particles of a body with respect to each
                    other, when in a quiescent state, they are kept in these situations by the
                    balance of opposite forces. This cannot be refused, nor can we form to ourselves
                    any other notion of the state of the particles of a body. Whether we suppose the
                    ultimate particles to be of certain magnitudes and shapes, touching each other
                    in single points of cohesion; or whether, with Boscovich, we consider them as at
                    a distance from each other, and acting on each other by attractions and
                    repulsions, we must acknowledge, in the first place, that the centres of the
                    particles (by whose mutual distances we must estimate the distance of the
                    particles) may and do vary their distances from each other. What else can we say
                    when we observe a body increase in length, in breadth, and thickness, by heating
                    it, or when we see it diminish in all these dimensions by an external
                    compression? A particle, therefore, situated in the midst of many others, and
                    remaining in that situation, must be conceived as maintained in it by the mutual
                    balancing of all the forces which connect it with its neighbours. It is like a
                    ball kept in its place by the opposite action of two springs. This illustration
                    merits a more particular application. Suppose a number of balls ranged on the
                    table in the angles of equilateral triangles, and that each ball is connected
                    with the six which lie around it by means of an elastic wire curled like a
                    cork-screw; suppose such another stratum of balls above this, and parallel to
                    it, and so placed that each ball of the upper stratum is perpendicularly over
                    the centre of the equilateral triangle below, and let these be connected with
                    the balls of the under stratum by similar spiral wires. Let there be a third and
                    a fourth, and any number of such strata, all connected in the same manner. It is
                    plain that this may extend to any size, and fill any space. Now let this
                    assemblage of balls be firmly contemplated by the imagination, and be supposed
                    to shrink continually in all its dimensions, till the balls, and their distances
                    from each other, and the connecting wires, all vanish from the sight as discrete
                    individual objects. AH this is very conceivable. It will now appear like a solid
                    body, having length, breadth, and thickness; it may be compressed, and will
                    again resume its dimensions; it may be stretched, and will again shrink; it will
                    move away when struck; in short, it will not differ in its sensible appearance
                    from a solid elastic body. Now when this body is in a state of compression, for
                    instance, it is evident that any one of the balls is at rest, in consequence of
                    the mutual balancing of the actions of all the spiral wires which connect it
                    with those around it. It will greatly conduce to the full understanding of all
                    that follows to recur to this illustration. The analogy or resemblance between
                    the effects of this constitution of things and the effects of the corpuscular
                    forces is very great; and wherever it obtains, we may safely draw conclusions
                    from what we know would be the condition of a body of common tangible matter. We
                    shall just give one instructive example, and then have done with this
                    hypothetical body. We can suppose it of a long shape, resting on one point; we
                    can suppose two weights A, B. suspended at the extremities, and the whole in
                    equilibrio. We commonly express this state of things by saying that A and B are
                    in equilibrio. This is very inaccurate. A is in fact in equilibrio with the
                    united action of all the springs which connect the ball to which it is applied
                    with the adjoining balls. These springs are brought into action, and each is in
                    equilibrio with the joint action of<pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:chi.28490924&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=897" xml:id="kp-eb0720-0897-0751"/>
                    all the rest. Thus through the whole extent of the hypothetical body the springs
                    arc brought into action in a way and in a degree which mathematics can easily
                    investigate. We need not do this: it is enough for our purpose that our
                    imagination readily discovers that some springs are stretched, others are
                    compressed, and that a pressure is excited on the middle point of support, and
                    the support exerts a reaction which precisely balances it; and the other weight
                    is, in like manner, in immediate equilibrio with the equivalent of the actions
                    of all the springs which connect the last ball with its neighbours. Now take the
                    analogical or resembling case, an oblong piece of solid matter, resting on a
                    fulcrum, and loaded with two weights in equilibrio; for the actions of the
                    connecting springs substitute the corpuscular forces; and the result will
                    resemble that of the hypothesis.</p>
                <p>Now, as there is something that is at least analogous to a change of distance of
                    the particles, and a concomitant change of the intensity of the connecting
                    forces, we may express this in the same way that we arc accustomed to do in
                    similar cases. Let A and B (fig. 1) represent the centres of two particles of a
                    coherent elastic body in their quiescent inactive state, and let us consider
                    only the mechanical condition of B. The body may be stretched. In this case the
                    distance AB of the particles may become AC. In this state there is something
                    which makes it necessary to employ a force to keep the particles at this
                    distance. C has a tendency towards A, or we may say that A attracts C. We may
                    represent the magnitude of this tendency of C <hi rend="italic">towards</hi> A,
                    or this attraction of A, by a line C <hi rend="italic">c</hi> perpendicular to
                    AC. Again, the body may be compressed, and the distance AB may become AD.
                    Something obliges us to employ force to continue this compression, and D tends
                    <hi rend="italic">from</hi> A, or A appears to <hi rend="italic">repel</hi> D.
                    The intensity of this tendency or repulsion may be represented by another
                    perpendicular D <hi rend="italic">d;</hi> and, to represent the different
                    directions of these tendencies, or the different nature of these actions, we may
                    set D <hi rend="italic">d</hi> on the opposite side of AB. It is in this manner
                    that Boscovich has represented the actions of corpuscular forces in his
                    celebrated Theory of Natural Philosophy. Newton had said, that as the great
                    movements of the solar system were regulated by forces operating at a distance,
                    and varying with the distance, so he strongly suspected <hi rend="italic">(valde
                    suspico)</hi> that all the phenomena of cohesion, with all its modifications in
                    the different sensible forms of aggregation, and in the phenomena of chemistry
                    and physiology, resulted from the similar agency of forces varying with the
                    distance of the particles. The learned Jesuit pursued this thought; and has
                    shown, that if we suppose an ultimate atom of matter endowed with powers of
                    attraction and repulsion, varying, both in kind and degree, with the distance,
                    and if this force be the same in every atom, it may be regulated by such a
                    relation to the distance from the neighbouring atom, that a collection of such
                    may have all the sensible appearance of bodies in their different forms of
                    solids, liquids, and vapours, elastic or unelastic, and endowed with all the
                    properties which we perceive, by whose immediate operation the phenomena of
                    motion by impulse, and all the phenomena of chemistry, and of animal and
                    vegetable economy, may be produced. He shows, that notwithstanding a perfect
                    sameness, and even a great simplicity, in this atomical constitution, there will
                    result from this union all that unspeakable variety of form and property which
                    diversifies and embellishes the face of nature. We shall take another
                    opportunity of giving such an account of this celebrated work as it deserves. We
                    mention it only by the by, as far as a general notion of it will be of some
                    service on the present occasion. For this purpose, we just observe that
                    Boscovich conceives a particle of any individual species of matter to consist of
                    an unknown number of particles of simpler constitution; each of which particles,
                    in their turn, is compounded of particles still more simply constituted, and so
                    on through an unknown number of orders, till we arrive at the simplest possible
                    constitution of a particle of tangible matter, susceptible of length, breadth,
                    and thickness, and necessarily consisting of four atoms of matter. And he shows
                    that the more complex we suppose the constitution of a particle, the more must
                    the sensible qualities of the aggregate resemble the observed qualities of
                    tangible bodies. In particular, he shows how a particle may be so constituted,
                    that although it act on one other particle of the same kind through a
                    considerable interval, the interposition of a third particle of the same kind
                    may render it totally, or almost totally, inactive; and therefore an assemblage
                    of such particles would form such a fluid as air. All these curious inferences
                    are made with uncontrovertible evidence; and the greatest encouragement is thus
                    given to the mathematical philosopher to hope, that by cautious and patient
                    proceeding in this way, we may gradually approach to a knowledge of the laws of
                    cohesion, that will not shun a comparison even with the Principia of Newton. No
                    step can be made in this investigation, but by observing with care, and
                    generalizing with judgment, the phenomena, which are abundantly numerous, and
                    much more at our command than those of the great and sensible motions of bodies.
                    Following this plan, we observe,</p>
                <p>4. It is a matter of fact, that every body has some degree of compressibility and
                    dilatability; and when the changes of dimension are so moderate that the body
                    completely recovers its original dimensions on the cessation of the changing
                    force, the extensions or compressions are sensibly proportional to the extending
                    of compressing forces; and therefore <hi rend="italic">the connecting forces are
                    proportional to the distances of the particles from their quiescent, neutral, or
                    inactive positions.</hi> This seems to have been first viewed as a law of nature
                    by the penetrating eye of Dr Robert Hooke, one of the most eminent philosophers
                    of the last century. He published a cipher, which he said contained the theory
                    of springiness and of the motions of bodies by the action of springs. It was
                    this, <hi rend="italic">c e i i i n o s s s t t u u.</hi> When explained in his
                    dissertation, published some years after, it was <hi rend="italic">ut tensio sic
                    vis.</hi> This is precisely the proposition now asserted as a general fact, a
                    law of nature. This dissertation is full of curious observations of facts in
                    support of his assertion. In his application to the motion of bodies, he gives
                    his noble discovery of the balance-spring of a watch, which is founded on this
                    law. The spring, as it is more and more coiled up, or unwound, by the motion of
                    the balance, acts on it with a force proportional to the distance of the balance
                    from its quiescent position. The balance, therefore, is acted on by an
                    accelerating force, which varies in the same manner as the force of gravity
                    acting on a pendulum swinging in a cycloid. Its vibrations therefore must be
                    performed in equal time, whether they are wide or narrow. In the same
                    dissertation Hooke mentions all the facts which John Bernoulli afterwards
                    adduced in support of Leibnitz’s whimsical doctrine of the force of bodies in
                    motion, as the doctrine of the <hi rend="italic">vires viva;</hi> a doctrine
                    which Hooke might justly have claimed as his own, had he not seen its
                    futility.</p>
                <p>Experiments made since the time of Hooke show that this law is strictly true in
                    the extent to which we have limited it, viz. in all the changes of form which
                    will be completely undone by the elasticity of the body. It is nearly true to a
                    much greater extent. James Bernoulli, in his dis<pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:chi.28490924&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=898" xml:id="kp-eb0720-0898-0752"/>
                    sertation on the elastic curve, relates some experiments of his own, which seem
                    to deviate considerably from it; but on close examination they do not. The
                    finest experiments are those of Coulomb, published in some late volumes of the
                    Memoirs of the Academy of Paris, He suspended balls by wires, and observed their
                    motions of oscillation, which he found accurately corresponding with this
                    law.</p>
                <p>This we shall find to be a very important fact in the doctrine of the strength of
                    bodies, and we desire the reader to make it familiar to his mind. If we apply to
                    this our manner of expressing these forces by perpendicular ordinates C <hi
                    rend="italic">c</hi>, D <hi rend="italic">d</hi> (fig. 1), we must take other
                    situations E, F, of the particle B, and draw E <hi rend="italic">e</hi>, F <hi
                    rend="italic">f</hi>; and we must have <hi rend="italic">Od</hi>: F <hi
                    rend="italic">f</hi> = BD: BF, or C <hi rend="italic">c</hi>: E <hi
                    rend="italic">e</hi> = BC: BE. In such a supposition F <hi rend="italic">d</hi>
                    ZB <hi rend="italic">ce</hi> must be a straight line. But we shall have abundant
                    evidence by and by that this cannot be strictly true, and that the line Bee,
                    which limits the ordinates expressing the attractive forces, becomes concave
                    towards the line ABE, and that the part B <hi rend="italic">of</hi> is convex
                    towards it. All that can be safely concluded from the experiments hitherto made
                    is, that to <hi rend="italic">a certain extent</hi> the forces, both attractive
                    and repulsive, are <hi rend="italic">sensibly</hi> proportional to the
                    dilatations and compressions. For,</p>
                <p>5. It is universally observed, that when the dilatations have proceeded a certain
                    length, a less addition of force is sufficient to increase the dilatation in the
                    same degree. This is always observed when the body has been so far stretched
                    that it takes a set, and does not completely recover its form. The like may be
                    generally observed in compressions. Most persons will recollect, that in
                    violently stretching an elastic cord, it becomes suddenly weaker, or more easily
                    stretched. But these phenomena do not positively prove a diminution of the
                    corpuscular force acting on one particle: it more probably arises from the
                    disunion of some particles whose action contributed to the whole or sensible
                    effect. And in compressions we may suppose something of the same kind; for when
                    we compress a body in one direction, it commonly bulges out in another; and in
                    cases of very violent action some particles may be disunited, whose transverse
                    action had formerly balanced <hi rend="italic">part</hi> of the compressing
                    force. For the reader will see on reflection, that since the compression in one
                    direction causes the body to bulge out in the transverse direction, and since
                    this bulging out is in opposition to the transverse forces of attraction, it
                    must employ some part of the compressing force. And the common appearances are
                    in perfect uniformity with this conception of things. When we press a bit of
                    dryish clay, it swells out and cracks transversely. When a pillar of wood is
                    overloaded, it swells out, and small crevices appear in the direction of the
                    fibres. After this it will not bear half of the load. This the carpenters call
                    <hi rend="italic">crippling;</hi> and a knowledge of the circumstances which
                    modify it is of great importance, and enables us to understand some very
                    paradoxical appearances, as will be shown by and by.</p>
                <p>This partial disuniting of particles formerly cohering, is, we imagine, the chief
                    reason why the totality of the forces which really oppose an external strain
                    does not increase in the proportion of the extensions and compressions. But
                    sufficient evidence will also be given that the forces which would connect one
                    particle with one other particle do not augment in the accurate proportion of
                    the change of distance; that in extensions they increase more slowly, and in
                    compressions more rapidly.</p>
                <p>But there is another cause of this deviation perhaps equally effectual with the
                    former. Most bodies manifest some degree of ductility. Now what is this? The
                    fact is, that the parts have taken a new arrangement, in which they again
                    cohere. Therefore, in the passage to this new arrangement, the sensible forces,
                    which are the joint result of many corpuscular threes, begin to respect this new
                    arrange ment instead of the former. This must change the simple law of
                    corpuscular force, characterisic of the particular species of matter under
                    examination. It does not require much reflection to convince us that the
                    possible arrangements which the particles of a body may acquire, without
                    appearing to change their nature, must be more numerous according as the
                    particles are of a more complex constitution; and it is reasonable to suppose
                    that the constitution even of the most simple kind of matter that we are
                    acquainted with is exceedingly complex. Our microscopes show us animals so
                    minute, that a heap of them must appear to the naked eye an uniform mass with a
                    grain finer than that of the finest marble or razor hone; and yet each of these
                    has not only limbs, but bones, muscular fibres, blood-vessels, fibres, and a
                    blood consisting in all probability of globules organized and complex like our
                    own. The imagination is here lost in wonder; and nothing is left us but to adore
                    inconceivable art and wisdom, and to exult in the thought that we are the only
                    spectators of this beautiful scene who can derive pleasure from the view. But
                    let us proceed to observe,</p>
                <p>6. That the forces which connect the particles of tangible bodies change by a
                    change of distance, not only in degree, but also in kind. The particle B (fig.
                    1) is attracted by A when in the situation Cor E. It is repelled by it when at D
                    or F. It is not affected by it when in the situation B. The reader is requested
                    carefully to remark, that this is not an inference founded on the authority of
                    our mathematical figure. The figure is an expression (to assist the imagination)
                    of facts in nature. It requires no force to keep the particles of a body in
                    their quiescent situations: but if they be separated by stretching the body,
                    they endeavour (pardon the figurative expression) to come together again. If
                    they be brought nearer by compression, they endeavour to recede. This endeavour
                    is manifested by the necessity of employing force to maintain the extension or
                    condensation; and we represent this by the different position of our lines. But
                    this is not all: the particle B, which is repelled by A when in the situation F
                    or D, is neutral when at B, and is attracted when at C or E, may be placed at
                    such a distance AG from A greater than AB that it shall be again repelled, or at
                    such a distance AH that it shall be again attracted; and these alterations may
                    be repeated again and again. This is curious and important, and requires
                    something more than a bare assertion for its proof.</p>
                <p>In the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Optics</hi> we mentioned the most curious and
                    valuable observations of Sir Isaac Newton, by which it appears that light is
                    thus alternately attracted and repelled by bodies. The rings of colour which
                    appear between the object-glasses of long telescopes showed, that in the small
                    interval of <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"> 1000</hi> th
                    of an inch, there are at least an hundred such changes observable, and that it
                    is highly probable that these alternations extend to a much greater distance. At
                    one of these distances the light actually converges towards the solid matter of
                    the glass, which we express shortly by saying that it is attracted by it, and
                    that at the next distance it declines from the glass, or is repelled by it. The
                    same thing is more simply inferred from the phenomena of light passing by the
                    edges of knives and other opaque bodies. We refer the reader to the experiments
                    themselves, the detail being too long for this place; and we request him to
                    consider them minutely and attentively, and to form distinct notions of the
                    inferences drawn from them. And we desire it to be remarked, that although
                    Newton, in his discussion, always considers light as a set of corpuscles moving
                    in free space, and obeying the actions of external forces like any oilier
                    matter, the particular conclusion in which we are just now interested does not
                    at all depend on this notion of the nature of light. Should we, with Descartes
                    or Huygens, suppose light to be the undulation of an elastic medium, the<pb
                    break="no" facs="ht:chi.28490924&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=899"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0720-0899-0753"/> conclusion will be the same. The undulations at
                    certain distances are disturbed by forces directed towards the body, and at a
                    greater distance the disturbing forces tend <hi rend="italic">from</hi> the
                    body.</p>
                <p>But the same alternations of attraction and repulsion may be observed between the
                    particles of common matter. If we take a piece of very flat and well-polished
                    glass, such as is made for the horizon-glasses of a good Hadley’s quadrant, and
                    if we wrap round it a fibre of silk as it comes from the cocoon, taking care
                    that the fibre shall nowhere cross another, and then press this pretty hard on
                    such another piece of glass, it will lift it up and keep it suspended. The
                    particles therefore of the one do most certainly attract those of the other, and
                    this at a distance equal to the thickness of the silk fibre. This is nearly the
                    limit; and it sometimes requires a considerable pressure to produce the effect.
                    The pressure is effectual only by compressing the silk fibre, and thus
                    diminishing the distance between the glass plates. This adhesion cannot be
                    attributed to the pressure of the atmosphere, because there is nothing to hinder
                    the air from insinuating itself between the plates, since they are separated by
                    the silk. Besides, the experiment succeeds equally well under the receiver of an
                    air-pump. This most valuable experiment was first made by Huygens, who reported
                    it to the Royal Society. It is narrated in the Philosophical Transactions, No.
                    86.</p>
                <p>Here, then, is an attraction acting, like gravity, at a distance. But take away
                    the silk fibre, and try to make the glasses touch each other, and we shall find
                    a very great force necessary. By Newton’s experiments it appears, that unless
                    the prismatic colours begin to appear between the glasses, they are at least <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 1</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"> 890</hi> th of an inch
                    asunder or more. Now we know that a very considerable force is necessary for
                    producing these colours, and that the more we press the glasses together the
                    more rings of colours appear. It also appears from Newton’s measures, that the
                    difference of distance between the glasses where each of these colours appears
                    is about the 89,000th part of an inch. We know further, that when we have
                    produced the last appearance of a greasy or pearly colour, and then augment the
                    pressure, making it about 1000 pounds on the square inch, all colours vanish,
                    and the two pieces of glass seem to make one transparent undistinguishable mass.
                    They appear now to have no air between them, or to be in mathematical contact.
                    But another fact shows this conclusion to be premature. The same circles of
                    colours appear in the top of a soap-bubble; and as it grows thinner at top,
                    there appears an unreflecting spot in the middle. We have the greatest
                    probability therefore that the perfect transparency in the middle of the two
                    glasses does not arise from their being in contact, but because the thickness of
                    air between them is too small in that place for the reflection of light. Nay,
                    Newton expressly found no reflection where the thickness was <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 2</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"> 5</hi> ths or more of the <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 1</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"> 89000</hi> th part of an
                    inch.</p>
                <p>All this while the glasses are strongly repelling each other, for great pressure
                    is necessary for continuing the appearance of those colours, and they vanish in
                    succession as the pressure is diminished. This vanishing of the colours is a
                    proof that the glasses are moving off from each other, or repelling each other.
                    But we can put an end to this repulsion by very strong pressure, and at the same
                    time sliding the glasses on each other. We do not pretend to account for this
                    effect of the sliding motion; but the fact is, that by so doing, the glasses
                    will cohere with very great force, so that we shall break them by any attempt to
                    pull them asunder. It commonly happens (at least it did so with us), that in
                    this sliding compression of two smooth flat plates of glass, they scratch and
                    mutually destroy each other’s surface. It is also worth remarking, that
                    different kinds of glass exhibit different properties in this respect. Flint
                    glass will attract even though a silk fibre lies double between them, and they
                    much more readily cohere by this sliding pressure.</p>
                <p>Here, then, are two distances at which the plates of glass attract each other;
                    namely, when the silk fibre is interposed, and when they are forced together
                    with this sliding motion. And in any intermediate situation they repel each
                    other. We see the same thing in other solid bodies. Two pieces of lead, made
                    perfectly clean, may be made to cohere by grinding them together in the same
                    manner. It is in this way that pretty ornaments of silver are united to iron.
                    The piece is scraped clean, and a small bit of silver like a fish scale is laid
                    on. The die which is to strike it into a flower or other ornament is then set on
                    it, and we give it a smart blow, which forces the metals into contact as firm as
                    if they were soldered together. It sometimes happens that the die adheres to the
                    coin so that they cannot be separated: and it is found that this frequently
                    happens when the engraving is such that the raised figure is not completely
                    surrounded with a smooth flat ground. The probable cause of this is curious.
                    When the coin has a flat surface all around, this is produced by the most
                    prominent part of the die. This applies to the meta), and completely confines
                    the air which filled the hollow of the die. As the pressure goes on, the metal
                    is squeezed up into the hollow of the die; but there is still air compressed
                    between them, which cannot escape by any passage. It is therefore prodigiously
                    condensed, and exerts an elasticity proportioned to the condensation. This
                    serves to separate the die from the metal when the stroke is over. The hollow
                    part of the die has not touched the metal all the while, and we may say that the
                    impression was made by air. If this air escape by any engraving reaching through
                    the border, they cohere inseparably.</p>
                <p>We have admitted that the glass plates are in contact when they adhere thus
                    firmly. But we are not certain of this: for if we take these cohering glasses,
                    and touch them with water, it quickly insinuates itself between them. Yet they
                    still cohere, but can now be pretty easily separated.</p>
                <p>It is owing to this repulsion, exerted through its proper sphere, that certain
                    powders swim on the surface of water, and are wetted with great difficulty.
                    Certain insects can run about on the surface of water. They have brushy-feet,
                    which occupy a considerable surface, and if their steps be viewed with a
                    magnifying glass, the surface of the water is seen depressed all around,
                    resembling the footsteps of a man walking on feather beds. This is owing to a
                    repulsion between the brush and the water. A common fly cannot walk in this
                    manner on water. Its feet are wetted, because they attract the water instead of
                    repelling it. A steel needle, slightly greased, will lie on the surface of
                    water, make an impression as a great bar would make on a feather bed; and its
                    weight is less than that of the displaced water. A dew-drop lies on the leaves
                    of plants without touching them mathematically, as is plain from the extreme
                    brilliancy of the reflection at the posterior surface; nay, it may be sometimes
                    observed that the drops of rain lie on the surface of water, and roll about on
                    it like balls on a table. Yet all these substances can be wetted; that is, water
                    can be applied to them at such distances that they attract it</p>
                <p>What we lately remarked of water insinuating itself between the glass plates
                    without altogether destroying their cohesion, shows that this cohesion is not
                    the same that obtains between the particles of one of the plates; that is, the
                    two plates are not in the state of one continued mass. It is highly probable,
                    therefore, that between these two states there is an intermediate state of
                    repulsion, nay, perhaps, many such, alternated with attractive states.</p>
                <p>A piece of ice is elastic, for it rebounds and rings. Its particles, therefore,
                    when compressed, resile; and when<pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:chi.28490924&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=900" xml:id="kp-eb0720-0900-0754"/>
                    stretched, contract again. The particles are therefore in the state represented
                    by B in figure 1, acted on by repulsive forces if brought nearer, and by
                    attractive forces if drawn further asunder. Ice expands, like all other bodies,
                    by heat. It absorbs a vast quantity of fire, which, by combining its attractions
                    and repulsions with those of the particles of ice, changes completely the law of
                    action, and the ice becomes water. In this new state the particles are again in
                    limits between attractive and repulsive forces; for water has been shown, by the
                    experiments of Canton and Zimmerman, to be elastic or compressible. It again
                    expands by heat. It again absorbs a prodigious quantity of heat, and becomes
                    elastic vapour; its particles repelling each other at all distances yet
                    observed. The distance between the particles of one plate of glass and those of
                    another which lies on it, and is carried by it, is a distance of repulsion; for
                    the force which supports the upper piece is acting in opposition to its weight.
                    This distance is less than that at which it would <hi rend="italic">suspend</hi>
                    it below it with a silk fibre interposed; for no prismatic colours appear
                    between them when the silk fibre is interposed. But the distance at which glass
                    attracts water is much less than this, for no colours appear when glass is
                    wetted with water. This distance is less, and not greater, than the other; for
                    when the glasses have water interposed between them instead of air, it is found,
                    that when any particular colour appears, the thickness of the plate of water is
                    to that of the plate of air which would produce the same colour, nearly as three
                    to four. Now, if a piece of glass be wetted, and exhibit no colour, and another
                    piece of glass be simply laid on it, no colour will appear; but if they are
                    strongly pressed, the colours appear in the same manner as if the glasses had
                    air between. Also, when glass is simply wetted, and the film of water is allowed
                    to evaporate, when it is thus reduced to a proper thinness the colours show
                    themselves in great beauty.</p>
                <p>These are a few of many thousand facts, by which it is unquestionably proved that
                    the particles of tangible matter are connected by forces acting at a distance,
                    varying with the distance, and alternately attractive and repulsive. If we
                    represent these forces, as we have already done in fig. 1, by the ordinates Cc,
                    D <hi rend="italic">d</hi>, Ee, F <hi rend="italic">f, &amp;c. of</hi> a curve,
                    it is evident that this curve must cross the axis at all those distances where
                    the forces change from attractive to repulsive, and the curve must have branches
                    alternately above and below the axis.</p>
                <p>All these alternations of attraction and repulsion take place at small and
                    insensible distances. At all sensible distances the particles are influenced by
                    the attraction of gravitation; and therefore this part of the curve must be a
                    hyperbola whose equation is y=p∙ What is the form of the curve corresponding to
                    the smallest distance of the particles? that is, what is the mutual action
                    between the particles just before their coming into absolute contact? Analogy
                    should lead us to suppose it to be repulsion; for solidity is the last and
                    simplest form of bodies with which we are acquainted. Fluids are more
                    compounded, containing fire as an essential ingredient. We should conclude that
                    this ultimate repulsion is insuperable, for the hardest bodies are the most
                    elastic. We are fully entitled to say that this repelling force exceeds all that
                    we have ever yet applied to overcome it; nay, there are good reasons for saying
                    that this ultimate repulsion, by which the particles are kept from mathematical
                    contact, is really insuperable in its own nature, and that it is impossible to
                    produce mathematical contact.</p>
                <p>We shall just mention one of these, which we consider as unanswerable. Suppose
                    two atoms, or ultimate particles of matter, A and B. Let A be at rest, and B
                    move up to it with the velocity 2: and let us suppose that it comes into
                    mathematical contact, and impels it (according to the common acceptation of the
                    word). Both move with the velocity 1. This is granted by all to be the final
                    result of the collision. Now the instant of time in which this communication
                    happens is no part either of the duration of the solitary motion of A, nor of
                    the joint motion of A and B: it is the separation or boundary between them. It
                    is at once the end of the first and the beginning of the second, belonging
                    equally to both. A was moving with the volocity 2. The distinguishing
                    circumstance, therefore, of its mechanical state is, that it has a determination
                    (however incomprehensible) by which it would move for ever with the velocity 2,
                    if nothing changed it. This it has during the whole of its solitary motion, and
                    therefore in the last instant of this motion. In like manner, during the whole
                    of the joint motion, and therefore in the first instant of this motion, the atom
                    A has a determination by which it would move for ever with the velocity 1. In
                    one and the same instant, therefore, the atom A has two incompatible
                    determinations. Whatever notion we can form of this state, which we call
                    velocity, as a distinction of condition, the same impossibility of conception,
                    or the same absurdity, occurs. Nor can it be avoided in any other way than by
                    saying, that this change of A’s motion is brought about by insensible
                    gradations; that is, that A and B influence each other precisely as they would
                    do if a slender spring were interposed. The reader is desired to look at what we
                    have said in the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Physics.</hi></p>
                <p>The two magnets there spoken of are good representatives of two atoms endowed
                    with mutual powers of repulsion; and the communication of motion is accomplished
                    in both cases in precisely the same manner.</p>
                <p>If, therefore, we shall ever be so fortunate as to discover the law of variation
                    of that force which connects one <hi rend="italic">atom</hi> of matter with
                    another atom, and which is therefore characteristic of matter, and the ultimate
                    source of all its sensible qualities, the curve whose ordinates represent the
                    kind and the intensity of this atomical force will be something like that
                    sketched in fig. 2. The first branch <hi rend="italic">a n</hi> B will have</p>
                <p>AK (perpendicular to the axis AH) for its assymptote. and the last branch <hi
                    rend="italic">lino</hi> will be to all sense a hyperbola, having AO for its
                    assymptote; and the ordinates <hi rend="italic">l</hi> L, <hi rend="italic"
                    >m</hi> M, &amp;c. will be proportional to -ry—, <hi rend="strikethrough"
                    >L;</hi>, &amp;c. expressing the universal</p>
                <p>ALz ΑΛΙ*</p>
                <p>gravitation of matter. It will have many branches B <hi rend="italic">b</hi> C, D
                    <hi rend="italic">d</hi> E, F <hi rend="italic">f</hi> G, &amp;c. expressing

                    <hi rend="italic">e</hi> F, G <hi rend="italic">g</hi> H, &amp;c. All these will
                    be contained within a distance AH, which does not exceed a very minute fraction
                    of an inch.</p>
                <p>The simplest particle which can be a constituent of a body having length,
                    breadth, and thickness, must consist of four such atoms, all of which combine
                    their influence on each atom of another such particle. It is evident that the
                    curve which expresses the force that connects two such particles must be totally
                    different from this original curve, this hylarchic principle. Supposing the last
                    known, our mathematical knowledge is quite able to discover the first; but when
                    we proceed to conquise a body of particles, each of<pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:chi.28490924&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=901" xml:id="kp-eb0720-0901-0755"/>
                    which consiste of four such particles, we may venture to say that the compound
                    force which connects them is almost beyond our search, and that the discovery of
                    the primary force from an <hi rend="italic">accurate</hi> knowledge of the
                    corpuscular forces of <hi rend="italic">this</hi> particular matter is
                    absolutely out of our power.</p>
                <p>All that we can learn is, the possibility, nay, the certainty, of an innumerable
                    variety of external sensible forms and qualities, by which different kinds of
                    matter will be distinguished, arising from the number, the order of composition,
                    and the arrangement of the subordinate particles of which a particle of this or
                    that kind of matter is composed. All these varieties will take place at those
                    small and insensible distances which are between A and H, and may produce all
                    that variety which we observe in the tangible or mechanical forms of bodies,
                    such as elasticity, ductility, hardness, softness, fluidity, vapour, and all
                    those unseen motions or actions which we observe in fusion and congelation,
                    evaporation and condensation, solution and precipitation, crystallization,
                    vegetable and animal assimilation and secretion, &amp;c.; while all bodies must
                    be, in a certain degree, elastic, all must gravitate, and all must be
                    incompenetrable.</p>
                <p>This general and satisfactory resemblance between the appearance of tangible
                    matter and the legitimate consequence of this general hypothetical property of
                    an atom of matter, affords a considerable probability that such is the origin of
                    all the phenomena. We earnestly recommend to our readers a careful perusal of
                    Boscovich’s celebrated treatise. A careful perusal is necessary for seeing its
                    value; and nothing will be got by a hasty inspection. The rentier will be
                    particularly pleased with the facility and evidence with which the ingenious
                    author has deduced all the ordinary principles of mechanics, and with the
                    explanation which he has given of fluidity, and his deduction from thence of the
                    laws of hydrostatics. No part of the treatise is more valuable than the doctrine
                    of the propagation of pressure through solid bodies. This, however, is but just
                    touched on in the course of the investigation of the principles of mechanics. We
                    shall borrow as much as will suffice for our present inquiry into the strength
                    of materials; and we trust that our readers are not displeased with this general
                    sketch of the doctrine (if it may be so called) of the cohesion of bodies. It is
                    curious and important in itself, and is the foundation of all the knowledge
                    which we can acquire of the present article. We are sorry to say that it is as
                    yet a new subject of study; but it is a very promising one, and we by no means
                    despair of seeing the whole of chemistry brought by its means within the pale of
                    mechanical science. The great and distinguishing agent in chemistry is beat, or
                    fire the cause of heat; and one of its most singular effects is the conversion
                    of bodies into elastic vapour. We have the clearest evidence that this is
                    brought about by mechanical forces; for it can be opposed or prevented by
                    external pressure, a very familiar mechanical force. We may perhaps find another
                    mechanical force which will prevent fusion.</p>
                <p>Having now made our readers familiar with the mode of action in which cohesion
                    operates in giving strength to solid bodies, we proceed to consider the strains
                    to which this strength is opposed.</p>
                <p>A piece of solid matter is exposed to four kinds of strains, different in the
                    manner of their operation.</p>
                <p>1. It may be torn asunder, as in the case of ropes, stretchers, king-posts,
                    tie-beams, &amp;c.</p>
                <p>2. It may be crushed, as in the case of pillars, posts, and truss-beams.</p>
                <p>3. It may be broken across, as happens to a joist or lever of any kind.</p>
                <p>4. It may be wrenched or twisted, as in the case of the axle of a wheel, the nail
                    of a press, &amp;c.</p>
                <p>I. IT MAY BE PULLED ASUNDER.</p>
                <p>This is the simplest of all strains, and the others are indeed modifications of
                    it. To this the force of cohesion is <hi rend="italic">directly</hi> opposed,
                    with very little modification of its action by any particular circumstances.</p>
                <p>When a long cylindrical or prismatic body, such as a rod of wood or metal, or a
                    rope, is drawn by one end, it must be resisted at the other, in order to bring
                    its cohesion into action. When it is fastened at one end, we cannot conceive it
                    any other way than as equally stretched in all its parts; for all our
                    observations and experiments on natural bodies concur in showing us that the
                    forces which connect their particles in any way whatever are equal and opposite.
                    This is called the <hi rend="italic">third law of motion;</hi> and we admit its
                    universality, while we affirm that it is purely experimental. Yet we have met
                    with dissertations by persons of eminent knowledge, where propositions are
                    maintained inconsistent with this. During the dispute about the communication of
                    motion, some of the ablest writers have said, that a spring compressed or
                    stretched at the two ends was gradually less and less compressed or stretched
                    from the extremities towards the middle: but the same writers acknowledged the
                    universal equality of action and re-action, which is quite incompatible with
                    this state of the spring. No such inequality of compression or dilatation has
                    ever been observed; and a little reflection will show it to be impossible, in
                    consistency with the equality of action and re-action.</p>
                <p>Since all parts are thus equally stretched, it follows that the strain in any
                    transverse section is the same, as also in every point of that section. If
                    therefore the body be supposed of a homogeneous texture, the cohesion of the
                    parts is equable; and since every part is equally stretched, the particles are
                    drawn to equal distances from their quiescent positions, and the forces which
                    are thus excited, and now exerted in opposition to the straining force, are
                    equal. This external force may be increased by degrees, which will gradually
                    separate the parts of the body more and more from each other, and the connecting
                    forces increase with this increase of distance, till at last the cohesion of
                    some particles is overcome. This must be immediately followed by a rupture,
                    because the remaining forces are now weaker than before.</p>
                <p>It is the united force of cohesion, immediately before the disunion of the first
                    particles, that we call the <hi rend="italic">strength</hi> of the section. It
                    may also be properly called its <hi rend="italic">absolute strength,</hi> being
                    exerted in the simplest form, and not modified by any relation to other
                    circumstances.</p>
                <p>If the external force have not produced any permanent change on the body, and it
                    therefore recovers its former dimensions when the force is withdrawn, it is
                    plain that this strain may be repeated as often as we please, and the body which
                    withstands it once will always withstand it. It is evident that this should be
                    attended to in all constructions, and that in all our investigations on this
                    subject this should be kept strictly in view. When we treat a piece of soft clay
                    in this manner, and with this precaution, the force employed must be very small.
                    If we exceed this, we produce a permanent change. The rod of clay is not indeed
                    torn asunder, but it has become somewhat more slender; the number of particles
                    in a cross section is now smaller; and therefore, although it will again, in
                    this new form, suffer or allow an endless repetition of a <hi rend="italic"
                    >certain</hi> strain without any farther permanent change, this strain is
                    smaller than the former.</p>
                <p>Something of the same kind happens in all bodies which receive a <hi
                    rend="italic">set</hi> by the strain to which they are exposed. All ductile
                    bodies are of this kind. But there are many bodies which are not ductile. Such
                    bodies break completely whenever they are stretched beyond the limit of their
                    perfect elasticity. Bodies of a fibrous structure exhibit very great<pb
                    break="no" facs="ht:chi.28490924&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=902"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0720-0902-0756"/> varieties in their cohesion. In some the fibres
                    have no lateral cohesion, as in the case of a rope. The only way in which all
                    the fibres can be made to unite their strength, is to twist them together. This
                    causes them to bind each other so fast, that any one of them will break before
                    it can be drawn out of the bundle. In other fibrous bodies, such as timber, the
                    fibres are held together by some cement or gluten. This is seldom as strong as
                    the fibre. Accordingly timber is much easier pulled asunder in a direction
                    transverse to the fibres. There is, however, every possible variety in this
                    particular.</p>
                <p>In stretching and breaking fibrous bodies, the visible extension is frequently
                    very considerable. This is not solely the increasing of the distance of the
                    particles of the cohering fibre; the greatest part chiefly arises from drawing
                    the crooked fibre straight. In this, too, there is great diversity; and it is
                    accompanied with important differences in their power of withstanding a strain.
                    In some woods, such as fir, the fibres on which the strength most depends are
                    very straight. Such woods are commonly very elastic, do not take a set, and
                    break abruptly when overstrained: others, such as oak and birch, have their
                    resisting fibres very undulating and crooked, and stretch very sensibly by a
                    strain. They are very liable to take a set, and they do not break so suddenly,
                    but give warning by <hi rend="italic">complaining,</hi> as the carpenters call
                    it; that is, by giving visible signs of a derangement of texture. Hard bodies of
                    an uniform glassy structure, or granulated like stones, are elastic through the
                    whole extent of their cohesion, and take no set, but break at once when
                    overloaded.</p>
                <p>Notwithstanding the immense variety which nature exhibits in the structure and
                    cohesion of bodies, there are certain general facts of which we may now avail
                    ourselves with advantage. In particular,</p>
                <p>The absolute cohesion is proportional to the area of the section. This must be
                    the case where the texture is perfectly uniform, as we have reason to think it
                    is in glass and the ductile metals. The cohesion of each particle being alike,
                    the whole cohesion must be proportional to their number, that is, to the area of
                    the section. The same must be admitted with respect to bodies of a granulated
                    texture, where the granulation is regular and uniform. The same must be admitted
                    of fibrous bodies, if we suppose their fibres equally strong, equally dense, and
                    similarly disposed through the whole section; and this we must either suppose,
                    or must state the diversity, and measure the cohesion accordingly.</p>
                <p>We may therefore assert, as a general proposition on this subject, that the
                    absolute strength in any part of a body, by which it resists being pulled
                    asunder, or the force which must be employed to tear it asunder <hi
                    rend="italic">in that part,</hi> is proportional to the area of the section
                    perpendicular to the extending force.</p>
                <p>Therefore all cylindrical or prismatical rods are equally strong in every part,
                    and will break alike in any part; and bodies which have unequal sections will
                    always break in the slenderest part. The length of the cylinder or prism has no
                    effect on the strength. Also the absolute strengths of bodies which have similar
                    sections are proportional to the squares of their diameters or homologous sides
                    of the section.</p>
                <p>The weight of the body itself may be employed to strain it and to break it. It is
                    evident, that a rope may be so long as to break by its own weight. When the rope
                    is hanging perpendicularly, although it is equally strong in every part, it will
                    break towards the upper end, because the strain on any part is the weight of all
                    that is below it. Its <hi rend="italic">relative strength</hi> in any part, or
                    power of withstanding the strain which is actually laid on it, is inversely as
                    the quantity below that part.</p>
                <p>When the rope is stretched horizontally, as in towing a ship, the strain arising
                    from its weight often bears a very sensible proportion to its whole
                    strength.</p>
                <p>These are the chief general rules which can be safely deduced from our clearest
                    notions of the cohesion of bodies. In order to make any practical use of them,
                    it is proper to have some measures <hi rend="italic">of</hi> the cohesion of
                    such bodies as are commonly employed in our mechanics, and other structures
                    where they are exposed to this kind of strain. These must be deduced solely from
                    experiment; therefore they must be considered as no more than general values, or
                    as the averages of many particular trials. The irregularities are very great,
                    because none of the substances are constant in their texture and firmness.
                    Metals differ by a thousand circumstances unknown to us, according to their
                    purity, to the heat with which they were melted, to the moulds in which they
                    were cast, and the treatment they have afterwards received, by forging,
                    wire-drawing, tempering, &amp;c.</p>
                <p>It is a very curious and inexplicable fact, that by forging a metal, or by
                    frequently drawing it through a smooth hole in a steel plate, its cohesion is
                    greatly increased. This operation undoubtedly deranges the natural situation of
                    the particles. They are squeezed closer together in one direction, but it is not
                    in the direction in which they resist the fracture. In this direction they arc
                    rather separated to a greater distance. The general density, however, is
                    augmented in all of them except lead, which grows rather rarer by wire-drawing;
                    but its cohesion may be more than tripled by this operation. Gold, silver, and
                    brass, have their cohesion nearly tripled; copper and iron have it more than
                    doubled. In this operation they also grow much harder. It is proper to heat them
                    to redness after drawing a little. This is called <hi rend="italic">nealing</hi>
                    or <hi rend="italic">annealing.</hi> It softens the metal again, and renders it
                    susceptible of another drawing without the risk of cracking in the
                    operation.</p>
                <p>We do not pretend to give any explanation of this re-markuble and very important
                    fact, which has something resembling it in woods and other fibrous bodies, as
                    will be mentioned afterwards.</p>
                <p>The varieties in the cohesion of stones and other minerals, and of vegetable and
                    animal substances, are hardly susceptible of any description or
                    classification.</p>
                <p>We shall take for the measure of cohesion the number of pounds avoirdupois which
                    are just sufficient to tear asunder a rod or bundle of one inch square. From
                    this it will be easy to compute the strength corresponding to any other
                    dimension.</p>

                <p>It is very remarkable, that almost all the mixtures of metals are more tenacious
                    than the metals themselves. The change of tenacity depends much on the
                    proportion of the ingredients, and the proportion which produces the most
                    tenacious mixture is different in the different metals. We have selected the
                    following from the experiments of Muschenbroeck. The proportion of ingredients
                    here selected is that which produces the greatest strength.</p>

                <p>Four parts of tin with one of lead and one of zinc... 13,000</p>
                <p>These numbers are of considerable use in the arts. The mixtures of copper and tin
                    are particularly interesting in the fabric of great guns. We see that, by mixing
                    copper, whose greatest strength does not exceed 37,000, with tin, which does not
                    exceed 6000, we produce a metal whose tenacity is almost double, at the same
                    time that it is harder and more easily wrought. It is, however, more fusible,
                    which is a great inconvenience. We also see that a very small addition of zinc
                    almost doubles the tenacity of tin, and increases the tenacity of lead five
                    times; and a small addition of lead doubles the tenacity of tin. These are
                    economical mixtures. This is very valuable information to the plumbers, for
                    augmenting the strength of water-pipes.</p>
                <p>By having recourse to these tables, the engineer can proportion the thickness of
                    his pipes, of whatever metal, to the pressures to which they are exposed.</p>
                <p>2 <hi rend="italic">d, Woods.</hi></p>
                <p>We may premise to this part of the table the following general observations.</p>
                <p>1. The wood immediately surrounding the pith or heart of the tree is the weakest,
                    and its inferiority is so much more remarkable as the tree is older. In this
                    assertion, however, we speak with some hesitation. Muschenbroeck’s <hi
                    rend="italic">detail</hi> of experiments is decidedly in the affirmative. Μ.
                    Buffon, on the other hand, says that his experience has taught him that the
                    heart of a sound tree is the strongest; but he gives no instances. From many
                    observations of our own on very <hi rend="italic">large</hi> oaks and firs, we
                    are certain that the heart is much weaker than the exterior parts.</p>
                <p>2. The wood next the bark, commonly called the <hi rend="italic">white</hi> or
                    <hi rend="italic">blea,</hi> is also weaker than the rest; and the wood
                    gradually increases in strength as we recede from the centre to the blea.</p>
                <p>3. The wood is stronger in the middle of the trunk than at the springing of the
                    branches or at the root; and the wood of the branches is weaker than that of the
                    trunk.</p>
                <p>4. The wood of the north side of all trees which grow in our European climates is
                    the weakest, and that of the southeast side is the strongest; and the difference
                    is most remarkable in hedge-row trees, and such as grow singly. The heart of a
                    tree is never in its centre, but always nearer to the north side, and the annual
                    coats of wood are thinner on that side. In conformity with this, it is a general
                    opinion of carpenters that timber is stronger whose annual plates are thicker.
                    The trachea or air-vessels are weaker than the simple ligneous fibres. The
                    air-vessels are the same in diameter and number of rows in trees of the same
                    species, and they make the visible separation between the annual plates.
                    Therefore, when these are thicker, they contain a greater proportion of the
                    simple ligneous fibres.</p>
                <p>5. All woods are more tenacious while green, and lose very considerably by drying
                    after the trees are felled.</p>
                <p>The only author who has put it in our power to judge of the propriety of his
                    experiments is Muschenbroeck. He has described his method of trial minutely, and
                    it seems unexceptionable. The woods were all formed into slips fit for his
                    apparatus, and part of the slip was cut away to a parallelopiped of <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 1</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"> 5</hi> th of an inch square,
                    and therefore <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"> 5</hi> th
                    of a square inch in section. The absolute strengths of a square inch were as

                <p>Muschenbroeck has given a very minute detail of the experiments on the ash and
                    the walnut, stating the weights which were required to tear asunder slips taken
                    from the four sides of the tree, and on each side, in a regular progression from
                    the centre to the circumference. The number of this table corresponding to these
                    two timbers may therefore be considered as the average of more than fifty trials
                    made of each; and he says that all the others were made with the same care. We
                    cannot therefore see any reason for not confiding in the results; yet they are
                    considerably higher than those given by some other writers. Mr Pitot, on the
                    authority of his own experiments, and of those of Mr Parent, avers that sixty
                    pounds will just tear asunder a square line of sound oak, and that it will bear
                    fifty with safety. This gives 8640 for the utmost strength of a square inch,
                    which is much inferior to Muschenbroeck’s valuation.</p>
                <p>We may add to these,</p>
                <p>Ivory 16,270</p>
                <p>Bone 5,250</p>
                <p>Hom 8,750</p>
                <p>Whalebone 7,500</p>
                <p>Tooth of sea-calf. 4,075</p>
                <p>The reader will surely observe, that these numbers express something more than
                    the utmost cohesion; for the weights are such as will very quickly, that is, in
                    a minute or two, tear the rods asunder. It may be said in general, that two
                    thirds of these weights will sensibly impair the strength after a considerable
                    while, and that one half is the utmost that can remain suspended at them without
                    risk for ever; and it is upon this last allotment that the engineer should
                    reckon in his constructions. There is, however, considerable difference in this
                    respect. Woods of a very straight<pb break="no"

                    fibre, such as fir, will be less impaired by any load which is not sufficient to
                    break them immediately.</p>
                <p>According to Mr Emerson, the load which may be safely suspended to an inch square
                    is as follows:</p>
                <p>Iron 76,400</p>
                <p>Brass 35,600</p>

                    follows:</p>

                <p>Good rope 22</p>
                <p>Oak..... 14</p>
                <p>Fir 9 } cwt.</p>
                <p>The rank which the different woods hold in this list of Mr Emerson’s is very
                    different from what we find in Muschenbroeck’s. But precise measures must not be
                    expected in this matter. It is wonderful, that in a matter of such
                    unquestionable importance the public has not enabled some persons of judgment to
                    make proper trials. They are beyond the abilities of private persons.</p>
                <p>II.—BODIES MAY BE CRUSHED.</p>
                <p>It is of equal, perhaps greater, importance to know the strain which may be laid
                    on solid bodies without danger of crushing them. Pillars and posts of all kinds
                    are exposed to this strain in its simplest form; and there are cases where the
                    strain is enormous, viz. where it arises from the oblique position of the parts,
                    as in the struts, braces, and trusses, which occur very frequently in our great
                    works. It is therefore most desirable to have some general knowledge of the
                    principle which determines the strength of bodies, in opposition to this kind of
                    strain. But, unfortunately, we are much more at a loss in this than in the last
                    case. The mechanism of nature is, in the present case, much more complicated. It
                    must be in some circuitous way that compression can have any tendency to tear
                    asunder the parts of a solid body, and it is very difficult to trace the
                    steps.</p>
                <p>If we suppose the particles insuperably hard and in contact, and disposed in
                    lines which are in the direction of the external pressures, it does not appear
                    how any pressure can disunite the particles; but this is a gratuitous
                    supposition. There are infinite odds against this precise arrangement of the
                    lines of particles; and the compressibility of all kinds of matter in some
                    degree shows that the particles are in a situation equivalent to distance. This
                    being the case, and the particles, with their intervals, or what is equivalent
                    to intervals, being in situations that are oblique with respect to the
                    pressures, it must follow, that by squeezing them together in one direction,
                    they are made to bulge out or separate in other directions. This may proceed so
                    far that some may be thus pushed laterally beyond their limits of cohesion. The
                    moment that this happens the resistance to compression is diminished, and the
                    body will now be crushed together. We may form some notion of this by supposing
                    a number of spherules, like small shot, sticking together by means of a cement.
                    Compressing this in some particular direction causes the spherules to act among
                    each other like so many wedges, each tending to penetrate through between the
                    three which lie below it: and this is the simplest, and perhaps the only
                    distinct, notion we can have of the matter. We have reason to think that the
                    constitution of very homogeneous bodies, such as glass, is not very different
                    from this.</p>
                <p>If this be the constitution of bodies, it appears probable that the strength, or
                    the resistance which they are capable of making to an attempt to crush them to
                    pieces, is proportional to the area of the section whose plane is perpendicular
                    to the external force; for each particle being similarly and equally acted on
                    and resisted, the whole resistance must be as their number, that is, as the
                    extent of the section.</p>
                <p>Accordingly this principle is assumed by the few writers who have considered the
                    subject; but we confess that it appears to us very doubtful. Suppose a number of
                    brittle or friable balls lying on a table uniformly arranged, but not cohering
                    nor in contact, and that a board is laid over them and loaded with a weight; we
                    have no hesitation in saying that the weight necessary to crush the whole
                    collection is proportional to their number or to the area of the section. But
                    when they are in contact, and still more if they cohere, we imagine that the
                    case is materially altered. Any individual ball is crushed only in consequence
                    of its being bulged outwards in the direction perpendicular to the pressure
                    employed. If this could be prevented by a hoop put round the ball like an
                    equator, we cannot see how any force can crush it. Any thing therefore which
                    makes this bulging outwards more difficult, makes a greater force necessary. Now
                    this effect will be produced by the mere contact of the balls before the
                    pressure is applied; for the central ball cannot swell outward laterally without
                    pushing away the balls on all sides of it. This is prevented by the friction on
                    the table and upper board, which is at least equal to one third of the pressure.
                    Thus any interior ball becomes stronger by the mere vicinity of the others; and
                    if we further suppose them to cohere laterally, we think that its strength will
                    be still more increased.</p>
                <p>The analogy between these balls and the cohering particles of a friable body is
                    very perfect. We should therefore expect that the strength by which it resists
                    being crushed will increase in a greater ratio than that of the section, or the
                    square of the diameter of similar sections; and that a square inch of any matter
                    will bear a greater weight in proportion as it makes a part of a greater
                    section. Accordingly this appears in many experiments, as will afterwards be
                    noticed. Muschenbroeck, Euler, and some others, have supposed the strength of
                    columns to be as the biquadrates of their diameters. Euler deduced this from
                    formulae which occurred to him in the course of his algebraic analysis; and he
                    boldly adopts it as a principle, without looking tor its foundation in the
                    physical assumptions which he had made in the beginning of his investigation.
                    But some of his original assumptions were as paradoxical, or at least as
                    gratuitous, as these results; and those, in particular, from which this
                    proportion of the strength of columns “as deduced, were almost foreign to the
                    case; and therefore the inference was of no value. Yet it was received as a
                    principle by Muschenbroeck and by the academicians of St Petersburg. We make
                    these very few observations, because the subject is of great practical
                    importance; and it is a great obstacle to improvements when deference to a great
                    name, joined to incapacity or indolence, causes authors to adopt his careless
                    reveries as principles from which they are afterwards to draw important
                    consequences. It must be acknowledged that we have not as yet established, on
                    solid mechanical principles, the relation between the dimensions and the
                    strength of a pillar. Experience plainly contradicts the general opinion, that
                    the strength is proportional to the area of the section; but it is still more
                    inconsistent with the opinion, that it is in the quadruplicate ratio of the
                    diameters of similar sections. It would seem that the ratio depends much on the
                    internal structure of the body; and experiment seems the only method for
                    ascertaining its general laws.<pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:chi.28490924&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=905" xml:id="kp-eb0720-0905-0759"/>
                    If we suppose the body to be of a fibrous texture, having the fibres situated in
                    the direction of the pressure, and slightly adhering to each other by some kind
                    of cement, such a body will fail only by the bending of the fibres, by which
                    they will break the cement and be detached from each other. Something like this
                    may be supposed in wooden pillars. In such cases, too, it would appear that the
                    resistance must be as the number of equally resisting fibres, and as their
                    mutual support, jointly; and, therefore, as some function of the area of the
                    section. The same thing must happen if the fibres be naturally crooked or
                    undulated, as is observed in many woods, provided we suppose some similarity in
                    their form. Similarity of some kind must always be supposed, otherwise we need
                    never aim at any general inferences.</p>
                <p>In all cases therefore we can hardly refuse admitting that the strength in
                    opposition to compression is proportional to a function of the area of the
                    section.</p>
                <p>As the whole length of a cylinder or prism is equally pressed, it does not appear
                    that the strength of a pillar is at all affected by its length. If indeed it be
                    supposed to bend under the pressure, the case is greatly changed, because it is
                    then exposed to a transverse strain; and this increases with the length of the
                    pillar. But this will be considered with due attention under the next class of
                    strains.</p>
                <p>Few experiments have been made on this species of strength and strain. Mr Pitot
                    says that his experiments and those of Mr Parent show that the force necessary
                    for crushing a body is nearly equal to that which will tear it asunder. He says
                    that it requires something more than sixty pounds on every square line to crush
                    a piece of sound oak. But the rule is by no means general: glass, for instance,
                    will carry a hundred times as much as oak in this way, that is, resting on it;
                    but will not <hi rend="italic">suspend</hi> four or five times as much. Oak will
                    suspend a great deal more than fir; but fir, as a pillar, will carry twice as
                    much. Woods of a soft texture, although consisting of very tenacious fibres, are
                    more easily crushed by their load. This soilness of texture is chiefly owing to
                    their fibres not being straight but undulated, and there being considerable
                    vacuities between them, so that they are easily bent laterally and crushed. When
                    a post is overstrained by its load, it is observed to swell sensibly in
                    diameter. Increasing the load causes longitudinal cracks or shivers to appear,
                    and it presently after gives way. This is called <hi rend="italic"
                    >crippling.</hi></p>
                <p>In all cases where the fibres lie oblique to the strain, the strength is greatly
                    diminished, because the parts can then be made to slide on each other when the
                    cohesion of the cementing matter is overcome.</p>
                <p>Muschenbroeck has given some experiments on this subject; but they are cases of
                    long pillars, and therefore do not belong to this place. They will be considered
                    afterwards.</p>
                <p>The only experiments of which we have seen any detail (and it is useless to

                <p>Little can be deduced from these experiments: the first and third, compared with
                    the fifth and sixth, should furnish similar results; for the first and fifth are
                    respectively half of the third and sixth; but the third is three times stronger
                    (that is, a line of the third) than the first, whereas the sixth is only twice
                    as strong as the fifth.</p>
                <p>It is evident, however, that the strength increases much faster than the area of
                    the section, and that a square line can carry more and more weight, according as
                    it makes a part of a larger and larger section. In this series of experiments on
                    the soft stone, the individual strength of a square line seems to increase
                    nearly in the proportion of the section of which it makes a part.</p>
                <p>Mr Gauthey deduces, from the whole of his numerous experiments, that a pillar of
                    hard stone of Givry, whose section is a square foot, will bear with perfect
                    safety 664,000 pounds, and that its extreme strength is 871,000; and the
                    smallest strength observed in any of his experiments was 460,000. The soft bed
                    of Givry stone had for its smallest strength 187,000, for its greatest 311,000,
                    and for its safe load 249,000. Good brick will carry with safety 320,000; chalk
                    will carry only 9000. The boldest piece of architecture in this respect which he
                    has seen is a pillar in the church of All-Saints at Angers. It is twenty-four
                    feet long and eleven inches square, and is loaded with 60,000, which is not one
                    seventh of what is necessary for crushing it.</p>
                <p>We may observe here by the way, that Mr Gauthey’s measure of the suspending
                    strength of stone is vastly small in proportion to its power of supporting a
                    load laid above it. He finds that a prism of the hard bed of Givry, of a foot
                    section, is torn asunder by 4600 pounds; and if it be firmly fixed horizontally
                    in a wall, it will be broken by a weight of 56,000 suspended a foot from the
                    wall. If it rest on two props at a foot distance, it will be broken by 206,000
                    laid on its middle. These experiments agree so ill with each other, that little
                    use can be made of them. The subject is of great importance, and well deserves
                    the attention of the patriotic philosopher.</p>
                <p>A set of good experiments would be very valuable, because it is against this kind
                    of strain that we must guard by judicious construction in the most delicate and
                    difficult problems which come through the hands of the civil and military
                    engineer. The construction of stone arches, and the construction of great wooden
                    bridges, and particularly the construction of the frames of carpentry called <hi
                    rend="italic">centres</hi> in the erection of stone bridges, are the most
                    difficult jobs that occur. In the centres on which the arches of the bridge of
                    Orleans were built, some of the pieces of oak were carrying upwards of two tons
                    on every square inch of their scantling. All who saw it said that it was not
                    able to carry the fourth part of the intended load. But the engineer understood
                    the principles of his art, and ran the risk, and the result completely justified
                    his confidence; for the centre did not complain in any part, only it was found
                    too supple; so that it went out of shape while the haunches only of the arch
                    were laid on it. The engineer corrected this by loading it at the crown, and
                    thus kept it completely in shape during the progress of the work.</p>
                <p>In the Memoirs of the Academy of St Petersburg for<pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:chi.28490924&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=906" xml:id="kp-eb0720-0906-0760"/>
                    1778, there is a dissertation by Euler on this subject, but particularly limited
                    to the strain on columns, in which the bending is taken into the account. Mr
                    Fuss has treated the same subject with relation to carpentry in a subsequent
                    volume. But there is little in these papers besides a dry mathematical
                    disquisition, proceeding on assumptions which (to speak favourably) are
                    extremely gratuitous. The most important consequence of the compression is
                    wholly overlooked, as we shall presently see. Our knowledge of the mechanism of
                    cohesion is as yet far too imperfect to entitle us to a confident application of
                    mathematics. Experiments should be multiplied.</p>
                <p>The only way in which we can hope to make these experiments useful, is to pay a
                    careful attention to the <hi rend="italic">manner</hi> in which the fracture is
                    produced. By discovering the general resemblances in this particular, we advance
                    a step in our power of introducing mathematical measurement. Thus, when a
                    cubical piece of chalk is slowly crushed between the chaps of a vice, we see it
                    uniformly split in a surface oblique to the pressure, and the two parts then
                    slide along the surface of fracture. This should lead us to examine
                    mathematically what relation there is between this surface of fracture and the
                    necessary force; then we should endeavour to determine experimentally the
                    position of this surface. Having discovered some general law or resemblance in
                    this circumstance, we should try what mathematical hypothesis will agree with
                    this. Having found one, we may then apply our simplest notions of cohesion, and
                    compare the result of our computations with experiment.</p>
                <p>III. A BODY MAY BE BROKEN ACROSS.</p>
                <p>The most usual, and the greatest strain, to which materials are exposed, is that
                    which tends to break them transversely. It is seldom, however, that this is done
                    in a manner perfectly simple; for when a beam projects horizontally from a wall,
                    and a weight is suspended from its extremity, the beam is commonly broken near
                    the wall, and the intermediate part has performed the functions of a lever. It
                    sometimes, though rarely, happens that the pin in the joint of a pair of pincers
                    or scissors is cut through by the strain; and this is almost the only case of a
                    simple transverse fracture. Being so rare, we may content ourselves with saying,
                    that in this case the strength of the piece is proportional to the area of the
                    section.</p>
                <p>Experiments were made for discovering the resistances made by bodies to this kind
                    of strain in the following manner. Two iron bars were disposed horizontally at
                    an inch distance; a third hung perpendicularly between them, being supported by
                    a pin made of the substance to be examined. This pin was made of a prismatic
                    form, so as to fit exactly the holes in the three bars, which were made very
                    exact, and of the same size and shape. A scale was suspended at the lower end of
                    the perpendicular bar, and loaded till it tore out that part of the pin which
                    filled the middle hole. This weight was evidently the measure of the lateral
                    cohesion of two sections. The side-bars were made to grasp the middle bar pretty
                    strongly between them, that there might be no distance interposed between the
                    opposite pressures. This would have combined the energy of a lever with the
                    purely transverse pressure. For the same reason it was necessary that the
                    internal parts of the holes should be no smaller than the edges. Great
                    irregularities occurred in our first experiments from this cause, because the
                    pins were somewhat tighter within than at the edges; but when this was corrected
                    they were extremely regular. We employed three sets of holes, viz. a circle, a
                    squire (which was occasionally made a rectangle whose length was twice its
                    breadth), and an equilateral triangle. We found in alt our experiments the
                    strength exactly proportional to the area of the section, and quite independent
                    of its figure or position, and we found it considerably above the direct
                    cohesion; that is, it took considerably more than twice the force to tear out
                    this middle piece that it did to tear the pin asunder by a direct pull. A piece
                    of fine freestone required 205 pounds to pull it directly asunder, and 575 to
                    break it in this way. The difference was very constant in any one substance, but
                    varied from four thirds to six thirds in different kinds of matter, being
                    smallest in bodies of a fibrous texture. But indeed we could not make the trial
                    on any bodies of considerable cohesion, because they required such forces as our
                    apparatus could not support. Chalk, clay baked in the sun, baked sugar, brick,
                    and freestone, were the strongest that we could examine.</p>
                <p>But the more common case, where the energy of a lever intervenes, demands a
                    minute examination. <hi rend="smallcaps">(b. b. b.)</hi></p>
                <p>Let ABCD (fig. 3) be the longitudinal section of a beam inserted into a wall at
                    the end AD, and supporting a weight at the free end BC: it is required to find
                    what tendency the weight will have to break the beam over at the section EF.</p>
                <p>The weight at C will, in the first place, cause a tendency of the part EBCF to
                    slide down on the surface EF, but the strength of the beam in resisting this
                    kind of dislocation is much greater than its power of resisting common fracture:
                    it is therefore unnecessary to examine this case.</p>
                <p>The weight at C will cause the beam to bend; that is, it will distend the upper
                    and compress the under part of the beam, and, acting at the extremity of the
                    lever FC, its power of causing such compression and distention will be W× FC.
                    Since the weight at C acts in a vertical direction, it cannot tend either to
                    lengthen or to shorten the beam, and thus the repulsion of the compressed part
                    must be exactly equal to the attraction of the distended parts.</p>
                <p>Let G be the neutral point, and draw through it the line <hi rend="italic"
                    >fGe,</hi> contiguous to FGE; draw also H <hi rend="italic">h</hi> and I <hi
                    rend="italic">i</hi> parallel to CD. The lines It, in the under side of the
                    cross section, will represent the degrees of compression, and also (since within
                    the limits of security the repulsion is proportional to the degree of
                    compression) the force of repulsion, while the lines H <hi rend="italic">h</hi>
                    on the upper side will serve to represent the attractions. The sum of all the
                    lines on the upper side, that is, the wedge EG <hi rend="italic">c</hi>, will
                    thus represent the entire amount of attraction, while the wedge FG <hi
                    rend="italic">f</hi> will represent the total amount of repulsion. These two
                    wedges, then, must be equal to each other; and this equality determines the
                    position of the Axis of flexure represented by the point G. In the case of a
                    rectangular beam, G must clearly be in the middle of the line EF; but when the
                    cross section of the beam is irregular, the position of the axis of flexure is
                    not quite so easily found.</p>
                <p>Let EF be the cross section of an irregular beam, and OH the axis of flexure, or
                    the place where the beam is neither compressed nor distended. Then the wedges
                    generated by turning the section EF upon OH as an axis must be equal to each
                    other. This is always the case when OH passes through the centre of gravity of
                    the cross section, and thus it follows that those points which are neither
                    compressed nor distended are always ranged in a straight line drawn through the
                    centre of gravity of the cross section.<pb break="no"

                    The position of the fulcrum of the lever being now known, we can proceed to
                    ascertain the effects of the various forces.</p>
                <p>Returning, for the sake of simplicity, to the rectangular beam; the sum of the
                    repulsions <hi rend="italic">i</hi> I will be represented by the triangle G <hi
                    rend="italic">f</hi> F: but the rectangle under GF and <hi rend="italic">Ff</hi>
                    would measure the entire strength of the under half of the beam, and therefore
                    the force actually exerted when the beam is about to be broken across, is just
                    half of the absolute strength of the beam; one quarter being exhibited as
                    attraction, another quarter as repulsion. These forces act at different
                    distances from the fulcrum G, and it is well known that the influence of a
                    number of weights in turning a lever round is the same as if all these weights
                    were to act at their common centre of gravity; so that to find the entire action
                    in this case, we have to suppose one fourth of the whole strength of the beam to
                    act at the distance <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> / <hi rend="subscript">
                    3</hi> of GF or <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi> of
                    EF from the fulcrum G, and another quarter of the strength at <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 2</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi> of GE. Now, if <hi
                    rend="italic">s</hi> be the strength of one square inch of the beam, and if D,
                    B, and L be its depth, breadth, and length, measured in inches, DBs will be the
                    absolute strength of the whole beam; and therefore the tendencies of the above
                    forces to straighten the beam will be ¼DB <hi rend="italic">s</hi> × <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 1</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi> D +¼DB <hi

                    tendency of the weight W to bend the beam is W L; so that <hi rend="superscript"

                <p>Throughout this investigation we have supposed that the force needed to extend or
                    compress a fibre is exactly proportional to the quantity of extension or
                    compression. This hypothesis, though not perhaps strictly true, and though it
                    certainly errs when we approach to dislocation or fracture, is yet confirmed by
                    all experiments when the extensions have been kept within the limits of safety:
                    the results of this hypothesis therefore are what must guide us in forming any
                    structure.</p>
                <p>It may now be interesting to inquire into the strength of a beam when bent in
                    different directions.</p>
                <p>EF being, as before, the cross section of an irregular beam, let that beam he
                    bent in the direction OG, the axis of flexure being OH perpendicular to OG; and
                    let us consider the action of a small portion <hi rend="italic">ds</hi> of the
                    surface situated at I. Having drawn the perpendiculars IK and IL, it is clear
                    that the compression of the fibre I must be proportional to KI; and therefore
                    the force exerted by it may be denoted by C ∙ IK ∙ <hi rend="italic">ds,</hi> C
                    being some constant depending on the nature of the material and the degree of
                    flexure. This force, conceived to act at the extremity of the lever KI, will
                    tend to bend the beam round the axis OH; but again acting at the end of the
                    lever LI, it will tend to bend the beam on OG as an axis. Putting 2 to denote
                    the integral for the entire surface, C∙Σ·IK <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">ds</hi> will be the entire tendency to rectify the form of the
                    beam, and CΣIK ∙ IL∙ <hi rend="italic">ds</hi> will be the entire tendency to
                    take a flexure in a plane at right angles to that which it actually has. A beam
                    therefore will not bend in the direction in which the pressure is applied to it
                    unless 2∙IK∙ IL <hi rend="italic">ds</hi> = 0. This is a circumstance overlooked
                    in all treatises on flexure; but it is one that must be carefully attended to in
                    practice. It may easily be illustrated thus: Take a thin slip of wood, such
                    perhaps as is used for Venetian blinds, and fix it in a vice so that while its
                    length is horizontal its flat sides may be inclined at a considerable angle.
                    Attach now a weight to the free end, and it will be found that that end does not
                    descend vertically, but that it moves obliquely, the flexure not happening in
                    that direction in which the force is applied. The force necessary to bend the
                    beam in the plane of OG is not a force in that direction, but is the resultant
                    of two forces, Σ IK <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> ∙ <hi rend="italic">ds</hi>
                    in the direction OG, and 2 ∙ IK ∙ IL ∙ <hi rend="italic">ds</hi> in the
                    direction OH. For the present we shall call ΣIK <hi rend="superscript">
                    2</hi><hi rend="italic">ds</hi> the <hi rend="italic">stiffness in the
                    direction</hi> OG, and ∑∙ IL <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >ds</hi> of course the stiffness in the direction OH. The sum of these two
                    stiffnesses is manifestly Σ · OI <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >ds</hi>, which is a constant quantity, depending not at all upon the directions
                    of OG, OH, but only on the form of the cross section: hence follows the
                    remarkable law, that the sum of the stiffnesses of a beam in two directions
                    perpendicular to each other is constant; and that therefore, whatever may be the
                    form of the beam, its directions of greatest and least stiffness are always
                    perpendicular to each other.</p>
                <p>For the purpose of discovering in what directions the greatest and least
                    stiffness lie, let us refer all the points in the cross section to the axes OX
                    and O Y, putting the angle XOG = <hi rend="italic">φ.</hi> We have then IK = <hi
                    rend="italic">x</hi> cos. <hi rend="italic">φ -∣- y</hi> sin. <hi rend="italic"
                    >φ,</hi> IL =— a: sin. <hi rend="italic">φ.</hi> p <hi rend="italic">y</hi> cos.
                    p; and thus the tendency of the beam to redress itself in the direction GO is
                    2∙(<hi rend="italic">x</hi> cos. P + <hi rend="italic">y</hi> sin. <hi
                    rend="italic">φ ds,</hi> while the deflecting tendency in the direction HO is Σ·
                    (* cos. <hi rend="italic">φ</hi>-f- <hi rend="italic">y</hi> sin. <hi
                    rend="italic">φ) (— x</hi> sin. <hi rend="italic">φ</hi> + <hi rend="italic"
                    >y</hi> cos. <hi rend="italic">φ) ds.</hi> Regarding <hi rend="italic">φ</hi> as
                    the variable quantity, and differentiating the former for the purpose of
                    discovering its maximum, we obtain 2∙(z cos. 0 + y sin. <hi rend="italic">φ)
                    (—x</hi> sin. φ <hi rend="italic">+ y</hi> cos. <hi rend="italic">φ)</hi> ds= 0;
                    now it will be observed that this expression is just that for the deflecting
                    tendency, and hence this law, <hi rend="italic">That when a beam is bent in the
                    direction of greatest or of least stiffness, the pressure to be applied is
                    exactly in the direction of the betiding.</hi></p>
                <p>The value of <hi rend="italic">φ</hi> may easily be found from the above
                    equation; the result is <hi rend="italic">„ 2 S∙ x∣∕ ds</hi> tan. 2 ® = ——∙— <hi
                    rend="italic">'—-χ-r-.</hi><hi rend="italic superscript"> r</hi><hi

                <p>The lines. OX and OY will coincide with the directions of greatest and least
                    stiffness when p = 0, or when tan. 2 <hi rend="italic">φ =</hi> 0, that is, when
                    Σ <hi rend="italic">∙ xy ds = 0.</hi></p>
                <p>If, then, the directions of greatest and least stiffness be taken for the axes of
                    <hi rend="italic">xy</hi> and of <hi rend="italic">y,</hi> we shall have 2 ∙ <hi
                    rend="italic">xy ds</hi> = 0, 2 <hi rend="italic">x</hi><hi rend="italic

                    other direction, as well as the deflecting tendency, can readily be obtained.
                    Putting P and Q respectively for these quantities, we have</p>
                <p>P = A cos. <hi rend="italic">φ</hi><hi rend="italic superscript"> 2</hi> + B sin.
                    p <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi>,</p>
                <p>Q = ½ (B— A ) sin. 2 φ.</p>
                <p>The deflecting tendency is thus greatest when <hi rend="italic">φ =</hi> 45°,
                    that is, when the actual direction of flexure is equally inclined to the
                    directions of greatest and least stiffness. In this case P <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 1</hi> = ½ (A+B), Q = ½(B-A).</p>
                <p>Galileo, who was the first to investigate the law of transverse strain, conceived
                    the lower edge of the beam to be the fulcrum, and each fibre to be exerting its
                    whole strength; Professor Robison, in the former editions of this work,
                    corrected the supposition in the case of rectangular beams: the above
                    investigation extends it to beams of all forms. (c. E.)</p>
                <p>We must now remark, that this correction of the Galilean hypothesis of equal
                    forces was suggested by the bending which is observed in all bodies which are
                    strained transversely. Because they are bent, the fibres on the convex side have
                    been extended. We cannot say in what proportion this obtains in the different
                    fibres. Our most distinct notions of the internal equilibrium between the
                    particles render it highly probable that their extension is proportional to
                    their distance from that fibre which retains its former dimensions. But by
                    whatever law this is regulated, we see plainly that the actions of the stretched
                    fibres must follow the proportions of some function of this distance, and that
                    therefore the relative strength of a beam is in all cases susceptible of
                    mathematical determination.<pb break="no"

                    We also see an intimate connection between the strain and the curvature. This
                    suggested to the celebrated James Bernoulli the problem of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >elastic curve, i. e.</hi> the curve into which an extensible rigid body will be
                    bent by a transverse strain. His solution in the <hi rend="italic">Acta
                    Eruditorum</hi> 1694 and 1695, is a very beautiful specimen of mathematical
                    discussion, and we recommend it to the perusal of the curious reader. He will
                    find it very perspicuously treated in the first volume of his works, published
                    after his death, where the wide steps which he had taken in his investigation
                    are explained so as to be easily comprehended. His nephew, Daniel Bernoulli, has
                    given an elegant abridgement in the Petersburg Memoirs for 1729. The problem is
                    too intricate to be fully discussed in a work like ours, but it is also too
                    intimately connected with our present subject to be entirely omitted. We must
                    content ourselves with showing the leading mechanical properties of this curve,
                    from which the mathematician may deduce all its geometrical properties.</p>
                <p>When a bar of uniform depth and breadth, and of a given length, is bent into an
                    arch of a circle, the extension of the outer fibres is proportional to the
                    curvature; for, because the curves formed by the inner and outer sides of the
                    beam are similar, the circumferences are as the radii, and the radius of the
                    inner circle is to the difference of the radii as the length of the inner
                    circumference is to the difference of the circumferences. The difference of the
                    radii is the depth of the beam, the difference of the circumferences is the
                    extension of the outer fibres, and the inner circumference is supposed to be the
                    primitive length of the beam. Now the second and third quantities of the above
                    analogy, viz. the depth and length of the beam, are constant quantities, as is
                    also their product. Therefore the product of the inner radius and the extension
                    of the outer fibre is also a constant quantity, and the whole extension of the
                    outer fibre is inversely as the radius of curvature, or is directly as the
                    curvature of the beam.</p>
                <p>The mathematical reader will readily see, that into whatever curve the elastic
                    bar is bent, the whole extension of the outer fibre is equal to the length of a
                    similar curve having the same proportion to the thickness of the beam that the
                    length of the beam has to the radius of curvature.</p>
                <p>Now let ADCB (fig. 5) be such a rod of uniform breadth and thickness, firmly
                    fixed in a vertical position, and bent into a curve AEFB by a weight W suspended
                    at B, and of such magnitude that the extremity B has its tangent perpendicular
                    to the action of the weight, or parallel to. the horizon. Suppose, too, that the
                    extensions are proportional to the extending forces. From any two points E and F
                    draw the horizontal ordinates EG, FH. It is evident that the exterior fibres of
                    the sections Ee and F <hi rend="italic">f</hi> are stretched by forces which are
                    in the proportion of EG to FH (these being the long arms of the levers, and the
                    equal thicknesses Ee, F <hi rend="italic">f</hi> being the short arms).
                    Therefore (by the hypothesis) their extensions are in the same proportion. But
                    because the extensions are proportional to some similar functions of the
                    distance from the axes of fracture E and F, the extension of any fibre in the
                    section Ee is to the contemporaneous extension of the similarly situated fibre
                    in the section <hi rend="italic">Ff,</hi> as the extension of the exterior fibre
                    in the section Ee is to the extension of the exterior fibre in the section <hi
                    rend="italic">Ff:</hi> therefore the whole extension of Ee is to the whole
                    extension of <hi rend="italic">Ff</hi> as EG to FH, and EG is to FH as the
                    curvature in E to the curvature in F.</p>
                <p>Here let it be remarked, that this proportionality of the curvature to the
                    extension of the fibres is not limited to the hypothesis of the proportionality
                    of the extensions to the extending forces: it follows from the extension in the
                    different sections being as some similar function of the distance from the axis
                    of fracture; an assumption which cannot be refused.</p>
                <p>This, then, is the fundamental property of the elastic curve, from which its
                    equation, or relation between the abscissa and ordinate, may be deduced in the
                    usual forms, and all its other geometrical properties. These are foreign to our
                    purpose; and we shall notice only such properties as have an immediate relation
                    to the strain and strength of the different parts of a flexible body, and which
                    in particular serve to explain some difficulties in the valuable experiments of
                    Buffon on the Strength of Beams.</p>
                <p>We observe, in the first place, that the elastic curve cannot be a circle, but is
                    gradually more incurvated as it recedes from the point of application B of the
                    straining forces. At B it has no curvature; and if the bar were extended beyond
                    B there would be no curvature there. In like manner, when a beam is supported at
                    the ends and loaded in the middle, the curvature is greatest in the middle; but
                    at the props, or beyond them, if the beam extend farther, there is no curvature.
                    Therefore, when a beam projecting twenty feet from a wall is bent to a certain
                    curvature at the wall by a weight suspended at the end, and a beam of the same
                    size projecting twenty feet is bent to the very same curvature at the wall by a
                    greater weight at ten feet distance, the figure and the mechanical state of the
                    beam in the vicinity of the wall is different in these two cases though the
                    curvature at the very wall is the same in both. In the first case every part of
                    the beam is incurvated; in the second, all beyond the ten feet is without
                    curvature. In the first experiment the curvature at the distance of five feet
                    from the wall is three fourths of the curvature at the wall; in the second, the
                    curvature at the same place is but one half of that at the wall. This must
                    weaken the long beam in this whole interval of five feet, because the greater
                    curvature is the result of a greater extension of the fibres.</p>
                <p>In the next place we may remark, that there is a certain determinate curvature
                    for every beam, which cannot be exceeded without breaking it; for there is a
                    certain separation of two adjoining particles that puts an end to their
                    cohesion. A fibre can therefore be extended only a certain proportion of its
                    length. The ultimate extension of the outer fibres must bear a certain
                    determinate proportion to its length, and this proportion is the same with that
                    of the thickness (or what we have hitherto called the depth) to the radius of
                    ultimate curvature, which is therefore determinate.</p>
                <p>A beam of uniform breadth and depth is therefore most incurvated where the strain
                    is greatest, and will break in the most incurvated part. But by changing its
                    form, so as to make the strength of its different sections in the ratio of the
                    strain, it is evident that the curvature may be the same throughout, or may be
                    made to vary according to any law. This is a remark worthy of the attention of
                    the watchmaker. The most delicate problem in practical mechanics is so to taper
                    the balance-spring of a watch that its wide and narrow vibrations may be
                    isochronous. Hooke’s principle <hi rend="italic">ut tensio sic vis</hi> is not
                    sufficient when we take the <hi rend="italic">inertia</hi> and motion of the
                    spring itself into the account. The figure into which it bends and unbends has
                    also an influence. Our readers will take notice that the artist aims at an
                    accuracy which will not admit an error of <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> / <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 86400</hi> th and that Harrison and Arnold have actually
                    attained it in several instances. The taper of a spring is at present a nostrum
                    in the hands of each artist, and he is careful not to impart its secret Again,
                    since the depth of the beam is thus proportional to the radius of ultimate
                    curvature, this ultimate or breaking curvature is inversely as the depth. It may
                    be expressed by <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> / <hi rend="italic subscript">
                    d</hi><hi rend="italic">.</hi><pb break="no"

                    When a weight is hung on the end of a prismatic beam, the curvature is nearly as
                    the weight and the length directly, and as the breadth and the cube of the depth
                    inversely; for the strength is = ∕'θy∙ Let us suppose that this produces the
                    ultimate curvature Now let the beam be loaded with a smaller weight <hi
                    rend="italic">w,</hi> and let the curvature 0^7" 1</p>
                <p>produced be C; we have this analogy,/ <hi rend="italic">'.w~-∙.</hi> C, and C =
                    ⅛⅛. It is evident that this is also true of a beam supported at the ends and
                    loaded between the props; and we see how to determine the curvature in its
                    different parts, whether arising from the load, or from its own weight, or from
                    both.</p>
                <p>When a beam is thus loaded at the end or middle, the loaded point is pulled down,
                    and the space through which it is drawn may be called the <hi rend="italic"
                    >deflection.</hi> This may be considered as the subtense of the angle of
                    contact, or as the versed sine of the arch into which the beam is bent, and is
                    therefore as the curvature when the length of the arches is given (the flexure
                    being moderate), and as the square of the length of the arch when the curvature
                    is given. The deflection therefore is as the curvature and as the square of the
                    length of the arch jointly; that is, as <hi rend="italic">×</hi> or as</p>
                <p>The deflection from the primitive shape is therefore as the bending weight and
                    the cube of the length directly, and as the breadth and cube of the depth
                    inversely.</p>
                <p>In beams just ready to break, the curvature is as the depth inversely, and the
                    deflection is as the square of the length divided by the depth; for the ultimate
                    curvature at the breaking part is the same whatever is the length; and in this
                    case the deflection is as the square of the iength.</p>
                <p>We have been the more particular in our consideration of this subject, because
                    the resulting theorems afford us the finest methods of examining the laws of
                    corpuscular action, that is, for discovering the variation of the force of
                    cohesion by a change of distance. It is true it is not the atomical law, or <hi
                    rend="italic">hylarchic principle</hi> as it may justly be called, which is thus
                    made accessible, but the specific law of the particles of the substance or kind
                    of matter under examination. But even this is a very great point; and
                    coincidences in this respect among the different kinds of matter are of great
                    moment. We may thus learn the nature of the corpuscular action of different
                    substances, and perhaps approach to a discovery of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >mechanism</hi> of chemical affinities. For that chemical actions are insensible
                    cases of local motion is undeniable, and local motion is the province of
                    mechanical discussion; nay, we see that these hidden changes are produced by
                    mechanical forces in many important cases, for we see them promoted or prevented
                    by means purely mechanical. The conversion of bodies into elastic vapour by heat
                    can at all times be prevented by a <hi rend="italic">sufficient</hi> external
                    pressure. A strong solution of Glauber’s salts will congeal in an instant by
                    agitation, giving out its latent heat; and it will remain fluid for ever, and
                    retain its latent heat in a close vessel which it completely fills. Even water
                    will by such treatment freeze in an instant by agitation, or remain fluid for
                    ever by confinement. We know that heat is produced or extricated by friction,
                    that certain compounds of gold or silver with saline matters explode with
                    irresistible violence by the smallest pressure or agitation. Such facts should
                    rouse the mathematical philosopher, and excite him to follow out the conjectures
                    of the illustrious Newton, encouraged by the ingenious attempts of Boscovich;
                    and the proper beginning of this study is to at tend to the laws of attraction
                    and repulsion exerted by the particles of cohering bodies, discoverable by
                    experiments made on their actual extensions and compressions. The experiments of
                    simple extensions and compressions are quite insufficient, because the total
                    stretching of a wire is so small a quantity, that the mistake of the 1000th part
                    of an inch occasions an irregularity which deranges any progression so as to
                    make it useless. But by the bending of bodies a distention of <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 1</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"> 100</hi> th of an inch may be
                    easily magnified in the deflection of the spring ten thousand times. We know
                    that the investigation is intricate and difficult, but not beyond the reach of
                    our present mathematical attainments; and it will give very fine opportunities
                    of employing all the address of analysis. In the 17th century and the beginning
                    of the 18th this was a sufficient excitement to the first geniuses of Europe.
                    The cycloid, the catenaria, the elastic curve, the velaria, the caustics, were
                    reckoned an abundant recompense for much study; and James Bernoulli requested,
                    as an honourable monument, that the logarithmic spiral might be inscribed on his
                    tombstone. The reward for the study to which we now presume to incite the
                    mathematicians is the almost unlimited extension of natural science, important
                    in every particular branch. To go no further than our present subject, a great
                    deal of important practical knowledge respecting the strength of bodies is
                    derived from the single observation, that in the moderate extensions which
                    happen before the parts are overstrained, the forces are nearly in the
                    proportion of the extensions or separations of the particles. To return to our
                    subject.</p>
                <p>James Bernoulli, in his second dissertation on the elastic curve, calls in
                    question this law, and accommodates his investigation to any hypothesis
                    concerning the relation of the forces and extensions. He relates some
                    experiments of lutestrings where the relation was considerably different.
                    Strings of three feet long, stretched by 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 pounds, were lengthened
                    9, 17, 23, 27, 30 lines.</p>
                <p>But this is a most exceptionable form of the experiment. The strings were
                    twisted, and the mechanism of the extensions is here exceedingly complicated,
                    combined with compressions and with transverse twists, &amp;c. We made
                    experiments on fine slips of the gum caoutchouc, and on the juice of the berries
                    of the white bryony, of which a single grain will draw to a thread of two feet
                    long, and again return into a perfectly round sphere. We measured the diameter
                    of the thread by a microscope with a micrometer, and thus could tell in every
                    state of extension the proportional number of particles in the sections. We
                    found, that through the whole range in which the distance of the particles was
                    changed in the proportion of thirteen to one, the extensions did not <hi
                    rend="italic">sensibly</hi> deviate from the proportion of the forces. The same
                    thing was observed in the caoutchouc as long as it perfectly recovered its first
                    dimensions. And it is on the authority of these experiments that we presume to
                    announce this as a law of nature.</p>
                <p>Dr Robert Hooke was undoubtedly the first who attended to this subject, and
                    assumed this as a law of nature. Mariotte indeed was the first who expressly
                    used it for determining the strength of beams: this he did about the year 1679,
                    correcting the simple theory of Galileo. Leibnitz, indeed, in his dissertation
                    in the <hi rend="italic">Acta Eruditorum</hi> 1684, <hi rend="italic">De
                    Resistentia Solidorum,</hi> introduces this consideration, and wishes to be
                    considered as the discoverer; and he is always acknowledged as such by the
                    Bernoullis, and others who adhered to his peculiar doctrines. But Mariotte had
                    published the doctrine in the most express terms long before; and Bulfinger, in
                    the <hi rend="italic">Comment. Petropol.</hi> 1729, completely vindicates his
                    claim. But Hooke was unquestionably the discoverer of this law. It made the
                    foundation of his theory of springs, announced to the Royal Society about the
                    year 1661, and read in 1666. On this occasion he mentions<pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:chi.28490924&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=910" xml:id="kp-eb0720-0910-0764"/>
                    many things on the strength of bodies as quite familiar to his thoughts, which
                    are immediate deductions from this principle; and among these <hi rend="italic"
                    >all</hi> the facts which John Bernoulli so vauntingly adduces in support of
                    Leibnitz’s finical dogmas about the force of bodies in motion; a doctrine which
                    Hooke might have claimed as his own, had he not perceived its frivolous
                    inanity.</p>
                <p>But even with this first correction of Mariotte, the mechanism of transverse
                    strain is not fully nor justly explained. The force acting in the direction BW
                    (fig 3), and bending the body ABCD, not only stretches the fibres on the side
                    opposite to the axis of fracture, but compresses the side CD, which becomes
                    concave by the strain. Indeed it cannot do the one without doing the other; for,
                    in order to stretch the fibres at D, there must be some fulcrum, some support,
                    on which the virtual lever BAD may press, that it may tear asunder the stretched
                    fibres. This fulcrum must sustain both tile pressure arising from the cohesion
                    of the distended fibres, and also the action of the external force, which
                    immediately tends to cause the prominent part of the beam to slide along the
                    section EF.</p>
                <p>This is fully verified by experiment. If we attempt to break a long slip of cork,
                    or any such very compressible body, we always observe it to bulge out on the
                    concave side before it cracks on the other side. If it is a body of fibrous or
                    foliated texture, it seldom fails splintering off on the concave side; and in
                    many cases this splintering is very deep, even reaching half way through the
                    piece. In hard and granulated bodies, such as a piece of freestone, chalk, dry
                    clay, sugar, and the like, we generally see a considerable splinter or shiver
                    fly off from the hollow side. If the fracture be slowly made by a force at B
                    gradually augmented, the formation of the splinter is very distinctly seen. It
                    forms a triangular piece, which generally breaks in the middle.</p>
                <p>Let us see what consequences result from this state of the case respecting the
                    strength of bodies. Let D∆KC (fig. 6) represent a vertical section of a prism of
                    compressible materials, such as a piece of timber. Suppose it loaded with a
                    weight P hung at its extremity. Suppose it of such a constitution that all the
                    fibres in AD are in a state of dilatation, while those in A∆ are in a state of
                    compression. In the instant of fracture the particles at D and E are withheld by
                    forces DJ, Ee, and the particles at ∆ and E repel, resist, or support, with
                    forces ∆3, Fι.</p>
                <p>Some line, such as <hi rend="italic">de</hi> A <hi rend="italic">εδ</hi>, will
                    limit all these ordinates, which represent the forces actually exerted in the
                    instant of fracture. If the forces be as the extensions and compressions, as we
                    have great reason to believe, <hi rend="italic">deA</hi> and Aεδ will be two
                    straight lines.. They will form <hi rend="italic">one</hi> straight line <hi
                    rend="italic">dAδ,</hi> if the forces which resist a certain dilatation are
                    equal to the forces which resist an equal compression. But this is quite
                    accidental, and is not strictly true in any body. In most bodies which have any
                    considerable firmness, the compressions made by any external force are not so
                    great as the dilatations which the same force would produce; that is, the
                    repulsions which are excited by any supposed degree of compression are greater
                    than the attractions excited by the same degree of dilatation. Hence it will
                    generally follow, that the angle dAD is less than the angle δA∆, and the
                    ordinates Dd, Ee, &amp;c. are less than the corresponding ordinates ∆δ, Eε,
                    &amp;c.</p>
                <p>But whatever be the nature of the line <hi rend="italic">dAi,</hi> we are certain
                    of this, that the whole area AD <hi rend="italic">d</hi> is equal to the whole
                    area A <hi rend="italic">∆δ</hi>; for as the force at B is gradually increased,
                    and the parts between A and D are more extended, and greater cohesive forces are
                    excited, there is always such a degree of repulsive forces excited in the
                    particles between A and Δ that the one set precisely balances the other. The
                    force at B, acting perpendicularly to AB, has no tendency to push the whole
                    piece closer on the part next the wall, or to pull it away. The sum of the
                    attractive and repulsive forces actually excited must therefore be equal. These
                    sums are represented by the two triangular areas, which are therefore equal.</p>
                <p>The greater we suppose the repulsive forces corresponding to any degree of
                    compression, in comparison with the attractive forces corresponding to the same
                    degree of extension, the smaller will A∆ be in comparison of AD. In a piece of
                    cork or sponge, A∆ may chance to be equal to AD, or even to exceed it; but in a
                    piece of marble, A∆ will perhaps be very small in comparison of AD.</p>
                <p>Now it is evident that the repulsive forces excited between A and Δ have no share
                    in preventing the fracture. They rather contribute to it, by furnishing a
                    fulcrum to the lever by whose energy the cohesion of the particles in AD is
                    overcome. Hence we see an important consequence of the compressibility of the
                    body. Its power of resisting this transverse strain is diminished by it, and so
                    much the more diminished as the stuff is more compressible.</p>
                <p>This is fully verified by some very curious experiments made by Duhamel. He took
                    sixteen bars of willow two feet long and half an inch square, and supporting
                    them by props under the ends, he broke them by weights hung on the middle. He
                    broke four of them by weights of 40, 41, 47, and 52 pounds: the mean is 45. He
                    then cut four of them one third through on the upper side, and filled up the cut
                    with a thin piece of harder wood stuck in pretty tight These were broken by 48,
                    54, 50, and 52 pounds; the mean of which is 51. He cut other four half through,
                    and they were broken by 47, 49, 50, 46; the mean of which is 48. The remaining
                    four were cut two thirds, and their mean strength was 42.</p>
                <p>Another set of his experiments is still more remarkable.</p>
                <p>Six battens of willow thirty-six inches long and one and a half square were
                    broken by 525 pounds at a medium.</p>
                <p>Six bars were cut one third through, and the cut filled with a wedge of hard wood
                    stuck in with a little force: these broke with 551.</p>
                <p>Six bars were cut half through, and the cut was filled in the same manner: they
                    broke with 542.</p>
                <p>Six bars were cut three fourths through: these broke with 530.</p>
                <p>A batten cut three fourths through, and loaded till nearly broken, was unloaded,
                    and the wedge taken out of the cut. A thicker wedge was put in tight, so as to
                    make the batten straight again by filling up the space left by the compression
                    of the wood: this batten broke with 577 pounds.</p>
                <p>From this it is plain that more than two thirds of the thickness (perhaps nearly
                    three fourths) contributed nothing to the strength.</p>
                <p>The point A is the centre of fracture in this case; and in order to estimate the
                    strength of the piece, we may sup-<pb break="no"

                    pose that the crooked lever virtually concerned in the strain is DAB. We must
                    find the point I, which is the centre of effort of all the attractive forces, or
                    that point where the full cohesion of AD must be applied, so as to have a
                    momentum equal to the accumulated momenta of all the variable forces. We must in
                    like manner find the centre of effort <hi rend="italic">i</hi> of the repulsive
                    or supporting forces exerted by the fibres lying between A and Δ.</p>
                <p>It is plain, and the remark is important, that this last centre of effort is the
                    real fulcrum of the lever, although A is the point where there is neither
                    extension nor contraction; for the lever is supported in the same manner as if
                    the repulsions of the whole line A∆ were exerted at that point. Therefore let S
                    represent the surface of fracture from A to D, and <hi rend="italic">f</hi>
                    represent the absolute cohesion of a fibre at D in the instant of fracture. We
                    shall have ∕S × I 4- <hi rend="italic">i = pl,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">I</hi>:

                    between the two centres of effort I and <hi rend="italic">i</hi>, as the
                    absolute cohesion of the section between A and D is to the relative strength of
                    the section.</p>
                <p>It would be perhaps more accurate to make Al and Ai equal to the distances of A
                    from the horizontal lines passing through the centres of gravity of the
                    triangles of dAD and δA∆. It is only in this construction that the points I and
                    <hi rend="italic">i are</hi> the centres of real effort of the accumulated
                    attractions and repulsions. But I and i, determined as we have done, are the
                    points where the full equal actions may be all applied, so as to produce the
                    same momenta. The final results are the same in both cases. The attentive and
                    duly informed reader will see that Mr Bullinger, in a very elaborate
                    dissertation on the strength of beams, in the <hi rend="italic">Comment.
                    Petropolitan.</hi> 1729, has committed several mistakes in his estimation of the
                    actions of the fibres. We mention this because his reasonings are quoted and
                    appealed to as authorities by Muschenbroeck and other authors of note. The
                    subject has been considered by many authors on the continent. We recommend to
                    the reader’s perusal the very minute discussions in the Memoirs of the Academy
                    of Paris for 1702 by Varignon, the Memoirs for 1708 by Parent, and particularly
                    that of Coulomb in the <hi rend="italic">Mém. par les Sçavans Etrangers,</hi>

                <p>It is evident from what has been said above, that if S and <hi rend="italic"

                <p>If, as is most likely, the forces are proportional to the extensions and

                    instant of fracture, and the body is a rectangular prism like a common joist or
                    beam, then DA and ∆A are also equal; and therefore the momentum of cohesion is

                    the absolute cohesion of the section is to its relative strength.”</p>
                <p>Thus we see that the compressibility of bodies has a very great influence on
                    their power of withstanding a transverse strain. We see that in this most
                    favourable supposition of equal dilatations and compressions, the strength is
                    reduced to one half of the value of what it would have been had the body been
                    incompressible. This is by no means obvious; for it does not readily appear how
                    compressibi lity, which does not diminish the cohesion of a single fibre, should
                    impair the strength of the whole. The reason, however, is sufficiently
                    convincing when pointed out. In the instant of fracture, a smaller portion of
                    the section is actually exerting cohesive forces, while a part of it is only
                    serving as a fulcrum to the lever by whose means the strain on the section is
                    produced. We see, too, that this diminution of strength does not so much depend
                    on the sensible compressibility, as on its proportion to the dilatability by
                    equal forces. When this proportion is small, A∆ is small in comparison of AD.
                    and a greater portion of the whole fibre is exerting attractive forces. The
                    experiments already mentioned, of Duhamel de Monceau, on battens of willow, show
                    that its compressibility is nearly equal to its dilatability. But the case is
                    not very different in tempered steel. The famous Harrison, in the delicate
                    experiments which he made while occupied in making his longitude watch,
                    discovered that a rod of tempered steel was nearly as much diminished in its
                    length as it was augmented by the same external force. But it is not by any
                    means certain that this is the proportion of dilatation and compression which
                    obtains in the very instant of fracture. We rather imagine that it is not. The
                    forces arc nearly as the dilatations till very near breaking; but we think that
                    they diminish when the body is just going to break. But it seems certain that
                    the forces which resist compression increase faster than the compressions, even
                    before fracture. We know incontestably that the ultimate resistances to
                    compression are insuperable by any force which we can employ. The repulsive
                    forces, therefore, in their whole extent, increase faster than the compressions,
                    and are expressed by an assymp-totic branch of the Boscovician curve formerly
                    explained. It is therefore probable, especially in the more simple substances,
                    that they increase faster, even in such compressions as frequently obtain in the
                    breaking of hard bodies. We ate disposed to think that this is always the case
                    in such bodies as do not fly off in splinters on the concave side; but this must
                    be understood with the exception of the permanent changes which may be made by
                    compression when the bodies are crippled by it. This always increases the
                    compression itself, and causes the neutral point to shift still more towards D.
                    The effect of this is sometimes very great and fatal.</p>
                <p>Experiment alone can help us to discover the proportion between the dilatability
                    and compressibility of bodies. The strain now under consideration seems the best
                    calculated for this research. Thus if we find that a piece of wood an inch
                    square requires 12,000 pounds to tear it asunder by a direct pull, and that 200
                    pounds will break it transversely by acting 10 inches from the section of
                    fracture, we must conclude that the neutral point A is in the middle of the
                    depth, and that the attractive and repulsive forces are equal. Any notions that
                    we can form of the constitution of such fibrous bodies as timber, make us
                    imagine that the <hi rend="italic">sensible</hi> compressions, including what
                    arises from the bending up of the compressed fibres, is much greater than the
                    real corpuscular extensions. One may get a general conviction of this unexpected
                    proposition by reflecting on what must happen during the fracture. An undulated
                    fibre can only be drawn straight, and then the corpuscular extension begins; but
                    it may be bent up by compression to any degree, the corpuscular compression
                    being little affected all the while. This observation is very important; and
                    though the forces of corpuscular repulsion may be almost insuperable by any
                    compression that we can employ, a <hi rend="italic">sensible</hi> compression
                    may be produced by forces not enormous, sufficient to cripple the beam. Of this
                    we shall see very important instances afterwards.</p>
                <p>It deserves to be noticed,, that although the relative strength of a prismatic
                    solid is extremely different in the three hypotheses now considered, yet the
                    proportional<pb break="no" facs="ht:chi.28490924&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=912"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0720-0912-0766"/> strengths of different pieces follow the same
                    ratio, namely, the direct ratio of the breadth, the direct ratio of the square
                    of the depth, and the inverse ratio of the length. In the first hypothesis (of
                    equal forces) the strength of a rectangular beam was <hi rend="superscript">
                    -</hi> ^^-; in the second (of attractive forces proportioned to the extensions)
                    it was '^gγ'; and in the third (equal attractions and repulsions proportional to
                    the extensions and compressions) it was <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> η^-, or
                    more generally ^-γ, where <hi rend="italic">m</hi> expresses the unknown
                    proportion between the attractions and repulsions corresponding to an equal
                    extension and compression.</p>
                <p>Hence we derive a piece of useful information, which is confirmed by
                    unexceptionable experience, that the strength of a piece depends chiefly on its
                    depth, that is, on that dimension which is in the direction of the strain. A bar
                    of timber of one inch in breadth and two inches in depth is four times as strong
                    as a bar only one inch deep, and it is twice as strong as a bar two inches broad
                    and one deep; that is, a joist or lever is always strongest when laid on its
                    edge.</p>
                <p>There is therefore a choice in the manner in which the cohesion is opposed to the
                    strain. The general aim must be to put the centre of effort I as far from the
                    fulcrum or the neutral point A as possible, so as to give the greatest energy or
                    momentum to the cohesion. Thus if a triangular bar projecting from a wall is
                    loaded with a weight at its extremity, it will bear thrice as much when one of
                    the sides is uppermost as when it is undermost.</p>
                <p>Hence it follows that the strongest joist that can be cut out of a round tree is
                    not the one which has the greatest quantity of timber in it, but such that the
                    product of its breadth by the square of its depth shall be the greatest
                    possible. Let ABCD (fig. 7) be the section of this joist inscribed in the
                    circle, A B being the breadth and AD the depth. Since it is a rectangular
                    section, the diagonal BD is a diameter of the circle, and BAD is a right-angled
                    triangle. Let BD be called <hi rend="italic">a,</hi> and BA be called <hi

                    C, which determines the depth BC and the breadth CD.</p>
                <p>Because BD: BC = CD: CE, we have the area of the section BC·CD = BD·CE. Therefore
                    the different sections having the same diagonal BD, are proportional to their
                    heights CE. Therefore the section BCDA is less than the section B <hi
                    rend="italic">c</hi> D <hi rend="italic">a</hi>, whose four sides are equal. The
                    joist so shaped, therefore, is stronger, lighter, and cheaper.</p>
                <p>The strength of ABCD is to that of a B <hi rend="italic">c</hi> D as 10,000 to
                    9186, and the weight and expense as 10,000 to 10,607; so that ABCD is preferable
                    to <hi rend="italic">a</hi> B <hi rend="italic">c</hi> D, in the proportion of
                    10,607 to 9186, or nearly 115 to 100.</p>
                <p>From the same principles it follows that a hollow tube is stronger tban a solid
                    rod containing the same quantity of matter. Let fig. 8 represent the section of
                    a cylindric tube, of which AF and BE are the exterior and interior diameters,
                    and C the centre. Draw BD perpendicular to BC, and join</p>
                <p>DC. Then, because BD <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> = CD <hi rend="superscript">
                    2</hi> —CB <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi>, BD is the radius of a circle
                    containing the same quantity of matter with the ring. If we estimate the
                    strength by the first hypothesis, it is evident that the strength of the tube
                    will be to that of the solid cylinder, whose radius is BD, as BD <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 2</hi> × AC to BD <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> × BD; that
                    is, as AC to BD; for BD <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> expresses the cohesion of
                    the ring of the circle, and AC and BD are equal to distances of the centres of
                    effort (the same with the centres of gravity) of the ring and circle from the
                    axis of the fracture.</p>
                <p>The proportion of these strengths will be different in the other hypothesis, and
                    is not easily expressed by a general formula; but in both it is still more in
                    favour of the ring or hollow tube.</p>
                <p>The following very simple solution will be readily understood by the intelligent
                    reader. Let O be the centre of oscillation of the exterior circle, <hi

                    rend="italic">w</hi> the centre of oscillation of the ring included between

                <p>Emerson has given a very inaccurate approximation to this value in his Mechanics,
                    4to.</p>
                <p>This property of hollow tubes is accompanied also with greater stiffness; and the
                    superiority in strength and stiffness is so much the greater as the surrounding
                    shell is thinner in proportion to its diameter.</p>
                <p>Here we see the admirable wisdom of the Author of nature in forming the bones of
                    animal limbs hollow. The bones of the arms and legs have to perform the office
                    of levers, and are thus opposed to very great transverse strains. By this form
                    they become incomparably stronger and stiffer, and give more room for the
                    insertion of muscles, while they are lighter and therefore more agile; and the
                    same wisdom has made use of this hollow for other valuable purposes of the
                    animal economy. In like manner the quills in the wings of birds acquire by their
                    thinness the very great strength which is necessary, while they are so light as
                    to give sufficient buoyancy to the animal in the rare medium in which it must
                    live and fly about. The stalks of many plants, such as all the grasses, and many
                    reeds, are in like manner hollow, and thus possess an extraordinary strength.
                    Our best engineers now begin to imitate nature by making many parts of their
                    machines hollow, such as their axles of cast iron, &amp;c.; and the ingenious Mr
                    Ramsden made the axes and framings of his great astronomical instruments in the
                    same manner.</p>
                <p>In the supposition of homogeneous texture, it is plain that the fracture happens
                    as soon as the particles at D are separated beyond their utmost limit of
                    cohesion. This is a determined quantity, and the piece bends till this degree of
                    extension is produced in the uttermost fibre. It follows, that the smaller we
                    suppose the distance between A and D, the greater will be the curvature which
                    the beam will acquire before it breaks. Greater depth therefore makes a beam not
                    only stronger, but also stiffer. But if the parallel fibres can slide on each
                    other, both the strength and the stiffness will be diminished. Therefore, if,
                    instead of one beam D∆KC (fig. 6), we suppose two, DABC and<pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:chi.28490924&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=913" xml:id="kp-eb0720-0913-0767"/>
                    A∆KB, not cohering, each of them will bend, and the extension of the fibres AB
                    of the under beam will not hinder the compression of the adjoining fibres AB of
                    the upper beam. The two together therefore will not be more than twice as strong
                    as one of them (supposing DA — A∆), instead of being four times as strong; and
                    they will bend as much as either of them alone would bend by half the load. This
                    may be prevented, if it were possible to unite the two beams all along the seam
                    AB, so that the one shall not slide on the other. This may be done in small
                    works by gluing them together with a cement as strong as the natural lateral
                    cohesion of the fibres. If this cannot be done (as it cannot in large works),
                    the sliding is prevented by <hi rend="italic">joggling</hi> the beams together,
                    that is, by cutting down several rectangular notches in the upper side of the
                    lower beam, and making similar notches in the under side of the upper beam, and
                    filling up the square spaces with pieces of very hard wood firmly driven in, as
                    represented in fig. 9. Some employ iron bolts by way of joggles. But when the
                    joggle is much harder than the wood into which it is driven, it is very apt to
                    work loose, by widening the hole into which it is lodged. The same thing is
                    sometimes done by scarphing the one upon the other, as represented in fig. 10;
                    but this wastes more timber, and is not so strong, because the mutual hooks
                    which this method form on each beam are very apt to tear each other up. By one
                    or other of these methods, or something similar, may a compound beam be formed,
                    of any depth, which will be almost as stiff and strong as an entire piece.</p>
                <p>On the other hand, we may combine strength with pliableness, by composing our
                    beam of several thin planks laid on each other, till they make a proper depth,
                    and leaving them at full liberty to slide on each other. It is in this manner
                    that coach-springs are formed, as is represented in fig. 11. In this assemblage
                    there must be no joggles nor bolts of any kind put through the planks or plates,
                    for this would hinder their mutual sliding. They must be kept together by straps
                    which surround them, or by something equivalent.</p>
                <p>The preceding observations show the propriety of some maxims of construction,
                    which the artists have derived from long experience.</p>
                <p>Thus, if a mortise is to be cut out of a piece which is exposed to a cross
                    strain, it should be cut out from that side which becomes concave by the
                    strain.</p>
                <p>If a piece is to be strengthened by the addition of another, the added piece must
                    be joined to the side which grows convex by the strain.</p>
                <p>Before we proceed any farther, it will be convenient to recall the reader’s
                    attention to the analogy between the strain on a beam projecting from a wall and
                    loaded at the extremity, and a beam supported at both ends and loaded in some
                    intermediate point. It is sufficient on this occasion to read attentively what
                    is delivered in the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Roof.</hi> We learn there that
                    the strain on the middle point C (fig. 16 of the present article) of a
                    rectangular beam AB, supported on props at A and B, is the same as if the part
                    CA projected from a wall, and were loaded with the half of the weight W
                    suspended at A. The momentum of the strain is therefore ½ W × ½ AB = W × ¼ AB
                    <hi rend="italic">=p</hi> ¼ <hi rend="italic">l</hi> or <hi rend="superscript">
                    pl</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"> 4</hi>. The momentum of cohesion must be equal
                    to this in every hypothesis.</p>
                <p>Having now considered in sufficient detail the circumstances which affect the
                    strength of any section of a solid body that is strained transversely, it is
                    necessary to take notice of some of the chief modifications of the strain
                    itself. We shall consider only those that occur most frequently in our
                    constructions.</p>
                <p>The strain depends on the external force, and also on the lever by which it
                    acts.</p>
                <p>It is evidently of importance, that since the strain is exerted in any section by
                    means of the cohesion of the parts intervening between the section under
                    consideration and the point of application of the external force, the body must
                    be able in all these intervening parts to propagate or excite the strain in the
                    remote section. In every part it must be able to resist the strain excited in
                    that part. It should therefore be equally strong; and it is useless to have any
                    part stronger, because the piece will nevertheless break where it is not
                    stronger throughout; and it is useless to make it stronger (relatively to its
                    strain) in any part, for it will nevertheless equally fail in the part that is
                    t∞ weak.</p>
                <p>Suppose, then, in the first place, that the strain arises from a weight suspended
                    at one extremity, while the other end is firmly fixed in a wall. Supposing also
                    the cross sections to be all rectangular, there are several ways of shaping the
                    beam so that it shall be equally strong throughout. Thus it may be equally deep
                    in every part, the upper and under surfaces being horizontal planes. The
                    condition will be fulfilled by making all the horizontal sections triangles, as
                    in fig. 12. The two sides are vertical planes, meeting in an edge at the
                    extremity L. For the equation expressing the balance of strain and strength is
                    <hi rend="italic">pl = fbd</hi><hi rend="italic superscript"> 2</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">.</hi> Therefore, since <hi rend="italic">d</hi><hi rend="italic
                    superscript"> 2</hi> is the same throughout, and also <hi rend="italic">p</hi>,
                    we must have <hi rend="italic">fb</hi> = <hi rend="italic">l</hi>, and <hi
                    rend="italic">b</hi> (the breadth AD of any section ABCD) must be proportional
                    to <hi rend="italic">l</hi> (or AL), which it evidently is.</p>
                <p>Or, if the beam be of uniform breadth, we must have <hi rend="italic">d</hi><hi
                    rend="italic superscript"> 2</hi> everywhere proportional to Z. This will be
                    obtained by making the depths the ordinates of a common parabola, of which L is
                    the vertex and the length is the axis. The upper or under side may be a straight
                    line, as in fig. 13, or the middle line may be straight, and then both upper and
                    under surfaces will be curved. It is almost indifferent what is the shape of the
                    upper and under surfaces, provided the distances between them in every part be
                    at the ordinates of a common parabola.</p>
                <p>Or, if the sections are all similar, such as circles, squares, or any other
                    similar polygons, we must have <hi rend="italic">d</hi><hi rend="italic
                    superscript"> 2</hi> or <hi rend="italic">b</hi><hi rend="italic superscript">
                    3</hi> proportional to Z, and the depths or breadths must be as the ordinates of
                    a cubical parabola.</p>
                <p>It is evident that these are also the proper forms for a lever moveable round a
                    fulcrum, and acted on by a force at the extremity. The force comes in the place
                    of the weight suspended in the cases already considered; and as such levers
                    always are connected with another arm, we readily see that both arms should be
                    fashioned in the same manner. Thus in fig. 12 the piece of timber may be
                    supposed a kind of steelyard, moveable round a horizontal axis in the front of
                    the wall, and having the two weights P and π in equilibrio. The strain
                    occasioned by each at the section in which the axis OP is placed must be the
                    same, and each<pb break="no" facs="ht:chi.28490924&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=914"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0720-0914-0768"/> arm OL and Oλ. must be equally strong in all its
                    parts. The longitudinal sections of each arm must be a triangle, a common
                    parabola, or a cubic parabola, according to the conditions previously given.</p>
                <p>And, moreover, all these forms are equally strong; for any one of them is equally
                    strong in all its parts, and they are all supposed to have the same section at
                    the front of the wall or at the fulcrum. They are not, however, equally stiff.
                    The first, represented in fig. 12, will bend least upon the whole, and the one
                    formed by the cubic parabola will bend most. But their curvature at the very
                    fulcrum will be the same in all.</p>
                <p>It is also plain, that if the lever is of the second or third kind, that is,
                    having the fulcrum at one extremity, it must still be of the same shape; for in
                    abstract mechanics it is indifferent which of the three points is considered as
                    the axis of motion. In every lever the two forces at the extremities act in one
                    direction, and the force in the middle acts in the opposite direction, and the
                    great strain is always at that point. Therefore a lever such as fig. 12,
                    moveable round an axis passing horizontally through λ, and acting against an
                    obstacle at OP, is equally able in all its parts to resist the strains excited
                    in those parts.</p>
                <p>The same principles and the same construction will apply to beams, such as
                    joists, supported at the ends L and λ (fig. 12), and loaded at some intermediate
                    part OP. This will appear evident by merely inverting the directions of the
                    forces at these three points, or by recurring to tire article <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Roof,</hi> p. 444.</p>
                <p>Hitherto we have supposed the external straining force as acting only in one
                    point of the beam. But it may be uniformly distributed all over the beam. To
                    make a beam in such circumstances equally strong in all its parts, the shape
                    must be considerably different from the former.</p>
                <p>Thus suppose the beam to project from a wall. If it be of equal breadth
                    throughout, its sides being vertical planes parallel to each other and to the
                    length, the vertical section in the direction of its length must be a triangle
                    instead of a common parabola; for the weight uniformly distributed over the part
                    lying beyond any section, is as the length beyond that section: and since it may
                    all be conceived as collected at its centre of gravity, which is the middle of
                    that length, the lever by which this load acts or strains the section is also
                    proportioned to the same length. The strain on the section (or momentum of the
                    load) is as the square of that length. The section must have strength in the
                    same proportion. Its strength being as the breadth and the square of the depth,
                    and the breadth being constant, the square of the depth of any section must be
                    as the square of its distance from the end, and the depth must be as that
                    distance; and therefore the longitudinal vertical section must be a
                    triangle.</p>
                <p>But if all the transverse sections are circles, squares, or any other similar
                    figures, the strength of every section, or the cube of the diameter, must be as
                    the square of the lengths beyond that section, or the square of its distance
                    from the end; and the sides of the beam must be a semi-cubical parabola.</p>
                <p>If the upper and under surfaces are horizontal planes, it is evident that the
                    breadth must be as the square of the distance from the end, and the horizontal
                    sections may be formed by arches of the common parabola, having the length for
                    their tangent at the vertex.</p>
                <p>By recurring to the analogy so often quoted between a projecting beam and a
                    joist, we may determine the proper form of joists which are uniformly loaded
                    through their whole length.</p>
                <p>This is a frequent and important case, being the office of joists, rafters,
                    &amp;c.; and there are some circumstances which must be particularly noticed,
                    because they are not so obvious, and have been misunderstood. When a beam AB
                    (fig. 14) is supported at the ends, and a weight is laid on any point P, a
                    strain is excited in every part of the beam.</p>
                <p>The load on P causes the beam to press on A and B, and the props re-act with
                    forces equal and opposite to these pressures. The load at P is to the pressures
                    at A and B as A B to PB and PA, and the pressure at A is to that at B as BP to
                    PA; the beam therefore is in the same state, with respect to strain in every
                    part of it, as if it were resting on a prop at P, and were loaded at the ends
                    with weights equal to the two pressures on the props: and observe, these
                    pressures are such as will balance each other, being inversely as their
                    distances from P. Let P represent the weight or load at P. The pressure on the
                    prop P PA</p>
                <p>must be P × <hi rend="superscript"> PA</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"> AB</hi>; This
                    is therefore the re-action of the prop</p>
                <p>B, and is the weight which we may suppose suspended at B, when we conceive the
                    beam resting on a prop at P, and carrying the balancing weights at A and B.</p>
                <p>The strain occasioned at any other point C, by the load P at P, is the same with
                    the strain at C, by the weight P × <hi rend="superscript"> PA</hi> / <hi
                    rend="subscript"> AB</hi> hanging at B, when the beam rests on P, in the manner
                    now supposed; and it is the same if the beam, instead of being balanced on a
                    prop at P, had its part AP fixed in a wall. This is evident. Now we have shown
                    at length that the strain at C, by the weight at B, is P × <hi
                    rend="superscript"> PA</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"> AB</hi> × BC. We desire it
                    to be particularly remarked, that the pressure at A has no influence on the
                    strain at C, arising from the action of any load between A and C; for it is
                    indifferent how the part AP of the projecting beam PB is supported. The weight
                    at A just performs the same office with the wall in which we suppose the beam to
                    be fixed. We are thus particular, because we have seen even persons not
                    unaccustomed to discussions of this kind puzzled in their conceptions of this
                    strain.</p>
                <p>Now let the load P be laid on some point <hi rend="italic">p</hi> between C and
                    B. The same reasoning shows us that the point is, with respect to strain, in the
                    same state as if the beam were fixed in a wall, embracing the part <hi
                    rend="italic">p</hi> B, and a weight = P × <hi rend="superscript"> pB</hi> / <hi
                    rend="subscript"> AB</hi> were hung on at A, and the strain at C is P A b</p>
                <p>× <hi rend="superscript"> pB</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"> AB</hi> × AC.</p>
                <p>In general, therefore, the strain on any point C, arising from a load P laid on
                    another point P, is proportional to the rectangle of the distances of P and C
                    from the ends nearest to each. It is P × PA× <hi rend="superscript"> CB</hi> /
                    <hi rend="subscript"> AB</hi>, or <hi rend="superscript"> P×</hi><hi
                    rend="italic superscript"> p</hi><hi rend="superscript"> B×CA</hi> / <hi
                    rend="subscript"> AB</hi>, according as the load lies between C and A or between
                    C and B.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Cor.</hi> 1. The strains which a load on any point P occasions
                    on the points C, c, lying on the same side of P, are as the distances of these
                    points from the end B. In like manner the strains on E and <hi rend="italic"
                    >e</hi> arc as EA and eA.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Cor.</hi> 2. The strain which a load occasions in the part on
                    which it rests is as the rectangle of the parts on each side. Thus the strain
                    occasioned at C by a load is to that at D by the same load as AC × CB to AD ×
                    DB. It is therefore greatest in the middle.</p>
                <p>Let us now consider the strain on any point C arising from a load uniformly
                    distributed along the beam. Let AP be represented by <hi rend="italic">x,</hi>
                    and P <hi rend="italic">p</hi> by <hi rend="italic">dx,</hi> and the whole

                <p>Thus we see that the strain is proportional to the rectangle of the parts, in the
                    same manner as if the load <hi rend="italic">a</hi> had been laid directly on
                    the point C, and is indeed equal to one half of the strain which would be
                    produced at C by the load <hi rend="italic">a</hi> laid on there.</p>
                <p>It was necessary to be thus particular, because we see in some elementary
                    treatises on mechanics, published by authors of reputation, mistakes which are
                    very plausible, and mislead the learner. It is there said that the pressure at B
                    from a weight uniformly diffused along AB, is the same as if it were collected
                    at its centre of gravity, which would be the middle of AB; and then the strain
                    at C is said to be this pressure at B multiplied by BC. But surely it is not
                    difficult to see the difference of these strains. It is plain that the pressure
                    of gravity downwards on any point between the end A and the point C has no
                    tendency to diminish the strain at C, arising from the upward re-action of the
                    prop B; whereas the pressure of gravity between C and B is almost in direct
                    opposition to it, and must diminish it. We may however avoid the fluxionary
                    calculus with safety by the consideration of the centre of gravity, by supposing
                    the weights of AC and BC to be collected at their respective centres of gravity;
                    and the result of this computation will be the same as above: and we may use
                    either method, although the weight he not uniformly distributed, provided only
                    that we know in what manner it is distributed.</p>
                <p>This investigation is evidently of importance in the practice of the engineer and
                    architect, informing them what support is necessary in the different parts of
                    their constructions. We considered some cases of this kind in the article <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Roof.</hi></p>
                <p>It is now easy to form a joist so that it shall have the same relative strength
                    in all its parts.</p>
                <p>I. To make it equally able in all its parts to carry a given weight laid on any
                    point C taken at random, or uniformly diffused over the whole length, the
                    strength of the section at the point C must be as AC X CB. Therefore,</p>
                <p>1. If the sides be parallel vertical planes, the square of the depth (which is
                    the only variable dimension), or CD <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi>, must be as
                    AC × CB, and the depths must be ordinates of an ellipse.</p>
                <p>2. If the transverse sections be similar, we must make CD <hi rend="superscript">
                    3</hi> as AC X CB.</p>
                <p>3. If the upper and under surfaces be parallel, the breadth must be as AC X
                    CB.</p>
                <p>II. If the beam be necessarily loaded at some given point C, and we would have
                    the beam equally able in all its parts to resist the strain arising from the
                    weight at C, we must make the strength of every transvense section between C and
                    either end as its distance from that end. Therefore,</p>
                <p>1. If the sides be parallel vertical planes, we must make CD <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ,</hi>: EF <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> = AC: AE.</p>
                <p>2. If the sections be similar, then CD <hi rend="superscript"> 3</hi>: EF <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 3</hi> = AC: AE.</p>
                <p>3. If the upper and under surfaces be parallel, then breadth at C: breadth at E =
                    AC: AE.</p>
                <p>The same principles enable us to determine the strain and strength of square or
                    circular plates of different extent but equal thickness. This may be
                    comprehended in this general proposition.</p>
                <p>Similar plates of equal thickness supported all round will carry the same
                    absolute weight, uniformly distributed, or resting on similar points, whatever
                    be their extent.</p>
                <p>Suppose two similar oblong plates of equal thickness, and let their lengths and
                    breadths be L, ∕, and B, <hi rend="italic">b.</hi> Let their strength or
                    momentum of cohesion be C, c, and the strains from the weights W, <hi
                    rend="italic">w,</hi> be S, <hi rend="italic">s.</hi></p>
                <p>Suppose the plates supported at the ends only, and resisting fracture
                    transversely. The strains, being as the weights and lengths, are as WL and <hi
                    rend="italic">wl,</hi> but their cohesions are as the breadths; and since they
                    are of equal relative strength, we have WL: <hi rend="italic">wl</hi> = B: <hi
                    rend="italic">b,</hi> and WL5 ≡ <hi rend="italic">wlB,</hi> and L: <hi
                    rend="italic">l</hi> = wB: Wb; but since they are of similar shapes, L: <hi
                    rend="italic">l</hi> = B: <hi rend="italic">b,</hi> and therefore <hi
                    rend="italic">w —</hi> W.</p>
                <p>The same reasoning holds again when they are also supported along the sides, and
                    therefore holds when they are supported all round (in which case the strength is
                    doubled).</p>
                <p>And if the plates be of any other figure, such as circles or ellipses, we need
                    only conceive similar rectangles inscribed in them. These are supported all
                    around by the continuity of the plates, and therefore will sustain equal
                    weights; and the same may be said of the segments which lie without them,
                    because the strengths of any similar segments are equal, their lengths being as
                    their breadths.</p>
                <p>Therefore the thickness of the bottoms of vessels holding heavy liquors or grains
                    should be as their diameters and as the square root of their depths jointly.</p>
                <p>Also the weight which a square plate will bear is to that which a bar of the same
                    matter and thickness will bear as twice the length of the bar to its
                    breadth.</p>
                <p>There is yet another modification of the strain which tends to break a body
                    transversely, which is of very frequent occurrence, and in some cases must be
                    very carefully attended to, viz. the strain arising from its own weight.</p>
                <p>When a beam projects from a wall, every section is strained by the weight of all
                    that projects beyond it. This may be considered as all collected at its centre
                    of gravity. Therefore the strain on any section is in the joint ratio of the
                    weight of what projects beyond it, and the distance of its centre of gravity
                    from the section.</p>
                <p>The determination of this strain, and of the strength necessary for withstanding
                    it, must be more complicated than the former, because the form of the piece
                    which results from this adjustment of strain and strength influences the strain.
                    The general principle must evidently be, that the strength or momentum of
                    cohesion of every section must be as the product of the weight beyond it,
                    multiplied by the distance of its centre of gravity. For example:</p>
                <p>Suppose the beam DLA (fig. 15) to project from the wall, and that its sides are
                    parallel vertical planes, so that the depth is the only variable dimension. Let
                    LB = <hi rend="italic">x</hi> and B <hi rend="italic">b</hi> = y. The element
                    BbcC is = <hi rend="italic">xy.</hi> Let G be the centre of gravity of the part
                    lying without Βb, and <hi rend="italic">g</hi> be its distance from the

                    parabola touching the horizontal line in L.</p>
                <p>It is easy to see that a conoid formed by the rotation of this figure round DL
                    will also be equally able in every section to bear its own weight.</p>
                <p>We need not prosecute this farther. When the figure of the piece is given, there
                    is no difficulty in finding the strain; and the circumstance of equal strength
                    to resist this strain is chiefly a matter of curiosity.</p>
                <p>It is evident, from what has been already said, that a projecting beam becomes
                    less able to bear its own weight as it projects farther. Whatever may be the
                    strength of the section DA, the length may be such that it will break by its own
                    weight. If we suppose two beams A and B of the same substance and similar
                    shapes, that is, having their lengths and diameters in the same proportion; and
                    further suppose that the shorter can just bear its own weight; then the longer
                    beam will not be able to do the same; for the strengths of the sections are as
                    the cubes of the diameters, while the strains are as the biquadrates of the
                    diameters; because the weights are as the cubes, and the levers by which these
                    weights act in producing the strain are as the lengths or as the diameters.</p>
                <p>These considerations show us, that in all cases where strain is affected by the
                    weight of the parts of the machine or structure of any kind, the smaller bodies
                    are more able to withstand it than the greater; and there seem to be bounds set
                    by nature to the size of machines constructed of any given materials. Even when
                    the weight of the parts of the machine is not taken into the account, we cannot
                    enlarge them in the same proportion in all their parts. Thus a steam-engine
                    cannot be doubled in all its parts, so as to be still efficient. The pressure on
                    the piston is quadrupled. If the lift of the pump be also doubled in height
                    while it is doubled in diameter, the load will be increased eight times, and
                    will therefore exceed the power. The depth of lift, therefore, must remain
                    unchanged; and in this case the machine will be of the same relative strength as
                    before, independent of its own weight. For the beam being doubled in all its
                    dimensions, its momentum of cohesion is eight times greater, which is again a
                    balance for a quadruple load acting by a double lever. But if we now consider
                    the increase of the weight of the machine itself, which must be supported, and
                    which must be put in motion by the intervention of its cohesion, we see that the
                    large machine is weaker and less efficient than the small one.</p>
                <p>There is a similar limit set by nature to the size of plants and animals formed
                    of the same matter. The cohesion of an herb could not support it if it were
                    increased to the size of a tree, nor could an oak support itself if forty or
                    fifty times bigger; nor could an animal of the make of a long-legged spider be
                    increased to the size of a man; the articulations of its legs could not support
                    it.</p>
                <p>Hence may be understood the prodigious superiority of the small animals both in
                    strength and agility. A man by falling twice his own height may break his
                    firmest bones. A mouse may fall twenty times its height without risk; and even
                    the tender mite or wood louse may fall unhurt from the top of a steeple. But
                    their greatest superiority is in respect of nimbleness and agility. A flea can
                    leap above 500 times its own length, while the strength of the human muscles
                    could not raise the trunk from the ground on limbs of the same construction.</p>
                <p>The angular motions of small animals (in which consists their nimbleness or
                    agility) must be greater than those of large animals, supposing the force of the
                    muscular fibre to be the same in both. For supposing them similar, the number of
                    equal fibres will be as the square of their linear dimensions; and the levers by
                    which they act are as their linear dimensions. The energy therefore of the
                    moving force is as the cube of these dimensions. But the momentum of inertia, or
                    ∫ <hi rend="italic">p</hi> ∙ r <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi>, is as the fourth
                    power; therefore the angular velocity of the greater animals is smaller. The
                    number of strokes which a fly makes with its wings in a second is astonishingly
                    great; yet, being voluntary, they are the effects of its agility.</p>
                <p>We have hitherto confined our attention to the simplest form in which this
                    transverse strain can be produced. This was quite sufficient for showing us the
                    mechanism of nature by which the strain is resisted; and a very slight attention
                    is sufficient for enabling us to reduce to this every other way in which the
                    strain can be produced. We shall not take up the reader’s time with the
                    application of the same principles to other cases of this strain, but refer him
                    to what has been said in the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Roof.</hi> In that
                    article we have shown the analogy between the strain on the section of a beam
                    projecting from a wall and loaded at the extremity, and the strain on the same
                    section of a beam simply resting on supports at the ends, and loaded at some
                    intermediate point or points. The strain on the middle C of a beam AB (fig. 16)
                    so supported, arising from a weight laid on there, is the same with the strain
                    which half that weight hanging at B would produce on the same section C, if the
                    other end of the beam were fixed in a wall. If therefore 1000 pounds hung on the
                    end of a beam projecting ten feet from a wall will just break it at the wall, it
                    will require 4000 pounds on its middle to break the same beam resting on two
                    props ten feet asunder. We have also shown in that article the additional
                    strength which will be given to this beam by extending both ends beyond the
                    props, and there framing it firmly into other pillars or supports. We can hardly
                    add any thing to what has been said in that article, except a few observations
                    on the effects of the obliquity of the external force. We have hitherto supposed
                    it to act in the direction BP (fig. 6) perpendicular to the length of the beam.
                    Suppose it to act in the direction BP', oblique to BA. In the article <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Roof</hi> we supposed the strain to be the same as if the force
                    <hi rend="italic">p</hi> acted at the distance AB', but still perpendicular to
                    AB: so it is. But the strength of the section A∆ is not the same in both cases;
                    for by the obliquity of the action the piece DCK∆ is pressed to the other. We
                    are not sufficiently acquainted with the corpuscular forces to say precisely
                    what will be the effect of the pressure arising from this obliquity; but we can
                    clearly see in general, that the point A, which in the instant of fracture<pb
                    break="no" facs="ht:chi.28490924&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=917"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0720-0917-0771"/> is neither stretched nor compressed, must now be
                    farther up, or nearer to D; and therefore the number of particles which are
                    exerting cohesive forces is smaller, and therefore the strength is diminished.
                    Therefore, when we endeavour to proportion the strength of a beam to the strain
                    arising from an external force acting obliquely, we make too liberal allowance
                    by increasing this external force in the ratio of AB to AB'. We acknowledge our
                    inability to assign the proper correction. But this circumstance is of very
                    great influence. In many machines, and many framings of carpentry, this oblique
                    action of the straining force is unavoidable; and the most enormous strains to
                    which materials are exposed are generally of this kind. In the frames set up for
                    carrying the ringstones of arches, it is hardly possible to avoid them; for
                    although the judicious engineer dispose his beams so as to sustain only
                    pressures in the direction of their lengths, tending either to crush them or to
                    tear them asunder, it frequently happens that, by the settling of the work, the
                    pieces come to check and. bear on each other transversely, tending to break each
                    other across. This we have remarked upon in the article <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Roof,</hi> with respect to a truss by Mr Price (see <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Roof,</hi> p. 452-54). Now when a cross strain is thus combined with an
                    enormous pressure in the direction of the length of the beam, it is in the
                    utmost danger of snapping suddenly across. This is one great cause of the
                    carrying away of masts. They are compressed in the direction of their length by
                    the united force of the shrouds, and in this state the transverse action of the
                    wind soon completes the fracture.</p>
                <p>When considering the compressing strains to which materials are exposed, we
                    deferred the discussion of the strain on columns, observing that it was not, in
                    the cases which usually occur, a simple compression, but was combined with a
                    transverse strain, arising from the bending of the column. When the column ACB
                    (fig. 17), resting on tl∣e ground at B, and loaded at top with a weight A,
                    acting in the vertical direction AB, is bent into a curve ACB, so that the
                    tangent at C is perpendicular to the horizon, its condition somewhat resembles
                    that of a beam firmly fixed between B and C, and strongly pulled by the end A,
                    so as to bend it between C and A. Although we cannot conceive how a force acting
                    on a straight column AB in the direction AB can bend it, we may suppose that the
                    force acted first in the horizontal direction Aft till it was bent to this
                    degree, and that the rope was then gradually removed from the direction Aft to
                    the direction AB, increasing the force as much as is necessary for preserving
                    the same quantity of flexure.</p>
                <p>The first author, we believe, who considered this important subject with
                    scrupulous attention was the celebrated Euler, who published in the Berlin
                    Memoirs for 1757 his Theory of the Strength of Columns. The general proposition
                    established by this theory is, that the strength of prismatical columns is in
                    the direct quadruplicate ratio of their diameters, and the inverse duplicate
                    ratio of their lengths. he prosecuted this subject in the Petersburg
                    Commentaries for 1778, confirming his former theory. We do not find that any
                    other author has bestowed much attention on it, all seeming to acquiesce in the
                    determinations of Euler, and to consider the subject as of very great
                    difficulty, requiring the application of the most refined mathematics.
                    Muschenbroeck has compared the theory with experiment; but the comparison has
                    been very unsatisfactory, the difference from the theory being so enormous as to
                    afford no argument for its justness. But the experiments do not contradict it,
                    for they are so anomalous as to afford no conclusion or general rule
                    whatever.</p>
                <p>To say the truth, the theory can be considered in no other light than as a
                    specimen of ingenious and very artfill algebraic analysis. Euler was
                    unquestionably the first analyst in Europe for resource and address. He knew
                    this, and enjoyed his superiority, and without scruple admitted any physical
                    assumptions which gave him an opportunity of displaying his skill. The
                    inconsistency of his assumptions with the known laws of mechanism gave him no
                    concern; and when his algebraic processes led him to any conclusion which would
                    make his readers stare, being contrary to all our usual notions, he frankly
                    owned the paradox, but went on in his analysis, saying, <hi rend="italic">Sed
                    analyst magis fidendum.</hi> Mr Robins has given some very risible instances of
                    this confidence in his analysis, or rather of his confidence in the indolent
                    submission of his readers. Nay, so fond was he of this kind of amusement, that
                    after having published an untenable Theory of Light and Colours, he published
                    several Memoirs, explaining the aberration of the heavenly bodies, deducing some
                    very wonderful consequences, fully confirmed by experience, from the Newtonian
                    principles, which were opposite and totally inconsistent with his own theory,
                    merely because the Newtonian theory gave him <hi rend="italic">occasionem
                    analyseos promovenda·.</hi> We are thus severe in our observations, because his
                    Theory of the Strength of Columns is one of the strongest instances of this
                    wanton kind of proceeding, and because his followers in the Academy of St
                    Petersburg, such as Fuss, Lexill, and others, adopt his conclusions, and merely
                    echo his words. Since the death of Daniel Bernoulli, no member of that academy
                    has controverted any thing advanced by their <hi rend="italic">Professor
                    sublimis Geometrice,</hi> to whom they had been indebted for their places and
                    for all their knowledge, having been (most of them) his amanuenses, employed by
                    this wonderful man during his blindness, to make his computations and carry on
                    his algebraic investigations. We are not a little surprised to see Mr Emerson, a
                    considerable mathematician, and a man of very independent spirit, hastily
                    adopting the same theory, of which we doubt not but our readers will easily see
                    the falsity.</p>
                <p>Euler considers the column ACB as in a condition precisely similar to that of an
                    elastic rod bent into the curve by a cord AB connecting its extremities. In this
                    he is not mistaken. But he then draws CD perpendicudar to AB, and considers the
                    strain on the section C as equal to the momentum or mechanical energy of the
                    weight A, acting in the direction DE, upon the lever <hi rend="italic">kc</hi>
                    D, moveable round the fulcrum <hi rend="italic">c,</hi> and tending to tear
                    asunder the particles which cohere along the section <hi rend="italic">c</hi> C
                    <hi rend="italic">k.</hi> This is the same principle (as Euler admits) employed
                    by James Bernoulli in his investigation of the elastic curve ACB. Euler
                    considers the strain on the section <hi rend="italic">ck</hi> as the same with
                    what it would sustain if the same power acted in the horizontal direction EF on
                    a point E, as far removed from C as the point D is. We reasoned in the same
                    manner (as has been observed) in the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Roof,</hi>
                    where the obliquity of action was inconsiderable. But in the present case this
                    substitution leads to the greatest mistakes, and has rendered the whole of this
                    theory false and useless. It would be just if the column were of materials which
                    are incompressible. But it is evident, by what has been said above, that by the
                    compression of the parts the real fulcrum of the lever shifts away from the
                    point <hi rend="italic">c</hi>, so much the more as the compression is greater.
                    In the great compressions of loaded columns, and the almost unmeasurable
                    compressions of the truss-beams in the centres of bridges, and other cases of
                    chief importance, the fulcrum is shifted far over towards <hi rend="italic"
                    >k,</hi> so that very few fibres resist the fracture by their cohesion, and
                    these few have a very feeble energy or momentum, on account of the short arm of
                    the lever by which they act. This is a most important consideration in
                    carpentry, yet makes no element of Euler’s theory. The consequence of this is,
                    that a very small degree of curvature is sufficient<pb break="no"

                    'to cause the column or strut to snap in an instant, as is well known to every
                    experienced carpenter. The experiment by Muschenbroeck, which Euler makes use of
                    in order to obtain a measure of strength in a particular instance, from which he
                    might deduce all others by his theorem, is an incontestable proof of this. The
                    force which broke the column is not the twentieth part of what is necessary for
                    breaking it by acting at E in the direction EF. Euler takes no notice of this
                    immense discrepancy, because it must have caused him to abandon the speculation
                    with which he was then amusing himself.</p>
                <p>The limits of this work do not afford room to enter minutely upon the refutation
                    of this theory; but we can easily show its uselessness, by its total
                    inconsistency with common observation. It results legitimately from this theory,
                    that if CD have no magnitude, the weight A can have no momentum, and the column
                    cannot be broken. True, it cannot be broken in this way, snapped by a transverse
                    fracture, if it do not bend; but we know very well that it can be crushed or
                    crippled, and we see this frequently happen. This circumstance or event does not
                    enter into Euler’s investigation, and therefore the theory is at least imperfect
                    and useless. Had this crippling been introduced in the form of a physical
                    assumption, every topic of reasoning employed in the process must have been laid
                    aside, as the intelligent reader will easily see. But the theory is not only
                    imperfect, but false. The ordinary reader will be convinced of this by another
                    legitimate consequence of it. Fig. 18 is the same with fig. 106 of Emerson’s
                    Mechanics, where this subject is treated on Euler’s principles, and represents a
                    crooked piece of matter resting on the ground at F, and loaded at A with a
                    weight acting in the vertical direction AF. It results from Euler’s theory that
                    the strains at <hi rend="italic">b,</hi> B, D, E, &amp;c. are as <hi
                    rend="italic">bc,</hi> BC, DI, EK, &amp;c. Therefore the strains at G and H are
                    nothing; and this is asserted by Emerson and Euler as a serious truth; and the
                    piece may be thinned <hi rend="italic">ad infinitum</hi> in these two places, or
                    even cut through, without any diminution of its strength. The absurdity of litis
                    assertion strikes at first hearing. Euler asserts the same thing with respect to
                    a point of contrary flexure. Farther discussion is, we apprehend, needless.</p>
                <p>This theory must therefore be given up. Yet these dissertations of Euler in the
                    Petersburg Commentaries deserve a perusal, both as very ingenious specimens of
                    analysis, and because they contain maxims of practice which are important.
                    Although they give an erroneous measure of the comparative strength of columns,
                    they show the immense importance of preventing all bendings, and point out with
                    accuracy where the tendencies to bend are greatest, and how this may be
                    prevented by very small forces, and what a prodigious accession of force this
                    gives the column. There is a valuable paper in the same volume by Fuss on the
                    Strains on framed Carpentry, which may also be read with advantage.</p>
                <p>It will now be asked, what shall be substituted in place of this erroneous
                    theory? what is the true proportion of the strength of columns? We acknowledge
                    our inability to give a satisfactory answer. This can only be obtained by a
                    previous knowledge of the proportion between the extensions and compressions
                    produced by equal forces, by the knowledge of the absolute compressions
                    producible by a given force, and by a knowledge of the degree of that
                    derangement of parts which is termed crippling. These circumstances are but
                    imperfectly known to us, and there lies before us a wide field of experimental
                    inquiry. Fortunately the force requisite for crippling a beam is prodigious, and
                    a very small lateral support is sufficient to prevent that bending which puts
                    the beam in imminent danger. A judicious engineer will always employ transverse
                    bridles, as they arc called to stay the middle of long beams which are employed
                    as pillars, struts, or truss-beams, and are exposed, by their position, to
                    enormous pressures in the direction of their lengths. Such stays may be
                    observed, disposed with great judgment and economy, in the centres employed by
                    Mr Perronet in the erection of his great stone arches. He was obliged to correct
                    this omission made by his ingenious predecessor in the beautiful centres of the
                    bridge of Orleans, which we have no hesitation in affirming to be the finest
                    piece of carpentry in the world.</p>
                <p>It only remains on this head to compare these theoretical deductions with
                    experiment.</p>
                <p>Experiments on the transverse strength of bodies are easily made, and accordingly
                    are very numerous, especially those made on timber, which is the case most
                    common and most interesting. But in this great number of experiments there are
                    very few from which we can draw much practical information. The experiments have
                    in general been made on such small scantlings, that the unavoidable natural
                    inequalities bear too great a proportion to the strength of the whole piece.
                    Accordingly, when we compare the experiments of different authors, we find them
                    differ enormously, and even the experiments by the same author are very
                    anomalous. The completent series that we have yet seen is that detailed by
                    Behdor in his <hi rend="italic">Science des Ingenieurs.</hi> They are contained

                    rend="italic">ad</hi> be the depths, and DC, <hi rend="italic">dc</hi> the
                    breadths. The batten ABCD will be the stronger, for the same reason that an
                    assemblage of planks set edgewise will form a stronger joist than planks laid
                    above each other like the plates of a coach-spring. Μ. Buffon found by many
                    trials that the strength of ABCD was to that of <hi rend="italic">abed</hi> (in
                    oak) nearly as eight to seven. The authors of the different experiments were not
                    careful that their battens had their plates all disposed similarly with respect
                    to the strain. But even with this precaution they would not have afforded sure
                    grounds of computation for large works; for great beams occupy much, if not the
                    whole, of the section of the tree; and from this it has happened that their
                    strength is less than in proportion to that of a small lath or batten. In short,
                    we can trust no experiments but such as have been made on large beams. These
                    must be very rare, for they are most expensive and laborious, and exceed the
                    abilities of most of those who are disposed to study this subject.</p>
                <p>But we are not wholly without such authority. Μ. Buffon and Μ. Duhamel, two of
                    the first philosophers and mechanicians of the age, were directed by government
                    to make experiments on this subject, and were supplied with ample funds and
                    apparatus. The relation of their experiments is to be found in the Memoirs of
                    the French Academy for 1740, 1741, 1742, 1768; as also in Duhamel’s valuable
                    performances <hi rend="italic">Sur l’Exploitation des Arbres, et sur la
                    Conservation et le Transport de Bois.</hi> We earnestly recommend these
                    dissertations to the perusal of our readers, as containing much useful
                    information relative to the strength of timber, and the best methods of
                    employing it. We shall here give an abstract of Μ. Buffon’s experiments.</p>
                <p>He relates a great number which, during two years, he had prosecuted on small
                    battens. He found that the odds of a single layer, or part of a layer, more or
                    less, or even a different disposition of them, had such influence that he was
                    obliged to abandon this method, and to have recourse to the largest beams that
                    he was able to break. The following table exhibits one series of experiments on
                    bars of sound oak, clear of knots, and four inches square. This is a specimen of
                    all the rest.</p>
                <p>Column 1st is the length of the bar in clear feet between the supports.</p>
                <p>Column 2d is the weight of the bar (the second day after it was felled) in
                    pounds. Two bars were tried of each length. Each of the first three pairs
                    consisted of two cuts of the same tree. The one next the root was always found
                    the heaviest, stiffest, and strongest. Indeed Μ. Buffon says that this was
                    invariably true, that the heaviest was always the strongest; and he recommends
                    it as a certain (or sure) rule for the choice of timber. He finds that this is
                    always the case when the timber has grown vigorously, forming very thick annual
                    layers. But he also observes that this is only during the advances of the tree
                    to maturity; for the strength of the different circles approaches gradually to
                    equality during the tree’s healthy growth, and then it decays in these parts in
                    a contrary order. Our tool-makers assert the same thing with respect to beech:
                    yet a contrary opinion is very prevalent; and wood with a fine, that is, a small
                    grain, is frequently preferred. Perhaps no person has ever made the trial with
                    such minuteness as Μ. Buffon, and we think that much deference is due to his
                    opinion.</p>
                <p>Column 3d is the number of pounds necessary for breaking the tree in the course
                    of a few minutes.</p>
                <p>Column 4th is the number of inches which it bent down before breaking.</p>
                <p>Column 5th is the time at which it broke.</p>

                <p>Μ. Buffon had found, by numerous trials, that oak-timber lost much of its
                    strength in the course of drying or season-<pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:chi.28490924&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=920" xml:id="kp-eb0720-0920-0774"/>
                    ing; and therefore, in order to secure uniformity, his trees were all felled in
                    the same season of the year, were squared the day after, and tried the third
                    day. Trying them in this green state gave him an opportunity of observing a very
                    curious and unaccountable phenomenon. When the weights were laid briskly on,
                    nearly sufficient to break the log, a very sensible smoke was observed to issue
                    from the two ends with a sharp hissing noise. This continued all the while the
                    tree was bending and cracking. This shows that the log is affected or strained
                    through its whole length. Indeed this must be inferred from its bending through
                    its whole length. It also shows us the great effects of the compression. It is a
                    pity Μ. Buffon did not take notice whether this smoke issued from the upper or
                    compressed half of the section only, or whether it came from the whole.</p>
                <p>We must now make some observations on these experiments, in order to compare them
                    with the theory which we have endeavoured to establish.</p>
                <p>Μ. Buffon considers the experiments with the five-inch bars as tire standard of
                    comparison, having both extended these to greater lengths, and having tried more
                    pieces of each length.</p>
                <p>Our theory determines the relative strength of bars of the same section to be
                    inversely as their lengths. But, if we except the five experiments in the first
                    column, we find a very great deviation from this rule. Thus the five-inch bar of
                    twenty-eight feet long should have half the strength of that of fourteen feet,
                    or 2650; whereas it is but 1775. The bar of fourteen feet should have half the
                    strength of that of seven feet, or 5762; whereas it is but 5360. In like manner,
                    the fourth of 11,525 is 2881; but the real strength of the twenty-eight feet bar
                    is 1775. We have added a column A, which exhibits the strength which each of the
                    five-inch bars ought to have by the theory. This deviation is most distinctly
                    seen in fig. 20, where BK is the scale of lengths, B being at the point seven of
                    the scale, and K at twenty-eight. The ordinate CB is = 11,525, and the other
                    ordinates DE, GK, &amp;c. are respectively = <hi rend="superscript"> 7CB</hi> /
                    <hi rend="subscript"> length</hi>. The lines DF, GH, &amp;c. arc made = 4350,
                    1775, &amp;c, expressing the strengths given by experiment. The ten-feet bar and
                    the twenty-four feet bar are remarkably anomalous. But all are deficient, and
                    the defect has an evident progression from the first to the last. The same thing
                    may be shown of the other columns, and even of the first, though it is very
                    small in that column. It may also be observed in the experiments of Belidor, and
                    in all that we have seen. We cannot doubt therefore of its being a law of
                    nature, depending on the true principles of cohesion and the laws of
                    mechanics.</p>
                <p>But it is very puzzling, and we cannot pretend to give a satisfactory explanation
                    of the difficulty. The only effect which we can conceive the length of a beam to
                    have, is to increase the strain at the section of fracture, by employing the
                    intervening beam as a lever. But we do not distinctly see what change this can
                    produce in the mode of action of the fibres in this section, so as either to
                    change their cohesion or the place of its centre of effort: yet something of
                    this kind must happen.</p>
                <p>We see indeed some circumstances which must contribute to make a smaller weight
                    sufficient, in Μ. Buffon’s experiments, to break a long beam, than in the exact
                    inverse proportion of its length.</p>
                <p>In the first place, the weight of the beam itself augments the strain as much as
                    if half of it were added in the form of a weight. Μ. Buffon has given the
                    weights of every beam on which he made experiments, which is very nearly
                    seventy-four pounds per cubic loot. But they are much too small to account for
                    the deviation from the theory. The half weights of the five-inch beams of seven,
                    fourteen, and twenty-eight feet length, are only forty-five, ninety-two, and 182
                    pounds; which makes the real strains in the experiments 11,560, 5390, and 1956;
                    which are far from having the proportions of four, two, and one.</p>
                <p>Buffon says that healthy trees arc universally strongest at the root end;
                    therefore, when we use a longer beam, its middle point, where it is broken in
                    the experiment, is in a weaker part of the tree. But the trials of the four-inch
                    beams show that the difference from this cause is almost insensible.</p>
                <p>The length must have some mechanical influence which the theory we have adopted
                    has not yet explained. It may not however be inadequate to the task. The very
                    ingenious investigation of the elastic curve by James Bernoulli and other
                    celebrated mathematicians is perhaps as refined an application of mathematical
                    analysis as we know. Yet in this investigation it was necessary, in order to
                    avoid almost insuperable difficulties, to take the simplest possible case, viz.
                    where the thickness is exceedingly small in comparison with the length. If the
                    thickness be considerable, the quantities neglected in the calculus are too
                    great to permit the conclusion to be accurate, or very nearly so. Without being
                    able to define the form into which an elastic body of considerable thickness
                    will be bent, we can say with confidence, that in an extreme case, where the
                    compression in the concave side is very great, the curvature differs
                    considerably from the Bernoullian curve. But as our investigation is incomplete
                    and very long, we do not offer it to the reader. The following more familiar
                    considerations will, we apprehend, render it highly probable that the relative
                    strength of beams decreases faster than in the inverse ratio of their length.
                    The curious observation by Μ. Buffon, of the vapour which issued with the
                    hissing noise from the ends of a beam of green oak, while it was breaking by the
                    load on its middle, shows that the whole length of the piece was affected:
                    indeed it must be, since it is bent throughout. We have shown above, that a
                    certain definite curvature of a beam of a given form is always accompanied by
                    rupture. Now suppose the beam A of ten feet long, and the beam B of twenty feet
                    long, bent to the same degree, at the place of their fixture in the wall; the
                    weight which hangs on A is nearly double of that which must hang on B. The form
                    of any portion, suppose five feet, of these two beams, immediately adjoining to
                    the wall, is considerably different. At the distance of five feet the curvature
                    of A is half of its curvature at the wall. The curvature of B in the
                    corresponding point is three fourths of the same curvature at the wall. Through
                    the whole of the intermediate five feet, therefore, the curvature of B is
                    greater than that of A. This must make it weaker throughout. It must occasion
                    the fibres to slide more on each other (that it may acquire <hi rend="italic"
                    >this</hi> greater curvature), and thus affect their lateral union; and
                    therefore those which are stronger will not assist their weaker neighbours. To
                    this we must add, that in the shorter beams the force with which the fibres are
                    pressed laterally on each other is double. This must impede the<pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:chi.28490924&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=921" xml:id="kp-eb0720-0921-0775"/>
                    mutual eliding of the fibres which we mentioned a little ago; nay, this lateral
                    compression may change the law of longitudinal cohesion (as will readily appear
                    to the reader who is acquainted with Boscovich’s doctrines), and increase the
                    strength of the very surface of fracture, in the same way (however inexplicable)
                    as it does in metals when they are hammered or drawn into wire.</p>
                <p>The reader must judge how far these remarks are worthy of his attention. The
                    engineer will carefully keep in mind the important fact, that a beam of
                    quadruple length, instead of having one fourth of the strength, has only about
                    one sixth; and the philosopher should endeavour to discover the cause of this
                    diminution, that he may give the artist a more accurate rule of computation.</p>
                <p>Our ignorance of the law by which the cohesion of the particles changes by a
                    change of distance, hinders us from discovering the precise relation between the
                    curvature and the momentum of cohesion; and all we can do is to multiply
                    experiments, upon which we may establish some <hi rend="italic">empirical</hi>
                    rules for calculating the strength of solids. Those from which we must reason at
                    present are too few and too anomalous to be the foundation of such an empirical
                    formula. We may however observe, that Μ. Buffon’s experiments gave us
                    considerable assistance in this particular; for if to each of the numbers of the
                    column for the five-inch beams, corrected by adding half the weight of the beam,
                    we add the constant number 1245, we shall have a set of numbers which are very
                    nearly reciprocals of the lengths. Let 1245 be called <hi rend="italic">c</hi>,
                    and let the weight which is known by experiment to be necessary for breaking the
                    five-inch beam of the length <hi rend="italic">a</hi> be called P. We shall have
                    <hi rend="italic">— c∙=,p.</hi></p>
                <p>Thus the weight necessary for breaking the seven-feet bar is 11,560. This added
                    to 1245, and the sum multiplied by 7, gives P-f-c×α=89,635. LetZbelS;
                    then^^’^^—1245 =3725 = <hi rend="italic">p,</hi> which differs not more than <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 1</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"> 40</hi> th from what
                    experiment gives us. This rule holds equally well in all the other lengths
                    except the 10 and 24 feet beams, which are very anomalous. Such a formula is
                    abundantly exact for practice, and will answer through a much greater variety of
                    length, though it cannot be admitted as a true one; because, in a certain very
                    great length, the strength will be nothing. For other sizes the constant number
                    must change in the proportion of <hi rend="italic">d</hi><hi rend="italic
                    superscript"> 3</hi><hi rend="italic">,</hi> or perhaps of <hi rend="italic"
                    >p.</hi></p>
                <p>The next comparison which we have to make with the theory is the relation between
                    the strength and the square of the depth of the section. This is made by
                    comparing with each other the numbers in any horizontal line of the table. In
                    making this comparison we find the numbers of the five-inch bars uniformly
                    greater than the rest. We imagine that there is something peculiar to these
                    bars; they are in general heavier than in the proportion of their section, but
                    not so much so as to account for all their superiority. We imagine that this set
                    of experiments, intended as a standard for the rest, has been made at one time,
                    and that the season has had a considerable influence. The fact however is, that
                    if this column be kept out, or uniformly diminished about one sixteenth in their
                    strength, the different sizes will deviate very little from the ratio of the
                    square of the depth, as determined by theory. There is however a small
                    deficiency in the bigger beams.</p>
                <p>We have been thus anxious in the examination of these experiments, because they
                    are the only ones which have been related in sufficient detail, and made on a
                    proper scale for giving us data from which we can deduce confidential maxims for
                    practice. They are so troublesome and expensive that we have little hopes of
                    seeing their number greatly increased; yet surely our navy board would do an
                    unspeakable service to the public by appropriating a fund for such experiments
                    under the management of some man of science.</p>
                <p>There remains another comparison which is of chief importance, namely, the
                    proportion between the <hi rend="italic">absolute cohesion</hi> and the <hi
                    rend="italic">relative strength.</hi> It may be guessed, from the very nature of
                    the thing, that this must be very uncertain. Experiments on the absolute
                    strength must be confined to very small pieces, by reason of the very great
                    forces which are required for tearing them asunder. The values therefore deduced
                    from them must be subject to great inequalities. Unfortunately we possess no
                    detail of any experiments; all that we have to depend on are two passages of
                    Muschenbroeck’s <hi rend="italic">Essais de Physique;</hi> in one of which he
                    says, that a piece of sound oak <hi rend="superscript"> 27</hi> / <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 100</hi> ths of an inch square is torn asunder by 1150 pounds;
                    and in the other, that an oak plank twelve inches broad and one thick will just
                    suspend 189,163 pounds. These give for the cohesion of an inch square 15,755 and
                    15,763 pounds. Bouguer, in his <hi rend="italic">Traité du Navire,</hi> says
                    that it is very well known that a rod of sound oak one fourth of an inch square
                    will be torn asunder by 1000 pounds. This gives 16,000 for the cohesion of a
                    square inch. We shall take this as a round number, easily used in our
                    computations. Let us compare this with Μ. Buffon’s trials of beams four inches
                    square.</p>
                <p>The absolute cohesion of this section is 16,000×16= 256,000. Did every fibre
                    exert its whole force in the instant of fracture, the momentum of cohesion would
                    be the same as if it had all acted at the centre of gravity of the section at
                    two inches from the axis of fracture, and is therefore 512,000. The four-inch
                    beam, seven feet long, was broken by 5312 pounds hung on its middle. The half of
                    this, or 2656 pounds, would have broken it, if suspended at its extremity,
                    projecting 3½ feet, or 42 inches, from a wall. The momentum of this strain is
                    therefore 2656×42 = 111,552. Now this is in equilibrio with the actual momentum
                    of cohesion, which is therefore 111,552 instead of 512,000. The strength is
                    therefore diminished in the proportion of 512,000 to 111,552, or very nearly of
                    4∙59 to 1.</p>
                <p>As we are quite uncertain as to the place of the centre of effort, it is needless
                    to consider the full cohesion as acting at the centre of gravity, and producing
                    the momentum 512,000; and we may convert the whole into a simple multiplier <hi
                    rend="italic">in</hi> of the length, and say, <hi rend="italic">as</hi> in <hi
                    rend="italic">times the length is to the depth, so is the absolute cohesion of
                    the section to the relative strength.</hi> Therefore let the absolute cohesion
                    of a square inch be called <hi rend="italic">f,</hi> the breadth <hi
                    rend="italic">b,</hi> the depth <hi rend="italic">d,</hi> and the length <hi

                <p>y*</p>
                <p>This great diminution of strength cannot be wholly accounted for by the
                    inequality of the cohesive forces exerted in the instant of fracture; for in
                    this case we know that the centre of effort is at one third of the height in a
                    rectangular section (because the forces really exerted are as the extensions of
                    the fibres). The relative strength would <hi rend="italic">fbtP</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">p</hi> would have been 8127 instead of 2656.</p>
                <p>We must ascribe this diminution (which is three times greater than that produced
                    by the inequality of the cohesive forces) to the compression of the under part
                    of the beam; and we must endeavour to explain in what manner this compression
                    produces an effect which seems so little explicable by such means.</p>
                <p>As we have repeatedly observed, it is a matter of nearly universal experience
                    that the forces <hi rend="italic">actually</hi> exerted by the<pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:chi.28490924&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=922" xml:id="kp-eb0720-0922-0776"/>
                    particles of bodies, when stretched or compressed, are very nearly in the
                    proportion of the distances to which the particles are drawn from their natural
                    positions. Now, although we are certain that, in enormous compressions, the
                    forces increase faster than in this proportion, this makes no sensible change in
                    the present question, because the body is broken before the compressions have
                    gone so far; nay, we imagine that the compressed parts are crippled in most
                    cases even before the extended parts are torn asunder Muschenbroeck asserts this
                    with great confidence with respect to oak, on the authority of his own
                    experiments. He says, that although oak will suspend half as much again as fir,
                    it will not support, as a pillar, two thirds of the load which fir will support
                    in that form.</p>
                <p>We imagine therefore that the mechanism in the <hi rend="italic">present</hi>
                    case is nearly as follows:</p>
                <p>Let the beam DCK∆ (fig. 21) be loaded at its extremity with the weight P, acting
                    in the direction KP perpendicular to DC. Let D∆ be the section of fracture. Let
                    DA be about one third of D∆. A will be the particle or fibre which is neither
                    extended nor compressed. Make ∆δ = D <hi rend="italic">d</hi> = DA: A∆. The
                    triangles DA <hi rend="italic">d</hi>, ∆Aδ, will represent the accumulated
                    attracting and repelling forces. Make AI and A <hi rend="italic">i</hi> = <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 1</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi> DA and <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 1</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi> ∆A. The point I will
                    be that to which the full cohesion D <hi rend="italic">d</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">f</hi> of the particles in AD must be applied, so as to produce
                    the same momentum which the variable forces at I, D, &amp;c. really produce at
                    their several points of application. In like manner, <hi rend="italic">i</hi> is
                    the circle of similar effort of the repulsive forces excited by the compression
                    between A and Δ, and it is the real fulcrum of a bended lever I <hi
                    rend="italic">i</hi> K, by which the whole effect is produced. The effect is the
                    same as if the full cohesion of the stretched fibres in AD were accumulated in
                    I, and the full repulsion of all the compressed fibres in A∆ were accumulated in
                    <hi rend="italic">i</hi>. The forces which are balanced in the operation are the
                    weight P, acting by the arm <hi rend="italic">ki,</hi> and the full cohesion of
                    AD acting by the arm It. The forces exerted by the compressed fibres between A
                    and Δ only serve to give support to the lever, that it may exert its strain.</p>
                <p>We imagine that this does not differ much from the real procedure of nature. The
                    position of the point A may be different from what we have deduced from Buffon’s
                    experiments, compared with Muschenbroeck’s value of the absolute cohesion of a
                    square inch. If this last should be only 12,000, DA must be greater than we have
                    here made it, in the proportion of 12,000 to 16,000. For It must still be made =
                    <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi> A∆, supposing the
                    forces to be proportional to the extensions and compressions. There can be no
                    doubt that a part only of the cohesion of D∆ operates in resisting the fracture
                    in all substances which have any compressibility; and it is confirmed by the
                    experiments of Μ. Duhamel on willow, and the inferences are by no means confined
                    to that species of timber. We say, therefore, that when the beam is broken, the
                    cohesion of AD alone is exerted, and that each fibre exerts a force proportional
                    to its extension; and the accumulated momentum is the same as if the full
                    cohesion of AD were acting by the lever It = <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> /
                    <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi> d of D∆.</p>
                <p>It may be said, that if only one third of the cohesion of oak be exerted, it may
                    be cut two thirds through without weakening it. But this cannot be, because the
                    cohesion of the whole is employed in preventing the lateral slide so often
                    mentioned. We have no experiments to determine that it <hi rend="italic">may
                    not</hi> be cut through one third without loss of its strength.</p>
                <p>This must not be considered as a subject of mere speculative curiosity. It is
                    intimately connected with all the practical uses which we can make of this
                    knowledge; for it is almost the only way that we can learn the compressibility
                    of timber. Experiments on the direct cohesion are indeed difficult, and
                    exceedingly expensive if we attempt them in large pieces. But experiments on
                    compression are almost impracticable. The most instructive experiments would be,
                    first to establish, by a great number of trials, the transverse force of a
                    moderate batten; and then to make a great number of trials of the diminution of
                    its strength, by cutting it through on the concave side. This would very nearly
                    give us the proportion of the cohesion which really operates in resisting
                    fractures. Thus if it be found that one half of the beam may be cut on the under
                    side without diminution of its strength (taking care to drive in a slice of
                    harder wood), we may conclude that the point A is at the middle, or somewhat
                    above it.</p>
                <p>Much lies before the curious mechanician, and we are as yet very far from a
                    scientific knowledge of the strength of timber.</p>
                <p>In the mean time, we may derive from these experiments of Buffon a very useful
                    practical rule, without relying on any value of the absolute cohesion of oak. We
                    see that the strength is nearly as the breadth, as the square of the depth, and
                    as the inverse of the length, it is most convenient to measure the breadth and
                    depth of the beam in inches, and its length in feet. Since, then, a beam four
                    inches square and seven feet between the supports is broken by 5312 pounds, we
                    must conclude that a batten one inch square and one foot between the supports
                    will be broken by 581 pounds. Then the strength of any other beam of oak, or the
                    weight which will just break it when hung on <hi rend="italic">bd</hi><hi
                    rend="italic superscript"> 2</hi> its middle, is 581 -y.</p>
                <p>But we have seen that there is a very considerable deviation from the inverse
                    proportion of the lengths, and we must endeavour to accommodate our ride to this
                    deviation. We found, that by adding 1245 to each of the ordinates or numbers in
                    the column of the five-inch bars, we had a set of numbers very nearly reciprocal
                    of the lengths; and if we make a similar addition to the other columns in the
                    proportion of the cubes of the sixes, we have nearly the same result. The
                    greatest error (except in the case of experiments which are very irregular) does
                    not exceed <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"> 15</hi> th of
                    the whole. Therefore, for a radical number, add to the 5312 the number 640,
                    which is to 1245 very nearly as 4 <hi rend="superscript"> 3</hi> to 5 <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 3</hi>. This gives 5952. The 64th of this is 93, which
                    corresponds to a bar of one inch square and seven feet long. Therefore 93 × 7
                    will be the reciprocal corresponding to a bar of one foot. This is 651. Take
                    from this the present empirical correction, which is <hi rend="superscript">
                    b40</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"> b4</hi>, or 10, and there remains 641 for the
                    strength of the bar. This gives us for a general rule <hi rend="italic">p —</hi>
                    651 — 10 <hi rend="italic">bd?.</hi><hi rend="italic">Example.</hi> Required the

                    experiment gives 11,487. The error is very small indeed. The rule is most
                    deficient in comparison with the five-inch bars, which, we have already said,
                    appear stronger than the rest.</p>
                <p>The following process is easily remembered by such as are not algebraists.</p>
                <p>Multiply the breadth in inches twice by the depth, and<pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:chi.28490924&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=923" xml:id="kp-eb0720-0923-0777"/>
                    call this product <hi rend="italic">f</hi> Multiply <hi rend="italic">f</hi> by
                    651, and divide by the length in feet. From the quotient take 10 times <hi
                    rend="italic">f</hi>. The remainder is the number of pounds which will break the
                    beam.</p>
                <p>We are not sufficiently sensible of our principles to be confident that the
                    correction 10 <hi rend="italic">f</hi> should be in the proportion of the
                    section, although we think it most probable. It is quite empirical, founded on
                    Buffon’s experiments. Therefore the safe way of using this rule is to suppose
                    the beam square, by increasing or diminishing its breadth till equal to the
                    depth. Then find the strength by this rule, and diminish or increase it for the
                    change which has been made in its breadth. Thus, there can be no doubt that the
                    strength of the beam given as an example is double of that of a beam of the same
                    depth and half the breadth.</p>
                <p>The reader cannot but observe that all this calculation relates to the very
                    greatest weight which a beam will bear for a very few minutes. Μ. Buffon
                    uniformly found that two thirds of this weight sensibly impaired its strength,
                    and frequently broke at the end of two or three months. One half of this weight
                    brought the beam to a certain bend, which did not increase after the first
                    minute or two, and may be borne by the beam for any length of time. But the beam
                    contracted a bend, of which it did not recover any considerable portion. One
                    third seemed to have no permanent effect on the beam; but it recovered its
                    rectilineal shape completely, even after having been loaded several months,
                    provided that the timber was seasoned when first loaded; that is to say, one
                    third of the weight which would quickly break a seasoned beam, or one fourth of
                    what would break one just felled, may lie on it for ever without giving the beam
                    a set.</p>
                <p>We have no detail of experiments on the strength of other kinds of timber: only
                    Μ. Buffon says, that fir has about <hi rend="superscript"> 6</hi> / <hi

                <p>We have been thus minute in our examination of the mechanism of this transverse
                    strain, because it is the greatest to which the parts of our machines are
                    exposed. We wish to impress on the minds of artists the necessity of avoiding
                    this as much as possible. They are improving in this respect, as may be seen by
                    comparing the centres on which stone arches of great span are now turned with
                    those of former times. They were formerly a load of mere joists resting on a
                    multitude of posts, which obstructed the navigation, and were frequently losing
                    their shape by some of the posts sinking into the ground. Now they are more
                    generally trusses, where the beams abut on each other, and are relieved from
                    transverse strains. But many performances of eminent artists are still very
                    injudiciously exposed to cross strains. We may instance one which is considered
                    as a fine work, viz. the bridge at Walton on Thames. Here every beam of the
                    great arch is a joist, and it hangs together by framing. The finest piece of
                    carpentry that we have seen is the centre employed in turning the arches of the
                    bridge at Orleans, described by Perronet. In the whole there is not one cross
                    strain. The beam, too, of Hornblower’s steam-engine is very scientifically
                    constructed.</p>
                <p>IV. The last species of strain which we are to examine is that produced by
                    twisting. This takes place in all axles which connect the working parts of
                    machines.</p>
                <p>Although we cannot pretend to have a very distinct conception of that
                    modification of the cohesion of a body by which it resists this kind of strain,
                    we can have no doubt that, when all the particles act alike, the resistance must
                    be proportional to the number. Therefore if we suppose the two parts ABCD, ABFE
                    (fig. 22), of the body EFCD to be of insuperable strength, but cohering more
                    weakly in the common surface</p>
                <p>AB, and that one part ABCD is pushed laterally in the direction AB, there can be
                    no doubt that it will yield only there, and that the resistance will be
                    proportional to the surface.</p>
                <p>In like manner, we can conceive a thin cylindrical tube, of which KAH (fig. 23)
                    is the section, as cohering more weakly in that section than anywhere else.
                    Suppose it to be grasped in both hands, and the two parts twisted round the axis
                    in opposite directions, as we would twist the joints of a flute; it is plain
                    that it will first fail in this section, which is the circumference of a circle,
                    and the particles of the two parts which are contiguous to this circumference
                    will be drawn from each other laterally. The total resistance will be as the
                    number of equally resisting particles, that is, as the circumference (for the
                    tube being supposed very thin, there can be no sensible difference between the
                    dilatation of the external and internal particles). We can now suppose another
                    tube within this, and a third within the second, and so on till we reach the
                    centre. If the particles of each ring exerted the same force (by suffering the
                    same dilatation in the direction of the circumference), the resistance of each
                    ring of the section would be as its circumference and its breadth (supposed
                    indefinitely smalD, and the whole resistance would be as the surface; and this
                    would represent the resistance of a solid cylinder. But when a cylinder is
                    twisted in this manner by an external force applied to its circumference, the
                    external parts will suffer a greater circular extension than the internal; and
                    it appears that this extension (like the extension of a beam strained
                    transversely) will be proportional to the distance of the particles from the
                    axis. We cannot say that this is demonstrable, but we can assign no proportion
                    that is more probable. This being the case, the forces simultaneously exerted by
                    each particle will be as its distance from the axis. Therefore the whole force
                    exerted by each ring will be as the square of its radius, and the accumulated
                    force actually exerted will be as the cube of the radius; that is, the
                    accumulated force exerted by the whole cylinder, whose radius is CA, is to the
                    accumulated force exerted <hi rend="italic">at the same time</hi> by the part
                    whose radius is CE, as CA <hi rend="superscript"> 3</hi> to CE <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 3</hi>.</p>
                <p>The whole cohesion now exerted is just two thirds of what it would be if all the
                    particles were exerting the same attractive forces which are just now exerted by
                    the particles in the external circumference. This is plain to any person in the
                    least familiar with the fluxionary calculus. But such as are not may easily see
                    it in this way.</p>
                <p>Let the rectangle AC <hi rend="italic">ca</hi> be set upright on the surface of
                    the circle along the line CA, and revolve round the axis Cc. It will generate a
                    cylinder whose height is C <hi rend="italic">c</hi> or A♯, and having the circle
                    KAH for its base. If the diagonal C <hi rend="italic">a</hi> be supposed also to
                    revolve, it is plain that the triangle <hi rend="italic">cCa</hi> will generate
                    a cone of the same height, and having for its base the circle described by the
                    revolution of ca, and the point C for its apex. The cylindrical surface
                    generated by <hi rend="italic">Aa</hi> will express the whole cohesion exerted
                    by the circumference AHK, and the cylindrical surface generated by <hi
                    rend="italic">Ee</hi> will represent the cohesion exerted by the circumference
                    ELM, and the solid generated by the triangle <hi rend="italic">CAa</hi> will
                    represent the cohesion exerted by the whole circle AHK, and the cylinder
                    generated by the rectangle <hi rend="italic">ACca</hi> will represent the
                    cohesion exerted by the same surface if each particle had suffered the extension
                    <hi rend="italic">Aa.</hi></p>
                <p>Now it is plain, in the first place, that the solid generated by the triangle eEC
                    is to that generated by aAC as EC <hi rend="superscript"> 3</hi> to<pb
                    break="no" facs="ht:chi.28490924&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=924"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0720-0924-0778"/> AC’. In the next place, the solid generated by
                    aAC is two thirds of the cylinder, because the cone generated by cCa is one
                    third of it.</p>
                <p>We may now suppose the cylinder twisted till the particles in the external
                    circumference lose their cohesion. There can be no doubt that it will now be
                    wrenched asunder, all the inner circles yielding in succession. Thus we obtain
                    one useful information, viz. that a body of homogeneous texture resists a <hi
                    rend="italic">simple twist</hi> with two thirds of the force with which it
                    resists an attempt to force one part laterally from the other, or with one-third
                    part of the force which will cut it asunder by a square-edged tool; for to drive
                    a square-edged tool through a piece of lead, for instance, is the same as
                    forcing a piece of the lead as thick as the tool laterally away from the two
                    pieces on each side of the tool. Experiments of this kind do not seem difficult,
                    and they would give us very useful information.</p>
                <p>When two cylinders AHK and BNO are wrenched asunder, we must conclude that the
                    external particles of each are just put beyond their limits of cohesion, are
                    equally extended, and are exerting equal forces. Hence it follows, that in the
                    instant of fracture the sum-total of the forces actually exerted are as the
                    squares of the diameters.</p>
                <p>For drawing the diagonal C <hi rend="italic">e</hi>, it is plain that Ee = A <hi
                    rend="italic">a</hi> expresses the distension of the circumference ELM, and that
                    the solid generated by the triangle CEe expresses the cohesion exerted by the
                    surface of the circle ELM, when the particles in the circumference suffer the
                    extension Ee equal to A <hi rend="italic">a</hi>. Now the solids generated by CA
                    <hi rend="italic">a</hi> and CEe being respectively two thirds of the
                    corresponding cylinders, are as the squares of the diameters.</p>
                <p>Having thus ascertained the real strength of the section, and its relation to its
                    absolute lateral strength, let us examine its strength relative to the external
                    force employed to break it. This examination is very simple in the case under
                    consideration. The straining force must act by some lever, and the cohesion must
                    oppose it by acting on some other lever. The centre of the section may be the
                    neutral point, whose position is not disturbed.</p>
                <p>Let F be the force exerted laterally by an exterior particle. Let <hi
                    rend="italic">a</hi> be the radius of the cylinder, and <hi rend="italic">x</hi>
                    the indeterminate distance of any circumference, and <hi rend="italic">dx</hi>
                    the indefinitely small interval between the concentric arches; that is, let <hi
                    rend="italic">dx</hi> be the breadth of a ring and <hi rend="italic">x</hi> its
                    radius. The forces being as the extensions, and the extensions as the distances
                    from the axis, the cohesion actually exerted at any part of any ring will be <hi
                    rend="italic">f</hi><hi rend="italic superscript"> xdx</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >/</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> a</hi>. The force exerted by the whole ring
                    (being as the circumference or as the radius) will be ’ <hi rend="italic"

                <p>Hence we learn that the strength of an axle, by which it resists being wrenched
                    asunder by a force acting at a given distance from the axis, is as the cube of
                    its diameter.</p>
                <p>But, further, <hi rend="italic">⅛fa</hi><hi rend="italic superscript"> 3</hi> is
                    =∕α ’ × J <hi rend="italic">a.</hi> Now <hi rend="italic">fa</hi><hi
                    rend="italic superscript"> 2</hi> represents the full lateral cohesion of the
                    section. The momentum therefore is the same as if the full lateral cohesion were
                    accumulated at a point distant from the axis by one fourth of the radius, or one
                    eighth of the diameter of the cylinder.</p>
                <p>Therefore let F be the number of pounds which measure the lateral cohesion of a
                    circular inch, <hi rend="italic">d</hi> the diameter of the cylinder in inches,
                    and <hi rend="italic">l</hi> the length of the lever by which the straining
                    force <hi rend="italic">p</hi> is supposed to act; we shall have F <hi
                    rend="italic">×⅜d3=pZ,andF≤=p.</hi></p>
                <p>We see in general that the strength of an axle, by which it resists being
                    wrenched asunder by twisting, is as the cube of its diameter.</p>
                <p>We see also that the internal parts are not acting so powerfully as the external.
                    If a hole be bored out of the axle of half its diameter, the strength is
                    diminished only one eighth, while the quantity of matter is diminished one
                    fourth. Therefore hollow axles are stronger than solid ones containing the same
                    quantity of matter. Thus let the diameter be 5, and that of the hollow 4; then
                    the diameter of another solid cylinder having the same quantity of matter with
                    the tube is 3. The strength of the solid cylinder of the diameter 5 may be
                    expressed by 5 <hi rend="superscript"> 3</hi>, or 125. Of this the internal part
                    (of the diameter 4) exerts 64; therefore the strength of the tube is 125—64 =
                    61. But the strength of the solid axle of the same quantity of matter and
                    diameter 3 is 3 <hi rend="superscript"> 3</hi>, or 27, which is not half of that
                    of the tube.</p>
                <p>Engineers, therefore, have of late introduced this improvement in their machines,
                    and the axles of cast iron are all made hollow when their size will admit of it.
                    They have the additional advantage of being much stiffer, and of affording much
                    better fixture for the flanches which are used for connecting them with the
                    wheels or levers by which they are turned and strained. The superiority of
                    strength of hollow tubes over solid cylinders is much greater in this kind of
                    strain than in the former or transverse. In this last case the strength of this
                    tube would be to that of the solid cylinder of equal weight as 61 to 32 and a
                    half nearly.</p>
                <p>The apparatus which we mentioned on a former occasion for trying the lateral
                    strength of a square inch of solid matter, enabled us to try this theory of
                    twist with all desirable accuracy. The bar which hung down from the pin in the
                    former trials was now placed in a horizontal position, and loaded with a weight
                    at the extremity. Thus it acted as a powerful lever, and enabled us to wrench
                    asunder specimens of the strongest materials. We found the results perfectly
                    conformable to the theory, in as far as it determined the proportional strength
                    of different sizes and forms; but we found the ratio of the resistance to
                    twisting to the simple lateral resistance considerably different, and it was
                    some time before we discovered the cause.</p>
                <p>We had here taken the simplest view that is possible of the action of cohesion in
                    resisting a twist. It is frequently exerted in a very different way. When, for
                    instance, an iron axle is joined to a wooden one by being driven into one end of
                    it, the extensions of the different circles of particles are in a very different
                    proportion. A little consideration will show that the particles in immediate
                    contact with the iron axle are in a state of violent extension; so are the
                    particles of the exterior surface of the wooden part, and the intermediate parts
                    are less strained. It is almost impossible to assign the exact proportion of the
                    cohesive forces exerted in the different parts. Numberless cases can be pointed
                    out where parts of the axle are in a state of compression, and where it is still
                    more difficult to determine the state of the other particles. We must content
                    ourselves with the deductions made from this simple case, which is fortunately
                    the most common. In the experiments just now mentioned, the centre of the circle
                    is by no means the neutral point, and it is very difficult to ascertain its
                    place; but when this consideration occurred to us, we easily freed the
                    experiments from this uncertainty, by extending the lever to both sides, and by
                    means of a pulley applied equal force to each arm, acting in opposite
                    directions. Thus the centre became the neutral point, and the resistance to
                    twist was found to be two thirds of the simple lateral strength.</p>
                <p>We beg leave to mention here, that our success in these<pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:chi.28490924&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=925" xml:id="kp-eb0720-0925-0779"/>
                    experiments encouraged us to extend them much farther. We hoped by these means
                    to discover the absolute cohesion of many substances, which would have required
                    an enormous apparatus and a most unmanageable force to tear them asunder
                    directly. But we could reason with confidence from the resistance to twist
                    (which we could easily measure), provided that we could ascertain the proportion
                    of the direct and the lateral strengths. Our experiments on chalk, finely
                    prepared clay, and white bee’s wax (of one melting and one temperature), were
                    very consistent and satisfactory. But we have hitherto found great
                    irregularities in this proportion in bodies of a fibrous texture like timber.
                    These are the most important cases, and we still hope to be able to accomplish
                    our project, and to give the public some valuable information. This being our
                    sole object, it was our duty to mention the method which promises success, and
                    thus excite others to the task; and it will be no mortification to us to be
                    deprived of the honour of being the first who thus adds to the stock of
                    experimental knowledge.</p>
                <p>When the matter of the axle is of the most simple texture, such as that of
                    metals, we do not conceive that the length of the axle has any influence on the
                    fracture. It is otherwise if it be of a fibrous texture like timber; the fibres
                    are bent before breaking, being twisted into spirals like a cork-screw. The
                    length of the axle has somewhat of the influence of a lever in this case, and it
                    is easier wrenched asunder if long. Accordingly we have found it so; but we have
                    not been able to reduce this influence to calculation.</p>
                <p>Many useful deductions might be made from these premises respecting the manner of
                    disposing and combining the strength of materials in our structures. The best
                    form of joints, mortises, tenons, scarphs, the rules for joggling, tabling,
                    faying, fishing, &amp;c. practised in the delicate art of mast-making, arc all
                    founded on this doctrine; but the discussion of these would be equivalent to
                    writing a complete treatise of carpentry. <hi rend="smallcaps">(b. b.
