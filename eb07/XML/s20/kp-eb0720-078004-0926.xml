                <p><label type="entry">STUART, <hi rend="smallcaps">Gilbert</hi></label>, an eminent
                    jurist and historian, was born at Edinburgh in the year 1742. His father, George
                    Stuart, LL. D., had succeeded John Ker as professor of humanity during the
                    preceding year. According to the tradition of the university, he was an
                    excellent Latinist, but of his proficiency he has left no public proofs. He had
                    prepared an amended and enlarged edition of Ainsworth’s Latin Dictionary; but it
                    was never committed to the press, and its suppression may perhaps have been
                    occasioned by the too high estimate which the professor had formed of its
                    pecuniary value.</p>
                <p>The son was educated in the public school and in the university of his native
                    city. Of his proficiency in several branches of study, his various works afford
                    a sufficient criterion. To the pursuit of jurisprudence he devoted himself with
                    uncommon ardour; but although he had a strong relish for law as a science, he
                    anticipated no delight from its practice, and he was never called to the bar. Of
                    his early progress in this study he exhibited a very conspicuous specimen in a
                    work published without his name; “An Historical Dissertation concerning the
                    Antiquity of the English Constitution.” Edinb. 1768, 8vo. It has been asserted
                    that when he produced this work, he was little more than twenty years of age;
                    but the statement is not sufficiently accurate, for he had then attained his
                    twenty-sixth year. For a writer of that age, or indeed of any age, it is an
                    ingenious and able performance. His chief favourites and models are Tacitus and
                    Montesquieu. With no mean talents for research and disquisition, he has
                    endeavoured to evince that “the parts which compose our constitution arose more
                    immediately from the forests of Germany.” The same ground had recently been
                    occupied by the learned Dr Squire, bishop of St David’s; of whose Inquiry into
                    the Foundation of the English Constitution a second edition appeared in the year
                    1753. Stuart’s Dissertation, distinguished by so much vigour of intellect and
                    maturity of juridical learning, procured him from the university the degree of
                    LL. D., which is very rarely bestowed upon so young a scholar. A second edition,
                    bearing the author’s name, was published at London in the year 1771, and he then
                    prefixed a dedication to the earl of Mansfield.</p>
                <p>The dedication is dated at London in the month of January 1770; and before this
                    period he had become a regular contributor to the Monthly Review, with which he
                    continued his connexion from 1768 to 1774. We likewise find him employed as the
                    editor of “An Historical Treatise on the Feudal Law, and the Constitution and
                    Laws of England; with a Commentary on Magna Charta, and necessary Illustrations
                    of many of the English Statutes; in a<pb break="no"

                    Course of Lectures read in the University of Dublin, by the late Francis
                    Stoughton Sullivan, LL. D., Royal Professor of the Common Law in that
                    University.” Lond. 1772, 4to. Dr Sullivan had obtained a fellowship at the early
                    age of nineteen; and, as his editor informs us, he “was not less remarkable for
                    his knowledge in history and chronology than for his skill in his profession as
                    a barrister and civilian.” Towards the close of his life, he was engaged in
                    preparing a History of Ireland; but this task was reserved for Dr Leland,
                    another distinguished fellow of Trinity College. The editor, whose name does not
                    appear, has prefixed a preface of four pages, and has particularly extolled the
                    author for his “admirable vindication of the original freedom of our
                    constitution, and his excellent commentary on <hi rend="italic">Mayna
                    Charta”</hi></p>
                <p>A pseudonymous work, of a very different denomination, has been ascribed to Dr
                    Stuart. It bears the title of “Animadversions on Mr Adam’s Latin and English
                    Grammar; being an Exhibition of its Defects, and an Illustration of the Danger
                    of Introducing it into Schools. By John Richard Busby, Master of Arts.” Edinb.
                    1773, 8vo. This grammar, at its first appearance, was doomed to encounter a very
                    fierce and general opposition. The other four masters of the school to which the
                    author belonged, presented to the town-council a remonstrance against it; and
                    the use of it in that seminary was formally prohibited.<note anchored="true"

                    of Alexander Adam, LL. D. Rector of the High School of Edinburgh, p. 42. Edinb.
                    1810, 8vo.</p></note> Stuart’s zeal might be excited by his relationship to
                    Ruddiman, whose elementary works, both excellent in their kind, had for half a
                    century retained their place in the grammar schools. That the writer has
                    detected and specified errors and omissions, it would not be safe to deny; but
                    the spirit as well as the style of his animadversions is such as no unprejudiced
                    reader could approve. They conclude with the subsequent passage: “These
                    strictures will, it is thought, be sufficient to evince the entire frivolity of
                    Mr Adam’s grammar, and the danger that must attend its adoption into our
                    schools. To point out all the errors of his performance, would require several
                    volumes; and I am not ambitious of performing a task that would vie with any of
                    the labours of Hercules. It is the peculiar infelicity of this grammarian, that
                    he exhibits every defect which it is possible for an author to possess; a
                    sterile invention, an unhappy method, a cold and inauspicious manner, an
                    inaccurate and nerveless expression, a perverted judgment, a defective
                    understanding, a corrupted taste.—Education is -not a matter to be trifled with.
                    The mistakes and miscarriage of our most generous youth have too frequently
                    their rise in the negligence with which they have been treated in schools, where
                    they have been sent to be initiated in the first principles of knowledge. It is
                    also no groundless complaint, that the teacher often adds incapacity to neglect.
                    And if this is, in general, a just representation of the matter, how must we
                    pity, in particular, the pupils of Mr Adam! To disadvantages common to other
                    boys, they must join the cruel and insuperable one of studying a work that
                    advances in an unvaried progress from blunder to blunder, and from absurdity to
                    absurdity.” The merits and demerits of this grammar, which in spite of all
                    opposition became very popular, were discussed in various articles of the Weckly
                    Magazine. Here we find two Latin lucubrations on the subject, one of which was
                    known to be the production of Stuart, and the other might perhaps be written by
                    the same satirical pen. In the form of a description of a Roman funeral, he
                    records the interment of Adam’s Latin Grammar; nor does he neglect to introduce
                    the well-known Jamie Duff, an idiot whose supreme delight was to place himself,
                    an unhired attendant, at the head of a funeral procession: “Imus ad hortos
                    scholastico, praceunte Jacobo Duff, solita sua gravitate, densissimo ac
                    laetissimo puerorum agmine cincto.” The narrative closes with this monumental
                    inscription:</p>

                <p>Dr Stuart now undertook the management of “The Edinburgh Magazine and Review,” of
                    which the first number bears the date of November 1773. In the commercial part
                    of this enterprise his partners were Alexander Kincaid, his majesty’s printer,
                    William Creech, bookseller, William Smellie, printer, and William Kerr, surveyor
                    of the postoffice. The work was printed by Smellie, who was likewise to manage
                    the business details of the concern, to furnish the last half-sheet of every
                    number, and to review such books as the editor and he should select. The profits
                    were to lie distributed into six shares; one of which was allotted to Kincaid
                    and Creech conjunctly; one each to Stuart, Smellie, and Kerr; and the remaining
                    two to the editor and the printer, to be divided between them as they should
                    mutually agree. Stuart was himself the principal writer. Various essays and
                    reviews were furnished by Smellie. Lord Hailes, Dr Blacklock, Professor
                    Richardson of Glasgow, and Professor Barron of St Andrews, were among the number
                    of the contributors. The name of Dr Moor appears in the poetical department. An
                    extraordinary lucubration, entitled “A modest Defence of the Accomplishment of
                    Blasphemy,” was written by the Rev. A. Gillies. The Rev. Mr Nimmo of Bothkennar
                    wrote the Essay on the Antiquities of Stirlingshire, which he afterwards
                    enlarged to the size of an octavo volume.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>’ Kerr’s Memoirs of Smellie, vol. i. p. 401.</p></note></p>
                <p>A periodical work, supported by such contributors, might have run a long and
                    prosperous career, if its success had not been marred by the editor’s want of
                    temper and discretion. At that period, the population of Edinburgh probably did
                    not amount to one third of its present number; and the freedom of public
                    discussion was circumscribed in at least an equal proportion. Dr Henry was one
                    of those who had most reason to complain of injurious treatment. A single sermon
                    of his was very unfavourably noticed by Smellie; and on the second volume of his
                    History of Great Britain two articles were written by Stuart, in a style of
                    unmitigated sarcasm and contempt; nor does it appear that there was any original
                    ground of personal offence. In some fragments of his letters which have been
                    published by D’Israeli, he speaks of this historian with a strange mixture of
                    levity and virulence. Lord Monboddo did not experience better treatment. On the
                    second volume of his Origin and Progress of Language they inserted two, and on
                    the third volume three articles, each of them more offensive than another. These
                    articles were written by Stuart, Smellie, and Gillies, but the greater portion
                    of them by the latter. The editor lent his aid in the review of the third<pb
                    break="no" facs="ht:chi.28490924&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=928"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0720-0928-0782"/> volume, and in the art of vituperation he greatly
                    excelled his coadjutors. It is scarcely to be supposed that any of the
                    disparaging expressions were attributable to Smellie. This attack on the learned
                    judge gave great offence to him and his friends, and indeed it had a visible
                    effect in precipitating the failure of the work. Of Lord Karnes’s Sketches of
                    the History of Man the editor had prepared a very severe review; but when it was
                    sent to the printer, he “counteracted the intentions of his colleague, by
                    altering the whole into a totally opposite tendency, converting the far greater
                    part from harsh invective into reasonable and merited panegyric.” On discovering
                    that the venom had thus been extracted, the writer was moved with violent anger;
                    but he speedily moderated his feelings so far as to admit that his friend had
                    acted rightly. Smellie, though he generally exercised a sounder discretion,
                    could himself display a strong vein of satire. This remark was sufficiently
                    verified in his controversy with Dr Nisbet, then minister of Montrose, and
                    afterwards president of Dickinson College at Carlisle in Pennsylvania.<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See Dr Allen’s American
                    Biographical and Historical Dictionary, p. 449.</p></note> The controversy was
                    occasioned by the mode of reporting a certain debate in the General Assembly.
                    Nisbet printed two letters in a newspaper, and Smellie replied in the magazine.
                    This publication was continued till the month of August 1776, when it terminated
                    with tb.e fifth volume. A closing notice informed the “numerous and respectable
                    encouragera of this work,” that its publication was only interrupted for some
                    months, and that it would afterwards appear in an improved form. But the promise
                    was never fulfilled, nor is it very probable that many readers expected its
                    fulfilment.</p>
                <p>Notwithstanding the failure of this project, Dr Stuart had displayed so much
                    talent in his principal articles, that his reputation as a man of letters
                    suffered no diminution. He however felt a very painful mortification at the
                    unsuccessful result of his labours; and his mind was so badly regulated that,
                    instead of reflecting on the natural tendency of his own conduct, he continued
                    to cherish a most bitter and indiscriminate resentment. In a letter, dated on
                    the 17th of June 1774, and probably addressed to his London publisher, he
                    expresses himself in these unseemly terms: “It is an infinite disappointment to
                    me, that the Magazine does not grow in London; I thought the soil had been
                    richer. But it is my constant fate to be disappointed in every thing I attempt;
                    I do not think I ever had a wish that was gratified, and never dreaded an event
                    that did not come. With this felicity of fate, I wonder how the devil I could
                    turn projector. I am now sorry that I left London; and the moment that I have
                    money enough to carry me back to it, 1 shall get off. I mortally detest and
                    abhor this place, and every body in it. Never was there a city where there was
                    so much pretension to knowledge, and that had so little of it. The solemn
                    foppery, and the gross stupidity of the Scottish literati, are perfectly
                    insupportable. I shall drop my idea of a Scots newspaper. Nothing will do in
                    this country that has common sense in it; only cant, hypocrisy, and
                    superstition, will flourish here. A curse on the country, and all the men,
                    women, and children of it.... The publication is too good for the country. There
                    are very few men of taste or erudition on this side the Tweed; yet every idiot
                    one meets with lays claim to both. Yet the success of the Magazine is in reality
                    greater than we could expect, considering that we have every clergyman in the
                    kingdom to oppose it; and that the magistracy of the place are every moment
                    threatening its destruction.” All this exhibits a melancholy picture of a man of
                    superior talents and attainments, deriving no wisdom from experience, but still
                    indulging those very passions to which his want of success was chiefly to be
                    attributed, and which always bear along with them their own punishment. Before
                    he vented his spleen in terms of such unseemly import, he ought to have
                    recollected, “It is a foul <hi rend="italic">corby</hi> that bewrays its own
                    nest.” The fault that he here commits, is not one with which his countrymen are
                    commonly chargeable; and the period which he thus describes as so barren in
                    taste and erudition, was perhaps remarkable for its intellectual eminence beyond
                    any former or succeeding period in the literary annals of Scotland.</p>
                <p>Dr Stuart was still in the early vigour of manhood, and he speedily roused
                    himself to new and greater exertions. After an interval of less than two years,
                    he produced what we are disposed to regard as the best of his works, “A View of
                    Society in Europe, in its Progress from Rudeness to Refinement: or, Inquiries
                    concerning the History of Law, Government, and Manners.” Edinb. 1778, 4to. This
                    work, of which there are several other editions, excited much attention on its
                    first appearance. Hayley, who was then a popular writer, described the author as
                    possessing “all the energy of genius.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    grasps his subject with much vigour, and always expresses himself with boldness
                    and force. In the progress of his discussions, he points out various mistakes of
                    recent writers. One of these was Blackstone, who silently rectified the errors
                    which he detected.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    never languid or feeble, may however be considered as deficient in fluency and
                    variety. His periods are too uniformly short, to be altogether pleasing to the
                    ear. Long sentences he has elsewhere denounced in set terms. “This brevity,” he
                    avers, “is a conspicuous part of oratory, and is consistent with the greatest
                    elevation and dignity. Where Cicero himself is most eloquent, and where the tide
                    of his language is most rapid and powerful, his sentences are concise; and he
                    avoids with care the periodic swell, as cold, artificial, and unnatural. And
                    indeed it is to be laid down as a general rule, that where sentences are
                    uniformly long, as in Milton and in Clarendon, there is no eloquence in the
                    composition, and little connection in the argument.”<note anchored="true"

                <p>The chief value of the work consists in the vivid and striking picture which it
                    exhibits of chivalry and the feudal system. In this respect it possesses some
                    advantages over Dr Robertson’s View of the Progress of Society in Europe, though
                    it is not written with the same degree of classical elegance. “In the courtly
                    and agreeable introduction to the History of Charles the Fifth,” says Dr Stuart,
                    “of which the scheme is so comprehensive, it is remarkable that, amidst a wide
                    variety of other omissions, there is not even the slightest consideration of
                    knight-service, and the knight’s fee. Yet these circumstances were of a most
                    powerful operation, both with respect to government and manners. I make not this
                    remark to detract from the diligence of an author whose laboriousness is
                    acknowledged, and whose total abstinence from all ideas and inventions of his
                    own, permitted him to carry an undivided attention to other men’s thoughts and
                    speculations; but that, resting on these peculiarities, I may draw from them
                    this general and humiliating, yet, I hope, not unuseful conclusion, that the
                    study and knowledge of the dark ages are still in their infancy.” This
                    contemptuous mention of the great historian could scarcely fail to excite
                    resentment, and of this resentment he speedily had occasion to prove the bitter
                    effects.</p>
                <p>The professorship of the law of nature and nations was at that period held by
                    James Balfour; and in 1779, being then advanced in years, it was ascertained
                    that he was willing to resign it for a valuable consideration. Here it is
                    necessary to explain the very remarkable fact, that, under the sanction of the
                    secretary of state, this professorship was<pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:chi.28490924&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=929" xml:id="kp-eb0720-0929-0783"/>
                    regularly bought and sold. The price of his resignation had already been fixed,
                    and the chair, thus to be vacated, had been promised to Dr Stuart, when the
                    negociation was finally interrupted by a strong remonstrance from the principal;
                    who might safely represent to the lord advocate that the habits of the candidate
                    were not sufficiently academical, and that such an appointment would be highly
                    unsatisfactory to himself, as well as to some of his colleagues. “While engaged
                    in some of his studies and projected publications,” we are informed, “he has
                    been known to confine himself for many weeks to solitary literary labour, hardly
                    ever stirring abroad for air and exercise; but he unfortunately indulged in
                    occasional sallies of vastly too great latitude and even licentiousness.”<note

                <p>This professorship was founded by the crown in the year 1707. The salary, payable
                    out of the tithes of the bishopric of Edinburgh, amounted in 1802 to about
                    L.350; but it was then reduced so low as L.80 or L.90, by an augmentation of
                    stipend adjudged to the minister of St Cuthbert’s. As an indemnity for this
                    reduction, the professor obtained in 1806 a pension of E.200, payable during his
                    incumbency. He had “purchased his commission,” and he never read a single
                    lecture. He survived till the year 1831, and no successor has been appointed. A
                    middle way might certainly have been found between the conduct of one
                    administration and that of another. The number of lucrative offices in this
                    university is not superabundant, nor was it necessary to reduce their number by
                    so minute a fragment of public economy. Even on the admission of the chair
                    having been inefficient, this treatment, unless extended to some better-endowed
                    universities, can scarcely be regarded as impartial. The professorship of the
                    civil law at Oxford has long been as inefficient as the professorship of public
                    law at Edinburgh. Why should the one be suppressed, and the other spared?</p>
                <p>His qualifications for the office which thus seemed to be within his reach, were
                    very eminent; and this signal disappointment of his hopes proved the greatest
                    misfortune of his life. His resentment against Dr Robertson appears to have
                    suggested all the works in which he afterwards engaged. This spirit is very
                    easily to be discerned in his next publication, “Observations concerning the
                    Public Law and the Constitutional History of Scotland: with occasional Remarks
                    concerning English Antiquity.” Edinb. 1779, 8vo. His extensive researches for
                    the View of Society must evidently have abridged his labour of preparing these
                    Observations, which contain much disquisition of a similar kind. The work is
                    able and elaborate, nor can it be safely overlooked by any student anxious to
                    investigate the constitutional history of our country. His antipathy to
                    Robertson is unequivocally displayed in many passages; and, at the conclusion,
                    he thus concentrates his sentiments of disparagement: “A propensity to embellish
                    other men’s notions, without considering enough on what authority they are
                    founded, how strong they are in themselves, and what inferences are to be
                    deduced from them, is a constant and a teeming source of mistake to this showy
                    and elegant historian. It is thence that he holds out many a frail opinion to
                    glitter and to perish. To collect these cannot be interesting to me. But, though
                    I could not submit to make a chronicle of his errors, I have been induced to
                    wipe away, and to dispel, in part, the stains and the gloom they would fix upon
                    our story, and to illustrate, by examples, the respect which is due to his
                    authority. And, while I perform this service to truth, to liberty, and to our
                    national antiquities, I disdain to be unjust, and am far from being insensible
                    to the peculiarities of his merit. It must be a pain, I know, to many of his
                    readers, that the most widely amusing of all our writers, is not at the same
                    time the best informed, and the most able. They must regret that a work which
                    forms so general, so easy, and so pleasing a pastime, is not also fraught with
                    instruction, and loaded with wisdom; and that the author, who is deservedly so
                    eminent in all the arts of courtly and popular composition, is not likewise
                    remarkable for those superior qualities, which alone can secure and establish
                    admiration, the power of thought, and the originality of sentiment.” It is
                    scarcely necessary for us to subjoin, that we are very far from being disposed
                    to acquiesce in this general estimate.</p>
                <p>This publication was speedily followed by “The History of the Establishment of
                    the Reformation of Religion in Scotland.” Loud. 1780, 4to. The work is written
                    with his usual ability, but it cannot be affirmed that such an undertaking was
                    peculiarly adapted to his habits of thinking. He however displays a greater
                    degree of impartiality than could well have been anticipated. He is willing to
                    admit that “a tribute of the highest panegyric and praise is justly to be paid
                    to the actors in the Reformation. They gave way to the movements of a liberal
                    and a resolute spirit. They taught the rulers of nations that the obedience of
                    the subject is the child of justice, and that men must be governed by their
                    opinions and their reason. Their magnanimity is illustrated by great and
                    conspicuous exploits; which, at the same time that they awaken admiration, are
                    an example to support and animate virtue in the hour of trial and peril. The
                    existence of civil liberty was deeply connected with the doctrines for which
                    they contended and fought. While they treated with scorn an abject and cruel
                    superstition, and lifted and sublimed the dignity of man, by catling his
                    attention to a simpler and wiser theology, they were strenuous to give a
                    permanent security to the political constitution of their state.”</p>
                <p>Of this work, his next publication may be considered as the sequel: “The History
                    of Scotland, from the Establishment of the Reformation till the Death of Queen
                    Mary.” Lend. 1782, 2 vols. 4to. Here the author has made a great, and indeed a
                    splendid effort, to eclipse the reputation of Robertson, whom he both envied and
                    hated. As the one historian considered Mary guilty of some of the foulest crimes
                    laid to her charge, it was almost an obvious consequence that the other should
                    represent her as innocent. Her innocence, he is willing to believe, has been
                    demonstrated by Goodall and Tytler; but more recent writers, and especially
                    Laing, have sufficiently disposed of their demonstrations; nor is it perhaps to
                    be anticipated that any historian of eminence will hereafter desert the
                    footsteps of Robertson to tread in those of Stuart. His work however displays
                    great vigour of mind, and the style is more easy and flowing than that of his
                    View of Society. Some of his characters are sketched with a powerful pencil.
                    This history attracted no inconsiderable share of public attention on its first
                    appearance, and, like his preceding volume, it reached a second edition, but it
                    made little or no progress in supplanting the rival work; and the story of the
                    ill-fated Mary’s crimes and sufferings still continues to be chiefly read in the
                    elegant and captivating pages of Robertson.</p>
                <p>The preface to the History of Scotland is dated at London on the first of March
                    1782; and soon after this period, he undertook the management of the English
                    Review, the property of the late John Murray, who had been the London publisher
                    of his Magazine. Of “The English Review, or, an Abstract of English and Foreign
                    Literature,” the first number appeared at the commencement of the year 1783. One
                    of his coadjutors was Whitaker, an uncandid and virulent critic, whose chief
                    effort in this journal was a series of articles on Gibbon’s History.<note

                    in a separate form in the year 1791. In this English Review, some Scotish
                    authors do not find much favour. The historical works of Dr Ferguson and Dr
                    Watson receive a liberal portion of praise; but the Lectures of Dr Blair and the
                    Dissertations of Dr Beattie are treated as works of very inferior merit and
                    importance. It is observable that Smellie’s translation of Buffon is not
                    honoured with much commendation. Stuart had dedicated one of his works to the
                    chief justice; but the subsequent passage, which occurs in an article apparently
                    written by him, affords a sufficient indication of his altered sentiments: “Lord
                    Mansfield, during the course of his long life, has been uniformly the zealous
                    champion of prerogative; and has exerted and prostituted his abilities to
                    undermine the trial by jury, and the liberty of the press, those sacred and
                    formidable bulwarks which support the glorious fabric of the English
                    government.”</p>
                <p>How long he continued to conduct the English Review, we are not informed. In 1785
                    he became the editor of “The Political Herald and Review; or a Survey of
                    domestic and foreign Politics, and a critical Account of political and
                    historical Publications.” This work, it is believed, only reached a second
                    volume. One of his coadjutors, in this as well as the English Review, was Dr
                    Thomson, who, like himself, was too great a lover of Burton ale. Their favourite
                    haunt was the Peacock in Gray’s Inn Lane.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>‘ Annual Obituary, vol. ii. p. 101.</p></note> It is too
                    well known that Stuart’s mode of life had been such as to impair his health and
                    strength. With a constitution undermined by disease, and a mind soured by
                    disappointment, he embarked for Leith, and sought a place of rest under the roof
                    of his father, who having become emeritus professor in 1775, was then residing
                    at Musselburgh. The son was labouring under a dropsy, from which the usual
                    operation afforded him a temporary relief; but all medical aid was ineffectual,
                    and he descended to bis grave at the premature age of forty-four. He died on the
                    13th of August 1786, and his father survived till the 18th of June 1793.</p>
                <p>Gilbert Stuart is thus described by a writer who seems to have had some personal
                    knowledge of him: He “was about the middle size, and justly proportioned. His
                    countenance was modest and expressive, sometimes announcing sentiments of
                    glowing friendship, of which he is said to have been truly susceptible; at
                    others, displaying strong indignation against folly and vice, which he had also
                    shewn in his writings. With all his ardour for study, he yielded to the love of
                    intemperance, to which, notwithstanding a strong constitution, be fell an early
                    sacrifice.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>General
