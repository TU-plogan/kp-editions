                <p><label type="entry">SLAVERY</label> is a word, of which, though generally
                    understood, it is not easy to give a proper definition. An excellent moral
                    writer has defined it to be “an obligation to labour for the benefit of the
                    master, without the contract or consent of the servant.” But may not he be
                    properly called a slave, who has given up his freedom to discharge a debt which
                    he could not otherwise pay, or who has thrown it away at a game of hazard? In
                    many nations, debts have been legally discharged in this manner; and in some
                    savage tribes, it is no uncommon thing for a man, after having lost at play all
                    his other property, to stake, on a single throw of dice, himself, his wife, and
                    his children. That persons who have thus lost their liberty are slaves, will
                    hardly be denied; and surely the infatuated gamester is a slave by his own
                    contract. The debtor, too, if he was aware of the law, and contracted debts
                    larger than he could reasonably expect to be able to pay, may justly be
                    considered as having come under an obligation to labour for the benefit of a
                    master with his own consent; for every man is answerable for all the known
                    consequences of his voluntary actions.</p>
                <p>But this definition of slavery seems to be defective as well as inaccurate. A man
                    may be under an obligation to labour through life for the benefit of a master,
                    and yet that master have no right to dispose of him by sale, or in any other way
                    to make him the property of a third person; but the word slave, as used amongst
                    us, always denotes a person who may be bought and sold like a beast in the
                    market.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The Roman
                    orator’s definition of slavery, Parad. V. is as accurate as any that we have
                    seen. “Servitus est obedientia fracti animi et abjecti et arbitrio carentis
                    suo;" whether the unhappy person fell into that state with or without his own
                    contract or consent.</p></note></p>
                <p>As nothing can be more evident than that all men have, by the law of nature, an
                    equal right to life, liberty, and the produce of their own labour, it is not
                    easy to conceive what can have first led one part of them to imagine that they
                    had a right to enslave another. Inequalities of rank are indeed inevitable in
                    civil society; and from them results that servitude which is founded in
                    contract, and is of temporary duration. He who has much property has many things
                    to attend to, and must be disposed to hire persons to assist and serve him;
                    whilst those who have little or no property must be equally willing to be hired
                    for that purpose. And if the master be kind, and the servant faithful, they will
                    both be happier in this connection than they could have been out of it. But from
                    a state of servitude, where the slave is at the absolute disposal of his master
                    in all things, and may be transferred without his own consent from one
                    proprietor to another, like an ox or an ass, happiness must be for ever
                    banished. How then came a traffic so unna tural and unjust as that of slaves, to
                    be originally introduced into the world?</p>
                <p>The common answer to this question is, that it took its rise amongst savages,
                    who, in their frequent wars with eacn other, either massacred their captives in
                    cold blood, or condemned them to perpetual slavery. In support of this opinion
                    etymologists observe, that the Latin word <hi rend="italic">servus,</hi> which
                    signifies not a hired servant, but a <hi rend="italic">slave,</hi> is derived
                    from <hi rend="italic">servare,</hi> to preserve; and that such men were called
                    <hi rend="italic">serin,</hi> because they were captives, whose lives were
                    preserved on the condition of their becoming the property of the victor.</p>
                <p>That slavery had its origin from war, we think extremely probable, nor are we
                    inclined to controvert this etymology of the word <hi rend="italic">servus;</hi>
                    but the traffic in men prevailed almost universally, long before the Latin
                    language or Roman name was heard of; and there is no good evidence that it began
                    amongst savages. The word עכר, in the Old Testament, which in our version is
                    rendered servant, signifies literally a slave, either born in the family or
                    bought with money, in contradistinction to שביו, which denotes a hired servant;
                    and as Noah makes use of the word nay in the curse which he denounces upon Ham
                    and Canaan immediately after the deluge, it would appear that slavery had its
                    origin before that event. If so, it may be plausibly conjectured that it began
                    amongst those violent persons whom our translators have called <hi rend="italic"
                    >giants,</hi><note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Gen. vi,
                    4.</p></note> though the original word נפלם literally signifies <hi
                    rend="italic">assaulters of others.</hi> Those wretches seem to have first
                    seized upon women, whom they forcibly compelled to minister to their pleasures;
                    and from this kind of violence the progress was natural to that by which they
                    enslaved their weaker brethren amongst the men, obliging them to labour for
                    their benefit, without allowing them fee or reward.</p>
                <p>After the deluge the first dealer in slaves seems to have been Nimrod. “He
                    began,” we are told, “to be a mighty one in the earth, and was a mighty hunter
                    before the Lord.” He could not, however, be the first hunter of wild beasts; nor
                    is it probable that his dexterity in the chase, which was then the universal
                    employment, could have been so far superior to that of all his contemporaries,
                    as to entitle him to the appellation of “the mighty hunter before the Lord.”
                    Hence most commentators have concluded, that he was a hunter of men; an opinion
                    which they think receives some countenance from the import of his name, the word
                    Nimrod signifying a rebel. Whatever be in this, there can be little doubt that
                    he became a mighty one by violence; for it appears from Scripture, that he
                    invaded the territories of Ashur the son of Shem, who had settled in Shinar;
                    and, obliging him to remove into Assyria, he seized upon Babylon, and made it
                    the capital of the first kingdom in the world. As he had great projects in view,
                    it seems to be in a high degree probable that he made bond-servants of the
                    captives whom he took in his wars, and employed them in building or repairing
                    the metropolis of his kingdom; and hence may perhaps be dated the origin of
                    postdiluvian slavery.</p>
                <p>That it began thus early can hardly be questioned; for we know that it prevailed
                    universally in the age of Abraham, who was born within seventy years after the
                    death of Nimrod. That patriarch had three hundred and eighteen servants or
                    slaves, born in his own house, and trained to arms, with whom he pursued and
                    conquered the four kings who had taken captive his brother’s son.<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Gen xiv.</p></note> And it
                    appears from the conversation which took place between him and the king of Sodom
                    after the battle, that both believed the conqueror had a right to consider his
                    prisoners as part of his spoil. “Give me,” says the king, “the <hi rend="italic"
                    >persons,</hi> and take <hi rend="italic">the goods</hi> to thyself.” It is
                    indeed evident from numberless passages<pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:chi.28490924&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=444" xml:id="kp-eb0720-0444-0382"/>
                    of scripture, that the domestics whom our translators call servants, were in
                    those days universally considered as the most valuable part of their master’s
                    property, and classed with his flocks and herds.</p>
                <p>That the practice of buying and selling servants thus early begun amongst the
                    patriarchs descended to their posterity, is known to every attentive reader of
                    the Bible. It was expressly authorised by the Jewish law, in which are many
                    directions how such servants were to be treated. They were to be bought only of
                    the heathen; for if an Israelite grew poor and sold himself either to discharge
                    a debt, or to procure the means of subsistence, he was to be treated not as a
                    slave צבר, but as a hired servant שביו, and restored to freedom at the year of
                    Jubilee. Unlimited as the power thus given to the Hebrews over their
                    bond-servants of heathen extraction appears to have been, they were strictly
                    prohibited from acquiring such property by any other means than fair purchase.
                    “He that stealeth a man and selleth him,” said their great lawgiver, “shall
                    surely be put to death.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>Lev. xxi. 16</p></note></p>
                <p>Whilst slavery, in a mild form, was permitted amongst the people of God, a much
                    worse kind of it prevailed amongst the heathen nations of antiquity. With other
                    abominable customs, the traffic in men quickly spread from Chaldea into Egypt,
                    Arabia, and over all the east, and by degrees found its way into every known
                    region under heaven.</p>
                <p>Of this hateful commerce we shall not attempt to trace the progress through every
                    age and country, but shall content ourselves with taking a transient view of it
                    amongst the Greeks and Romans, and a few other nations, in whose customs and
                    manners our readers must be interested.</p>
                <p>One can hardly read a book of the Iliad or Odyssey, without perceiving that, in
                    the age of Homer, all prisoners of war were liable to be treated as slaves. So
                    universally was this cruel treatment of captives admitted to be the right of the
                    conqueror, that the poet introduces Hector, in the very act of taking a tender
                    and perhaps last farewell of his wife, when it was surely his business to afford
                    her every consolation in his power, telling her, as a thing of course which
                    could not be concealed, that, on the conquest of Troy, she would be
                    compelled</p>
                <p>To bear the victor’s bard commands, or bring The weight of water from Hyperia’s
                    spring..</p>
                <p>At that early period, the Phoenicians, and probably the Greeks themselves, had
                    such an established commerce in slaves, that, not satisfied with reducing to
                    bondage their prisoners of war, they scrupled not, for supplying their foreign
                    markets, to kidnap persons who had never kindled their resentment. In the
                    fourteenth book of the Odyssey, Ulysses represents himself as having narrowly
                    escaped a snare of this kind laid for him by a false Phoenician, who had doomed
                    the hero to Lybian slavery; and as the whole narrative, in which this
                    circumstance is told, is an artful fiction, intended to have the appearance of
                    truth to an Ithacan peasant, the practice of kidnapping slaves could not then
                    have appeared incredible to any inhabitant of that island.</p>
                <p>Such were the manners of the Greeks in the heroic age; nor were they much
                    improved in this respect at periods of greater refinement. Philip of Macedonia,
                    having conquered the Thebans, not only sold his captives, but even took money
                    for permitting the dead to be buried;<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Justin, lib. iii. cap. 4.</p></note> and Alexander, who had
                    more generosity than his father, afterwards razed the city of Thebes, and sold
                    the inhabitants, men, women, and children, for slaves.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Justin et Arrian.</p></note> This cruel
                    treatment of a brave people may indeed be supposed to have proceeded, in the
                    first instance, from the avarice of the conqueror; and in the second, from the
                    momentary resentment of a man who was savage and generous by turns, and who had
                    no command of his passions. Weshall not positively assign it to other causes;
                    but from the manner in which the Spartans behaved to their slaves, there is
                    little reason to imagine that, had they received from the Thebans the same
                    provocation with Alexander, they would have treated their captives with greater
                    lenity.</p>
                <p>It has been said, that in Athens and Rome slaves were better treated than in
                    Sparta. But in the former city their treatment cannot have been good, or their
                    lives comfortable, when the Athenians relished that tragedy of Euripides in
                    which Hecuba, the wife of Priam, is introduced as lamenting that she was chained
                    like a dog at Agamemnon’s gate. Of the estimation in which slaves were held in
                    Rome, we may form a tolerable notion from the well-known fact, that one of those
                    unhappy beings was often chained at the gate of a great man’s house, to give
                    admittance to the guests invited to a feast. In the early periods of the
                    commonwealth it was customary, in certain sacred shows exhibited on solemn
                    occasions, to drag through the circus a slave, who had been scourged to death,
                    holding in his hand a fork in the form of a gibbet.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Cicero de Div. lib. i. cap. 26.</p></note>
                    But we need not multiply proofs of the cruelty of the Romans to their slaves. If
                    the inhuman combats of the gladiators admit of any apology on account of the
                    martial spirit with which they were thought to inspire the spectators, the
                    conduct of Vedius Pollio must have proceeded from the most wanton and brutal
                    cruelty. This man, who flourished not in the earliest periods of the republic,
                    when the Romans were little better than a savage banditti, but in the polished
                    age of Augustus, frequently threw such slaves as gave him the slightest offence
                    into his fishponds to fatten his lampreys; and yet he was suffered to die in
                    peace. The emperor, indeed, upon coming to the knowledge of his cruelty, ordered
                    his lampreys to be destroyed, and his ponds to be filled up; but we do not
                    recollect that any other punishment was inflicted on the savage master.</p>
                <p>The origin of slavery in Rome was the same as in every other country. Prisoners
                    of war were of course reduced to that state, as if they had been criminals. The
                    dictator Camillus, one of the most accomplished generals of the republic, sold
                    his Etrurian captives to pay the Roman ladies for the jewels which they had
                    presented to Apollo. Fabius, whose cautious conduct saved his country when
                    Hannibal was victorious in Italy, having subdued Tarentum, reduced thirty
                    thousand of the citizens to slavery, and sold them to the highest bidder.
                    Coriolanus, when driven from Rome, and fighting for the Volsci, scrupled not to
                    make slaves of his own countrymen; and Julius Caesar, among whose faults wanton
                    cruelty has never been reckoned, sold at one time fifty-three thousand captives
                    for slaves. Nor did the slaves in Rome consist only of foreigners taken in war.
                    By one of the laws of the twelve tables, creditors were empowered to seize their
                    insolvent debtors, and keep them in their houses till, by their services or
                    labour, they had discharged the sum they owed. The children of slaves were the
                    property not of the commonwealth, or of their own parents, but of their
                    roasters; and thus was slavery perpetuated in the families of such unhappy men
                    as fell into that state, whether through the chance of war or the cruelty of a
                    sordid creditor. The consequence was, that the number of bondmen belonging to
                    the rich patricians was almost incredible. Cains Caecilius Isidorus, who died
                    about seven years before the Christian era, left to his heirs lour thousand one
                    hundred and sixteen slaves; and Augustus once put twenty thousand of his own
                    slaves on board the corn ships.</p>
                <p>Though many laws were enacted by Augustus and other patriotic emperors to
                    diminish the power of creditors over their insolvent debtors; though the
                    influence of the mild spirit of Christianity tended much to meliorate the
                    condition of slaves even under Pagan masters; and though the emperor Hadrian
                    made it capital to kill a slave without a just reason, yet this infamous
                    commerce prevailed univers-<pb break="no"

                    ally in the empire for many ages after the conversion of Constantine to the
                    religion of Christ. It was not indeed completely abolished even in the reign of
                    Justinian; and in many countries which had once been provinces of the empire, it
                    continued long after the empire itself had fallen to pieces.</p>
                <p>Amongst the ancient Germans, it was not uncommon for an ardent gamester to lose
                    his personal liberty by a throw of the dice. This was indeed a strong proof of
                    savage manners; but the general condition of slaves among those barbarians seems
                    to have been much better than among the polished Greeks and Romans. In Germany
                    the slaves were generally attached to the soil, and only employed in tending
                    cattle, and carrying on the business of agriculture; for the menial offices of
                    every great man’s house were performed by his wife and children. Such slaves
                    were seldom beaten, or chained, or imprisoned. Sometimes indeed they were killed
                    by their masters in a fit of sudden passion; but none were considered as
                    materials of commerce, except those who had originally been freemen, and lost
                    their freedom by play.</p>
                <p>Such is the account which Tacitus<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>De Mor. Germ. 24, 25.</p></note> gives of slavery amongst
                    the ancient Germans. The Anglo-Saxons, however, after they were settled in this
                    island, seem not to have carried on that traffic so honourably. By a statute of
                    Alfred the Great,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>Wilkins’ Collection of Laws from Ethelbert to Henry III.</p></note> the
                    purchase of a man, a horse, or an ox, without a voucher to warrant the sale, was
                    strictly forbidden. That law was, doubtless, enacted to prevent the stealing of
                    men and cattle; but it shows us that so late as the ninth or tenth century a
                    man, when fairly purchased, was, in England, as much the property of the buyer
                    as the horse on which he rode, or the ox which dragged his plough. In the same
                    country, now so nobly tenacious of freedom and the rights of man, a species of
                    slavery similar to that which prevailed amongst the ancient Germans, subsisted
                    even to the end of the sixteenth century. This appears from a commission issued
                    by Queen Elizabeth in 1574, for inquiring into the lands and goods of all her
                    bond-men, and bond-women, in the counties of Cornwall, Devon, Somerset, and
                    Gloucester, in order to compound with them for their manumission, that they
                    might enjoy their lands and goods as freemen. In Scotland there certainly
                    existed an order of slaves, or bond-men, who tilled the ground, were attached to
                    the soil, and with it w ere transferable from one proprietor to another, at a
                    period so late as the thirteenth century: but when or how those villeins, as
                    they were usually called, obtained their freedom, is a question not yet
                    completely solved. Colliers and salters were, in the same country, in a state
                    little removed from slavery, till near the end of the eighteenth century, when
                    they were manumitted by the British legislature, and restored to the rights of
                    freemen and citizens. Before that period the sons of colliers could follow no
                    business but that of their fathers; nor were they at liberty to seek employment
                    in any other mines than those to which they were attached by birth, without the
                    consent of the lord of the manor, who, if he had no use for their services
                    himself, transferred them by a written deed to some neighbouring proprietor.</p>
                <p>That the savage nations of Africa were at any period of history exempted from
                    this opprobrium of our nature, which spread over all the rest of the world, the
                    enlightened reader will not suppose. It is indeed in that vast country that
                    slavery has in every age appeared in its ugliest form. We have already observed,
                    that about the era of the Trojan war, a commerce in slaves was carried on
                    between Phoenicia and Libya; and the Carthaginians, who were a colony of
                    Phoenicians, and revered the customs, manners, and religion of their parent
                    state, undoubtedly continued the Tyrian traffic in human flesh with the inland
                    tribes of Africa.</p>
                <p>With the ancient state of the other African nations we arc but very little
                    acquainted. The Numidiane, Mauritanians, Getulians, and Garamantes, are indeed
                    mentioned by the Roman historians, who give us ample details of the battles
                    which they fought in attempting to preserve their national independence; but we
                    have no particular account of their different manners and customs in that age
                    when Rome was disputing with Carthage the sovereignty of the world. All the
                    African states of which we know any thing, were in alliance with one or the
                    other of those rival republics; and as the people of those states appear to have
                    been less enlightened than either the Romans or the Carthaginians, we cannot
                    suppose that they had purer morals, or a greater regard for the sacred rights of
                    man, than the powerful nations by whom they were either protected or oppressed.
                    They would, indeed, insensibly adopt their customs; and the ready market which
                    Marius found for the prisoners taken in the town of Capsa, although Sallust
                    acknowledges<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>De Bello
                    Jugurth. cap. 91.</p></note> that the sale was contrary to the laws of war,
                    shows that slavery was then no strange thing to the Numidians. It seems indeed
                    to have prevailed through all Africa from the very first peopling of that
                    unexplored country; and we doubt if in any age of the world the unhappy negro
                    was absolutely secure of his personal freedom, or even of not being sold to a
                    foreign trader.</p>
                <p>It has been often said, that the practice of making slaves of the negroes is of a
                    very modern date; that it owes its origin to the incursions of the Portuguese on
                    the western coast of Africa; and that, but for the cunning or cruelty of
                    Europeans, it would not now exist, and would never have existed. It is quite
                    certain, however, that the negroes themselves, like all other savage tribes,
                    have from ancient times enslaved their prisoners; and the establishment of a
                    trade by foreigners in African slaves, may at an early period have tempted them,
                    in some quarters, to make captives expressly for the purpose of selling them.
                    But Christians were not the first tempters. It has been proved, that from the
                    coast of Guinea a great trade in slaves was carried on by the Arabs some
                    hundreds of years before the Portuguese embarked in that traffic. Even the
                    wandering Arabs of the desert, who never had any friendly correspondence with
                    the Christians of Europe, have from time immemorial been served by negro slaves.
                    In all probability, indeed, these tribes have, without interruption, continued
                    the practice of slavery from the days of their great ancestor Ishmael; and it
                    seems evident, that none of the European nations had ever seen a woolly-headed
                    negro till the year 1100, when the crusaders fell in with a small party of them
                    near the town of Hebron in Judaea, and were so struck with the novelty of tlheir
                    appearance, that the army burst into a general fit of laughter.<note

                    83.</p></note> Long before the crusades, however, we know with certainty: that
                    the natives of Guinea had been exposed to sale in foreign countries. In 651 the
                    Mohammedan Arabs of Egypt so harassed the king of Nubia or Ethiopia, who was a
                    Christian, that he agreed to send them annually, by way: of tribute, a vast
                    number of Nubian or Ethiopian slaves into Egypt. Such a tribute as this at that
                    time, we are told, was more agreeable to the khalif than any other, as the Arabs
                    then made no small account of these slaves.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                <p>On the beginning of this commerce, or the dreadful cruelty with which it has been
                    carried on to the present . day, it is impossible to reflect without horror; but
                    there is more consolation, however small, in knowing that its original authors
                    were not Europeans. The purchase of Guinea blacks for slaves by foreign nations,
                    commenced ages before the Portuguese had laid that country open to the
                    intercourse of Europe. Even after they had made many incursions into<pb

                    for slaves by some of the adjoining states, as they were afterwards by the
                    maritime Europeans. ,</p>
                <p>Without prosecuting farther the history of slavery, we pass to the consideration
                    of its present state in the world, and, in particular, the revolutions which
                    have taken place in that worst department of the system which we have been last
                    occupied in examining.</p>
                <p>Before describing the altered position now held by negro slavery, it must be
                    remarked that the slavery of white men is by no means yet extinct. Details on
                    this subject will be found in the articles devoted to those countries in which,
                    under various modifications, bondage still prevails; and here a sentence or two
                    must suffice for summing up the result. The nature of that slavery which still
                    prevails among most Asiatic nations, modified in the Mohammedan states by some
                    precepts of their religion, but nowhere entirely extirpated, is familiarly known
                    to most readers, and information regarding it is sufficiently easy of access.
                    The branch of it in which Europeans are most nearly interested, is that
                    atrocious system of piracy which, carried on for centuries by Algiers and the
                    other Barbary states, filled the cities of Northern Africa with Christian
                    prisoners, but has in the present generation been nearly destroyed by the
                    exertions of our own government, aided by the subsequent expeditions of the
                    French. But the snake is scotched only, not killed; and European captives are
                    still said to pine in Morocco, Tunis, and Tripoli. In a preceding paragraph we
                    have considered the villeinage of the dark and middle ages as being a species of
                    slavery. There is no sound reason for regarding it in any other light; and,
                    however far the serf’s condition may be superior to that of the slave who
                    belonged to a Roman patrician or a West Indian planter, his servitude is still
                    so utterly repugnant both to humanity and religion, as to make us ashamed of the
                    fact that, in a shape not much improved, it exists still in Christian provinces
                    of northern Europe. The article <hi rend="smallcaps">Russia</hi> has described
                    the status of the boors or unfree peasants in that empire; and in more than one
                    kingdom bordering on it, villeinage has never been completely abolished till our
                    own times.</p>
                <p>But slavery in its most horrible shape, long averted by the spirit of
                    Christianity from those whom Christians were compelled to consider as their
                    fellow-men, has, in regard to the unfortunate people of Africa, been maintained
                    with unrelenting severity by men and nations professing to be disciples of the
                    gospel. The present age has seen the truth mightily triumph in reference to this
                    dark blot of the civilized world; but the evil is not yet entirely eradicated,
                    even where its atrocities have been most decisively condemned; and in several
                    extensive regions of the globe, no acknowledgment of error has yet been
                    extorted.</p>
                <p>Slavery is still lawful over a large part of the American continent. It extends
                    throughout the empire of Brazil, and is general in the southern provinces of the
                    United States. On the declaration of independence, however, seven of the
                    thirteen British provinces which then formed the confederation, abolished
                    slavery absolutely; and the example was followed by two or three of the rest, as
                    well as by several of those afterwards added to the Union. On the whole,
                    including the remnants of bondage in some of the Spanish republics, it has been
                    calculated that the continent of America now contains 4,000,000 of black and
                    coloured slaves. Of these the United States possess about 2,000,000, making
                    about a sixth part of their whole population; but, as the slaves are unequally
                    distributed, they amount in several provinces to half the number of the free
                    whites, and in some places make up a much larger proportion. The French and
                    Spanish colonies in the West Indies, in which likewise slavery remains
                    unabolished, have a slave population amounting to at least 400,000 souls.</p>
                <p>For the British colonies, the exertions of benevolent and enlightened men during
                    the last fifty years, have at length effected a mighty change, the history of
                    which can here be but too briefly told.</p>
                <p>1. <hi rend="smallcaps">The Slave Trade.</hi> If the merit of originating the
                    great scheme of abolition is to be shared by every one who, either through word
                    or writing, has expressed convictions of the inhuman injustice involved in the
                    slave-trade, or suggested means for its destruction, our list of
                    emancipationists would both be long, and would commence at an early date. But
                    the honour of having planned that systematic co-operation, which alone could
                    effect the end, does clearly belong to the Society of Friends; and in the series
                    of efforts by which that religious body heralded the exertions of our eminent
                    statesmen, the leading part was acted by Anthony Benezet, a French protestant,
                    who, educated in England, became a Quaker and a citizen of Philadelphia; and to
                    William Dillwyn, an American, and a member of the same sect. The former, besides
                    unwearied personal exertions, published, in 1762, the work which first attracted
                    in this country general notice to the slave-trade; the other, visiting England
                    in 1774, opened communications between the American philanthropists and those of
                    our own countrymen who had already engaged in the same cause Among these latter,
                    the foremost place belongs to the honoured name of Granville Sharp.</p>
                <p>This able and excellent man had been induced to interest himself in a class of
                    questions, which arose about the middle of the eighteenth century. West Indian
                    planters, after having brought negro slaves to England, were accustomed to carry
                    them back to the colonies, or even to sell them to others for that destination;
                    and the opinion of eminent lawyers had sanctioned the practice as legal.
                    Instances of crying hardship aroused the sympathy of individuals: Granville
                    Sharp rescued several victims; and, in the year 1772, he obtained a decision of
                    the English judges in the famous case of the negro Somerset, that, as soon as a
                    slave sets his foot on English ground, he becomes free.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>It must be noticed, however, that, a very few
                    years ago, it was decided by Lord Stowell, that slaves who bad gained freedom in
                    this way did, on their return to the colonies, become slaves
                    anew.</p></note></p>
                <p>At length, in May 1787, there was instituted in London a Society for the
                    Suppression of the Slave Tradc. Besides Dillwyn and Sharp, its most
                    distinguished member was Thomas Clarkson, a young graduate of Cambridge, who,
                    led to study the subject as the theme of an academical essay, had solemnly
                    devoted his life to the cause of negro emancipation. But the Society immediately
                    numbered among its supporters several men of rank and influence; and, among
                    other converts, its founders had gained, even before their organization, William
                    Wilberforce, then member of Parliament for Hull, and afterwards for
                    Yorkshire.</p>
                <p>Although our own days have witnessed a sharp contest in the last stages of those
                    measures, it is not very easy for us to conceive the magnitude of the obstacles
                    which then opposed themselves, even to the most cautious approach towards the
                    subject. Fear of exposure felt by individuals who knew themselves guilty of
                    malpractices, was aided by fear of pecuniary ruin, felt by many who had no other
                    reason for dreading inquiry; and, among the public men of the nation, the
                    corrupt influence of private interests biassed many, while others were
                    influenced by more honest fears for the effects which change might have on the
                    prosperity of the colonies. The Society determined, from the first, to keep the
                    question of slave emancipation studiously in the background. They proclaimed
                    their aim to be, simply, the abolition of the trade in slaves; maintaining, and
                    endeavouring to convince the public, that the slave population of the colonies
                    could be<pb break="no" facs="ht:chi.28490924&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=447"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0720-0447-0385"/> effectually kept up without new importations; and
                    that, indeed, such importation was in itself not only injurious to the real
                    interests of the planters, but eventually pregnant with ruin to the West India
                    Islands as British dependencies. These topics, with others appealing more
                    directly to moral principle and humane feeling, had already been treated in
                    various publications, and they were now anxiously disseminated through the whole
                    of Britain in pamphlets, newspaper articles and personal communications; while
                    the indefatigable Clarkson travelled everywhere collecting information as to the
                    state of the slave trade.</p>
                <p>An excitement was produced which enforced the attention of the government; and
                    its results were still farther aided by the circumstance that Mr. Pitt, who was
                    the intimate friend and political chief of Wilberforce, had already examined the
                    question, and privately declared himself favourable to the views of the society.
                    In February 1788, an order of the crown directed that a committee of the Privy
                    Council should inquire into the state of the slave trade, and its consequences
                    both to Africa, to the colonies, and to the general trade of the kingdom. Before
                    the end of that season, there lay on the table of the House of Commons one
                    hundred and three numerously signed petitions, praying for the abolition of the
                    traffic in human life.</p>
                <p>Mr. Wilberforce’s ill health detaining him in the country, Mr. Pitt, on the 9th
                    of May 1788, declining to state his own opinion, moved a resolution that the
                    House would, early in the next Session, take into consideration the
                    circumstances of the slave trade complained of in the petitions. This, excepting
                    a motion made by David Hartley some years before, against slavery in the
                    abstract, was the first time the subject had ever been mentioned in the British
                    Legislature. The prayer of the petitions was warmly supported, and delay opposed
                    by Mr. Fox, Mr. Burke, and others. In the meantime, a bill was introduced by Sir
                    William Dolben, and carried through both Houses after virulent opposition, for
                    regulating the burden of the slaveships, and otherwise diminishing the horrors
                    of the Middle Passage, as it was called, between Africa and the West Indian
                    islands. .</p>
                <p>On the 12th of May 1789,Wilberforce made his first speech in the House upon the
                    subject, introducing twelve resolutions deduced from the evidence which had been
                    taken before the Privy Council. The propositions, all condemnatory of the trade,
                    were supported by Burke, by Fox, by Granville, and by Pitt, who now declared his
                    opinion unalterable; but the opponents gained their end of delay, by obtaining
                    an order for hearing evidence. It was not till the spring of 1791, that
                    Wilberforce was able to move for leave to bring in a bill, for preventing the
                    further importation of slaves into the colonies in the West Indies. After a
                    stormy debate, the motion was lost by 88 to 163. The enthusiasm of the people,
                    and the favourable dispositions of the legislature, had alike cooled;
                    insurrections of the negroes had broken out in Dominica, the leaders of the
                    French revolution had corresponded with some members of the society, Clarkson
                    had not only visited France, but was the friend of Brissot; and every means had
                    been used for prepossessing the public against the abolitionists.</p>
                <p>But the defeated party bated “no jot of hope ;” and the public mind became
                    calmer. In April 1792 the House ofCom-mons received from England 330 petitions,
                    and from Scotland 187; and Wilberforce moved an opinion of the House that the
                    slave trade ought to be abolished. He was met by one of the most dangerous
                    enemies of the measure, Mr. Dundas, afterwards Lord Melville, under whose
                    dexterous management an amendment for <hi rend="italic">gradual</hi> abolition
                    was carried by a large majority; and a few days afterwards the House passed a
                    resolution for abolishing the trade in 1796; but in the House of Lords even this
                    tardy justice was frustrated by a resolution to hear further evidence.</p>
                <p>In 1793 the House of Commons refused to repeat their resolution of the previous
                    year: in 1795, and each of the four following years, the motion for abolition
                    was made and lost; and the abolitionists then resolved to wait for better times.
                    And thus a measure, calculated to wipe off in part a foul disgrace from the
                    nation,—a measure supported by men of all parties and of all sects,—a measure
                    openly and encouragingly advocated, not only by all the men of highest talent in
                    the country, but by the minister of the day himself, was defeated, after a
                    struggle which, at the time, was aptly called the battle of the pigmies against
                    the giants. Of the sincerity of the other great promoters of the scheme, no
                    doubt has been expressed; but on Mr. Pitt’s sincerity there have been thrown
                    very grave suspicions, which it is not possible entirely to dispel. For,
                    although the charge of absolute duplicity is sufficiently rebutted, both by his
                    unbending character and by his admirable speeches on the question, it is
                    unaccountable how he, the most peremptory of all rulers, should not, if he
                    pleased, have forced to silence those subalterns, who trembled to oppose him in
                    any plan but this. The proud son of Chatham loved truth and justice not a
                    little, but he loved power and place greatly more; and he was resolved that
                    negro emancipation should not lose him either a shred of political influence, or
                    a beam of royal favour.</p>
                <p>But the triumph was already at hand. The excitement of the war, indeed, still for
                    a time diverted public attention; and, though the principles which had been so
                    convincingly promulgated were silently making converts everywhere, nothing of
                    importance took place for some years, except the appearance of a new and most
                    able advocate in the person of Mr. Stephen, Wilberforce’s friend and
                    brother-in-law. In 1804, however, the annual motion of Wilberforce was renewed.
                    The first reading of his Bill tor immediate abolition was carried by 124 to 49,
                    the majority containing all the Irish members; and the votes for the third
                    reading were 99 to 33. On the second reading of the Bill in the House of Lords,
                    it was adjourned, without a division, till the following session. In that
                    session, (the spring of 1805,) a new Abolition Bill was thrown out by the House
                    of Commons on the second reading; but, in the same year, a measure of Pitt’s for
                    abolishing, by an Order in Council, the slave trade in the newly conquered
                    colonies, which had no charters, was carried into effect without the smallest
                    resistance.</p>
                <p>The next two years were to witness the final victory. Pitt died; and the ministry
                    of Fox and Lord Grenville was formed. In June 1806, resolutions proposed by the
                    new ministers, pledging the House of Commons to abolition “with all practicable
                    expedition,” were carried by more than 100 to 41; and an address to the king,
                    for obtaining the co-operation of foreign powers, was adopted without a
                    division. A bill, founded on the resolutions, was successful in both Houses, and
                    received the royal assent on the 25th of March 1807.</p>
                <p>The great measure of the British legislature was imitat ed, in the first
                    instance, by the United States, who were next followed successively by the new
                    South American Republics of Venezuela, Chili, and Buenos Ayres, by Sweden and
                    Denmark, Holland and France. But Spain was brought no farther than to promise in
                    1814 that she would abolish the slave trade in eight years; while Portugal in
                    1815 abolished to the north of the equator, promising to abolish finally eight
                    years afterwards, and receiving a sum of money as the price of her
                    acquiescence.</p>
                <p>In the meantime, the abolitionists in England soon had the disappointment to
                    discover, that the law bad no sanction sufficient for enforcing its provisions;
                    whilst the fact, that the horrible trade must now, if conducted at all, be
                    carried on as an act of smuggling, augmented all its miseries, and introduced
                    atrocities not less shocking than those<pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:chi.28490924&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=448" xml:id="kp-eb0720-0448-0386"/>
                    which had prevailed before the passing of Sir William Dolben’s carrying act. An
                    energetic remedy was necessary, and such an one was suggested by Mr. Brougham,
                    who, in 1811, introduced a bill, (carried unanimously through both Houses,)
                    declaring the trade in slaves to be felony, and punishable with fourteen years’
                    transportation, or five years’ imprisonment. After a time, even this decided
                    measure seemed not decided enough; an act of 1824 made slave-trading a capital
                    offence, by the name of piracy; and the recent acts of 1837, for mitigating the
                    criminal law, have left it punishable with transportation for life. “There is
                    every reason to think,” says Lord Brougham, “that no British subjects are now,
                    or have for many years been, directly engaged in this execrable traffic, with
                    the exception of those belonging to the Mauritius. In that island it is certain,
                    that, with the connivance, if not under the direct encouragement, of the higher
                    authorities of the colony, slave-trading to an enormous extent was for some
                    years openly carried on.”</p>
                <p>The treaties with foreign powers, crippled by national jealousies, were found
                    equally inefficient with our own law. The king of Spain, one of the two great
                    offenders, after having had the meanness to accept, by a treaty of 1817, a large
                    sum from our treasury, as the price of his promise to abolish his slave-trade on
                    the north of the equator immediately, and to put a final stop to the traffic in
                    1820, had next the effrontery to refuse all performance of the engagement for
                    which he had thus received the consideration; and a vote of abolition, passed by
                    the Cortes in 1822, remained of course inoperative. The great difficulty,—the
                    right of one nation’s cruisers to search vessels under the flag of another
                    power, when suspected of slaving,—was however mutually conceded in 1817, between
                    Great Britain on the one hand, and Portugal and Spain (within the limits
                    embraced in the subsisting treaties) on the other; and a similar treaty was
                    effected with Holland in the succeeding year.</p>
                <p>But, besides other faults, there were, in our treaties of this sort, two main
                    defects, which, of themselves, rendered the whole system of checks quite
                    inoperative. First, the cruisers, except under our treaty with the Netherlands,
                    had no power to capture vessels not having slaves on board, although it might be
                    fully proved that they were slaving-ships, or even that they had just delivered
                    a cargo. In consequence of this, not only were notorious slavers frequently
                    dismissed after examination, but, in several instances, which have been fully
                    authenticated, the wretches in command were known to throw their slaves
                    overboard on a chase, in the hope of thus removing the only ground on which
                    their detention could be legally justified. Secondly, condemned vessels, instead
                    of being broken up, were sold, and, being fitted for no trade but their own,
                    fell again almost invariably into the hands of the slave-dealers.</p>
                <p>In neither of these particulars was any improvement effected till after the late
                    revolution in France, whose subjects, since the restoration, had begun to rank
                    amongst the most active of the contraband slave merchants. In 1833 a treaty was
                    concluded between our government and that of France, by which the breaking up of
                    the vessels was agreed to; and it was also declared, that all vessels
                    ascertained by certain equipments to be intended for the slave trade, might be
                    lawfully detained and confiscated, even though slaves had not been found on
                    board, nor even embarked. France and England have since taken the lead in urging
                    all other Christian powers to accede to these conventions; but as yet their
                    success has been far from general. The five powers with which this country
                    previously had conventions on the subject have come very reluctantly into the
                    additional measures; and one of them, namely, Portugal, has shown a most
                    disgraceful want of faith in fulfilling her engagements. The protection of the
                    Portuguese flag was and is sold by the authorities of that government on the
                    African coast; and miscreants, thus furnished with papers apparently regular,
                    and not having yet received their slave-cargoes, insolently defy our cruisers,
                    or even prosecute our captains for damages, on account of illegal detention. Our
                    government, however, have recently shown a determined front; and we may perhaps
                    hope that the feeble and faithless power which insults us and outrages humanity,
                    will at length suffer condign punishment. As to Spain, between 1823 and 1832,
                    her slavers imported into Cuba 100,000 slaves at least. The equipment clause was
                    always refused by the cabinet nt Madrid; and it was not till 1835, after the
                    death of Ferdinand, that our minister at that court was able to extort the
                    accession of the Spanish government to that essential article. The effects of
                    this new treaty have been exceedingly encouraging: within six months after its
                    execution, as many Spanish slavers lay waiting the sentence of our Confiscation
                    Court at Sierra Leone, as had been taken during any three years under the
                    previous conventions. The Brazilian government, although professedly anxious to
                    discourage the importation of new slaves, on account of the danger the whites
                    already incur from an increasing black population, have pleaded, with some
                    plausibility, their want of power to check the trade effectually, so long as the
                    Portuguese flag shall be allowed to protect the slavers. Sweden and the
                    Netherlands were not prevailed on to accede to the French conventions till the
                    year 1838.</p>
                <p>Of those powers with which we had previously no agreement, Denmark and the
                    Sardinian States both acceded in 1834. Prussia has shewn a reluctance, for which
                    it is not easy to account. The display of the same spirit by Russia was not so
                    much matter of surprise. Austria, though the emperor has imitated our laws,
                    declaring any slave free who touches Austrian ground, and also making the
                    slave-trade heavily punishable, has acted with its accustomed jealousy, in
                    refusing co-operation with other states. Tuscany and the Two Sicilies joined the
                    league in 1838. With the republics of the New World our negociations have been
                    exceedingly unsuccessful. The United States have peremptorily refused to combine
                    with any foreign power for the suppression of the slave-trade; and, amongst the
                    Spanish commonwealths, Venezuela is the only one which has come cheerfully
                    forward, although the objections started by some of the rest do not seem to be
                    insuperable.</p>
                <p>Altogether, those efforts which philanthropists have so long continued for
                    removing this blot from the name of Christianity, have not yet by any means
                    produced such results as can allow us to believe that the struggle is nearly at
                    an end. Partly through defects in the machinery of the laws and treaties,—partly
                    through dishonesty or lukewarmness in the contracting powers or their
                    officials.— partly through causes which can never be removed while the fold
                    shape of slavery itself darkens any comer of the earth,—the traffic in human
                    blood still goes on with an activity that is incredible to all but those who
                    have studies the subject. The proofs of this lamentable fact are no where so
                    convincingly stated as in a work on <hi rend="italic">The African Slave
                    Trade,</hi> published in 1839, by Mr. Fowell Buxton, from which we can afford to
                    abstract but a very few statements, observing, at the same time, that there is
                    not one of them but is below the truth. According to the highest of those
                    estimates which have been founded on assured data, the Christian slave trade
                    still robs Africa every year of 250,000 human beings. According to the very
                    lowest computation, it absorbs 150,000. To this number must be added that of the
                    Mohammedan trade, which exports at least 50,000 annually; so that we are much
                    below the mark when we assert, that, in the course of every year, 200,000
                    negroes, at least, arc carried off into hopeless slavery. But this is not all.
                    It may be safely asserted, that, for every slave who is exported, there is<pb
                    break="no" facs="ht:chi.28490924&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=449"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0720-0449-0387"/> sacrificed one human life, and perhaps much more.
                    Mr. Buxton’s calculation is the following: First, the slaughter of the wars
                    which supply the slaves, the ill-usage of the captives on their march, and their
                    sufferings while detained on the coast, cause together a mortality of 100 per
                    cent. Secondly, the disease and cruelty of the voyage, now worse than ever it
                    was, carries off, at the very least, 25 per cent. Thirdly, the loss after
                    landing in the colonies, and during what planters used to call the “seasoning,”
                    amounts to at least 20 per cent. Upon these assumptions, “for every 1000 negroes
                    alive at the end of a year after their deportation, and available to the
                    planter, we have a sacrifice of 1450. Of 150,000 negroes, landed annually in
                    Cuba, Brazil, &amp;c. 30,000 die in the seasoning, leaving 120,000 available to
                    the planter. If 150,000 were landed, there must have been embarked 37,500 more,
                    who perish in the passage; and if 187,500 were embarked, 187,500 more must have
                    been sacrificed in the seizure, march, and detention. It is impossible for any
                    one to reach this result, without suspecting, as well as hoping, that it must be
                    an exaggeration; and yet there are those who think that this is too low an
                    estimate.” Putting these facts in another shape, we find, that the slave trade
                    between Africa and America subjects annually to the miseries of permanent
                    bondage, no fewer than 120,000 negroes; whilst, during the same period, it
                    destroys the lives of 255,000 more.</p>
                <p>II. <hi rend="smallcaps">Slavery.</hi> But, leaving here the consideration of the
                    slave trade, we pass to the history of those measures which, following up its
                    abolition in our own colonies, have destroyed it effectually as to them, by
                    cradicating slavery itself.</p>
                <p>Immediately on the passing of the act 1807, there was formed by the abolitionists
                    a new association, which they called “The African Institution.” Besides objects
                    connected with the recent measure, and embracing the tasks of watching its
                    execution, of prevailing on foreign powers to imitate our policy, and of aiding
                    in the civilization of Africa, this body gradually began to bestow great
                    attention on the state of slavery in our own colonies, having an especial view
                    to its ultimate abolition, which was afterwards taken up by the Anti-Slavery
                    Society; for their hopes soon waxed very low as to that progressive amelioration
                    in the treatment and even the enlightenment of the slaves, to which some among
                    them had looked forward as one consequence to flow from the stoppage of the
                    foreign supply. The abolitionists were speedily united in the great aim of
                    emancipation; Clarkson renewed his agitation in the provinces; local societies
                    were formed every where, and tracts and larger works were circulated; while in
                    Parliament, Wilberforce, the apostle of the cause, was now seconded by Messrs.
                    Brougham, Mackintosh, Buxton, Lushington, William Smith, and others, in pressing
                    vainly on the House of Commons the adoption of measures tending to prepare the
                    slave for eventually obtaining freedom.</p>
                <p>At length the trenches were opened in Parliament; and in this new attack, as in
                    the former, the van was led by the Quakers, whose petition for the extinction of
                    slavery was presented by Mr. Wilberforce to the House of Commons in March 1823.
                    Soon afterwards, a motion by Mr. Buxton, for a resolution declaring slavery
                    repugnant both to Christianity and to the British constitution, was defeated by
                    Mr. Canning on counter resolutions, recommending certain necessary reforms.
                    These and other improvements, it was asserted, might be safely left to the
                    colonial legislatures; and the ministry at the same time intimated, that, if the
                    West Indian Assemblies refused to do their duty, it would become necessary for
                    the British Parliament determinedly to interfere.</p>
                <p>That no effectual reforms could proceed from the planters themselves, the
                    abolitionists had been long convinced. The government and their supporters, said
                    they, had forgotten two of the prominent features of society in the West Indies;
                    the management of estates by agents for absentee proprietors, and that spirit of
                    reckless adventure which was at once a cause and an effect of West Indian
                    embarrassments. It might have been added, and some had the firmness to add it,
                    that the planters, supposing them ever so well disposed, dared not to introduce
                    any such mitigation of rigour as would afford sufficient protection against
                    individual oppression. The slavery of multitudes was never in any country
                    maintained but by the reign of terror; and, when an enslaved population has
                    reached a certain limit in strength and intelligence, society must inevitably
                    undergo one or another of three changes;—inhumanly increased severity, or
                    universal emancipation, or universal revolution.</p>
                <p>In 1824, Mr. Canning, who, though he had been a zealous abolitionist, acted in
                    regard to the new question a part totally unworthy of him, defeated, by a
                    ministerial majority, Mr. Brougham’s very guarded motion of censure on the
                    authorities of Demerara for the infamous and cruel injustice which destroyed the
                    missionary Smith. But the publicity which the debates in Parliament, in this
                    case, gave to the atrocities which, although certainly not common in the
                    colonies or any where upon earth, the colonial laws allowed, when they did
                    occur, to pass with perfect impunity, did more than any thing ever yet had done
                    to excite the indignation of the British people.</p>
                <p>The question, in fact, was surprisingly narrowed. When, in 1788, the
                    abolitionists attacked the outworks which flanked the edifice of slavery, the
                    fortress itself was pronounced by its defenders to be absolutely impregnable.
                    The good of the empire, the good of the slave, the principles of all
                    governments, the very Bible itself, were appealed to as authorising the property
                    in human flesh. But now, for many years, no man had breathed any argument of the
                    sort. It was plain that emancipation must come, and that speedily; the parties
                    were only at issue as to the time and the manner. Even the more intelligent
                    among the planters, who saw the negroes swarming around them in hundreds of
                    thousands, and already beginning to think dangerously, (that is, justly,) seem
                    scarcely to have extended their hopes farther than to obtaining liberal
                    compensation for all their losses, present or prospective, certain or
                    conjectural. But the attitude which they chose, almost universally, to assume,
                    was that of defiance towards the mother-country; and, accordingly, the right of
                    the Colonial Assemblies to legislate for their own islands, and the danger which
                    would be incurred by irritating them, were urged alternately with those other
                    topics, of the risk of revolution through hasty changes, the unfitness of the
                    uninstructed negroes to act as freemen, and such other grounds, which now became
                    the arguments of those who wished the British Parliament to decline
                    interfering.</p>
                <p>Down to the year 1830, how much had been done, either in the chartered colonies,
                    or in those governed immediately by the crown, for carrying into effect the
                    reforms embodied in the resolutions of 1823, and in the subsequent
                    recommendations of the government?—1. For providing the means of education and
                    religious instruction for the slaves, no one effectual measure had been taken in
                    the colonies of either class. The consolidated slave law for the crown colonies,
                    contained in an Order in Council, dated 8th February 1830, was held out as an
                    improvement on the Trinidad Order in Council of 1824, and was proposed to the
                    chartered colonies as a model for their adoption. It contained no provision for
                    this purpose. 2. The Sunday markets were abolished in the crown colonies by the
                    order of 1830, and they were also abolished by Grenada and Tobago, two of the
                    chartered islands. The other colonies of this class had expressly legalised
                    them. 3. Even this partial abolition was rendered useless, by the total omission
                    of any allowance of equivalent time to the negroes in lieu of Sunday, for
                    marketing or for cultivating their provision grounds. 4. The new order wisely
                    made the evidence of slaves admissable in the crown colonies to the same extent
                    as that of free persons, subject on-<pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:chi.28490924&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=450" xml:id="kp-eb0720-0450-0388"/>
                    ly to remark on the slave’s status as affecting credibility. Grenada and Tobago
                    had adopted a similar law; while, in the other colonies of their class, the
                    admission of slave evidence was hampered and restricted so much as to make the
                    grant perfectly useless. 5. In the crown colonies the marriages of slaves were
                    legalized under certain restrictions; in all others such marriages were
                    everywhere exposed to harassing impediments. 6. In the crown colonies the
                    separation of families had been peremptorily provided against, the order,
                    however, being somewhat vague as to the description of persons whom it should
                    embrace. In the chartered colonies the provisions of this kind were universally
                    insufficient. 7. The right of acquiring property was conferred on the slaves in
                    the crown colonies; on those in the others it was also conferred, hut under
                    limitations which made the privilege quite illusory. 8. The order in council
                    gave the slaves the right of redeeming themselves and their families, at a fair
                    appraisement, even against the will of the owners; but it imposed, in reference
                    to this grant, several very harsh conditions. The chartered colonies refused
                    unanimously to introduce any such compulsory manumission. 9. The new order most
                    unfortunately omitted that provision in the Trinidad code, which forbade the
                    master to punish the slave corporally more than once in twenty-four hours; but
                    it limited him to twenty-five lashes at a time. This latter enactment was
                    imitated in two or three of the chartered colonies; and in all the rest the old
                    law remained, which allowed the master to inflict thirty-nine lashes at once on
                    any slave, of any age, or of either sex, for any offence, or for none; and the
                    same law allowed him to imprison in the stocks or workhouse as long as he
                    pleased. 10. In the crown colonies there was required a return, as well as a
                    record, of arbitrary punishments inflicted on the slaves on the plantations; but
                    no such check was imposed as to any other classes, such as mechanics or
                    domestics. In the other colonies there was no return, and no adequate record.
                    11. By the order in council, the flogging of females was abolished; in every one
                    of the chartered colonies it was still permitted and practised. 12. The order
                    forbade, though not in sufficiently explicit terms, the use of the driving-whip
                    in the field. The legislature of the Bahamas did the same thing. The other
                    legislatures retained the old instruments of punishment. 13. Official protectors
                    of the slaves, none of whom could be slave-holders, were appointed in the crown
                    colonies. The chartered colonies all refused to appoint such functionaries;
                    though in some of them the local magistrates (composed of slave-holders) acted
                    in a similar capacity. 14. Another proposed reform was, the providing that no
                    slaveholder should be appointed to any function connected with the
                    administration of the slave-laws. The order in council, though it obeyed this
                    salutary ride in respect to the protector, disregarded it as to his assistants,
                    on whom devolved a great part of his ordinary duty. In the chartered colonies
                    the rule was little attended to, except in the leading appointments made by the
                    crown. 15. It was also proposed that, in cases involving the status of
                    individuals, the legal presumption should be for freedom and against slavery.
                    This rule, adopted in the crown colonies, was also imitated by Tobago and
                    Grenada, but by no other chartered island. 16. For purifying the administration
                    of justice, which called most grievously for amendment, nothing was done in any
                    colony of either class.</p>
                <p>ln July 1830, Mr. Brougham brought forward his motion, that the House should
                    resolve, at the earliest possible period in next session, to take into
                    consideration the state of the slaves, in order to the mitigation and final
                    abolition of slavery, and more especially in order to the amendment of the
                    administration of justice, It was lost by a large majority, in a very thin
                    House. The great changes in the ministry soon came on; and, during the eventful
                    years 1831 and 1832, the subjects of Great Britain and Ireland hod their own
                    battles to fight at home, instead of extending aid to foreign dependents. The
                    only steps taken in that period were, the issuing of new orders in council by
                    the Whig ministry in 1831, which proved as ineffectual as those of their
                    predecessors; and the appointment of committees, both in the Lords and Commons,
                    before both of which a large mass of evidence was taken.</p>
                <p>At length, after the friends of emancipation had repeatedly pressed the ministry
                    to redeem their pledge of bringing forward a government measure, the ministerial
                    proposition was introduced in May 1833, by Mr. Stanley, then secretary for the
                    colonies. The parts of the resolutions on which the emancipationists were most
                    divided were two; first, the plan of an intermediate state, called an
                    apprenticeship, into which the slave was to be received on his manumission, and
                    which, according to the first draft of the measure, was to last for no less than
                    twelve years; secondly, the proposal of compensation to the slave-owners, which,
                    brought forward at first hesitatingly, at last developed itself into a grant of
                    twenty millions sterling. On the principle of compensation most men were agreed;
                    there was guilt, it is true, in the very act upon which the claim was grounded,
                    but the nation was a thousand times guiltier than the planters, and it would
                    have ill become us to make the minor offenders the only sufferers. The amount
                    and application of the grant were matters less certain. On the question of the
                    apprenticeship there was much more room for doubt; and the most consistent
                    opponents of slavery were decidedly against it. Lord Howick, the under secretary
                    for the colonies, threw up his place rather than advocate it; and it was
                    strenuously resisted in the House by him, Mr. Buxton, and Mr. O’Connell, whose
                    opposition, however, was defeated by an overwhelming majority. Among those who
                    advocated the great principle of the resolutions, the most prominent were,
                    besides the members already named, Mr. Buckingham, Dr. Lushington, Admiral
                    Fleming, and Mr. T.B. Macaulay. The opposition, which scarcely amounted to more
                    than exhortations to caution, with insinuations of insurmountable difficulties,
                    was headed temperately and skilfully by Sir Robert Peel, whose most decided
                    supporters were, Sir Richard Vyvyan, Mr. Godson, Mr. W. E. Gladstone, and Mr.
                    Hume. No division was attempted on any question involving the principle.</p>
                <p>The resolutions, on being communicated to the House of Lords, where they were
                    carried without a vote, were supported by the Earl of Ripon, Lord Suffield, Earl
                    Grey, and Lord Chancellor Brougham, and cautiously opposed by the Duke of
                    Wellington, the Earl of Harewood, Lord Ellenborough, and Lord Wynford.</p>
                <p>A bill was next brought forward, founded on the resolutions. In the discussion on
                    this bill in the Commons, the most important change effected was, the limitation
                    of the apprenticeship to the term of six years for the plantation-negroes, and
                    four for all others. In the House of Lords, the amendments unsuccessfully
                    proposed by the Duke of Wellington were moderate in themselves, and candidly
                    advocated. On the 28th of August 1833, William the Fourth, giving his royal
                    assent to the act, atoned in some measure for the opposition which, in his early
                    days, he, in common with his whole family, except the Duke of Gloucester, had
                    offered to the abolition of the slave trade. William Wilberforce died while the
                    resolutions preparatory to the bill were at their last stage in the House of
                    Commons.</p>
                <p>The leading provisions of the great measure for the abolition of slavery were the
                    following.</p>
                <p>The act was to take effect on the first day of August 1834, on which day slavery
                    was to cease throughout the British colonies. And, in the first place, all
                    registered slaves, who should at that date be within any of our colonies, and
                    should appear to be six years old and upwards, were to become “apprenticed
                    labourers” to those who bad been their owners in slavery; while slaves who had
                    been<pb break="no" facs="ht:chi.28490924&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=451"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0720-0451-0389"/> already brought, or apprenticed labourers who
                    hereafter might be brought, into the United Kingdom, with the consent of their
                    possessors, were to be absolutely free from the date of the act. The apprentices
                    were divided into three classes. The first two classes, called “praedial
                    apprenticed labourers,” comprised all slaves “usually employed in agriculture,
                    or in the manufacture of colonial produce,” upon the lands in the colonies; the
                    first class being slaves of this sort, who were usually employed on lands
                    belonging to their owners, and who were declared to be “attached to the soil the
                    second class, declared to be “not attached to the soil,” being such slaves as
                    were similarly employed on lands not belonging to their owners. The third class,
                    called “non-praedial apprenticed labourers,” embraced all slaves not included in
                    either of the two other classes. The apprenticeship of the first and second
                    classes was not to continue beyond the first day of August 1840; and such
                    apprentices were not to be liable, in virtue of their apprenticeship, to labour
                    for their employers for more than forty-five hours in any one week. The
                    apprenticeship of the third class was not to continue beyond the first day of
                    August 1838. Voluntary discharges by the employers, before the expiration of
                    these periods, were allowed, under provisions to secure old and infirm
                    apprentices against destitution; and the apprentice was to be entitled to claim
                    his discharge, even against his employer’s consent, on payment of the appraised
                    value of his services. No apprentices were to be removed from the colony to
                    which they belonged; and those of the first class were not to be removable even
                    from their own plantation, except that they might be removed to other
                    plantations of the same owner in the same colony, on a certificate of justices
                    of the peace that the removal would not injure their health or welfare, nor
                    separate members of the same family. Under similar restrictions and conditions,
                    the services of the apprentices during their term were to be transferable
                    property. It was conditioned that the employers were to furnish the apprentices
                    with food, clothing, lodging, and other necessaries, according to the existing
                    laws of the several colonies, and to allow them sufficient provision ground, and
                    time for cultivating it, in' cases where that mode of maintenance was adopted.
                    Children born upon or after the first of August 1834, as also all those under
                    six years of age at that date, although they became at once free, might, if
                    proved destitute to the satisfaction of a magistrate, be bound out by the
                    magistrate as apprentice to the employer of the mother, by indenture, to
                    continue in force till the child had completed its twenty-first year. For giving
                    effect to the act. the crown was declared entitled to name, or to authorise
                    governors of colonies to name, justices of the peace by special commission, and
                    to give salaries not exceeding L.300 a-year, to such justices, not exceeding one
                    hundred in all.</p>
                <p>The act limited itself to general principles, such as those now specified,
                    declaring that, for carrying the principles into effect, enactments by the
                    several local authorities were the most proper means; and it therefore provided
                    for having such regulations made by the local legislatures for the colonies
                    which had charters, and by the king in council for the crown colonies. It was
                    provided, however, that no such local acts were to authorise the employers, or
                    any one but the special justices, to punish the apprentices by whipping,
                    beating, imprisonment, or addition to the hours of labour; and that they were
                    not to authorise corpora) punishment of females on any account, or by sentence
                    of any court. The special justices were made exclusive judges, in the first
                    instance, in all questions between the employer and the apprentices; and no
                    sentence was to impose as punishment extra-work for more than fifteen hours in
                    any week, nor prolongation of apprenticeship, except in the case of runaways,
                    whose prolonged service should not be compellable after the termination of seven
                    years from the end of the apprenticeship. No apprentice was, whether under the
                    act, or by way of punishment, or otherwise, to be compelled to labour on
                    Sundays, except for certain necessary purposes; and none was to be prevented
                    from attending anywhere on Sundays for worship at pleasure.</p>
                <p>The remaining sections of the act provided for the raising and application of the
                    twenty millions of compensation-money. The sum might be raised by loans, under
                    the usual restrictions on the government; and commissioners, not fewer than
                    five, were to be appointed by the crown for distributing it, while assistant
                    commissioners were to act for the same purpose in the colonies. No money was to
                    be payable to any slaveholder in any colony, until it should have been declared
                    by an order in council, that satisfactory provision had been made by law in such
                    colony, for giving effect to the act by special or supplementary regulations.
                    The whole money was to be divided into nineteen shares, one for each of the
                    colonies, each share being proportional to the number of registered slaves in
                    the colony, taken in connection with the market-price of slaves in each colony,
                    on an average of eight years ending with 1830.</p>
                <p>In virtue of this act, upon the first of August 1834, nearly 800,000 negroes
                    became nominally free; but both the friends and the opponents of emancipation
                    watched with much anxiety what would be their conduct during that probationary
                    state which it had been deemed proper for them to pass through,—a state which,
                    by the very removal of some evils, opened the way for certain others, and which,
                    while it gave increased protection against some kinds of oppression, left the
                    negroes more helpless against severities and neglect of other kinds. Two
                    subsequent acts of Parliament provided as far as possible against abuse; and,
                    although many conflicting accounts have reached this country, there does seem to
                    be no sufficient reason for believing that the treatment of the apprentices was
                    really in any material respect worse than it had been during their slavery;
                    while there appears to be as little reason for doubting, that the slaves in
                    general conducted themselves with thankfulness and decency on their change of
                    condition.</p>
                <p>But in different islands the policy of the local legislature was very various.
                    Many of the colonists were as well satisfied as the most zealous members of the
                    Anti-Slavery Society, that the apprenticeship was wrong and dangerous. Antigua
                    had the honour of leading the way in making this opinion operative. The
                    legislature of that island declined to take advantage of the apprenticeship at
                    all; its slaves were emancipated at once, and “on Christmas-day 1834, for the
                    first time these thirty years, martial law was not proclaimed in Antigua.”
                    Bermuda followed the example, which was next imitated by the small isles, and
                    afterwards by the great island of Barbadoes. Still some colonies held out, with
                    Jamaica at their head; and, particularly from this island, there reached us not
                    only threatening resolutions of the Assembly, but reports of extreme severities
                    towards the slaves, and of decided hostility to the stipendiary magistrates;
                    while one or two of the colonies would not even condescend, for several years,
                    to take such steps as the act declared to be necessary for entitling their
                    landholders to payment of the compensation-money.</p>
                <p>In the spring of 1838, the question of immediate abolition of the apprenticeship
                    was stirred, on those and other grounds, in both Houses of Parliament. Lord
                    Brougham’s motion to this effect, supported by Lord Lyndhurst and others, was
                    met by the previous question. Sir George Strickland’s, in the House of Commons,
                    was also negatived; and, although a similar resolution was afterwards carried in
                    the Commons, the ministry intimated that they would throw every obstacle in the
                    way of any, measure founded on it, and the attempt was therefore given up.</p>
                <p>But the colonists were warned in time, by the spirit which reigned here, and by
                    that which appears to have been rising among the negroes. They proceeded
                    forthwith to aboli-<pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:chi.28490924&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=452" xml:id="kp-eb0720-0452-0390"/>
                    tion; and, on the first of August 1838, there was not a slave left in any
                    British colony, except the Mauritius alone, in which instructions from the home
                    government have since carried the enfranchisement into effect. The act of the
                    Assembly of Jamaica for putting an end to the apprenticeship was accompanied by
                    a protest, which, in its tone of mingled sullenness and pertness, is assuredly
                    the strangest document that ever emanated from any legislative body.</p>
                <p>Of the results of this mighty change, we are not yet in a condition to speak.
                    From Jamaica the accounts have been of various complexions; from the other
                    islands almost universally favourable. The negroes have scarcely anywhere shown
                    a disinclination to work, except during the few weeks immediately succeeding
                    their complete manumission; and we look forward with a confident hope to
                    improvement both of society and statistics, believing firmly that the planters
                    have now fairer prospects before them than they have enjoyed at any time during
                    the last half century. If the event shall be otherwise, justice has at least
                    been done; and some atonement has been made for the most heinous crime which our
                    nation ever committed. Nay more, a revolution has been averted, which, before
                    many generations, would assuredly have repeated in our Caribbean Islands all the
                    horrors of Saint Domingo. <hi rend="smallcaps">(b. l.)</hi><hi rend="italic">Of
