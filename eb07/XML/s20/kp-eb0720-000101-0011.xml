                <p><label type="entry">SCULPTURE</label> is the art of imitating visible form by
                    means of solid substances, such as marble, wood, or metals. The art is one of
                    very great antiquity, and is generally thought to have originated from idolatry,
                    as it was found necessary to place before the people the images of their gods,
                    to enliven the fervour of their devotion. The pyramids and obelisks of Egypt,
                    which were probably temples, or rather altars, dedicated to the sun, were
                    covered with hieroglyphical emblems of men, beasts, birds, fishes, and reptiles,
                    at a period prior to that in which there is any unexceptionable evidence that
                    mere statue-worship prevailed even in that nursery of idolatry.</p>
                <p>But though it appears thus evident that picture-writing was the first employment
                    of the sculptor, we are far from imagining that idolatrous worship did not
                    contribute to carry his art to that perfection which it attained in some of the
                    nations of antiquity. Even in the dark ages of Europe, when the other fine arts
                    were almost extinguished, the ceremonies of the Church of Rome, and the
                    veneration which she taught for her saints and martyrs, preserved among the
                    Italians some vestiges of the sister arts of sculpture and painting; and
                    therefore, as human nature is everywhere the same, it is reasonable to believe
                    that a similar veneration for heroes and demigods would, among the ancient
                    nations, have a similar effect. But if this be so, the presumption is, that the
                    Chaldaeans were the first who invented the art of hewing blocks of wood and
                    stone into the figures of men and other animals; for the Chaldaeans were
                    unquestionably the first idolaters, and their early progress in sculpture is
                    confirmed by the united testimonies of Berosus, Alexander Polyhistor,
                    Apollodorus, and Pliny, not to mention the eastern tradition that the father of
                    Abraham was a sculptor.</p>
                <p>Against this conclusion, however, Mr Bromley, in his History of the Fine Arts,
                    has urged some plausible arguments. In stating these, he professes not to be
                    original, or to derive his information from the fountain-head of antiquity. He
                    adopts, as he tells us, the theory of a French writer, who maintains, that in
                    the year of the world 1949, about three hundred years after the deluge, the
                    Scythians under Brouma, a descendant of Magog the son of Japhet, extended their
                    conquests over the greater part of Asia. According to this system, Brouma was
                    not only the civilizer of India, and the author of the Brahminical doctrines,
                    but also diffused the principles of the Scythian mythology over Egypt,
                    Phoenicia, Greece, and the continent of Asia.</p>
                <p>Of these principles Mr Bromley has given us no distinct enumeration; the account
                    which he gives of them is not to be found in one place, but must be collected
                    from a variety of distant passages. In attempting therefore to present the
                    substance of his scattered hints in one view, we shall not be confident that we
                    have omitted none of them. The ox, says he, was the Scythian emblem of the
                    generator of animal life, and hence it became the principal divinity of the
                    Arabians. The serpent was the symbol of the source of intelligent nature. These
                    were the common points of union in all the first religions of the earth. From
                    Egypt the Israelites carried with them a religious veneration for the ox and the
                    serpent. Their veneration for the ox appeared soon after they marched into the
                    wilderness, when, in the absence of Moses, they called upon Aaron to make them
                    gods which should go before them. The idea of having an idol to go before them,
                    says our author, was completely Scythian; for so the Scythians acted in all
                    their progress throughout Asia, with this difference, that their idol was a
                    living animal. The Israelites having gained their favourite god, which was an
                    ox, not a calf, as it is rendered in the book of Exodus, next proceeded to hold
                    a festival, which was to be accompanied with dancing; a species of gaiety common
                    in the festivals which were held in adoration of the emblematic <hi
                    rend="italic">urotal</hi> or ox, in that very part of Arabia, near Mount Sinai,
                    where this event took place. It is mentioned too as a curious and important
                    fact, that the ox which was revered in Arabia was called <hi rend="italic"
                    >Adonai.</hi> Accordingly Aaron, announcing the feast to the ox or golden calf,
                    speaks thus, <hi rend="italic">To-morrow is a feast to Adonai,</hi> which is in
                    our translation rendered <hi rend="italic">to the Lord.</hi> In the time of
                    Jeroboam we read of the golden calves set up as objects of worship at Bethel
                    and<pb break="no" facs="ht:chi.28490924&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=12"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0720-0012-0002"/> Dan. Nor was the reverence paid to the ox
                    confined to Scythia, to Egypt, and to Asia. It extended much farther. The
                    ancient Cimbri, as the Scythians did, carried an ox of bronze before them on all
                    their expeditions. Mr Bromley also informs us, that as great respect was paid to
                    the living ox among the Greeks as was offered to its symbol among other
                    nations.</p>
                <p>The emblem of the serpent, continues Mr Bromley, was marked yet more decidedly by
                    the express direction of the Almighty. That animal had ever been considered as
                    emblematical of the supreme generating power of intelligent life. And was that
                    idea, says he, discouraged, so far as it went to be a sign or symbol of life,
                    when God said to Moses, “Make thee a brazen serpent, and set it on a pole, and
                    it shall come to pass that every one who is bitten, when he. looketh on it,
                    shall live ?” In Egypt the serpent surrounded Isis and Osiris, the diadems of
                    their princes, and the bonnets of their priests. The serpent made a
                    distinguished figure in Grecian sculpture. The fable of Echidne, the mother of
                    the Scythians, gave her figure terminating as a serpent to all the "founders of
                    states in Greece; from which their earliest sculptors represented in that form
                    the Titan princes, Cecrops, Draco, and even Ericthonius. Beside the spear of the
                    image of Minerva, which Phidias made for the citadel of Athens, he placed a
                    serpent, which was supposed to guard that goddess.</p>
                <p>In Egypt, as well as in Scythia and India, the divinity was represented on the
                    leaves of the tamara or lotus. Pan was worshipped as a god in that country, as
                    well as over the east. Their sphinxes, and all their combined figures of animal
                    creation, took their origin from the mother of the Scythians, who brought forth
                    an offspring that was half a woman and half a serpent. Their pyramids and
                    obelisks arose from the idea of flame, the first emblem of the supreme
                    principle, introduced by the Scythians, and which even the influence of
                    Zoroaster and the Magi could not remove.</p>
                <p>We are told that the Bacchus of the Greeks is derived from the Brouma of the
                    Indians; that both are represented as seated on a swan swimming over the waves,
                    to indicate that each was the god of humid nature; not the god of wine, but the
                    god of waters. The mitre of Bacchus was shaped like half an egg; an emblem taken
                    from this circumstance, that at the creation the egg from which all things
                    sprung was divided in the middle. Pan also was revered among the Scythians; and
                    from that people were derived all the emblems by which the Greeks represented
                    this divinity.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>It would
                    be tedious to follow our author through the whole of this subject; and were we

                    should still view his system with some degree of suspicion. It is drawn, as he
                    informs us, from the work of M. D'Ancarville, entitled <hi rend="italic"
                    >Recherches sur l’Origine, l’Esprit, et les Progrès, des Arts de la

                <p>To form conclusions concerning the origin of nations, the rise and progress of
                    the arts and sciences, without the aid of historical evidence, by analogies
                    which are sometimes accidental, and often fanciful, is a mode of reasoning which
                    cannot readily be admitted. There may indeed, we acknowledge, be resemblances in
                    the religion, language, manners, and customs, of different nations, so striking
                    and so numerous, that to doubt of their being descended from the same stock
                    would savour of scepticism. But historical theories must not be adopted rashly.
                    We must be certain that the evidence is credible and satisfactory before we
                    proceed to draw any conclusions from it. We must first know whether the Scythian
                    history itself be authentic, before we make any comparison with the history of
                    other nations. But what is called the Scythian history, every man of learning
                    knows to be a collection of fables. Herodotus and Justin are the two ancient
                    writers from whom we have the fullest account of that warlike nation; but these
                    two his torians contradict each other, and both write what cannot be believed of
                    the same people at the same period of their progress. By Strabo<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>’ Lib. vii.</p></note> ’ and
                    Herodotus<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Lib. iv. can.
                    62.</p></note> ’ they are represented as the most savage of mortals, delighting
                    in war and bloodshed, cutting the throats of all strangers who came among them,
                    eating their flesh, and making cups and pots of their skulls. It is not
                    conceivable that such savages could be sculptors; or that, even supposing their
                    manners to have been such as Justin represents them, a people so simple and
                    ignorant could have imposed their mythology upon the Chaidaeans, Phoenicians,
                    and Egyptians, whom we know by the most incontrovertible evidence to have been
                    great and polished nations so early as in the days of Abraham.</p>
                <p>Taking for granted, therefore, that the Scythians did not impose their mythology
                    on the eastern nations, and that the art of sculpture, as well as idolatrous
                    worship, prevailed first among the Chaldaeans, we shall endeavour to trace the
                    progress of this art through some other nations of antiquity, till we bring it
                    to Greece, where it was carried to the highest perfection to which it has yet
                    attained. We shall then follow out the art in its decline and subsequent
                    revivals in modern times.</p>
                <p>The first intimation that we have of the art of sculpture is in the book of
                    Genesis, where we are informed, that when Jacob, by the divine command, had
                    returned to Canaan, his wife Rachel carried along with her the teraphim or idols
                    of her father. These we are assured were small, since Rachel found it so easy to
                    conceal them from her father, notwithstanding his anxious search. We are
                    ignorant, however, how these images were made, or of what materials they were
                    composed. The first person mentioned as an artist of eminence is Bezaleel, who
                    formed the cherubim which covered the mercy-seat.</p>
                <p>1. EGYPTIAN, PHOENICIAN, AND ETRURIAN SCULPTURE.</p>
                <p>The Egyptians practised the art of sculpture very extensively; and the mιmber and
                    variety of their works remaining, from the most rude to the most perfect in
                    execution, give us reason to believe we have specimens of their earliest as well
                    as latest productions. Two circumstances appear to have obstructed the progress
                    and advancement of the art in Egypt. First, the persons of the Egyptians were
                    not possessed of the graces of form, elegance, or symmetry; and consequently
                    they had no perfect standard on which to model their taste. They resembled the
                    Chinese in the cast of their face, and in the clumsy rounding of their contours.
                    Secondly, they were confined by their laws to the principles and practices of
                    their ancestors, and were not permitted to introduce any innovations. Their
                    statues were always formed in the same stiff attitude, with the arms hanging
                    perpendicularly down the sides. So far were they from attempting any
                    improvements, that in the time of Hadrian the art continued in the same rude
                    state as at first; and when their slavish adulation for that emperor induced
                    them to place amongst the objects of their worship the statue of his favourite
                    Antinous, the same inanimate stiffness in the attitude of the body and position
                    of the arms was observed.</p>
                <p>Notwithstanding the attachment of the Egyptians to ancient usages, Winckelman
                    thinks he has discovered two different styles of sculpture, which prevailed at
                    different periods. The first of these ends with the conquest of Egypt by
                    Cambyses; the second begins at that time, and extends beyond the reign of
                    Alexander the Great. In the first style, the lines which form the contour are
                    straight, and project-<pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:chi.28490924&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=13" xml:id="kp-eb0720-0013-0003"/>
                    ing a little; the position is stiff and unnatural. In sitting figures the legs
                    are parallel, the feet squeezed together, and the arms fixed to the sides; but
                    in the figures of women the left arm is folded across the breast; the bones and
                    muscles are faintly discernible; the eyes are flat and looking obliquely, and
                    the eyebrows sunk,—features which destroy entirely the beauty of the head; the
                    cheek-bones are high, the chin small and piked; the ears are generally placed
                    higher than in nature, and the feet are too large and flat. In short, if we are
                    to look for any model in the statues of Egypt, it is not for the model of
                    beauty, but of deformity. The statues of men are naked, only they have a short
                    apron, and a few folds of drapery surrounding their waist. The vestments of
                    women are only distinguishable by the border, which rises a little above the
                    surface of the statue. In this age it is evident the Egyptians knew little of
                    drapery.</p>
                <p>Of the second style of sculpture practised amongst the Egyptians, Winckelman
                    thinks he has found specimens in the two figures of basaltes in the Capitol, and
                    in another figure at the Villa Albani, the head of which has been renewed. The
                    first two of these, he remarks, bear visible traces of the former style, which
                    appear especially in the form of the mouth and the shortness of the chin. The
                    hands possess more elegance; and the feet are placed at a greater distance from
                    each other than was customary in more ancient times. In the first and third
                    figures the arms hang down close to the sides; in the second they hang more
                    freely. Winckelman suspects that these three statues were made after the
                    conquest of Egypt by the Greeks. They are clothed with a tunic, a robe, and a
                    mantle. The tunic, which is puckered into many folds, descends from the neck to
                    the ground. The robe in the first and third statues seems close to the body, and
                    is only perceptible by some little folds. It is tied under the breast, and
                    covered by the mantle, the two buttons of which are placed under the
                    epaulette.</p>
                <p>The Egyptian statues were not only formed by the chisel; they were also polished
                    with great care. Even those on the summit of an obelisk, which could only be
                    viewed at a distance, were finished with as much labour and care as if they had
                    admitted a close inspection. As they are generally executed in granite or
                    basalt, stones of a very hard texture, it is impossible not to admire the
                    indefatigable patience of the artists. The eye was often of different materials
                    from the rest of the statue; sometimes it was composed of a precious stone or
                    metal. We are assured that the valuable diamond of an empress of Russia, the
                    largest and most beautiful hitherto known, formed one of the eyes of the famous
                    statue of Scheringham in the temple of Brahma.</p>
                <p>Herodotus mentions two Egyptian statues, one placed before the temple of Vulcan
                    at Memphis, the other in the city of Sais by king Amasis, each of which was
                    seventy-five feet long. The colossal sphinx near the great pyramid rises
                    twenty-five feet. The sitting statues of Memnon, the mother and son of Osmandue,
                    at Thebes, are each fifty-eight feet high. To these we might add a number of
                    similar works known by remaining fragments, or described by authors. Most of the
                    great works of the Egyptians were executed in the reign of Sesostris, who lived
                    in the time of Rehoboam king of Israel, a thousand years before the Christian
                    era, which shows that the arts of Egypt and of Greece were in a progressive
                    state of improvement at the same time.</p>
                <p>The enormous works of Egypt have struck foreign visiters with wonder and awe,
                    from Herodotus down to the members of the French Institute. Herodotus says “one
                    of their buildings is equal to many of the most considerable Greek buildings
                    taken together and M. Ripaud observes, “these works are so prodigious, they make
                    every thing we do look little.” The Egyptians had notions of durability in their
                    works which no other nation has succeeded in imitating: they seemed to work as
                    if they laughed at time, war, barbarism. Quantity was every thing with them, or
                    almost so; quality but little. They washed to please themselves and astonish
                    posterity, and they succeeded.</p>
                <p>The ancient authors who give the most satisfactory accounts of Egyptian
                    antiquities are, Herodotus, Diodorus Siculus, Josephus, Strabo, Clemens of
                    Alexandria, Jamblicus, and Orus Apollo. Among the modern writers, we may mention
                    Pocock, Savary, Norden, and Denon, as worthy of perusal on this subject.</p>
                <p>The Phoenicians possessed both a character and a situation highly favourable to
                    the cultivation of statuary. They had beautiful models in their own persons, and
                    their industrious character qualified them to attain perfection in every art for
                    which they had a taste. Their situation raised a spirit of commerce, and
                    commerce induced them to cultivate the arts. Their temples shone with statues
                    and columns of gold, and a profusion of emeralds was everywhere scattered about.
                    All the great works of the Phoenicians have been unfortunately destroyed; but
                    many of the Carthaginian medals are still preserved, ten of which are deposited
                    in the cabinet of Florence. But though the Carthaginians were a colony of
                    Phoenicians, we cannot from their works judge of the merit of their
                    ancestors.</p>
                <p>The Persians made no distinguished figure in the arts of design. They were indeed
                    sensible to the charms of beauty, but they did not study to imitate them. Their
                    dress, which consisted of long flowing robes concealing the whole person,
                    prevented them from attending to thu beauties of form. Their religion, too,
                    which taught them to worship the divinity in the emblem of fire, and that it was
                    impious to represent him under a human form, seemed almost to prohibit the
                    exercise of this art, by taking away those motives which alone could give it
                    dignity and value; and as it was not customary among them to raise statues to
                    great men, it was impossible that statuary could flourish in Persia.</p>
                <p>The Etrurians, or ancient Tuscans, in the opinion of Winckelman, carried this art
                    to some degree of perfection at an earlier period than the Greeks. It is said to
                    have been introduced before the siege of Troy by Daedalus, who, in order to
                    escape the resentment of Minos king of Crete, took refuge in Sicily, whence he
                    passed into Italy, where be left many monuments of his art. Pausanias and
                    Diodorus Siculus inform us, that some works ascribed to him were to be seen when
                    they wrote; and that these possessed that character of majesty which afterwards
                    distinguished the labours of Etruria.</p>
                <p>A character strongly marked forms tl∣e chief distinction in those productions of
                    Etruria which have descended to our times. Their style was indeed hard and
                    overcharged; for it is not to be supposed that a people of such rude manners as
                    the Etrurians could communicate to their works that vividness and beauty which
                    the elegance of Grecian manners inspired. On the other hand, there are many of
                    the Tuscan statues which bear so close a resemblance to those of Greece, that
                    antiquaries have thought it probable that they were conveyed from that country,
                    or Magna Graecia, into Etruria, about the time of the Roman conquest, when Italy
                    was adorned with the spoils of Greece.</p>
                <p>Among the monuments of Etrurian art two different styles have been observed. In
                    the first the lines are straight, the attitude stiff, and no idea of beauty
                    appears in the formation of the head. The contour is not well rounded, and the
                    figure is too slender. The head is oval, the chin piked, the eyes flat, and
                    looking asquint. These are the defects of an art in the state of infancy, which
                    an accomplished master could never fall into, and are equally conspicuous in
                    Gothic statues as in the productions of the ancient natives of Florence. They
                    resemble so much the style of the Egyptians, that one is almost induced to
                    suppose that there had once been a communication between these two<pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:chi.28490924&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=14" xml:id="kp-eb0720-0014-0004"/>
                    nations; but others think that this style was introduced by Daedalus.</p>
                <p>Winckelman supposes that the second epoch of this art commenced in Etruria about
                    the time at which it had reached its greatest perfection in Greece, in the age
                    of Phidias. But this conjecture is not supported by any proofs. The joints are
                    strongly marked, the muscles raised, and the bones distinguishable; but the
                    whole mien is harsh. In designing the bone of the leg, and the separation of the
                    muscles of the calf, there is an elevation and strength above life. The statues
                    of the gods are designed with more delicacy. In forming them, the artists were
                    anxious to show that they could exercise their power without that violent
                    distension of the muscles which is necessary in the exertions of beings merely
                    human; but in general their attitudes are unnatural, and the actions strained.
                    If a statue, for instance, hold any thing with its fore-fingers, the rest are
                    stretched out in a stiff position.</p>
                <p>II.—GRECIAN SCULPTURE.</p>
                <p>According to ancient history, the Greeks did not emerge from the savage state
                    till a long time after the Egyptians, Chaldaeans, and Indians, had arrived at a
                    considerable degree of civilization. The original rude inhabitants of Greece
                    were civilized by colonies which arrived among them, at different times, from
                    Egypt and Phoenicia. These brought along with them the religion, the letters,
                    and the arts of their parent countries; and if sculpture had its origin from the
                    worship of idols, there is reason to believe that it was one of the arts which
                    were thus imported; for that the gods of Greece were of Egyptian and Phoenician
                    extraction is a fact incontrovertible. The original statues of the gods,
                    however, were very rude. The earliest objects of idolatrous worship have
                    everywhere been the heavenly bodies; and the symbols consecrated to them were
                    generally pillars of a conical or pyramidal figure. It was not till hero-worship
                    was ingrafted on the planetary that the sculptor thought of giving to the sacred
                    statue any part of the human form; and it appears to have been about the era of
                    their revolution in idolatry that the art of sculpture was introduced among the
                    Greeks. The first representations of their gods were round stones placed upon
                    cubes or pillars; and these stones they afterwards formed roughly, so as to give
                    them something of the appearance of a head. Agreeable to this description was a
                    Jupiter which Pausanias saw in Tegeum, in Arcadia. These representations were
                    called Hermes; not that they represented Mercury, but from the word which
                    signified a rough stone. It is the name which Homer gives to the stones which
                    were used to fix vessels to the shore. Pausanias saw at Pheres thirty deities
                    made of unformed blocks or cubical stones. The Lacedaemonians represented Castor
                    and Pollux by two parallel posts; and a transverse beam was added, to express
                    their mutual affection.</p>
                <p>If the Greeks derived from foreign nations the rudiments of the arts, it must
                    redound much to their honour, that in a few centuries they carried them to such
                    wonderful perfection as entirely to eclipse the fame of their masters. It is by
                    tracing the progress of sculpture among them that we are to study the history of
                    this art; and we shall see its origin and successive improvements correspond
                    with nature, which always operates slowly and gradually.</p>
                <p>The great superiority of the Greeks in the art of sculpture may be ascribed to a
                    variety of causes. The influence of climate over the human body is so striking,
                    that it must have fixed the attention of every thinking man who has reflected on
                    the subject. The violent heats of the torrid zone, and the excessive cold of the
                    polar regions, are unfavourable to beauty. It is only in the mild climates of
                    the temperate regions that it appears in its most attractive charms. Perhaps no
                    country in the world enjoys a more serene air, less tainted with mist and
                    vapours, or possesses in a higher degree that mild and genial warmth which can
                    unfold and expand the human body into all the symmetry of muscular strength, and
                    all the delicacies of female beauty, in greater perfection, than the happy
                    climate of Greece; and never was there any people that had a greater taste for
                    beauty, or were more anxious to improve it. Of the four wishes of Simonides, the
                    second was to have a handsome figure. The love of beauty was so great among the
                    Lace-dacraonian women, that they kept in their chambers the statues of Nereus,
                    of Narcissus, of Hyacinthus, and of Castor and Pollux, hoping that by often
                    contemplating them they might have beautiful children.</p>
                <p>There was a variety of circumstances in the noble and virtuous freedom of the
                    Grecian manners, that rendered these models of beauty peculiarly subservient to
                    the cultivation of the fine arts. There were no tyrannical laws, as among the
                    Egyptians, to check their progress. They had the best opportunities to study
                    them in the public places, where the youth, who needed no other veil than that
                    of chastity and purity of manners, performed their various exercises quite
                    naked. They had the strongest motives to cultivate sculpture, for a statue was
                    the highest honour which public merit could attain. It was an honour ambitiously
                    sought, and granted only to those who had distinguished themselves in the eyes
                    of their fellow-citizens. As the Greeks preferred natural qualities to acquired
                    accomplishments, they decreed the first rewards to those who excelled in agility
                    and strength of body. Statues were often raised to wrestlers. Even the most
                    eminent men of Greece, in their youth, sought renown in gymnastic exercises.
                    Chrysippus and Cleanthes distinguished themselves in the public games before
                    they were known as philosophers. Plato appeared as a wrestler both at the
                    Isthmian and Pythian games; and Pythagoras carried off the prize at Elis. The
                    passion by which they were inspired was the ambition of having their statues
                    erected in the most sacred place of Greece, to be seen and admired by the whole
                    people. The number of statues erected on different occasions was immense; of
                    course the number of artists must have been great, their emulation ardent, and
                    their progress rapid.</p>
                <p>As most of the statues were decreed for those who vanquished in the public games,
                    the artists had the opportunity of seeing excellent models; for those who
                    surpassed in running, boxing, and wrestling, must in general have been well
                    formed, yet would exhibit different kinds of beauty.</p>
                <p>The high estimation in which sculptors were held was very favourable to their
                    art. Socrates declared artists to be the only wise men. An artist could be a
                    legislator, a commander of armies, and might hope to have his statue placed
                    beside those of Miltiades and Themistoclee, or those of the gods themselves.
                    Besides, the honour and success of an artist did not depend on the caprice of
                    pride or of ignorance. The productions of art were estimated and rewarded by the
                    greatest sages in the general assembly of Greece; and the sculptor who had
                    executed his work with ability and taste was confident of obtaining
                    immortality.</p>
                <p>It was the opinion of Winckelman, that liberty was highly favourable to this art;
                    but, though liberty is absolutely necessary to the advancement of science, it
                    may be doubted whether the fine arts owe their improvement to this cause.
                    Sculpture flourished most in Greece when Pericles exercised the power of a king,
                    and in the reign of Alexander when Greece was conquered. It attained no
                    perfection in Rome until Augustus had enslaved the Romans. It revived in Italy
                    under the patronage of the family of Medici, and in France under the despotic
                    rule of Louis XIV. It is the love of beauty, luxury, wealth, or the patronage of
                    a powerful individual, that promotes the progress of this art.<pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:chi.28490924&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=15" xml:id="kp-eb0720-0015-0005"/> It
                    will now be proper to give a particular account of the ideas which the Greeks
                    entertained concerning the standard of beauty in the different parts of the
                    human body. And with respect to the head, the profile which they chiefly admired
                    is peculiar to dignified heauty. It consists in a line almost straight, or
                    marked by such slight and gentle inflections as are scarcely distinguishable
                    from a straight line. In the figures of women and young persons, the forehead
                    and nose form a line approaching to a perpendicular.</p>
                <p>Ancient writers, as well as artists, assure us that the Greeks reckoned a small
                    forehead a mark of beauty, and a high forehead a deformity. From the same idea,
                    the Circassians wore their hair hanging down over their foreheads almost to
                    their eyebrows. To give an oval form to the countenance, it is necessary that
                    the hair should cover the forehead, and thus make a curve about the temples,
                    otherwise the face, which terminates in an oval form in the inferior part, will
                    be angular in the higher part, and the proportion will be destroyed. This
                    rounding of the forehead may be seen in all handsome persons, in all the heads
                    of ideal beauty in ancient statues, and especially in those of youth. It has
                    been overlooked, however, by modern statuaries. Bernini, who modelled a statue
                    of Louis XIV. in his youth, turned back the hair from the forehead.</p>
                <p>It is generally agreed that large eyes are beautiful; but their size is of less
                    importance in sculpture than their form, and the manner in which they are
                    enchased. In ideal beauty, the eyes are always sunk deeper than they are in
                    nature, and consequently the eyebrows have a greater projection. But in large
                    statues, placed at a certain distance, the eyes, which are of the same colour
                    with the rest of the head, would have little effect if they were not sunk. By
                    deepening the cavity of the eye, the statuary increases the light and shade, and
                    thus gives the head more life and expression. The same practice is used in small
                    statues. The eye is a characteristic feature in the heads of the different
                    deities. In the statues of Apollo, Jupiter, and Juno, the eyes are large and
                    round. In those of Pallas they are also large; but by lowering the eyelids, the
                    virgin air and expression of modesty are delicately marked. Venus has small
                    eyes, and the lower eyelid being raised a little, gives them a languishing look
                    and enchanting sweetness. It is only necessary to see the Venus de' Medicis to
                    be convinced that large eyes are not essential to beauty, especially if we
                    compare her small eyes with those which resemble them in nature. The beauty of
                    the eyebrows consists in the fineness of the hair, and in the sharpness of the
                    bone which covers them; and masters of the art considered the joining of the
                    eyebrows as a deformity, though it is sometimes to be met with in ancient
                    statues.</p>
                <p>The beauty of the mouth is peculiarly necessary to constitute a fine face. The
                    lower lip must be fuller than the upper, in order to give an elegant rounding to
                    the chin. The teeth seldom appear, except in laughing satyrs. In human figures
                    the lips are generally close, and a little opened in the figures of the gods.
                    The lips of Venus are half open. In figures of ideal beauty, the Grecian artists
                    never interrupted the rounding of the chin by introducing a dimple; for this
                    they considered not as a mark of beauty, and only to be admitted to distinguish
                    individuals. The dimple indeed appears in some ancient statues, but antiquaries
                    suspect it to be the work of a modern hand. It is suspected, also, that the
                    dimple which is sometimes found on the cheeks of ancient statues is a modern
                    innovation.</p>
                <p>No part of the head was executed by the ancients with more care than the ears,
                    though little attention has been given to them by modern artists. This character
                    is so decisive, that if we observe in any statue that the ears are not highly
                    finished, but only roughly marked, we may conclude with certainty that we are
                    examining a modem production. The ancients were very attentive to copy the
                    precise form of the ear in taking likenesses. Thus, where we meet with a head
                    the ears of which have a very large interior opening, we know it to be the head
                    of Marcus Aurelius.</p>
                <p>The manner in which the ancient artists formed the hair also enables us to
                    distinguish their works from those of the moderns. On hard and coarse stones the
                    hair was short, and appeared as if it had been combed with a wide comb; for that
                    kind of stone was difficult to work, and could not without immense labour be
                    formed into curled and flowing hair. But the figures executed in marble in the
                    most flourishing period of the art have the hair curled and flowing; at least
                    where the head was not intended to be an exact resemblance, for then the artist
                    conformed to his model. In the heads of women, the hair was thrown back, and
                    tied behind in a waving manner, leaving considerable intervals; which gives the
                    agreeable variety of light and shade, and produces the effects of the
                    claro-oscuro. The hair of the Amazons is disposed in this manner. Apollo and
                    Bacchus have their hair falling down their shoulders; and young persons, until
                    they arrived at manhood, wore their hair long. The colour of the hair which was
                    reckoned most beautiful, was fair; and this they gave without distinction to the
                    most beautiful of their gods, Apollo and Bacchus, and likewise to their most
                    illustrious heroes.</p>
                <p>Although the ravages of time have preserved but few of the hands or feet of
                    ancient statues, it is evident from what remains how anxious the Grecian artists
                    were to give every perfection to these parts. The hands of young persons were
                    moderately plump, with little cavities or dimples at the joints of the fingers.
                    The fingers tapered very gently from the root to the points, like
                    well-proportioned columns, and the joints were scarcely perceptible. The
                    terminating joint was not bent, as it commonly appears in modern statues.</p>
                <p>In the figures of young men the joints of the knee are faintly marked. The knee
                    unites the leg to the thigh without making any remarkable projections or
                    cavities. The most beautiful legs and best-turned knees, according to
                    Winckelman, are preserved in the Apollo Saurocthones, in the Villa Borghese; in
                    the Apollo which has a swan at its feet; and in the Bacchus of the Villa
                    Medicis. The same able connoisseur remarks, it is rare to meet with beautiful
                    knees in young persons, or in the elegant representations of art. As the
                    ancients did not cover the feet as we do, they gave to them the most beautiful
                    turning, and studied the form of them with the most scrupulous attention.</p>
                <p>The breasts of men were large and elevated. The breasts of women did not possess
                    much amplitude. The figures of the deities have always the breasts of a virgin,
                    the beauty of which the ancients made to consist in a gentle elevation. So
                    anxious were the women to resemble this standard, that they used several arts to
                    restrain the growth of their breasts. The breasts of the nymphs and goddesses
                    were never represented swelling, because that is peculiar to those women who
                    suckle. The paps of Venus contract and end in a point, this being considered as
                    an essential characteristic of perfect beauty. Some of the modems have
                    transgressed these rules, and have fallen into great improprieties. The lower
                    part of the body in the statues of men was formed like that of the living body
                    after a profound sleep and good digestion. The navel was considerably sunk,
                    especially in female statues.</p>
                <p>As beauty never appears in equal perfection in every part of the same individual,
                    perfect or ideal beauty can only be produced by selecting the most beautiful
                    parts from different models; but this must be done with such judgment and care,
                    that these detached beauties when united may form the most exact symmetry. Yet
                    the ancients sometimes confined themselves to one individual, even in the most
                    flourishing age. Theodorus, whom Socrates and his disciples visited, served as a
                    model to the artists of his time.<pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:chi.28490924&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=16" xml:id="kp-eb0720-0016-0006"/>
                    Phryne also appears to have been a model to the painters and sculptors. But
                    Socrates, in his conversation with Parrhasius, says, that when a perfect beauty
                    was to be produced, the artists joined together the most striking beauties which
                    could be collected from the finest figures. We know that Zeuxis, when he was
                    going to paint Helen, united in one picture all the beauties of the most
                    handsome women of Crotona.</p>
                <p>The Grecian sculptors, who represented with such suc- ' cess the most perfect
                    beauty of the human form, were not regardless of the drapery of their statues.
                    They clothed their figures in the most proper stuff, which they wrought into
                    that shape which was best calculated to give effect to their design.</p>
                <p>The vestments of women in Greece generally consisted of linen cloth, or some
                    other light stuff, and in later times of silk, and sometimes of woollen cloth.
                    They had also garments embroidered with gold. In the works of sculpture, as well
                    as in those of painting, one may distinguish the linen by its transparency and
                    small united folds. The other light stuffs which were worn by the women were
                    generally of cotton produced in the isle of Cos; and these the art of statuary
                    was able to distinguish from the linen vestments. The cotton cloth was sometimes
                    striped, and sometimes embellished with a profusion of flowers. Silk was also
                    employed; but whether it was known in Greece before the time of the Roman
                    emperors cannot easily be determined. In paintings it is distinguishable by
                    changing its colour in different lights, to red, violet, and sky-blue. There
                    were two sorts of purple; that which the Greeks called the colour of the sea,
                    and Tyrian purple, which resembled lac. Woollen garments are easily known by the
                    amplitude of their folds. Besides these, cloth of gold sometimes composed their
                    drapery. But it was not like the modem fabric, consisting of a thread of gold or
                    of silver spun with a thread of silk; it was composed of gold or silver alone,
                    without any mixture.</p>
                <p>The vestments of the Greeks, which deserve particular attention, are the tunic,
                    the robe, and the mantle.</p>
                <p>The tunic was that part of the dress which was next to the body. It may be seen
                    in sleeping figures, or in those in deshabile; as in the Flora Farnese, and in
                    the statues of the Amazons in the Capitol. The youngest of the daughters of
                    Niobe, who throws herself at her mother’s side, is clothed only with a tunic,
                    which was of linen, or some other light stuff, without sleeves, fixed to the
                    shoulders by a button, so as to cover the whole breast. None but the tunics of
                    the goddess Ceres and comedians have long straight sleeves.</p>
                <p>The robes of women commonly consisted of two long pieces of woollen cloth,
                    without any particular form, attached to the shoulders by a great many buttons,
                    and sometimes by a clasp. They had straight sleeves which came down to the
                    wrists. The young girls, as well as the women, (listened their robe to their
                    side by a cincture, in the same way as the high priest of the Jews fastened his,
                    and as it is still done in many parts of Greece. The cincture formed on the side
                    a knot of ribbons sometimes resembling a rose in shape, which has been
                    particularly remarked in the two beautiful daughters of Niobe. In the younger of
                    these the cincture is seen passing over the shoulders and the back. Venus has
                    two cinctures, the one passing over the shoulder, and the other surrounding the
                    waist. The latter is called cestus by the poets.</p>
                <p>The mantle was called <hi rend="italic">peplon</hi> by the Greeks, which
                    signifies properly the mantle of Pallas. The name was afterwards applied to the
                    mantles of the other gods, as well as to those of men. This part of the dress
                    was not square, as some have imagined, but of a roundish form. The ancients
                    indeed speak in general of square mantles, but they received this shape from
                    four tassels, which were affixed to them; two of these were visible, and two
                    were concealed under the mantle. The mantle was brought under the right arm, and
                    over the left shoulder; sometimes it was attached to the shoulder by two
                    buttons, as may be seen ιr. the beautiful statue of Leucothoe at the Villa
                    Albani.</p>
                <p>The colour of vestments peculiar to certain statues is too curious to be omitted.
                    To begin with the figures or the gods, the drapery of Jupiter was red, that of
                    Neptune is supposed by Winckelman to have been sea-green. The same colour also
                    belonged to the Nereids and the Nymphs. The mantle of Apollo was blue or violet.
                    Bacchus was dressed in white. Martianus Capella assigns green to Cybele. Juno’s
                    vestments were sky-blue, but she sometimes had a white veil. Pallas was robed in
                    a flame-coloured mantle. In a painting of Herculanum, Venus is in flowing
                    drapery of a golden-yellow. Kings were arrayed in purple, priests in white, and
                    conquerors sometimes in sea-green.</p>
                <p>With respect to the head, women generally wore no covering but their hair; when
                    they wished to cover the head, they used the comer of their mantle. Sometimes we
                    meet with veils of a fine transparent texture. Old women wore a kind of bonnet
                    upon their head, an example of which may be seen in a statue in the Capitol,
                    called the <hi rend="italic">Prafica;</hi> but Winckelman thinks it is a statue
                    of Hecuba.</p>
                <p>The covering of the feet consisted of shoes or sandals. The sandals were
                    generally an inch thick, and composed of more than one sole of cork. Those of
                    Pallas in the Villa Albani has two soles, and other statues had no less than
                    five.</p>
                <p>The most authentic monuments of the ancient style are medals, containing an
                    inscription which leads us back to very distant times. The writing is from right
                    to left, in the Hebrew manner, a usage which was abandoned before the time of
                    Herodotus. The statue of Agamemnon at Elis, which was made by Ornatas, has an
                    inscription from right to left. This artist flourished fifty years before
                    Phidias. It is in the intervening period therefore between these two artists
                    that we are to look for the cessation of this practice, The statues formed in
                    the ancient style were neither distinguished by beauty of shape nor by
                    proportion, but bore a close resemblance to those of the Egyptians and
                    Etrurians. The eyes were long and flat; the section of the mouth not horizontal;
                    the chin was pointed; the curls of the hair were ranged in little rings, and
                    resembled grains enclosed in a heap of raisins. What was still worse, it was
                    impossible by inspecting the head to distinguish the sex. The characters of this
                    ancient style were these: the designing was energetical, but harsh; it was
                    animated, but without gracefulness; and the violence of the expression deprived
                    the whole figure of beauty.</p>
                <p>The grand style was brought to perfection by Phidias, Polycletus, Scopas,
                    Alcamenes, Myron, and other illustrious artists. It is probable, from some
                    passages of ancient writers, that in this style were preserved some characters
                    of the ancient manner, such as the straight lines, the squares, and angles. The
                    ancient masters, being the legislators of proportions, and thinking they had a
                    right to distribute the measures and dimensions of the parts of the human body,
                    have undoubtedly sacrificed some degree of the form of beauty, to a grandeur
                    which is harsh, in comparison of the flowing contours and graceful forms of
                    their successors.</p>
                <p>Phidias, the great master of this art, was born at Athens in the seventy-third
                    Olympiad, about 488 years B. c. He was the contemporary of Socrates, Plato,
                    Xenophon, and other eminent men, and was engaged by Pericles to superintend the
                    decoration of the temple of Minerva and other public works. “His superior
                    genius,” says Flaxman, “in addition to his knowledge of painting, which be
                    practised previous to sculpture, gave a grandeur to his compositions, a grace to
                    his groups, a softness to fieβh, and flow to draperies, unknown to his
                    predecessors, the character of whose<pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:chi.28490924&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=17" xml:id="kp-eb0720-0017-0007"/>
                    figures was stiff rather than dignified; their forms either meagre or turgid;
                    the folds of drapery parallel, poor, and resembling geometrical lines, rather
                    than the simple but ever-varying appearances of nature.” Quintilian says of
                    Phidias, “his Athenian Minerva, and Olympian Jupiter at Elis, possessed beauty
                    which seemed to have added something to religion, the majesty of the work was so
                    worthy of the divinity.” The greatest work of this chief of sculptors was the
                    Jupiter at Elis, sixty feet in height, formed of ivory, enriched with the
                    radiance of golden ornament and precious stones, and justly esteemed one of the
                    seven wonders of the world.</p>
                <p>The third style of Grecian sculpture was the graceful or beautiful. Praxiteles
                    and Lysippus introduced this style. Being more conversant than their
                    predecessors with the sweet, the pure, the flowing, and the beautiful lines of
                    nature, they avoided the square forms, which the masters of the second style had
                    too much employed. They were of opinion that the use of the art was rather to
                    please than to astonish, and that the aim of the artists should be to raise
                    admiration by giving delight. The artists who cultivated this style did not,
                    however, neglect to study the sublime works of their predecessors. They knew
                    that grace is consistent with the most dignified beauty, and that it possesses
                    charms which must ever please; they knew also that these charms are enhanced by
                    dignity. Grace is infused into all the movements and attitudes of their statues,
                    and it appears in the delicate turns of the hair, and even in the adjusting of
                    the drapery. Every sort of grace was well known to the ancients; and great as
                    the ravages of time have been amongst the works of art, specimens are still
                    preserved, in which can be distinguished dignified beauty, attractive beauty,
                    and a beauty peculiar to infinite.</p>
                <p>Praxiteles, a native of Magna Graecia, was born about 364 years <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b. c</hi>. He excelled in the highest graces of youth and
                    heauty. “None,” says a judicious writer on sculpture, “ever more happily
                    succeeded in uniting softness with force,—elegance and refinement with
                    simplicity and purity: his grace never degenerates into the affected, nor his
                    delicacy into the artificial. Over his compositions he has thrown an expression
                    spiritual at once and sensual; a voluptuousness and modesty which touch the most
                    insensible, yet startle not the most retiring.” Among the known works of this
                    master are his Satyr, Cupid, Apollo the Lizard-killer, and Bacchus leaning on a
                    Fawn. The famous Venus of Gnidos was also his work. This statue seems to offer
                    the first idea of the Venus de’ Medicis, the statue which still “enchants the
                    world,” and “fills the air around with beauty,” and which is probably the
                    repetition of another Venus of Praxiteles.</p>
                <p>Lysippus of Sicyon, the younger, the contemporary and rival of Praxiteles, it is
                    believed worked only in metal. Although he is said to have executed upwards of
                    six hundred works, not one remains. The Tarentine Jupiter, sixty feet high, was
                    one of his great works. He excelled in the knowledge of symmetry, and many of
                    his works were finished with the utmost delicacy and truth. He was so great a
                    favourite with Alexander, that he alone was allowed to make casts of the prince.
                    It gives us some idea of the high consideration in which his works were held by
                    the Romans, that even Tiberius trembled in his palace at an insurrection of the
                    people, occasioned by the removal from one of the public baths of a figure by
                    Lysippus.</p>
                <p>The works that remain to us of ancient art sufficiently attest the excellence of
                    the Greeks in sculpture. We can only allude very briefly to some of the most
                    celebrated of these productions. The Apollo Belvidere, believed to be the Apollo
                    of Calamis mentioned by Pliny, has with justice been deemed one of the most
                    admirable works of Grecian art. This statue “breathes the flame with which 'twas
                    wrought,” as if the sculptor had left a portion of his own soul within the
                    marble, to half-animate his glorious creation. The Dying Gladiatoris another
                    greatly-valued work,finely designed, full of truth, and admirably executed. The
                    Fawn of the Florence Gallery, so wonderfully restored by Michel Angelo, is an
                    exquisite and characteristic representation. The Fighting Gladiator, and several
                    of the statues of Venus, Diana, Mercury, and Bacchus, are expressive productions
                    of the best days of Grecian sculpture. These precious monuments of art, the
                    ancient groups, display the sentiment, heroism, beauty, and sublimity of Greece,
                    existing as it were before us. The Laocoon, animated with the hopeless agony of
                    the father and sons, is the work of Apollodorus, Athenodorus, and Agesander of
                    Rhodes. The groups of Dirce, Hercules, and Antaeus, Atreus, Orestes, and
                    Electra, and Ajax supporting Patroclus, are examples of fine form, character,
                    and sentiment. The group of Niobe and her youngest daughter, by Scopas, is an
                    exquisite specimen of art, replete with heroic beauty and exalted passion. The
                    group of the Wrestlers is a representation of difficult but harmonious
                    composition; and that of Cupid and Psyche shows much elegance combined with
                    graceful proportion.</p>
                <p>The Elgin Marbles, now the property of the British nation, belong to a period in
                    the history of Grecian sculpture when the art had reached its highest
                    excellence. “These marbles,” we quote from the Library of Useful Knowledge,
                    “chiefly ornamented one edifice, dedicated to the guardian deity of Athens,
                    raised at the time of the greatest political power of the state, when all the
                    arts which contribute to humanize life were developing their beneficial
                    influence. Many of the writers of Athens, whose works are the daily text-books
                    of our schools, saw in their original perfection the mutilated marbles which we
                    cherish and admire. The Elgin collection has presented us with the external and
                    material forms in which the art of Phidias gave life and reality to the
                    beautiful mythi which veiled the origin of his native city, and perpetuated in
                    groups of matchless simplicity the ceremonies of the great national festival.
                    The lover of beauty, and the friend of Grecian learning, will here find a living
                    comment on what he reads; and as in the best and severest models of antiquity we
                    always discover something new to admire, so here we find fresh beauties at every
                    visit, and learn how infinite in variety are simplicity and truth, and how every
                    deviation from these principles produces sameness and satiety.”</p>
                <p>Clay was the first material employed in statuary. An instance of this may be seen
                    in a figure of Alcamenes in bas-relief in the Villa Albani. The ancients used
                    their fingers, and especially their nails, to render certain parts more delicate
                    and lively; and hence arose the phrase <hi rend="italic">ad unguem factus
                    homo,</hi> an accomplished man. It was the opinion of Count Caylus, that the
                    ancients did not use models in forming their statues. But to disprove this, it
                    is only necessary to mention an engraving on a stone in the cabinet of Stosch,
                    which represents Prometheus engraving the figure of a man, with a plummet in his
                    hand to measure the proportions of his model. The ancients as well as the
                    moderns made works in plaster; but no specimens remain except some figures in
                    bas-relief, of which the most beautiful were found at Baiae.</p>
                <p>The works made of ivory and silver were generally of a small size. Sometimes,
                    however, statues of a prodigious size were formed of gold and ivory. The
                    colossal Minerva of Phidias, which was composed of these materials, was
                    twenty-six cubits in height.</p>
                <p>The Greeks generally hewed their marble statues out of one block, though they
                    afterwords worked the heads separately, and sometimes the arms. The heads of the
                    famous group of Niobe and her Daughters have been adapted to their bodies after
                    being separately finished. It is proved by a large figure representing a river,
                    which is preserved in the Villa Albani, that the ancients first hewed their
                    statues<pb break="no" facs="ht:chi.28490924&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=18"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0720-0018-0008"/> roughly before they attempted to finish any part.
                    When the statue had received its perfect figure, they next proceeded to polish
                    it with pumice-stone, and again carefully retouched every part with the chisel.
                    The ancients, when they employed porphyry, usually made the head and extremities
                    of marble. It is true, that at Venice there are four figures entirely composed
                    of porphyry; but these are the production of the Greeks of the middle age; some
                    of their noblest works were cast in bronze. They also made statues of basalt and
                    alabaster.</p>

                <p>1 <hi rend="italic">Ancient Italian Sculpture.</hi></p>
                <p>The Romans made the conquest of the world so much the passion of their hearts,
                    that they had little enthusiasm to spare for art. They admired the works of
                    Greece, and filled Rome with statues; but though they inherited the empire, they
                    succeeded not to the genius of that little knot of republics. In their hands
                    sculpture soon degenerated; it became more vulgar and more absurd every
                    succeeding reign. As they worshipped the gods of Greece, they were content to
                    find them ready made to their hands, and their chief works were statues of their
                    great men, and triumphal columns and arches. Their best and most characteristic
                    sculpture was history. The Trajan Column represents, in one continued winding
                    relief, from the base to the summit, the actions of the emperor; and his statue
                    stood at the top to show him as the consummation of all glory. The Romans, when
                    they conquered Britain, adorned the temples and courts of justice with statues
                    of divinities. These remains are executed with such deficiency of skill as
                    countenances the conjecture, that the gods and altars, as well as the roads of
                    the time, were executed by the soldiers.</p>
                <p>Almost the only excellence to which the Romans could lay claim, was their
                    collection of busts. These, from Julius to Galienus, embracing a period of three
                    centuries, exhibit a series invaluable in the history of art, and in some
                    instances worthy of comparison with the best works of the kind executed in the
                    earlier ages. The busts are confined to the emperors of Rome; all others were
                    forbid to be sculptured. The most perfect specimens cease with the reign of
                    Augustus. Towards the close of the first century, forcible and free execution is
                    substituted for purity of design and natural expression. A stiffness and
                    laboured appearance marks the works of the reign of Hadrian. Some traits of good
                    workmanship are observable in the busts of Aurelius. In the times of Severus the
                    art had degenerated, and every subsequent reign shows a farther debasement, till
                    all traces of excellence finally disappear.</p>
                <p>2.— <hi rend="italic">Modem Italian Sculpture.</hi></p>
                <p>The first revival of modern art may be reckoned from the reign of Constantine,
                    when Christianity was established. We will not, in this sketch, dwell on the
                    works of this period, which indeed do not afford much matter for interesting
                    contemplation; but pass on to the time when indications - of real power and
                    genius first appeared. The most distinguished restorer of sculpture was
                    Donatello, born at Florence in 1383. Some of his works, both in bronze and
                    marble, might be placed beside the best productions of ancient Greece without
                    discredit. His alto-relievo of Two Singing Boys is a superior piece of
                    sculpture. The bronze statue of Mercury by this master, at Florence, is equally
                    remarkable. His marble statue of St George was greatly admired by Michel Angelo,
                    who, after gazing at it for some time in silence, suddenly exclaimed “March !” A
                    similar anecdote is told of this great man, who addressed these words to another
                    work of Donatello’s, Saint Mark, “Marco, perche non mi parli ?” The
                    basso-relievos of the life of Christ by Donatello abound in noble conceptions,
                    but they were the works of advanced age, and were finished by his scholars.</p>
                <p>Lorenzo Ghiberti, born in 1378, showed his great talents at the early age of
                    twenty-three, when he commenced that splendid work, the doors of the Baptistry
                    at Florence. These doors are three in number, all in bronze. The southern door,
                    on the panels of which are sculptured the life of St John the Baptist, is by
                    Andrea da Pisa. The northern and eastern doors are by Ghiberti. On the former is
                    represented the life of our Saviour, and the latter exhibits the principal
                    events recorded in the Old Testament. They occupied Ghiberti for forty years,
                    and are justly considered noble specimens of art. The eastern door was regarded
                    by Michel Angelo as worthy to be the gate of Paradise.</p>
                <p>We come now to notice Michel Angelo, the most illustrious master of modern art,
                    whether regarded as sculptor, painter, or architect. Born in 1474, and living to
                    the advanced age of ninety, this celebrated man was the means of influencing by
                    his mighty genius the efforts of art during the greater part of the sixteenth
                    century. Whatever be the various opinions of Michel Angelo, all unite in
                    acknowledging the wondrous power of his works in sculpture. It is only when he
                    has overstrained the muscular energy of his subjects that fault can be found at
                    all. In some instances we no doubt find him exaggerated, and deficient in
                    repose. His conceptions were generally vast, almost superhuman, and in this
                    spirit they were executed. With him expression and character were primary
                    considerations, and he made ideal beauty and form subservient to his forcible
                    representations. His works have a strong, marked character of their own; his
                    thoughts are always elevated, and his figures full of dignity. He is never
                    feeble. If not sublime, he is never insipid. The sentiment of aggrandizing his
                    subject often prevails. His statue of Moses in S. Pietro, in Vincoli, though
                    severely criticised, is a great work. “The true sublime,” says Forsyth, “resists
                    all ridicule. The offended lawgiver frowns on undepressed, and awes you with
                    inherent authority.” The recumbent statues in the monument of Julian de’
                    Medicis, in the Medici chapel, of Daybreak and Night, are grand and mysterious,
                    and denote a mighty mind and hand. The pensive sitting figure of Lorenzo de’
                    Medicis is finely conceived; and the Madonna and Child in the same chapel has,
                    in the opinion of Flaxman, “a sentiment of maternal affection never found in
                    Grecian sculpture, but frequently in the works of this artist, particularly in
                    his paintings, and that of the most tender kind.” Michel Angelo brought the
                    principles of art to great perfection. “Anatomy,” says Flaxman, “the motion and
                    perspective of figure, the complication, grandeur, and harmony of his grouping,
                    with the advantages and facility of execution in painting and sculpture, besides
                    his mathematical and mechanical attainments in architecture and building, which,
                    together with the many and prodigious works he accomplished, demonstrate how
                    greatly he contributed to the restoration of art.”</p>
                <p>Giovanni di Bologna, a Frenchman by birth, was one of the most celebrated of
                    Michel Angelo’s scholars. His Venus coming from the Bath, both standing and
                    kneeling, are remarkable for delicacy and grace; and his Mercury is beautifully
                    conceived and finely executed. Benvenuto Cellini obtained celebrity for his
                    group of Perseus and Medusa. Bernini enjoyed great reputation in his day, but
                    his Apollo and Daphne seems his only work of distinguished merit, although he
                    has been also esteemed for the ease and nature of his portraits. His larger
                    works were considered by Flaxman as remarkable for presuming airs, affected
                    grace, and unmeaning flutter.</p>
                <p>Sculpture continued to flourish in Italy during a portion of the seventeenth
                    century, but after that it rapidly declined. An illustrious man, however, was
                    destined to raise it<pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:chi.28490924&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=19" xml:id="kp-eb0720-0019-0009"/> to
                    a new existence. Antonio Canova, born in Possagno in 1757, though weakly in
                    constitution, gave early indications of future excellence. His diligence in
                    studying sculpture was unwearied, and he was distinguished among the Venetian
                    artists by a laborious exercise of hand, a restless activity of fancy, and an
                    enthusiastic longing for fame. The people of Venice felt the beauty of Canova’s
                    works. He went to Rome and executed his group of Theseus and the Minotaur, which
                    was pronounced by the first judges as “one of the most perfect works which Rome
                    had beheld for ages.” From this fortunate hour to the end of his life, he
                    produced a rapid succession of statues and groups, which carried his fame far
                    and wide over the world. Before 1800 he had given to the world some of his most
                    successful performances; the monuments of Ganganelli and Rezzonico the groups of
                    Venus and Adonis, and of Cupid and Psyche; the Hebe, and the Sommariva
                    Magdalene. These statues were entirely by his own hands, unassisted by workmen.
                    When his success produced wealth, his protection of rising merit was admirable.
                    His liberality in this respect was as boundless as his enthusiasm for the arts.
                    He died in 1822, having executed fifty-three statues, twelve groups, and
                    monuments, busts, and relievos amounting to the extraordinary number of 176
                    complete works, which are now dispersed all over Europe. Canova principally
                    excelled in the beautiful and graceful. He never attempted to tread</p>
                <p>Di Michel Angeol la terribil via.</p>
                <p>Hence his favourite subjects were those of female grace or youthful beauty.
                    Paris, Perseus, Palamedes, Psyche, Hebe, Venus, Nymphs, and Dancers, are the
                    most popular of all his works. In some of these there is an approach to
                    affectation and French taste, especially in the draperies; and, perhaps, in
                    avoiding the extremes of anatomical force and muscular development, he has too
                    much addicted himself to flowing outline and polished surface. But his taste
                    improved with his progress in the art. He felt the superiority of simplicity
                    over affectation, as is visibly shown in the noble productions of his riper
                    years, his Pauline, the mother of Buonaparte, the Endymion, and the recumbent
                    Magdalene. Although his power of conception was inferior to the illustrious
                    artists of Greece, he nevertheless rivalled them in the vivid grace and
                    exquisite skill of his works. Well did Byron say, in the lifetime of this great
                    artist,</p>
                <p>Such as the great of yore, Canova is to-day.</p>
                <p>The genius of Canova gave a new impulse to Italian sculpture. Thorwaldsen, though
                    a Dane by birth, may be considered an Italian artist. His Triumph of Alexander,
                    the Mercury, the Night, and Aurora, are works which have sufficiently
                    established the claim of this great artist to the admiration of his own age, and
                    that of posterity. Danneker, the sculptor of the Ariadne at Francfort, seems
                    also to belong to the existing school of Italy. There are others, whom we cannot
                    enumerate, who are also in the fair road to eminence; but singular to say, few
                    of these are sons of that land which has so well been called</p>
                <p>Mother of arts, as once of arms.</p>
                <p>IV. ENGLISH SCULPTURE.</p>
                <p>The Romans, when they withdrew their troops from Britain, left some taste for
                    sulpture behind them, and their successors the Saxons made attempts to imitate
                    the human form. The Normans introduced a better style of art and the return of
                    the crusaders brought a relish for Grecian statuary into this country. In the
                    reign of Henry III. the works of English artists were characterized by good
                    sense and simple grace, which redeemed the imperfections of workmanship. In the
                    chapel of Henry VII. we see monuments carved with great skill. The Protestant
                    religion was not favourable to the art, and our sculptures, after the
                    Reformation, were mostly by foreigners. The first English sculptor of note was
                    Gibbons, who, about the close of the seventeenth century, executed many
                    admirable works in wood. About the same time lived Cibber, an artist of
                    originality and power. The far-famed figures of Raving and Melancholy, carved in
                    stone, are his hest-known productions, and, in spite of Pope’s satirical lines
                    on the “brainless brothers,” they stand foremost in conception and second in
                    execution among the efforts of English sculpture. The bas-reliefs on the sides
                    of the monument in London, and some statues at Chatsworth, are from his
                    chisel.</p>
                <p>Roubiliac, a Frenchman by birth, was so long resident in England that he has been
                    adopted as a British artist. Although Flaxman has pronounced a poor opinion of
                    Roubiliac’s works, they have nevertheless taken a lasting hold of public
                    admiration. He was a man deeply imbued with poetic feelings, and had an
                    unbounded enthusiasm for his profession. Some of his works are fanciful and
                    conceited, but others again possess much elegance of action, and all are very
                    beautifully executed. His figure of Eloquence is masterly and graceful. Canova
                    said it was one of the noblest statues he had seen in England. The statue of Sir
                    Isaac Newton is another of his masterpieces; Chantrey calls it “the noblest of
                    all our English statues. There is an air of nature and a loftiness of thought
                    about it, which no other artist has in this country, I suspect, reached. You
                    cannot imagine any. thing grander in sentiment and the execution is every way
                    worthy of it.” His most famous work is the monument of Mrs Nightingale, in
                    Westminster Abbey: with some allegorical extravagance, it exhibits feeling and
                    pathos, and the workmanship is quite marvellous.</p>
                <p>“Banks,” says Cunningham, “was the first of our native sculptors whose aims were
                    uniformly lofty and heroic, and who desired to bring poetry to the aid of all
                    his compositions.” His groups and statues were, however, coldly received. His
                    sketches, which are full of vigour and feeling, have been highly esteemed. The
                    statue of Achilles mourning the loss of Briseis has not been excelled for fine
                    action and noble proportions. Nollekens, like Banks, was ambitious to introduce
                    a purer and more tasteful style of art but his great works hardly came up to
                    expectation. His busts are however excellent, and will preserve his fame.
                    Cunningham, from whose agreeable publication on English art we have already
                    quoted, says, “the claims of Nollekens to distinction are threefold; bust
                    sculpture, monumental sculpture, and poetic sculpture. He attained to eminence
                    in all, but to lasting fame, I apprehend, only in the first, and even then the
                    permanent meed is secured to him more from the lasting importance of some of his
                    subjects, than from the splendour of the art with which he has invested them.”
                    Bacon infused more English sense into sculpture than any of his predecessors, or
                    his contemporaries Banks and Nollekens. His statue of Samuel Johnson, in St
                    Paul’s, is an excellent work; stern, severe, full of surly thought and con
                    scious power. Howard, also in St Paul’s, is expressive of the philanthropic and
                    benevolent man it represents. Bacon had great skill in workmanship, and he never
                    spared his labour. Some of his monuments are rather too much crowded with
                    ornaments and objects of secondary interest.</p>
                <p>The most eminent sculptor this country has yet produced, John Flaxman, was born
                    in 1755. “The elements of his style,” said Sir Thomas Lawrence, “were founded in
                    Grecian art—on its noblest principles—on its deeper intellectual power, and not
                    on the mere surface of its skill. Though master of its purest lines, he was
                    still more the sculptor of sentiment than of form; and whilst the philosopher,
                    the statesman, and the hero, were treated by him with appropriate dignity, not
                    even in Raphael have the gentler feelings and sorrows of human nature been
                    treated with more touching pathos than in the various degrees and models of<pb

                    xml:id="kp-eb0720-0020-0010"/> this inestimable man. Like the greatest of modern
                    painters, he delighted to trace, from the actions of familiar life, the lines of
                    sentiment and passion, and, from the populous haunts and momentary peacefulness
                    of poverty and want, to form his inestimable groups of childhood and maternal
                    tenderness, with those nobler compositions from holy writ, as beneficent in
                    their motive as they were novel in design.” The classical productions of Flaxman
                    are now known far and wide, and they have given the world a high idea of the
                    genius of England. “Michel Angelo and Flaxman,” observes an excellent critic,
                    “are the only two sculptors who, with genius for the minute as well as the
                    grand, have dared sometimes to be remiss, and leave sentiment to make its way
                    without the accompanying graces of skilful labour.” His workmanship was
                    certainly sometimes slovenly, and his draperies heavy. The monuments he executed
                    are not his ablest works. His illustrations of Homer, Aeschylus, and Dante, are
                    worthy of the great originals; and the engravings from these works have given
                    Flaxman an European reputation. The mind of this great artist was essentially
                    poetical, and his genius was, in the strictest sense of the words, original and
                    inventive.</p>
                <p>We must touch lightly on the living artists of this country. It is satisfactory
                    to think that ours is not an age in which sculpture is retrograding in Britain.
                    The splendid genius of Chantrey has nobly sustained the reputation Flaxman
                    earned for us. His statues, now very numerous, are works of decided excellence;
                    whilst his busts are the most admirable productions of that kind in the world.
                    Westma-cott has also shared largely in public favour. Several of his monuments
                    and other works are ably executed. We do not name other artists of rising fame.
                    Their merit, if they truly possess any, will be duly appreciated, for a correct
                    taste in works of sculpture is every day becoming more generally diffused in
                    Britain.</p>
                <p>V. FRENCH, SPANISH, AND GERMAN SCULPTURE.</p>
                <p>Our sketch would be imperfect did we not allude to the sculpture of France,
                    Spain, and Germany. In France, the art began to be practised with success about
                    the middle of the sixteenth century. Gougon finished the famous Fountain of the
                    Innocents in 1550. The works of Cousin evince genius; and Pilon has been admired
                    for energy in his productions. Jacques D’Angouleme, a contemporary of Michel
                    Angelo’s, possesses merit. Giovanni di Bologna, of whom we have previously
                    spoken, filled his country with the principles of his master. Sculpture
                    flourished in France during the reign of Louis XIV. Voltaire says of one of the
                    artists of this time, Girandon, “il a égalé tout ce que l’antiquité a de plus
                    beau.” This is great praise, and scarcely merited, although his designs are
                    noble and his taste correct. An example of his style is well seen in his Tomb of
                    Richelieu. Puget is also much esteemed by his countrymen. The succeeding artists
                    of France were followers more or less of the styles of Girandon and Puget. The
                    art may be said to be in a flourishing state at present.</p>
                <p>A great number of names have been recorded by Spanish writers as eminent in
                    sculpture. The greater part of them seem to have been employed in ornamenting
                    the churches of Spain, and few are known from their works in other countries.
                    Berruguete, one of the best artists of Spain, studied under Michel Angelo at
                    Rome, and adorned Madrid, Saragossa, and other towns, with his works, which
                    exhibit much of the grandeur and expression of ancient art. After him Paul de
                    Cespedes was celebrated as a sculptor of great skill. In the eighteenth century
                    Philip de Castro became a distinguished sculptor, and contributed greatly to
                    spread the principles of correct taste in Spain.</p>
                <p>Prior to the seventeenth century, Germany appears to have made little progress in
                    sculpture. Ranchmuller pre ceded Schluter of Hamburg, who repaired to Rome, and
                    attached himself to the manner of Michel Angelo. Messerschmidt executed many
                    excellent pieces of sculpture in Vienna. In later times Ohnmacht, Sonnenschein,
                    Nahl, and the two Shadofs, have distinguished themselves as artists. The
                    Spinning Girl of the Younger Shadof is an exquisite piece of sculpture. The
                    Germans promise to advance rapidly in sculpture, from the enthusiasm they show
                    in acquiring the true principles of the art.</p>
                <p>VI OF EXPRESSION, ACTION, AND PROPORTION IN SCULPTURE.</p>
                <p>Without expression, gesture, and attitude, no figure can be beautiful, because in
                    these the graces always reside. It was for this reason that the graces are
                    always represented as the companions of Venus.</p>
                <p>The expression of tranquillity was frequent in Grecian statues, because,
                    according to Plato, that was considered as the middle state of the soul between
                    pleasure and pain. Experience, too, shows that in general the most beautiful
                    persons are endowed with the sweetest and most engaging manner. Without a sedate
                    tranquillity, dignified beauty could not exist. It is in this tranquillity,
                    therefore, that we look for the complete display of genius.</p>
                <p>The most elevated species of tranquillity and repose was studied in the figures
                    of the gods. The father of the gods, and even inferior divinities, are
                    represented without emotion or resentment. It is thus that Homer paints Jupiter
                    shaking Olympus by the motion of his hair and his eyebrows. Jupiter, however, is
                    not always exhibited in this tranquil state. In a bas-relief belonging to
                    Rondini he appears seated on an arm-chair with a melancholy aspect. The Apollo
                    of the Vatican represents the god in a fit of rage against the serpent Python,
                    which he kills at a blow. The artist, adopting the opinion of the poets, has
                    made the nose the seat of anger, and the lips the seat of disdain.</p>
                <p>To express the action of a hero, the Grecian sculptors delineated the countenance
                    of a noble virtuous character repressing his groans, and allowing no expression
                    of pain to appear. In describing the actions of a hero, the poet has much more
                    liberty than the artist. The poet can paint them such as they were before men
                    were taught to subdue their passions by the restraints of law or the refined
                    customs of social life. But the artist, obliged to select the most beautiful
                    forms, is reduced to the necessity of giving such an expression of the passions
                    as may not shock our feelings and disgust us with his production. The truth of
                    these remarks will be acknowledged by those who have seen two of the most
                    beautiful monuments of antiquity, one of which represents the fear of death, the
                    other the most violent pains and sufferings. The daughters of Niobe, against
                    whom Diana has discharged her fatal arrows, are exhibited in that state of
                    stupefaction which we imagine must take place when the certain prospect of death
                    deprives the soul of all sensibility. The fable presents us an image of that
                    stupor which Aeschylus describes as seizing the daughters of Niobe when they
                    were transformed into a rock. The other monument referred to is the image of
                    Laocoon, which exhibits the most agonizing pain that can affect the muscles, the
                    nerves, and the veins. The sufferings of the body and the elevation of the soul
                    are expressed in every member with equal energy, and form the most sublime
                    contrast imaginable. Laocoon appears to suffer with such fortitude, that, whilst
                    his lamentable situation pierces the heart, the whole figure fills us with an
                    ambitious desire of imitating his constancy and magnanimity in the pains and
                    sufferings that may fall to our lot.</p>
                <p>Philoctetes is introduced by the poets as shedding tears, uttering complaints,
                    and rending the air with his groans and cries; but the artist exhibits him
                    silent, and bearing his<pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:chi.28490924&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=21" xml:id="kp-eb0720-0021-0011"/>
                    pains with dignity. The Ajax of Timomachus is not drawn in the act of destroying
                    the sheep which he took for the Grecian chiefs, but in the moments of reflection
                    which succeeded those of frenzy. So far did the Greeks carry their love of
                    calmness and slow movements, that they thought a quick step always announced
                    rusticity of manners. Demosthenes reproaches Nicoulus for this very thing; and
                    from the words he makes use of, it appears that to speak with insolence and to
                    walk hastily were reckoned synonymous.</p>
                <p>In the figures of women the artists have conformed to the principle observed in
                    all the ancient tragedies, and recommended by Aristotle, never to make women
                    show too much intrepidity or excessive cruelty. Conformably to this maxim,
                    Clytemnestra is represented at a little distance from the fatal spot, watching
                    the murderer, but without taking any part with him. In a painting of Timomachus
                    representing Medea and her children, when Medea lifts up the dagger they smile
                    in her face, and her fury is immediately melted into compassion for the innocent
                    victims. In another representation of the same subject Medea appears hesitating
                    and indecisive. Guided by the same maxims, the artists of most refined taste
                    were careful to avoid all deformity, choosing rather to recede from truth than
                    from their accustomed respect for beauty, as may be seen in several figures of
                    Hecuba. Sometimes, however, she appears in the decrepitude of age, her face
                    furrowed with wrinkles, and her breasts hanging down.</p>
                <p>Illustrious men, and those invested with the offices of dignity, are represented
                    with a noble assurance and a firm aspect. The statues of the Roman emperors
                    resemble those of heroes, and are far removed from every species of flattery, in
                    the gesture, in the attitude, and in the action. They never appear with haughty
                    looks, or with the splendour of royalty; no figure is ever seen presenting any
                    thing to them with bended knee except captives, and none addresses them with an
                    inclination of the head. In modem works too little attention has been paid to
                    the ancient costume. Winckelman mentions a bas-relief which was executed at Rome
                    for the fountain of Trevi, representing an architect in the act of presenting
                    the plan of an aqueduct to Marcus Agrippa. The modern sculptor, not content with
                    giving a long beard to that illustrious Roman, contrary to all the ancient
                    marble statues as well as medals which remain, exhibits the architect on his
                    knees.</p>
                <p>In general it was an established principle to banish all violent passions from
                    public monuments. This will serve as a decisive mark to distinguish the true
                    antique from supposititious works. A medal has been found exhibiting two
                    Assyrians, a man and woman, tearing their hair; with this inscription, <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Assyria. et. Palaestina. ιν. potest, p. r. redac. s. c.</hi>
                    The forgery of this medal is manifest from the word <hi rend="italic"
                    >Palaestina,</hi> which is not to be found in any ancient Roman medal with a
                    Latin inscription. Besides, the violent action of tearing the hair does not suit
                    any symbolical figure. This extravagant style has been imitated by some of the
                    modern artists. Their figures resemble comedians οn the ancient theatres, who,
                    in order to suit the distant spectators, put on painted masks, employed
                    exaggerated gestures, and far overstepped the bounds of nature. This style has
                    been reduced into a theory in a treatise on the passions, composed by Le Brun.
                    The designs which accompany that work exhibit the passions in the very highest
                    degree, approaching even to frenzy. But these are calculated to vitiate the
                    taste, especially of the young; for the ardour of youth prompts them rather to
                    seize the extremity than the middle; and it will be difficult for that artist
                    who has formed his taste from such impassioned models ever to acquire that noble
                    simplicity and sedate grandeur which distinguished the works of ancient
                    taste.</p>
                <p>Proportion is the basis of beauty; indeed there can be no beauty without it, but
                    proportion may exist where there is little beauty. Experience every day teaches
                    us that knowledge is distinct from taste; and proportion, therefore, which is
                    founded on knowledge, may be strictly observed in any figure, and yet the figure
                    have no pretensions to beauty. The ancients considering ideal beauty as the most
                    perfect, have frequently employed it in preference to the beauty of nature.</p>
                <p>The body consists of three parts, as well as the members. The three parts of the
                    body are the trunk, the thighs, and the legs. The inferior parts of the body are
                    the thighs, the legs, and the feet. The arms also consist of three parts, and
                    these three parts must bear a certain proportion to the whole as well as to one
                    another. In a well-formed man the head and body must be proportioned to the
                    thighs, the legs, and the feet, in the same manner as the thighs are
                    proportioned to the legs and the feet, or the arms to the hands. The face also
                    consists of three parts, that is, three times the length of the nose; but the
                    head is not four times the length of the nose, as some writers have asserted.
                    From the place where the hair begins to the crown of the head are only three
                    fourths of the length of the nose, or that part is to the nose as nine to
                    twelve.</p>
                <p>It is probable that the Grecian as well as Egyptian artists have determined the
                    great and small proportions by fixed rules, and established a positive measure
                    for the dimensions of length, breadth, and circumference. This supposition alone
                    can enable us to account for the great conformity which we meet with in ancient
                    statues. Winckelman thinks that the foot was the measure which the ancients used
                    in all their great dimensions, and that it was by the length of it that they
                    regulated the measure of their figures, by giving to them six times that length.
                    This, in fact, is the length which Vitruvius assigns <hi rend="italic">(Pes vero
                    altitudinis corporis sextoe,</hi> lib. iii. cap. 1). That celebrated antiquary
                    thinks the foot is a more determinate measure than the head or the face, the
                    parts from which modern painters and sculptors often take their proportions.
                    This proportion of the foot to the body, which has appeared strange and
                    incomprehensible to the learned Huet, and has been entirely rejected by
                    Perrault, is however founded upon experience. After measuring with great care a
                    vast number of figures, Winckelman found this proportion observed not only in
                    Egyptian statues, but also in those of Greece. This fact may be determined by an
                    inspection of those statues the feet of which are perfect. One may be fully
                    convinced of it by examining some divine figures, in which the artists have made
                    some parts beyond their natural dimensions. In the Apollo Belvidere, which is a
                    little more than seven heads high, the f∞t is three Roman inches longer than the
                    head. The head of the Venus de’ Medicis is very small, and the height of the
                    statue is seven heads and a half; the foot is three inches and a half longer
                    than the head, or precisely the sixth part of the length of the whole
                    statue.</p>
                <p>VII. PRACTICE OF SCULPTURE.</p>
                <p>We have been thus minute in our account of the Grecian sculpture, because it is
                    the opinion of the ablest critics that modern artists have been more or less
                    eminent as they have studied with the greater or less attention the models left
                    us by that ingenious people. Winckelman goes so far as to contend that the most
                    finished works of the Grecian musters ought to be studied in preference even to
                    the works of nature. This appears to be paradoxical; but the reason assigned for
                    his opinion is, that the fairest lines of beauty are more easily discovered, and
                    make a more striking and powerful impression, by their reunion in these sublime
                    copies, than when they are scattered far and wide in the original. Allowing,
                    therefore, the study of nature the high degree of merit it so justly claims, it
                    must nevertheless be<pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:chi.28490924&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=22" xml:id="kp-eb0720-0022-0012"/>
                    granted that it leads to true beauty by a much more tedious, laborious, and
                    difficult path, than the study of the antique, which presents immediately to the
                    artist’s view the object of his researches, and combines, in a clear and strong
                    point of light, the various rays of beauty that are dispersed throughout the
                    wide domain of nature.</p>
                <p>As soon as the artist has laid this excellent foundation, acquired an intimate
                    degree of familiarity with the beauties of the Grecian statues, and formed his
                    taste after the admirable models they exhibit, he may then proceed with
                    advantage and assurance to the imitation of nature. The ideas he has already
                    formed of the perfection of nature, by observing her dispersed beauties combined
                    and collected in the compositions of the ancient artists, will enable him to
                    acquire with facility, and to employ with advantage, the detached and partial
                    ideas of beauty which will be exhibited to his view in a survey of nature in her
                    actual state. When he discovers these partial beauties, he will be capable of
                    combining them with those perfect forms of beauty with which he is already
                    acquainted. In a word, by having always present to his mind the noble models
                    already mentioned, he will be in some measure his own oracle, and will draw
                    rules from his own mind.</p>
                <p>There are, however, two ways of imitating nature. In the one a single object
                    occupies the artist, who endeavours to represent it with precision and truth; in
                    the other, certain lines and features are taken from a variety of objects, and
                    combined and blended into one regular whole. All kinds of copies belong to the
                    first kind of imitation; and productions of this kind must be executed
                    necessarily in the Dutch manner, that is to say, with high finishing, and little
                    or no invention. But the second kind of imitation leads directly to the
                    investigation and discovery of true beauty, of that beauty whose idea is connate
                    with the human mind, and is only to be found there in its highest perfection.
                    This is the kind of imitation in which the Greeks excelled, and in which men of
                    genius excite the young artists to excel after their example, namely, by
                    studying nature as they did. After having studied in the productions of the
                    Grecian masters their choice and expression of select nature, their sublime and
                    graceful contours, their noble draperies, together with that sedate grandeur and
                    admirable simplicity that constitute their chief merit, the curious artists will
                    do well to attend to the manual and mechanical part of their operations, as this
                    is absolutely necessary to the successful imitation of their excellent
                    manner.</p>
                <p>It is certain that the ancients almost always formed their first models in wax.
                    To this modern artists have substituted clay, or some such composition. They
                    prefer clay before wax in the carnations, on account of the yielding nature of
                    the latter, and its sticking in some measure to every thing it touches. We must
                    not, however, imagine from hence that the method of forming models of wet clay
                    was either unknown or neglected among the Greeks. On the contrary, it was in
                    Greece that models of this kind were invented. Their author was Dibutades of
                    Sicyon; and it is well known that Arcesilas, the friend of Lucullus, obtained a
                    higher degree of reputation by his clay models than by all his other
                    productions. Indeed if clay could be made to preserve its original moisture, it
                    would undoubtedly be the fittest substance for the models of the sculptor; but
                    when it is placed either in the fire or left to dry imperceptibly in the air,
                    its solid parts grow more compact, and the figure, losing thus a part of its
                    dimensions, is necessarily reduced to a smaller volume. This diminution would be
                    of no consequence did it equally affect the whole figure, so as to preserve its
                    proportions entire. But this is not the case. For the smaller parts of the
                    figure dry sooner than the larger; and thus losing more of their dimensions in
                    the space of time than the latter do, the symmetry and proportions of the figure
                    inevitably suffer.</p>
                <p>This inconvenience does not take place in those models that are made in wax. It
                    is indeed extremely difficult, in the ordinary method of working the wax, to
                    give it that degree of smoothness that is necessary to represent the softness of
                    the carnations or fleshy parts of the body. This inconvenience may, however, be
                    remedied by forming the model first in clay, then moulding it in plaster, and
                    lastly casting it in wax. And, indeed, clay is seldom used but as a mould in
                    which to cast a figure of plaster, stucco, or wax, to serve henceforth for a
                    model by which the measures and proportions of the statue are to be adjusted. In
                    making waxen models, it is common to put half a pound of colophony to a pound of
                    wax; and some add turpentine, melting the whole with oil of olives.</p>
                <p>So much for the first or preparatory steps in this procedure. It remains to
                    consider the manner of working the marble after the model so prepared. The
                    method here followed by the Greeks seems to have been extremely different from
                    that which is generally observed by modern artists. In the ancient statues we
                    find the most striking proofs of the freedom and boldness that accompanied each
                    stroke of the chisel, and which resulted from the artist’s being perfectly sure
                    of the accuracy of his idea, and the precision and steadiness of his hand. The
                    most minute parts of the figure carry these marks of assurance and freedom; no
                    indication of timorousness or diffidence appears, nothing that can induce us to
                    fancy that the artist had occasion to correct any of his strokes. It is
                    difficult to find, even in the second-rate productions of the Grecian artists,
                    any mark of a false stroke or a random touch. This firmness and precision of the
                    Grecian chisel was certainly derived from a more determined and perfect set of
                    rules than those which are observed in modem times.</p>
                <p>The method generally observed by the modem sculptor is as follows. First, out of
                    a great block of marble he saws another of the size required, which is performed
                    with a steel saw without teeth, casting water and sand thereon from time to
                    time; then he fashions it, by taking off what is superfluous with a steel point
                    and a heavy hammer of soft iron; after this, bringing it near the measure
                    required, he reduces it still nearer with another finer point; he then uses a
                    flat cutting instrument, having notches in its edge, and a chisel to take off
                    the scratches which the former has left; till at length, taking rasps of
                    different degrees of fineness, he by degrees brings his work into a condition
                    for polishing.</p>
                <p>After this, having studied his model with all possible attention, he draws upon
                    this model horizontal and perpendicular lines which intersect each other at
                    right angles. He afterwards copies these lines upon his marble, as the painter
                    makes use of such transverse lines to copy a picture, or to reduce it to a
                    smaller size. These transverse lines or squares, drawn in an equal number upon
                    the marble and upon the model, in a manner proportioned to their respective
                    dimensions, exhibit accurate measures of the surfaces upon which the artist is
                    to work; but cannot determine, with equal precision, the depths that are
                    proportioned to these surfaces. The sculptor, indeed, may determine these depths
                    by observing the relation they bear to his model; but as his eye is the only
                    guide he has to follow in this estimate, he is always more or less exposed to
                    error, or at least to doubt. He is never sure that the cavities made by his
                    chisel are exact; a degree of uncertainty accompanies each stroke; nor can he be
                    assured that it has carried away neither too much nor too little of his marble.
                    It is equally difficult to determine, by such lines as have already been
                    mentioned, the external and internal contours of the figure, or to transfer them
                    from the model to the marble. By the internal contour is understood that which
                    is described by the parts which approach towards the centre, and which are not
                    marked in a striking manner.<pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:chi.28490924&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=23" xml:id="kp-eb0720-0023-0013"/> It
                    is further to be noticed, that in a complicated and laborious work, which an
                    artist cannot execute without assistance, he is often obliged to make use of
                    foreign hands, which have not the talents nor the dexterity that are necessary
                    to finish his plan. A single stroke of the chisel that goes too deep is a defect
                    not to be repaired; and such a stroke may easily happen, where the depths are so
                    imperfectly determined. Defects of this kind are inevitable, if the sculptor, in
                    chipping his marble, begins by forming the depths that are requisite in the
                    figure which he designs to represent. Nothing is more liable to error than this
                    manner of proceeding. The cautious artist ought, on the contrary, to form these
                    depths gradually, by little and little, with the utmost circumspection and care;
                    and the determining of them with precision ought to be considered as the last
                    part of his work, and the finishing touches of his chisel.</p>
                <p>The various inconveniences attending this method determined several eminent
                    artists to look out for one that would be liable to less uncertainty, and
                    productive of fewer errors. The French Academy of Painting at Rome devised a
                    method of copying the ancient statues, which some sculptors have employed with
                    success, even in the figures which they finished after models in clay or in wax.
                    This method is as follows. The statue that is to be copied is enclosed in a
                    frame that fits it exactly. The upper part of this frame is divided into a
                    certain number of equal parts, and to each of these parts a thread is fixed with
                    a piece of lead at the end of it. These threads, which hang freely, show what
                    parts of the statue are most removed from the centre with much more perspicuity
                    and precision than the lines which are drawn on its surface, and which pass
                    equally over the higher and hollow parts of the block. They also give the artist
                    a tolerable rule to measure the more striking variations of height and depth,
                    and thus render him more bold and determined in the execution of his plan.</p>
                <p>But even this method is not without its defects. For as it is impossible, by
                    means of a straight line, to determine with precision the procedure of a curve,
                    the artist has, in this method, no certain rule to guide him in his contours;
                    and as often as the line which he is to describe deviates from the direction of
                    plumb-line, which is his main guide, he must necessarily feel himself at a loss,
                    and be obliged to have recourse to conjecture. It is also evident, that this
                    method affords no certain rule to determine exactly the proportion which the
                    various parts of the figure ought to bear to each other, considered in their
                    mutual relation and connections. The artist, indeed, endeavours to supply this
                    defect by intersecting the plumb-lines by horizontal ones. This resource has,
                    nevertheless, its inconveniences, since the squares formed by transverse lines
                    that are at a distance from the figure, although they be exactly equal, yet
                    represent the parts of the figure as greater or smaller, according as they are
                    more or less removed from our position or point of view. But notwithstanding
                    these inconveniences, the method now under consideration is certainly the best
                    that has hitherto been employed. It is surer and more practicable than any other
                    we know, although it appears, from the remarks we have now been making, that it
                    does not exhibit a sure and universal criterion to a sculptor who executes after
                    a model.</p>
                <p>To polish the statue, or make the parts of it smooth and sleek, pumice-stone and
                    smelt are used; then tripoli; and when a still greater lustre is required,
                    burned straw is employed.</p>
