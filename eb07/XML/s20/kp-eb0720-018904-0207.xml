                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra

                <p><label type="entry">SHARP, <hi rend="smallcaps">James</hi></label>, archbishop of
                    St Andrews, was born of a good family in Banffshire in the year 1618. He devoted
                    himself early to the church, and was educated for that purpose in the university
                    of Aberdeen. When the solemn league and covenant was framed in 1638, the learned
                    men in that seminary, and young Sharp in particular, declared themselves
                    decidedly against it. To avoid the insults and indignities to which he was
                    subjected in consequence of this conduct, he retired to England, where he
                    contracted an acquaintance with some of the most celebrated divines in that
                    country.</p>
                <p>At the commencement of the civil wars he returned to Scotland. During his journey
                    thither, he accidentally met with Lord Oxenford, who was so charmed with his
                    conversation that he invited him to his house. While he resided with that
                    nobleman, he became known to the Earl of Rothes, who procured him a
                    professorship at St Andrews. By the interest of the Earl of Crawford, he was
                    soon afterwards appointed minister of Crail, where he conducted himself, it is
                    said, in an exemplary manner.</p>
                <p>Sharp had always inclined to the cause of royalty, and had for some time kept up
                    a correspondence with his exiled prince. After this he began to declare himself
                    more openly, and seems to have enjoyed a great share of the confidence of Monk,
                    who was at that time planning the restoration of Charles II. When that general
                    marched to London, the presbyterians sent Sharp to attend him, in order to
                    support their interests. At the request of General Monk and the chief
                    presbyterians in Scotland, Mr Sharp was sent over to the king at Breda, to
                    procure from him, if possible, the establishment of presbytery. On his return,
                    he assured his friends that “he had found the king very affectionate to
                    Scotland, and resolved not to wrong the settled government of the church; but he
                    apprehended they were mistaken who went about to establish the presbyterian
                    government.”</p>
                <p>Charles was soon afterwards restored without any terms. All the laws passed in
                    Scotland since the year 1633 were repealed; the king and his ministers resolved
                    at all hazards to restore prelacy. Mr Sharp, who had been commissioned by the
                    Scotch presbyterians to manage their interests with the king, was prevailed upon
                    to abandon the party; and as a reward for his compliance, he was made archbishop
                    of St Andrews. This conduct rendered him very odious in Scotland. He was accused
                    of treachery and perfidy, and reproached by his old friends as a traitor and
                    renegade. The absurd and wanton cruelties which were afterwards committed, and
                    which were imputed in a great measure to the archbishop, rendered him still more
                    detested. Nor is it probable that these accusations were without foundation. The
                    very circumstance of his having formerly been of the presbyterian party would
                    induce him, after forsaking them, to treat them with severity. Besides, it is
                    certain, that when, after the rout at Pentland Hills, he received an order from
                    the king to stop the executions, he kept it for some time before he produced it
                    to the council.</p>
                <p>There was one Mitchell, a preacher, and a desperate fanatic, who had formed the
                    design of taking vengeance for these cruelties by assassinating the archbishop.
                    He fired a pistol at him as he was sitting in his coach; but the bishop of
                    Orkney, lifting up his hand at the moment, intercepted the ball. Though this
                    happened in the midst of Edinburgh, the primate was so much detested, that
                    nobody stopped the assassin, who, having walked leisurely home, and thrown off
                    his disguise, returned, and mixed unsuspected with the crowd. Some years
                    afterwards, the archbishop observing a man eyeing him with keenness, suspected
                    that he was the assassin, and ordered him to be brought before him. It was
                    Mitchell. Two loaded pistols were found in his pocket. The primate offered him a
                    pardon if he would confess the crime. The man complied; but Sharp, regardless of
                    his promise, conducted him to the council. The council also gave him a solemn
                    promise of pardon if he would confess nis guilt, and discover his accomplices.
                    They were much disappointed to hear that only one man was privy to his purpose,
                    who was since dead. Mitchell was then brought before a court of justice, and
                    ordered to make a third confession, which he refused. He was imprisoned for
                    several years, and then tried. His own confession was urged against him. It was
                    in vain for him to plead the illegality of that evidence, and to appeal to the
                    promise of pardon previously given. The council took an oath that they had given
                    no such promise, and Mitchell was condemned. Lauderdale, who at that time
                    governed Scotland, would have pardoned him, but the primate insisted on his
                    execution, observing, that if assassins were permitted to go unpunished, his
                    life must be continually in danger. Mitchell was accordingly executed.</p>
                <p>Sharp had a servant, one Carmichael, who by his cruelty had rendered himself
                    particularly odious to the zealots. Nine men formed the resolution of waylaying
                    him in Magus Moor, about three miles from St Andrews. While they were waiting
                    for this man, the primate himself appeared, with very few attendants. This they
                    looked upon as a declaration of heaven in their favour; and calling out, “the
                    Lord has delivered him into our hands,” they ran up to the carriage. They fired
                    at him without effect; a circumstance which was afterwards imputed to magic.
                    They then despatched him with their swords, regardless of the tears and
                    entreaties of his daughter, who accompanied him.</p>
                <p>Thus fell Archbishop Sharp, whose memory is even at present detested by the
                    common people of Scotland. His abilities were certainly good, and in the early
                    part of his life he appears with honour and dignity. But his conduct afterwards
                    was too cruel and insincere to merit approbation. His treatment of Mitchell was
                    mean and vindictive. How far he contributed to the measures adopted against the
                    presbyterians is not certain. They were equally cruel and impolitic; nor did
                    their effects cease with the measures them»<pb break="no"

                    selves. The unheard-of cruelties exercised by the ministers of Charles II.
                    against the adherents of the covenant, raised such a flame of enthusiasm and
                    bigotry as is not yet entirely extinguished.</p>
