                    significant corrections to the OCR text, predominantly in cases of confusing "c"

                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra
                    space around the <gi>pb</gi> tag. Where a word is hyphenated at a <gi>pb</gi>,

                <p><label type="entry">STATIUS, <hi rend="smallcaps">Publius Papinus</hi></label>, a
                    celebrated Latin poct, who was born at Naples, A.n. 61. His father was of a
                    patrician family, but being poor, he maintained himself by teaching rhetoric,
                    first at Naples, and afterwards at Rome. The emperor Domitian is said to have
                    been one of his pupils. He was a master of the Greek as well as the Latin
                    tongue, and was a poet as well as a rhetorician. If we could rely on the
                    statements of his son, he was little inferior to Homer in poetical genius; but
                    as his contemporaries have nowhere noticed him, it may fairly be presumed, that
                    his affection for his father blinded the son’s judgment.</p>
                <p>Statius received his education at Rome, and married at an early age <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">(a.D.</hi> 81) a widow named Claudia, whom he frequently
                    mentions in his verses. He was distinguished by his powers as an improwisatore,
                    which seem to have been very considerable, and he often appeared before the
                    public in the poetical contests of the age. In these he was not unfrequently
                    victorious; yet though crowds flocked to hear the recitation of his Thebaïs,
                    Juvenal, Sat. vii. 87, remarks, that he would have perished from hunger, if he
                    had not been able to sell to the principal actor of the day his tragedy of
                    Agave, which is now lost. His high reputation however excited against him many
                    enemies, and among others Martial, who, it is observed, never took any notice of
                    Statius. The principal poem of Statius is entitled Thebaïs; it is an epic poem
                    in twelve cantos, and a work of considerable merit. It relates to the Theban war
                    under the sons of Oedipus, and is in reality, like that of Silius Ita licus, an
                    historical poem, the materials for which have been drawn principally from Greek
                    sources, more particularly from the Thebaïs of Antimachus. He has taken for his
                    model Virgil’s Aeneid, but has not been very successful in his imitation.
                    Another of his poems is entitled Achilleis, being intended to exhibit a detailed
                    account of the life and deeds of Achilles, from the moment of his birth; but the
                    author did not live to complete his plan, and only two books remain, the last of
                    which is imperfect. This portion contains only a small part of the life of
                    Achilles. We have besides a collection of thirty-two poems, divided into five
                    books, and bearing the title of Silvae. They are mostly in hexameter, but some
                    few in Alcaic, Sapphic, and Phaleucian verse. Having fallen into a feeble state
                    of health, he retired to Naples in the hope of deriving some benefit from his
                    native air. Here he laboured at his Achilleis; but death arrested his progress
                    before he had completed the thirty-sixth year of his age.</p>
                <p>The poems of Statins exhibit nearly the same faults as are to be found in the
                    works of Silius Italicus, and Valerius Flaccus. He possesses the rhetorical
                    spirit of his age, which, disregarding the beauties of simplicity, aimed at
                    effect by ingenious turns of expression, and a display of great learn ing. His
                    language is sometimes bombastic. His works were at one period, not of the most
                    refined taste, held in as great estimation as those of Virgil. The first
                    collective edition of his poems appeared at Venice in 1483, folio. They had been
                    separately printed at an earlier period. The subsequent editions are
                    sufficiently numerous. Among the more elaborate of the early editions, we must
                    mention that of Lindenbrog, Paris. 1600, 4to. It includes the scholia of
                    Lactantius, or Lactatius, on the Thebaïs and Achilleis. Nor must we omit the
                    accurate edition of Gro novius, Amst. 1653, 12mo. The same able critic had
                    previously published “In P. Papinii Statii Silvarum libros v. Diatribe.” Hagae
                    Com. 1637, 8vo. An edition of Statius was not long afterwards published with the
                    very elaborate and learned commentary of Barthius, Cygnae, 1664,2 tom. 4to. The
                    commentator was then dead, and the edition was su perintended by Daumius.
                    Considerable additions were here made to the ancient scholia formerly printed.
                    Another critic to whom this poet has many obligations, is Markland, who
                    published, with notes and emendations, a separate edition of the “Silvarum libri
                    quinque.” Lond. 1728, 4to. Among the attempts at English translation, we may
                    mention Lewie’s version of “The Thebaid of Statius,” Oxford, 1767, 2 vols.
                    8vo.</p>
