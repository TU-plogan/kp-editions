                <p><label type="entry">SENEGAMBIA</label>, a large country of Africa, on the
                    Atlantic Ocean, lying between the rivers Senegal and Gambia, from the mouth of
                    the Nunez to Portendik, with several adjoining districts, and extending from 8°
                    to 18° 20' of north latitude, and from about 5° to 17° 30'30'' of west
                    longitude. It is bounded on the west by the Atlantic Ocean, on the south by
                    Guinea, on the east by Nigritia or Soudan, and on the north by the great desert
                    of Sahara. This fine territory lies upon the western and northern declivities of
                    the mountains of Kong, which here stretch from east to west in some degree
                    parallel with the Gulf of Guinea, and is separated by the great valley of the
                    Quorra or Niger from that part of the northern table or terrace land in which
                    the elevated portion of Africa sinks into Soudan. The interior of this extensive
                    tract of high land, called High Soudan, whose southern limit towards the Gulf of
                    Guinea more especially bears the name of the Kong Mountains, is wholly unknown
                    to us; but its general height is not more than two thousand feet above the level
                    of the sea. It appears to be fine pasture-land, to have an excellent climate,
                    and to support a vast number of African tribes. Surrounding it on the west and
                    north, are those table-lands called the Wildernesses of Jallonkadu, which are
                    only inhabited by wild beasts and reptiles, and through which Mungo Park
                    travelled five days without seeing the face of man. But beyond these to the
                    north and west extends a fertile country, rich in streams, which descend to the
                    coast in a westerly or north-westerly direction. Immediately north from Sierra
                    Leone the fruitful part of the coast is narrow, but enlarges as we proceed in
                    the same direction, especially where the mountains on the middle of the Gambia
                    fall back to the east; and on the Senegal it expands into broad plains, which
                    reach to the foot of the highlands already mentioned. The principal capes upon
                    the coast arc called Verga, Roxo, St Mary, and Verd. The low parts of this tract
                    of country are reckoned amongst the hottest on the globe, the average
                    temperature throughout the year being 63° Fahrenheit; but the heat is of course
                    moderated on the mountainous districts and high table-lands. From November till
                    the end of March is the<pb break="no"

                    dry and healthy season, during which the nights are cool, and the east and
                    north-east winds prevail. Between the dry and the wet season a period intervenes
                    when those terrific visitations, the tornadoes, prevail, and which are in
                    general accompanied by violent thunder-storms. During the rainy season the heat
                    is suffocating and the air loaded with humidity. Bad fevers are then common, and
                    multitudes of insects and crawling vermin swarm in the air and on the ground,
                    the torment and terror of man. Towards the end of the rainy season the harmatta
                    begins to blow from the Sahara, which, although troublesome in itself, dries up
                    the soaked ground, and purifies the air from its pernicious miasmata.</p>
                <p>The mountains of Kong are more rich in water than any other part of Africa. Great
                    numbers of rivers of various sizes descend its declivities, and after traversing
                    large tracts of country, find their embouchure in the Atlantic Ocean. The most
                    important are, the Rio Grande, the Gambia, and the Senegal, each of which is
                    described under its own head; the Rio Nunez, which originates in the high
                    table-lands in the interior, and, without having a very long course, is abundant
                    in water; the Katherine and the Domingo, or the Upper and Lower Geba,
                    originating in the table-land of Mandingo, and forming during its course a large
                    lake, whence a considerable river flows to the sea, where it has deposited an
                    extensive delta. From this point to the embouchure of the Gambia, numerous
                    rivers or arms of the sea intersect the flat coast like net-work, so that
                    between 10° and 14° of north latitude it appears as if partitioned into
                    numberless islands. In front of this maritime tract extends a long bank of sand,
                    out of which the islands called the Bissagos have been formed.</p>
                <p>The inhabitants consist of Moors and Negroes, which races present a remarkable
                    contrast in respect to their physiognomy, hair, colour, manners and customs, and
                    the like. To the last-named people belong the Jallofs, situated between the
                    Senegal and the Gambia. They are a fine specimen of the negro. Their colour is
                    of a deep glossy black, of which they are very proud, and also of their ancient
                    origin. The Mandingoes, who are partly Mahommedans, are situated on the Gambia;
                    but, on account of their trade, they have colonies scattered over the interior
                    of Africa. The Soosoos lie between the sources of the Gambia and the Senegal.
                    The Feloops are scattered along the banks of the Lower Gambia, in Casamansa, and
                    St Domingo. The Serawoollies occupy the kingdoms of Galam and Senegal. The
                    Serreres, or Seraires, are distributed in little republics on the borders of the
                    kingdom of Kayor; and the Rappels are situated on the south side of the St
                    Domingo, and on the Bissagos islands. The Foulahs, on the Senegal, the same race
                    which in Soudan is called the Fellatahs, are not true negroes; they have silken
                    hair, and a reddish or olive complexion. Amongst those tribes which have more
                    recently become known to us, we have to mention the Timmanees, whose principal
                    place is Rokon, on the river Rokelle, some miles distant from the colony of
                    Sierra Leone. From their youth they accustom themselves so much to drinking palm
                    wine, that they get into a relaxed and effeminate state at a very early age. The
                    Koorankas are mixed with the Mandingoes. They go constantly armed, usually with
                    a firelock and dagger. Lastly, the Soolimas are a gay, thoughtless, stirring
                    race, whose principal town is called Falaba, not far from the sources of the
                    rivers Rokelle and Kabba. The principal languages spoken are the Jallof,
                    Mandingo, Serawool, Soosoo, Arabic, Portuguese, and many varying dialects formed
                    out of these.</p>
                <p>In the trade of Senegambia, the English, French, Dutch, Danes, and North
                    Americans participate. The exports consist of slaves, which, however, are of
                    less value than those of Guinea; skins of tigers, and other animals; wax, hides,
                    ivory, gums, cotton, and the like. England obtains ivory and gold from the
                    countries situated between Cape Blanco and Cape Negro, and gives in return such
                    of her own manufactures as are required. The trade in gold amounts to 30,000
                    ounces yearly.</p>
                <p>Of the numerous kingdoms and countries into which the vast territory of
                    Senegambia is partitioned, there will be found described in this work, each
                    under its own head, <hi rend="smallcaps">Βαμβοοκ, Bissagos, Bondoo,</hi> and <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Kajaaga.</hi> There still remain unnoticed a considerable
                    number, of which we shall here present a brief account.</p>
                <p>1. The land of the Foulahs consists of a number of provinces or kingdoms,
                    interspersed throughout the tract comprehended between the mountainous border of
                    the country of Sierra Leone on the west and that of Timbuctoo on the east, as
                    also a large tract on both sides of the Senegal, and several districts on the
                    Gambia; these provinces being insulated from each other in a very remarkable
                    manner. The principal of the Foulah states is that within Sierra Leone, and of
                    which Temboo is the capital. The next in order appears to be that bordering on
                    the south of the Senegal river, and on the Jallofs. Others of less note lie
                    between the rivers Gambia and Falemé; Foola-doo and Brooko are situated along
                    the upper part of the Senegal; Was-sela, beyond the upper part of the Niger; and
                    Massina, lower down on the same river, adjoining Timbuctoo on the west. Amongst
                    other districts belonging to the Foulahs may be mentioned Morfil or Ivory
                    Island, Bilbos, and other islands of the river Senegal. On the former is a
                    French factory, at a place called St Podhor, which is fortified. A trade in gum
                    is here carried on. Not fur from the sources of the Senegal, and three hundred
                    and seventy miles inland, are situated, on the mountains of Kong, the towns of
                    Temboo, which has eight thousand inhabitants, and Ladi, which has five thousand
                    inhabitants. In both are Maraboot schools; and some trade is carried on in iron,
                    silk, and leather. The other towns it is unnecessary to enumerate, nor can the
                    whole number of inhabitants in the land of the Foulahs be ascertained. 2.
                    Ludamar, situated on the borders of the Sahara. It is ruled over by a Moorish
                    king, who resides at Benowm. On the borders of the neighbouring kingdom of
                    Kaarta lies Tsharra, where the unfortunate Houghton met his fate. 3. The land of
                    the Jallofs or Yolofs, comprising four territories or governments, and situated
                    near the sea-coast, in the region between the rivers Senegal and Gambia. This
                    country is rich in provisions, cattle, and poultry, and flourishes under a more
                    regular administration than that of the adjoining states. The people manufacture
                    cotton goods. The chief ruler bears the title of emperor of the Jallofs, and
                    resides at Hikarkor, the principal town. The states separated from the Jallof
                    empire, such as those of Baol and Cayor, are governed by a prince, who bears the
                    title of Damel. 4. Sin, or Barb-Sin, for the most part situated on the north of
                    the Gambia, has a hundred and forty square leagues of territory, and contains
                    sixty thousand inhabitants. The regent, who is called Boor, has his principal
                    seat at Joal, a seaport, formed by the mouth of the river of that name. There is
                    a trade carried on in cattle, poultry, rice, slaves, wax, hides, and ivory. <hi
                    rend="italic">5.</hi> Boorsali, or Salum, situated on a river of the same name,
                    which discharges itself into the Atlantic in latitude 13° 44' north. It
                    comprehends a surface of 1500 square miles, and contains 300,000 inhabitants.
                    The principal place, and the residence of the king, is called Calyoon. Upon the
                    Gambia are situated Kahan or Cahon, and Cower or Kayee, where cotton-weaving is
                    carried on. 6. Bar or Barrah, situated at the mouth of the Gambia, has an area
                    of 700 square miles, and contains 200,000 inhabitants, who arc Mahommedans.
                    There are here public schools, so that it must have risen above the barbarism of
                    most of the surrounding states. The country is tributary to Salum, and is
                    governed by regents of circumscribed authority. The principal town is called
                    Ba-<pb break="no" facs="ht:chi.28490924&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=108"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0720-0108-0094"/> rinding; the others are Albreda, on the river
                    Gambia, which has 7000 inhabitants, and Jellifree, on the same river, a
                    Portuguese settlement, where there is also an English factory. Salt is the
                    principal article of trade. 7. Badiboo, situated to the east of the former, on
                    the right bank of the Gambia, is about 600 square miles in extent. The capital
                    is a small place of the same name. The population of the country may amount to
                    150,000. 8. Yani, also situated on the Gambia. The chief towns are Pisania,
                    where there is an English factory, and Jonkadouda, where are several other
                    European factories. There is a trade carried on in gold, ivory, and other
                    products of the country. 9. Wally, or Bembook, is situated to the east of the
                    former, and is rich in wood, corn, rice, garden-stuffs, cotton, indigo, cattle,
                    and fish. Malchme is the chief town, where resides the king, who exercises a
                    limited sovereignty. 10. Wooli, a Mandigo kingdom, extends along the northern
                    bank of Gambia, between Salum and Bondoo. The country is generally covered with
                    extensive woods; the soil is everywhere fertile, producing cotton, tobacco, and
                    esculent vegetables; and there are a number of towns situated in the valleys,
                    which are the tracts chiefly cultivated. Medina, the capital, is a walled town,
                    the residence of the king and state officers. It does not appear that this is a
                    place of any considerable trade. 11. Gedumah, situated on the northern bank of
                    the Senegal, and inhabited by nomadic Moors, who here find pasture for their
                    cattle. It appears to be destitute of either town or village. 12. Combo, Foini,
                    Caen, Jemaroa, Tom-mani, and Kolar, are the names of small kingdoms or
                    territories, generally productive in rice, wax, goats, poultry, and the like,
                    and in the principal towns of which are European factories. 13. The land of the
                    Soosoos, which is situated between the sources and head waters of the Senegal
                    and Gambia. This country is inhabited by an active race of men, who appear to
                    live under a monarchy. From the conflicting statements of travellers and
                    geographers, it seems doubtful if these people do not form a part of the
                    Foulahs. 14. The land of the Fel∞ps, situated upon the banks of the Casamanza,
                    and on the upper course of the Vintain, is about twenty-five leagues in length
                    by fifteen in breadth. The country is very fertile, and the inhabitants rear
                    cattle, which they defend with much courage against lions and other wild
                    animals, with which their forests abound. Rice, goats, poultry, bees’ wax, and
                    honey, are abundant, and partly exported. The population may amount to fifty
                    thousand, who inhabit about sixty villages. 15. Kaboo is a territory situated on
                    the upper part of the rivers St Domingo and Geba. It is subject to a king, who
                    trades with the Portuguese in slaves, gold, and ivory. His residence, which is
                    in the chief town, lies on the lake from which the river Geba flows. The
                    Portuguese have here a settlement. Kaboo is very fertile in rice, millet, maize,
                    indigo, and cotton. It is inhabited by a mixture of nations, chiefly Pagan
                    Mandingoes, whose language prevails. 16. The important kingdom of Foota Torra,
                    which extends considerably both to the north and south of the middle Senegal,
                    but whose interior has not yet been explored by Europeans. There are a number of
                    other kingdoms or territories in Senegambia, but they do not require particular
                    notice. The most distinguished are the kingdom of Jallonkadoo, in which the
                    river Senegal takes its rise; and the kingdom of Soolimana, which extends along
                    the rocky Rokelle, and the Camaranca and Mungo.</p>
                <p>Besides those places we have mentioned as possessing European factories, the
                    English, French, and Portuguese have also settlements. The English have
                    factories on the rich gum coast at Portendik, to the north of the Senegal; the
                    island of James, situated a few miles from the mouth of the Gambia, with the
                    fort of the same name; the island of Boolam, with a secure and spacious harbour,
                    and formerly one of the Sierra Leone Company’s stations, for promoting
                    civilization amongst the Indians, for assisting in putting down the slave-trade,
                    and for cultivating West Indian products; and the island of St Maria, on the
                    Gambia, with twelve thousand inhabitants.</p>
                <p>The French possess the island of St Louis or Senegal, at the mouth of the river
                    of the same name, with 16,130 inhabitants, and the Fort St Louis, whence ships
                    proceed on their voyage up the Senegal; but navigation is very much embarrassed
                    by a dangerous bank across the mouth of the river. The trade between this place
                    and the mother country was at one time very considerable, amounting to L.750,000
                    annually; and the English disposed of an equal amount of goods on the Gambia. At
                    the French settlement a considerable quantity of cotton is still grown, and gum
                    collected. The names of the other places are, the island of Goree, which is
                    separated from the mainland by the canal of Dakar, 1500 toises in breadth. It is
                    a great basaltic rock, with a town upon it, which bears the same name, and a
                    fort, which bears that of St Michael. The French have also in the neighbourhood
                    of Cape Verd a place called Riofresco. On the left bank of the Senegal is the
                    settlement of Bakel, a hundred and five miles from St Louis, to which there is a
                    steam-boat sent annually with goods. There are, besides, St Charles, formerly
                    called Fort St Joseph; and the islands of Babaghee, Safal, and Geber.</p>
                <p>The Portuguese possess St Cachao or Cacheu, situated on the north-east of the
                    island of Bassao, at the mouth of the river St Domingo, in the kingdom of
                    Koombo. It is fortified, has a Catholic church and a monastery, is the seat of a
                    Portuguese governor, trades with the Cape Verd and Azore Islands, and contains
                    8000 inhabitants. The Portuguese also possess the island of Bissago, and the
                    posts of Farim, Zeguichor, and Geba, which belong to the government of Cape
                    Verd. (<hi rend="smallcaps">r</hi>. <hi rend="smallcaps">r</hi>. <hi
