                <p><label type="entry">SKINNER, <hi rend="smallcaps">John</hi></label>, a poet and
                    theologian, was born at Balfour in the parish of Birse and county of Aberdeen,
                    on the third day of October 1721. His father, who bore the same name, was master
                    of the parochial school, and had married Jane the widow of Donald Farquharson,
                    Esq. of Balfour, grandfather to the late Dr. Farquharson of Edinburgh. The
                    mother, whose maiden name was Gillanders, died about two years after the birth
                    of this their only son; and Mr. Skinner afterwards removed to the parish of
                    Echt, at the distance of about twelve miles from Aberdeen. Here he continued for
                    fifty years to discharge the duties of a schoolmaster, “to the entire
                    satisfaction of many persons of distinction, whose sons were entrusted to his
                    care and tuition; and so great was his diligence in the line of his profession,
                    that he fitted out more young men for the university, than most country
                    schoolmasters of his day.” After having continued a widower for several years,
                    he contracted a second marriage, and had a numerous family. His youngest son,
                    Mr. James Skinner, a solicitor of Edinburgh, still survives, and has reached a
                    very advanced age.</p>
                <p>For the rudiments of learning, John was indebted to his father’s school, where he
                    made rapid progress in the acquisition of the Latin language. At the early age
                    of thirteen, he was emboldened to present himself at the annual competition in
                    Marischal College; and there he gained a considerable <hi rend="italic"
                    >bursary,</hi> or exhibition, which served to defray a great proportion of his
                    expenses during the four years of his academical course. After the completion of
                    this period, he was for a few months employed as a teacher in Kemnay school;
                    from which he transferred his services to the adjoining parish of Monymusk, as
                    an assistant to the schoolmaster. Lady Grant, admiring some of his poetical
                    effusions in the Scotish dialect, “was pleased to encourage his rustic muse, by
                    affording him in the house of Monymusk every accommodation for prosecuting his
                    studies, and improving his mind in the attainment of useful learning. Here it
                    was, that enjoying the conversation, and the benefit of reading under the
                    direction of a worthy episcopal clergyman in that neighbourhood, he became a
                    convert to the principles of episcopacy, and united himself to the venerable
                    remains of the old established church of Scotland.” This <hi rend="italic"
                    >venerable</hi> church was, at that period, chiefly distinguished by a narrow
                    bigotry in politics, as well as religion. In the month of June 1740, he became
                    tutor to the only son of Mr. Sinclair of Scalloway, a gentleman of considerable
                    property in Zetland. Here he only resided for about twelve months, the death of
                    his pupil’s father having occasioned another arrangement. He honoured his memory
                    by an English elegy and a Latin epitaph, both of which were printed by Ruddiman.
                    Here he became intimately acquainted with Mr. Hunter, the only episcopal
                    clergyman in those islands, who not only assisted him in<pb break="no"

                    his theological studies, but likewise bestowed upon him the hand of his eldest
                    daughter; “and with her the best of all earthly blessings, a sweetly soothing
                    affectionate wife, who was his dear companion, and ministered tenderly to all
                    his wants, for the uncommon space of fifty-eight years.” This marriage must have
                    taken place when he had scarcely attained the twentieth year of his age.</p>
                <p>Having now returned to Aberdeenshire, and made some further preparation, he
                    received ordination from Bishop Dunbar, who resided at Peterhead. In November
                    1742 he fixed his residence at Linshart in the parish of Longside, as minister
                    of a congregation which bis biographer describes as large and respectable.<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>During the following year, he
                    wrote a Latin elegy on the death of Bishop Rattray, which appeared in a small
                    publication entitled “A Letter to a Friend: with two Poems sacred to the memory
                    of the late R. R. Dr. Thomas Rattray of Craighall, Bisbop of Edinburgh.” Edinb.
                    1743, 4to. The letter was also written by Skinner. This elegy is followed by an
                    English poem, written by a different person.</p></note> It is not however to be
                    supposed that his stipend was very ample. The rebellion, which ensued in 1745,
                    exposed him to no small annoyance. The episcopal clergy were very generally
                    disaffected to the existing government, and many of them were subjected to
                    useless severities. On returning home one evening, Mr. Skinner “found his house
                    in the possession of a military party; some of them guarding the door with fixed
                    bayonets, and others searching the several apartments, even the bedchamber where
                    Mrs. Skinner was lying-in of her filth child, and little able to bear such a
                    rude unseasonable visit. No lenity was to be looked for from such unfeeling
                    visitors, who pillaged the house of every thing they could carry with them,
                    hardly leaving a change of linen to father, mother, or child in the family. The
                    chapel with all its furniture was destroyed; and for several years the
                    congregation could find no place to meet in for public worship but the
                    clergyman’s house, which not being sufficiently large, many of them were obliged
                    to stand in the open air, during divine service.” Of this miserable species of
                    persecution, it is not easy to devise any plausible justification. The
                    episcopalians of Longside, even if we suppose all of them to have been the most
                    decided Jacobites, certainly could not convert their chapel to any political or
                    military purpose; nor is it very obvious how this mode of treatment could have
                    any tendency to increase their attachment to the reigning family. With the view
                    of preventing his flock from being scattered from the true fold, he now prepared
                    a small tract, entitled “A Preservative against Presbytery,” which was printed
                    in the year 1746.</p>
                <p>In the course of the same year, an act of parliament enjoined the episcopal
                    clergy to register their letters of orders before the first day of September;
                    after which date, it was provided that none should be admitted for registration,
                    except such as had been obtained from a bishop of the church of England or of
                    Ireland. And another act, passed two years afterwards, declared that no letters
                    of orders, unless such as were granted by bishops of those churches, should
                    after the 29th of September be sufficient to qualify any minister of an
                    episcopalian meeting. From such vexatious and unavailing regulations as these,
                    many hardships must have resulted, and Skinner seems to have experienced his
                    full share. In 1753 he was apprehended under the authority of a warrant from the
                    sheriff-substitute of the county; nor did he hesitate to make a voluntary
                    confession that he had violated the recent act, by officiating as a clergyman to
                    more than four persons, beside the members of his own family. For this offence
                    he was sentenced to six months imprisonment. His wife, with her six children,
                    were in the mean time kindly treated by the good people of Longside. The
                    solitude of his prison was enlivened by the visits of some faithful friends, to
                    whom he was likewise indebted for a liberal supply of books. His literary ardour
                    did not suffer any abatement; and he frequently declared that no six months of
                    his life had ever passed with so little interruption to his studies and
                    improvement. In the exercise of his poetical talents he found a pleasing
                    recreation, but his attention was chiefly directed to more serious pursuits.</p>
                <p>For several years he had devoted much of his leisure to the study of the Hebrew
                    language; and during his prison hours he formed the design of his Dissertation
                    on the Shechinah, which appeared amongst his posthumous works. In the year 1757
                    he published at London “A Dissertation on Jacob’s Prophecy, Genesis xix. 10.”
                    According to his interpretation, this prophecy denotes “that the <hi
                    rend="italic">tribeship</hi> should not depart from Judah, nor a <hi
                    rend="italic">typifer</hi> from between his feet, or from among his descendants,
                    till Shiloh (the Messiah) should come, and till the gathering of the people
                    should be to him.” This explanation, we are informed, was highly approved by
                    Bishop Sherlock, and by other biblical critics of acknowledged eminence. His
                    next work was of a different denomination. Mr. Sievwright, an episcopal minister
                    of Brechin, published a somewhat curious volume, exposing the principles and
                    practices of his nonjuring brethren.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    Minister to the authorised Episcopal Congregation in Brechin. Edinb. 1767
                    12mo.</p></note> It appeared in 1767, and Mr. Skinner soon afterwards published,
                    but without his name, “A Letter to Norman Sievwright, M.A., in Vindication of
                    the Episcopal Clergy of Scotland from his Charge of Innovations in Politics and
                    Religion.” Of his next publication, neither the date nor the precise title is
                    mentioned by his biographer. It however assumed the form of an answer to an
                    Enquiry into the Powers of Ecclesiastics, on the Principles of Scripture and
                    Reason, written by the Rev. Thomas Gordon, minister of Speymouth.</p>
                <p>This was followed by a more elaborate work, “An Ecclesiastical History of
                    Scotland, from the first appearance of Christianity in that kingdom, to the
                    present time: with remarks on the most important occurrences. In a Series of
                    Letters to a Friend.” Lend. 1788, 2 vols. 8vo. Prefixed is a dedication, in
                    Latin verse, to his son the bishop. The value of this work is far from being
                    considerable. It is written in a spirit too sectarian, and in a style too
                    provincial. Many facts are very inaccurately stated. Thus he asserts that with
                    the exception of Dr. Featley, no episcopalian divine ever sat in the Westminster
                    assembly. According to this ecclesiastical historian, the praise of Archbishop
                    Laud “is and ever will be in the English church.” A man who could thus bestow
                    commendation on a merciless bigot, is not to be admired for his wisdom or
                    moderation. Nothing is so apt as bigotry to blind a man’s understanding, and to
                    suppress the best feelings of his heart. In the nefarious sentence of death
                    pronounced on the earl of Argyle for adding an explanation when he took the
                    test-oath, Mr. Skinner finds nothing to condemn. According to the same
                    authority, King James’s attachment to popery was acknowledged by his greatest
                    enemies to be the only blemish of his character. The sufferings of the episcopal
                    clergy after the Revolution are commemorated in terms sufficiently tragical; but
                    the bloody persecution of the presbyterians during the reign of Charles the
                    Second is represented as a very trivial matter; and it seems to have been the
                    author’s deliberate opinion, that they were treated neither better nor worse
                    than they deserved. A very different opinion was entertained<pb break="no"

                    by a more impartial, as well as a more able writer. “Scotland,” says Jonathan
                    Edwards, “has also been the scene, for many years together, of cruelties and
                    blood by the hands of high-churchmen, such as came very little short of the
                    popish persecution in Queen Mary’s days, and in many things much exceeded
                    it.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Edwards’s History
                    of the Work of Redemption, p. 291. Edinb. 1771, 8vo</p></note> Mr. Skinner is
                    lively where he is not edifying or instructive; and if he is here entitled to
                    any other praise, it is that of supplying an account of his own sect from the
                    era of the Revolution. A supplementary volume, under the title of “Annals of
                    Scottish Episcopacy,” was published at Edinburgh in 1818 by the author’s
                    grandson the Rev. John Skinner of Forfar.</p>
                <p>Towards the close of the century, he published “a Letter to the Congregation of
                    the Chapel of Old Deer and “Some plain Remarks on a plain Account of Conversion,
                    now in circulation through the Parish and Neighbourhood of Old Deer.” This last
                    tract, printed in 1799, is directed against William Ward, A.M., a clergyman of
                    the church of England. He continued to augment his stores of theological
                    learning, and undertook some more laborious works, which were not however
                    published till after the death of the author. His name was favourably known to
                    many distinguished individuals in England, as well as Scotland. As a poet, he
                    corresponded with Bums; as a man of erudition, with Doig. The master of Stirling
                    school and the minister of Longside chapel were both remarkable men in their
                    generation; and to those who complain of the want of leisure, opportunities, and
                    encouragement in the pursuit of learning, their history supplies a most edifying
                    example. During the summer of 1795, Dr. Doig and Mr. Ramsay of Ochtertyre paid
                    him a visit; and he spent a delightful week with them at Peterhead, which was
                    then a watering place of fashionable resort.</p>
                <p>Of the activity, as well as the benevolence of his disposition, he exhibited a
                    signal proof by devoting a portion of his time to the study of physic, not for
                    his own benefit, but for that of his poor neighbours, whether episcopalians or
                    presbyterians. “Nor was it only to those,” says his biographer, “who were placed
                    more immediately under bis pastoral care, that his benevolence was extended.
                    Though he always considered them as entitled to his first and principal concern,
                    yet did he never feel himself more happily employed, than when administering
                    relief to the distresses, whether bodily or mental, of all that were within his
                    reach, and would listen to his advice, whatever might be their religious
                    profession. As no medical practitioner resided within four or five miles of
                    Longside, soon after his settlement there, Mr. Skinner’s sympathy was often
                    excited by perceiving his neighbours suffering under a want, of which the state
                    of the country afforded no prospect of a regular supply. He resolved therefore
                    to devote part of his own time to the study of physic; and with the aid of an
                    eminent physician in Aberdeen [Dr. Thomas Livingston], who approved of his
                    design, and felt the force of the motives from which it sprung, he soon acquired
                    such a knowledge of the healing art, as enabled him to afford to the poor,
                    labouring under disease, that relief which they could not otherwise have easily
                    obtained, and the want of which might sometimes have proved fatal. It is proper
                    to add, that for his medical prescriptions he accepted no fees.”</p>
                <p>During the autumn of 1799 he had the heavy misfortune to lose his wife. This was
                    a loss which could not be repaired; and at length, when the weight of age
                    pressed more heavily upon him, his only surviving son Bishop Skinner invited him
                    to spend the remainder of his days under his roof. He accordingly removed to
                    Aberdeen on the 4th of June 1807, and for about eight days he apparently enjoyed
                    his usual health and spirits. Some feverish symptoms, with a difficulty of
                    respiration, afterwards supervened: but during the last day of his life, he
                    moved into the garden, when finding his strength to be totally impaired, and
                    having with much difficulty been supported into the house, he was placed in a
                    chair, and calmly closing his eyes, expired without a groan or a struggle. He
                    thus departed on the 16th of June, in the eighty-sixth year of his age. In
                    compliance with his own request, his remains were interred in the church-yard of
                    Longside, in the same grave with those of his wife. A marble tablet was there
                    erected by the members of his congregation, by whom his memory was much
                    revered.</p>
                <p>Skinner appears to have been a man of a cheerful and friendly disposition; and in
                    the discharge of his pastoral duties, he is represented as very exemplary.
                    During the greater part of his professional life, it was not his practice to
                    commit his discourses to writing, but he nevertheless preached with much ease
                    and fluency. His opinions were deeply tinctured with the Hutchinsonian
                    philosophy. To a lively fancy he added no despicable share of learning. He had
                    cultivated not only a knowledge of the Latin and Greek, but likewise of the
                    Hebrew language. In the composition of Latin verse he had attained to great
                    facility, and to considerable skfll. The longest of his poems is a Latin version
                    of the Batrachomyomachia ascribed to Homer. He likewise translated Christis Kirk
                    of the Grcne, a Scotish poem remarkable for its genuine humour. The measure
                    which he has here adopted, hexameter and pentameter verse, is not peculiarly
                    suited to so familiar and ludicrous a subject: iambics would certainly have been
                    more appropriate. Some of his Scotish poems are written in a pleasant strain,
                    and three of his songs, Tullochgorum, John o’ Ba-denyon, and the Ewie wi’ the
                    crookit Horn, have obtained a great share of popularity.</p>
                <p>Not long after his death appeared “Theological Works of the late Rev. John
                    Skinner, Episcopal Clergyman in Longside, Aberdeenshire. To which is prefixed a
                    biographical memoir of the author.” Aberdeen, 1809, 2 vols. 8vo. This
                    publication was accompanied or immediately followed by “A miscellaneous
                    Collection of Fugitive Pieces of Poetry,&amp;c. Vol. III. of his Posthumous
                    Works.” Edinburgh, 1809∙ A separate edition of his poems was published under the
                    title of “Amusements of Leisure Hours: or, Poetical Pieces, chiefly in the
                    Scottish dialect.” Edinburgh, 1809, 12mo. A copious life of the author,
                    evidently written by his son, is prefixed to the theological works. The first
                    volume likewise includes a series of “Letters addressed to Candidates for Holy
                    Orders in the <hi rend="italic">Episcopal church of Scotland”</hi> The second
                    contains “A Dissertation on the Shechinah, or Divine Presence with the Church or
                    People of God,” “An Essay towards a literal or true radical Exposition of the
                    Song of Songs, which is Solomon’s,” and “Psalms viii., xxiii., and xlv.
                    translated into Latin verse.” In his Essay he strenuously maintains the opinion
                    of those who regard the Song of Solomon as an inspired book. Of the value of his
                    Dissertation, some notion may perhaps be formed from a single specimen. The
                    divine presence, says this learned theologian, “is not now to be looked for, but
                    in the way of God’s own divine appointment, and under the sacred symbols of
                    bread and wine, set apart and instituted for that very purpose by Christ
                    himself. . . . And if Corah and his company met with so signal and sudden a
                    punishment for invading but a part of Aaron’s office, of how much sorer
                    punishment shall they be thought worthy, as St. Paul argues in a like case, who
                    dare thrust themselves, without any call, order, or commission, into the
                    ministry of the Christian priesthood, and will take upon them to consecrate the
                    symbols of the divine presence, and to stand as priests between God and the
                    people? It is no wonder that such unruly invaders of the priesthood should do
                    what they can to bring the sacrament of the divine presence into contempt<pb
                    break="no" facs="ht:chi.28490924&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=442"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0720-0442-0380"/> and should refuse to appear in any posture of
                    adoration before it, since they cannot but know that God will not vouchsafe to
                    be present in it, but in the way and method of his own appointment.” According
                    to this pure and enlightened theology, the divine presence, utterly withheld
                    from all non-episcopalian assemblies of worshippers, is regularly manifested
                    wherever a popish or half-popish priest “offers the unbloody sacrifice.” It is
                    truly pitiful that any man, calling himself a protestant, should be so besotted
                    as to represent all this as the way and method of God’s own appointment. It is
                    the very essence of such an adulterated form of Christianity, that, without the
                    supplementary aid of bishops and priests, Christ has died in vain, and in vain
                    has risen from the dead. (x.)</p>
