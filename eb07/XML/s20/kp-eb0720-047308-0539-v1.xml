                <p><label type="entry">SOLON</label>, one of the seven wise men of Greece, was born
                    at Salamis, of Athenian parente, who were descended from Codrus. His father
                    leaving little patrimony, he had recourse to merchandise for his subsistence. He
                    had, however, a greater thirst after knowledge and fame than after riches, and
                    made his mercantile voyages subservient to the increase of his intellectual
                    treasures. He very early cultivated the art of poetry, and applied himself to
                    the study of moral and civil wisdom. When the Athenians, tired out with a long
                    and troublesome war with the Megarensians, for the recovery of the isle of
                    Salamis, prohibited any one, under pain of death, to propose the renewal of
                    their claim to that island, Solon thinking the prohibition dishonourable to the
                    state, and finding many of the younger citizens desirous to revive the war,
                    feigned himself mad, and took care to have the report of his insanity spread
                    through the city. In the mean time he composed an elegy adapted to the state of
                    public affairs, and committed it to memory. Every thing being thus prepared, he
                    sallied forth into the market-place with the kind of cap on his head which was
                    commonly worn by sick persons, and ascending the herald’s stand, he delivered,
                    to a numerous crowd, his lamentation for the desertion of Salamis. The verses
                    were heard with general applause; Pisistratus seconded his advice, and urged the
                    people to renew the war. The decree was immediately repealed; the claim to
                    Salamis was resumed; and the conduct of the war was committed to Solon and
                    Pisistratus, who by means of a stratagem defeated the Megarensians and recovered
                    the island.</p>
                <p>His popularity was extended through Greece in consequence of a successful
                    alliance which he formed among the states in defence of the temple at Delphi
                    against the Cirrhaeans. When dissensions had arisen at Athens between the rich
                    creditors and their poor debtors, Solon was created archon, with the united
                    power of supreme legislator and magistrate. He soon restored harmony between the
                    rich and poor. He cancelled the debts which had proved the occasion of so much
                    oppression; and ordained that in future no creditor should be allowed to seize
                    the body of the debtor for his security. He made a new distribution of the
                    people, instituted new courts of judicature, and framed a judicious code of
                    laws, which afterwards became the basis of the laws of the twelve Tables in
                    Rome. Among his criminal laws are many wise and excellent regulations; but the
                    code is necessarily defective with respect to those principles which must be
                    derived from the knowledge of the true God, and of pure morality, as the certain
                    foundations of national happiness. Two of them in particular were very
                    exceptionable; the permission of a voluntary exile to persons that had been
                    guilty of premeditated murder, and the appointment of a less severe punishment
                    for a rape than for seduction. Those who wish to see accurately stated the
                    comparative excellence of the laws of Moses, of Lycurgus, and Solon, may consult
                    the prize Dissertations relative to natural and revealed religion, published by
                    the Teylerian Society of Haarlem, vol. ix.</p>
                <p>The interview which Solon is said to have had with Croesus king of Lydia; the
                    solid remarks of the sage after surveying the monarch’s wealth; the recollection
                    of those remarks by Croesus when doomed to die, and the noble conduct of Cyrus
                    on that occasion, are known to every schoolboy. Solon died in the island of
                    Cyprus at a very advanced age. Statues were erected to his memory both at Athens
                    and in Salamis. His thirst after knowledge continued to the last: “I grow old,’’
                    said he, “learning many things.” Among the apophthegms and precepts which have
                    been ascribed to Solon, are the following: Laws are like cobwebs, that entangle
                    the weak, but are broken by the strong. He who has learned to obey, will know
                    how to command. In all things let reason be your guide. Diligently contemplate
                    excellent things. In every thing that you do, consider the end.</p>
                <p>The chronology of his life is involved in no small obscurity. His legislation
                    may, with some degree of confidence, be referred to the year 594 before Christ;
                    but, as a very learned and able chronologer has remarked, since both his age and
                    the time of his death are doubtful, nothing can be with certainty affirmed of
                    the year of his<pb break="no" facs="ht:chi.28490924&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=540"

                    According to Laertius, he died at the age of eighty; but Lucian extends his life
                    to one hundred years. Of the poems of Solon, an elaborate edition has recently
                    been published by Bach, under the title of “Solonis Atheniensis Carminum quae
                    supersunt.” Bonnae, 1825, 8vo.</p>
