                <p><label type="entry">SUNDERLAND</label>, a large and important seaport town on the
                    east coast of England, in the county of Durham, 268 miles from London by way of
                    Stockton. The municipal boundary includes the townships of Monkwearmouth,
                    Bishopwearmouth, and Southwick, which form an area of 5095 acres. The river
                    Wear, after running through the centre of the borough, falls into the sea.
                    Sunderland proper is situated on the south or right side of the river, and is

                    xml:id="kp-eb0720-0956-0810"/> place of considerable antiquity. At the latter
                    end of the twelfth century it received a charter from Bishop Pudsey, which gave
                    it equal privileges with those enjoyed by Newcastle, and from that time it has
                    risen into importance. The town consists of one long street, under the names of
                    Sunderland High Street and Bishopwearmouth High Street, and the two together
                    extend to nearly a mile in length. This continued street is broad, well built,
                    having many respectable shops, and in it are the principal buildings. With this
                    exception, Sunderland presents the appearance of one mass of small houses, of
                    considerable age, crowded together, with interstices of narrow streets and
                    lanes; and here the population is extremely dense. To this crowded state of the
                    population, together with the want of cleanliness, may be traced the fearful
                    ravages of the cholera in 1832, which first broke out in England at this port.
                    On the outskirts of the town there are some good streets, which are rapidly
                    extending, with excellent houses, and in them the higher class of the
                    inhabitants reside. There are various well frequented literary institutions in
                    the town, to most of which libraries are attached. It contains numerous
                    charitable institutions, which are liberally supported. The great object of
                    interest is the magnificent iron bridge which crosses the Wear, and connects
                    Sunderland with Monkwearmouth. It consists of a single arch of 236 feet in span,
                    formed by small segments of iron, having a height of upwards of 100 feet from
                    the centre of the arch to the surface of the river at low water, which enables
                    vessels of above 300 tons burden to pass under by merely lowering their
                    top-gallants. The projector of the bridge was Rowland Burdon, Esq. of this
                    neighbourhood, who subscribed L.23,000 out of the L.27,000 which it cost. The
                    harbour is constructed at the mouth of the river, by means of two piers of more
                    than 200 yards in length, which form a beautiful promenade. It is defended by a
                    battery, near to which are extensive brick barracks, capable of holding 2000
                    men. At the end of the north pier there is a lighthouse. The water in the
                    harbour is too shallow to admit large vessels, and they are loaded and
                    discharged by means of large boats locally called keels. Great advantages have
                    been gained by the formation of a railway, running through the eastern part of
                    the town, in the direction of the low quay; by which means the coals and other
                    products of the interior are more easily and expeditiously shipped than higher
                    up the river, where great inconvenience was frequently experienced from its
                    crowded state above the existing staiths where the coals are kept. The trade,
                    which is principally in the building of vessels and shipment of coals, is on the
                    increase. Of the former, a hundred can be laid on the stocks at the same time;
                    and when it is mentioned that there are upwards of thirty yards for building
                    ships, five for small craft, and four dry and floating docks, besides a large
                    basin or dock, which is constructed on the left bank, near the mouth of the
                    river, the shipping interest of the port must appear to be of great value. In
                    the year 1836 the number of ships which left the port was 994, with a tonnage of
                    153,415; and in 1837 they had increased to 1338, with a tonnage of 193,133. The
                    coal-trade employs many vessels and hands. It is calculated that upwards of 2000
                    seamen belonging to the town are occupied in the trade, besides those employed
                    in the keels. The quantity of coals shipped for home consumption in 1836 was
                    971,190 tons; for foreign consumption, 170,367 tons. In 1837 the quantity for
                    home use was 931,944 tons; for foreign, 242,252 tons. In addition to those
                    important branches of industry, there are several extensive manufactories for
                    chain-cables, ropes, sail-cloths, salt, glass, and pottery. Lime also forms a
                    considerable part of the trade, upwards of 40,000 tons being annually shipped.
                    The value of the custom-duty received at this port for the year 1836, after
                    deducting all expenses, amounted to L.71,637, and lor the year 1837 L.80,072.
                    The municipal govemment of the borough is vested in a mayor, fourteen aldermen,
                    and forty-one councillors, and it is divided into seven wards. The borough
                    returns two members to parliament. In 1821 the population of Sunderland alone
                    amounted to 14,725, and in 1831 to 17,060. In 1821 the conjoined population
                    amounted to 31,891, and in 1831 to 40,735.</p>
