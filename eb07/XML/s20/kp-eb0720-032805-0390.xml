                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra

                <p><label type="entry">SIDDONS, <hi rend="smallcaps">Mrs</hi></label>. (whose maiden
                    name was Sarah Kemble,) the greatest actress that ever trode the stage, was born
                    at Brecon, in South Wales, on the 5th of July 1755. Roger Kemble, her father,
                    was manager of a provincial company of players, and amongst this class of
                    persons he seems to have held a highly respectable rank. Sarah, who was his
                    eldest daughter, appeared very early on the stage, and went the usual round of
                    juvenile characters without exciting much expectation. At the age of eighteen
                    she married Mr Siddons, an actor in her father’s company, soon after which event
                    she removed to Cheltenham, where she attracted some attention, and was
                    recommended to Garrick. Her first appearance on the London boards was not
                    successful, simply because she never had a proper part assigned her. Mrs.
                    Siddons accordingly returned to the provinces much mortified; but the praises
                    showered upon her by such audiences as those of York, Manchester, and Bath,
                    induced the managers of Drury Lane to re-invite her to the metropolis. Her
                    reappearance took place on the 10th of October 1782. The character which she
                    chose was that of Isabella in “The Fatal Marriage.” The effect of that
                    performance was extraordinary and unparalleled. It gave a shock of wonder and
                    delight to the public mind, like the news of some great and unexpected victory.
                    On that night, Mrs. Siddons at once took possession of the tragic throne, on
                    which, for thirty years, she reigned without a rival. Some idea of the
                    excitement which she created may be learned from the fact, that “the grave and
                    reverend seignors” of the English bar presented her with a purse of one hundred
                    guineas. During the season, Mrs. Siddons played <hi rend="italic">Euphrasia,
                    Jane Shore, Calista,</hi> and, for her two benefits, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Belvidera</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Zara.</hi> In all of these characters she
                    greatly added to her fame; the public were astonished at the vastness of her
                    powers, and tragedy became the fashion. In subsequent seasons she encreased her
                    circle of characters, adding from shakespeare those of <hi rend="italic">Lady
                    Macbeth, Constance, Isabella, Queen Katherine,</hi> (the most chaste, beautiful,
                    and perfect performance that ever drew a tear,) <hi rend="italic">Rosalind,</hi>
                    (not in her line, for she was altogether too stately and heroic for comedy,) <hi
                    rend="italic">Desdemona, Volumnia, Portia, Hermione, Imogene,</hi> and a few
                    others. This list shows, that her range was surprising, but she was not equally
                    excellent in all her parts. Her comedy never gave great satisfaction, although
                    there was occasionally much to admire in it. When the metropolitan season
                    closed, it was the custom of this, as it is of every great actor, to visit the
                    principal cities of Ireland, Scotland, and the provinces of England. Every where
                    she enchanted the lovers of the drama. She became a favourite with their
                    majesties, and was in the habit of reading plays to them, an occupation of more
                    honour than emolument. However, Mrs. Siddons. by her professional exertions,
                    realized a for-<pb break="no" facs="ht:chi.28490924&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=391"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0720-0391-0329"/> tune equal to her wishes, and retired from the
                    stage in 1812. Her death took place on the 8th of June 1831, when she was in her
                    76th year.</p>
                <p>The symmetry of this great actress’s person was most captivating. Her features
                    were strongly marked, but finely harmonised; the flexibility of her countenance
                    was extraordinary, yielding instantaneously to every, change of passion; her
                    voice was plaintive, yet capable of firmness and exertion; her articulation was
                    clear, penetrating, and distinct ;—above all, she was completely mistress of her
                    powers, and possessed that high judgment which enabled her to display all her
                    other qualifications to the greatest advantage. One of Mrs. Siddons’s highest,
                    if not her very highest endowment, was the power of identifying herself with the
                    character which she personated. The scenes in which she acted, were to her far
                    from being a mere mimic show; so powerfully did her imagination conjure up the
                    reality, that the tears which she shed were those of bitterness felt at the
                    moment. From her frown of proud disdain and scorn, the very actors themselves
                    shrank with something like terror. Her greatest characters were Katherine in
                    Henry VIII., and Lady Macbeth, in which she manifested a dignity and a
                    sensibility, a power and a pathos never equalled by any female performer.
                    Lastly, Mrs. Siddons was truly an original; she copied no one, living or dead,
                    but acted from nature and herself. In all the relations of life her conduct was
                    most exemplary, “She was more than a woman of genius,” says the poet Campbell,
                    who knew her well, “for the additional benevolence of her heart made her an
                    honour to her sex, and to human nature.” (<hi rend="smallcaps">r. r.
