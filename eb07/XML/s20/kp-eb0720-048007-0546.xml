                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra

                <p><label type="entry">SOPHOCLES</label>, the famous tragic poet, was the son of
                    Sophilus, an Athenian, and was born in the year 495 before Christ. Although the
                    father was only a mechanic, the son enjoyed the advantage of a good education.
                    Superior vigour and address in the exercises of the palaestra, and skill in
                    music, were the great accomplishments of young men in the states of Greece. In
                    these Sophocles excelled; nor was he less distinguished by the beauty of his
                    person. He was also instructed in the noblest of all sciences, civil polity and
                    religion: from the first of these he derived an unshaken love of his country,
                    which he served in some embassies, and in high military command with Pericles;
                    from the latter he was impressed with a pious reverence for the gods, manifested
                    by the inviolabIe integrity of his life. But his studies were early devoted to
                    the tragic muse; the spirit of Aeschylus lent a fire to his genius, and excited
                    that noble emulation which led him to contend with, and sometimes to bear away
                    the prize from, his great master. He wrote forty-three<pb break="no"

                    tragedies, of which seven only have escaped the ravages of time. Having
                    testified his love of his country by refusing to leave it, though invited by
                    many kings, and having en joyed the uninterrupted esteem and affection of his
                    fellow citizens, which neither the gallant actions and sublime genius of
                    Aeschylus, nor the tender spirit and philosophic virtue of Euripides, could
                    secure to them, he died in the beginning of the year 405, at the very advanced
                    age of ninety.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Clinton’s
                    Fasti Hellenici, vol. ii. p. 23, 57, 83.</p></note> The burial-place of his
                    ancestors was at Decelia, which the'La cedaemonians had at that time seized and
                    fortified: but Lysander, the Spartan chief, permitted the Athenians to inter
                    their deceased poet; and they paid him all the honours due to his love of his
                    country, integrity of life, and high poetic excellence. Aeschylus had at once
                    seized the highest post of honour in the field of poetry, the true sublime: to
                    that eminence his claim could not be disputed. Sophocles had a noble elevation
                    of mind, but tempered with so fine a taste, and so chastened a judgment, that he
                    never passed the bounds of propriety. Under his conduct the tragic muse appeared
                    with the chaste dignity of some noble matron at a religious solemnity; harmony
                    is in her voice, and grace in all her motions. From him the theatre received
                    some additional embellishments; but his distinguished excellence is in the
                    judicious disposition of the fable, and so nice a connection and dependence of
                    the parts on each other, that they all conduce to make the event not only
                    probable, but even necessary. This is peculiarly admirable in his King Oedipus;
                    and in this important point he is far superior to every other dramatic writer of
                    antiquity.</p>
                <p>The ingratitude of the children of Sophocles is well known. They wished to become
                    immediate masters of their father’s possessions, and therefore, tired of his
                    long life, they accus ed him before the Areopagus of insanity. The only defence
                    the poet made, was to read his tragedy of Oedipus at Colo nos, which he had
                    lately finished; and he then asked his judges, whether the author of such a
                    performance could be charged with insanity. The father upon this was acquitted,
                    and the children returned home covered with shame and confusion.</p>
                <p>The editions of Sophocles are very numerous, and some of them very elaborate, but
                    we can only enumerate the more conspicuous. The <hi rend="italic">editio
                    princeps</hi> was published by Aldus, Venet. 1502, 8vo. This was followed by an
                    edition published by the heirs of P. Junta, Florent. 1522, 4to; and another
                    published by B. Junta, Florent. 1547, 4to. The text of Aldus was the basis of
                    all the editions which preceded that of Tumebus, Paris. 1553, 4to. This is among
                    the best of the early editions. We must not omit those of H. Stephanus, Paris.
                    1568, 4to, and of Canter, Antverp. 1579, 12mo. The text of Tumebus was chiefly
                    adopted in all the succeeding editions till that of Brunck, Argent. 1786, 2 tom.
                    4to. This is a very elaborate as well as splendid edition, and strikingly
                    displays the editor’s acute ness and learning. The same able critic published
                    two octavo editions, each in two volumes. We now descend to the edition of
                    Erfurdt, Lips. 180211, 8 tom. 8vo. The tragedies of Sophocles have been
                    translated into many different languages. An English version, which was favour
                    ably received, was published by Dr Francklin, Greek professor at Cambridge,
                    Lond. 1759, 2 vols. 4to. Another was subsequently published by Mr Potter, Lond.
                    1788, 4to.</p>
