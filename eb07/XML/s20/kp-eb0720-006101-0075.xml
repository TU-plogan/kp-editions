                    withdrawn from the communion of the Established Church in Scotland.</p>
                <p>In order that the causes from which the Secession originated may be clearly
                    understood, we shall introduce an account of that important event by a brief
                    sketch of the previous history of the Scottish church.</p>
                <p>James I. after his accession to the English throne, entertained an ardent desire
                    to form the Church of Scotland as much as possible upon the model of that in
                    England; and his son Charles, with the assistance of Archbishop Laud,
                    endeavoured to carry the design into execution, by establishing canons for
                    ecclesiastical discipline, and introducing a liturgy into the public service of
                    the church. Great numbers of the clergy and laity of all ranks took the alarm at
                    what they justly considered as a bold and dangerous innovation; and after
                    frequent applications to the throne, they at last obtained the royal
                    proclamation for a free parliament and General Assembly. The Assembly met in
                    1688, and began their labours with a repeal of all the acts of the six preceding
                    parliaments, which had favoured the introduction of Episcopacy. They condemned
                    the liturgy, together with every branch of the hierarchy. They cited all the
                    Scottish bishops to their bar, and after having excommunicated nine of them, and
                    deposed five from their episcopal office, they restored kirk-sessions,
                    presbyteries, and synods, provincial as “ell as national. These proceedings were
                    ratified by the parliament which met in 1640. The law of patronage, however, was
                    in full force for several years after this period; but great care was taken that
                    no minister should be obtruded on the people contrary to their inclination; and
                    in 1649 patronage was abolished altogether, as an oppressive grievance.</p>
                <p>The restoration of Charles II. in 1660, produced a total change in the state of
                    ecclesiastical affairs in Scotland. All that the General Assembly had done from
                    1688 to 1650 was rendered null and void; the covenants were pronounced to be
                    unlawful, Episcopacy was restored, and the king was declared to be the supreme
                    head of the church in all matters civil and ecclesiastical. During this period,
                    under the sway of Lauderdale and his associates, the Presbyterians were not only
                    subjected to tines, imprisonment, and exile, but numbers of them were publicly
                    executed, for their adherence to their political and religious principles.</p>
                <p>At the memorable era of the Revolution, the affairs of the church underwent a
                    complete change. The first parliament which met after that event abolished
                    prelacy and the king’s supremacy in ecclesiastical affairs. They ratified the
                    Westminster Confession of Faith, together with the Presbyterian form of church
                    government and discipline, “as agreeable to the word of God, and most conducive
                    to the advancement of true piety and godliness, and the establishment of peace
                    and tranquillity within these realms.” That same parliament abolished patronage,
                    and vested the election of ministers in the heritors and elders, with the
                    consent of the congregation.</p>
                <p>At the first General Assembly held after the Revolution, a most conciliatory
                    spirit was manifested, and a wide door of admission into the national church was
                    opened to the episcopal ministers, on the most lenient terms. Great multitudes
                    of the conforming clergy were thus induced, for the sake of the benefice, to
                    transfer their respect and obedience from the bishop to the presbytery, and were
                    received into ministerial communion on merely acknowledging “that the church
                    government, as now settled by law, is the only government of this church.” The
                    admission of these timeservers into the church laid the foundation of those
                    measures which ultimately led to the secession.<note anchored="true"

                    Burnet, vol. i. p. 158, folio edition.</p></note></p>
                <p>In the reign of Queen Anne, the true Protestant religion was ratified and
                    established, together with the Presbyterian form of church government and
                    discipline; and the unalterable continuance of both was declared to be an
                    essential condition of the union of the two kingdoms in all time coming. In
                    1712, the law respecting patronage was revived, in resentment, it has been said,
                    of that warm attachment which the Church of Scotland discovered to the family of
                    Hanover; and about the same period the imposition by the government, of the oath
                    of abjuration, was a fertile source of discord and strife, both among ministers
                    and people. This oath was regarded with great jealousy, and was peculiarly
                    obnoxious to the Presbyterian clergy, both because its avowed design was the
                    security of the Church of England, and because it seemed to imply an approbation
                    of diocesan Episcopacy, with the ceremonies of that church, and a recognition of
                    the queen’s supremacy in matters of religion. About a third part of the clergy,
                    including the founders of the Secession Church, positively refused to swear this
                    offensive oath; though they were enjoined to do so on pain of ejection from
                    their churches, and of paying an exorbitant fine. A train of events which
                    followed in rapid succession soon made it manifest that the dominant party in
                    the Scottish church were, if not hostile, at least indifferent, to the most
                    important doctrines of religion, and ready to sacrifice the liberties of tire
                    people at the shrine of civil authority. This charge was proved beyond the
                    possibility of contradiction, by their conduct towards the presbytery of
                    Auchterarder in the year 1717, with regard to what has since been denominated
                    the Auchterarder Creed, by their vindictive proceedings against the twelve
                    minsters known by the name of “Marrow Men,” who endeavoured to check the
                    progress of error by the diffusion of sound doctrine, along with their
                    condemnation of the doctrines of the book entitled the Marrow of Modern
                    Divinity, in the years 1720-21, and especially by the leniency of their dealings
                    with Professor Simpson of Glasgow, who, though found guilty of teaching a system
                    of deism rather than Christian theology, in his prelections to the students of
                    divinity, received no higher censure than simple suspension.</p>
                <p>For some time after the revival of patronage in 1712, the severity of the law was
                    greatly mitigated by the general disinclination, on the part both of ministers
                    and patrons, to avail themselves of its provisions in opposition to the feelings
                    of the people; but this state of things was speedily changed. After the lapse of
                    a few years, patrons no longer hesitated to avail themselves of their legal
                    rights, and ministers were no longer disinclined to accept of presentations when
                    given contrary to the wishes of the congregation. But on the part of the people
                    acts of resistance became more frequent and more obstinate, though they were
                    almost uniformly unsuccessful; for the ruling party among the clergy were firm
                    in their resolution that the law of patronage should be carried into effect.
                    They found themselves, however, placed in circumstances of peculiar difficulty;
                    for not only were the people loud in their remonstrances against violent
                    settlements, but a considerable party of the ministers themselves espoused the
                    popular side, and not only strenuously opposed the intrusion of ministers upon
                    congregations, but obstinately refused to carry into effect the decisions of the
                    Assembly. To obviate this difficulty, in 1729 they appointed a committee of
                    their own number to meet and ordain the obnoxious presentee; and for a period of
                    twenty years this expedient was resorted to in cases where the presbytery proved
                    refractory. The excitement of the people, and their resistance to the yoke of
                    patronage, continued to increase; violent settlements prevailed in every part of
                    the country; and in some cases the popular feeling was so strong, that it was
                    deemed necessary to employ an armed force to carry into effect the decisions of
                    the church-courts. At the meeting of the Assembly in 1730, there were no<pb

                    xml:id="kp-eb0720-0076-0062"/> fewer than twelve cases of appeals on the part of
                    congregations against the intrusion of obnoxious ministers; but the dominant
                    party were so determined to crush all opposition to their enactments, that they
                    not only dismissed these appeals, but solemnly enacted, at this meeting of the
                    Assembly, that henceforward no reasons of dissent “against the determination of
                    church judicatures” should be entered on the record. The Assembly of 1781
                    followed closely in the footsteps of its predecessor. By the law of patronage it
                    was provided, that if the patron suffered six months to elapse without
                    exercising his right of presentation, the presbytery to which the vacant parish
                    belonged was empowered to take steps for its settlement. The presbyteries in
                    these cases frequently gave the people the right of ch∞sing their ministers; and
                    with the view of destroying this last remnant of popular election, an overture
                    was laid before the Assembly of 1731, proposing, that when the right of
                    appointment devolved upon presbyteries, the power of election in vacant parishes
                    should belong only to the elders and Protestant heritors, and, in royal burghs,
                    to the elders, magistrates, and town-council. This overture was transmitted to
                    the different presbyteries, that, according to the regulations of the barrier
                    act, their opinion respecting it might be given at next meeting of the Assembly;
                    and though a great majority of those presbyteries from whom reports were
                    received, expressed disapprobation of the measure, the supporters of the
                    overture obtained a majority of the Assembly of 1782 in its favour.<note

                    forty-nine presbyteries; six approved of the overture without alteration, twelve
                    on condition that certain important amendments were introduced, while thirty-one
                    gave it their unqualified condemnation. Eighteen presbyteries gave in no
                    report.</p></note></p>
                <p>Among the opponents of the measures of the Assembly in 1732, Mr Ebenezer Erskine,
                    minister at Stirling, held a prominent place. His talents and learning, his
                    faithfulness in the discharge of his ministerial duties, and his intrepidity and
                    zeal in the popular cause, had secured to him the respect and esteem of his
                    brethren, as well as extensive influence among the people. In the various
                    important questions which had been agitated after his entrance into the
                    ministry, the abjuration oath, the controversy respecting the Marrow of
                    Divinity, and the process carried on against Professor Simpson, he had shown
                    himself an active and fearless opponent of the measures pursued by the ruling
                    party in the church. He was not only one of those who signed the representation
                    of grievances laid before the Assembly in 1732, but being a member of Assembly
                    that year, he spoke and protested against its rejection. Being at that time
                    moderator of the synod of Perth and Stirling, he opened the meeting at Perth, on
                    the 10th of October following, with a sermon from Psalm cxviii. 22, in the
                    course of which he remonstrated against the act of the preceding Assembly with
                    regard to the settlement of ministers, alleging that it was contrary to the word
                    of God and the established constitution of the church. These statements gave
                    great offence to several members of synod, and after the court was constituted,
                    and a new moderator chosen, a formal complaint was lodged against him, for
                    uttering several offensive expressions in his sermon.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The persons who took the lead in moving for
                    investigation were. Messrs Adam Ferguson, minister at Logiernit; James Mercer,
                    minister at Aberdalgie; James Mackie, minister at Forteviot, afterwards at St
                    Ninians; and the Laird of Glendoig, ruling elder.</p></note> Many of the members
                    declared that they heard him utter nothing but sound and seasonable doctrine;
                    but his accusers insisting on their complaint, obtained the appointment of a
                    committee of synod, to collect what were called the offensive expressions, and
                    to lay them before the next diet in writing. This was done accordingly, and Mr
                    Erskine having been heard in reply to the charges made against him, a keen
                    debate of three days ensued, and at last the synod, by a majority of six votes,
                    found Mr Erskine censurable for some expressions in his sermon, “tending to
                    disquiet the peace of the church, and impugning several acts of Assembly, and
                    proceedings of church judicatories.” Against this sentence Mr Erskine protested
                    and appealed to the General Assembly. But in spite of his protest and appeal,
                    the synod proceeded in the cause, and agreed to “rebuke Mr Erskine, and admonish
                    him to behave orderly for the future and they at the same time appointed the
                    “presbytery of Stirling to inquire anent his after behaviour at their privy
                    censures, and report to the next synod.” Mr Erskine not appearing when called
                    upon, the synod resolved that he should be rebuked at their next meeting in
                    April. All attempts at accommodation proving fruitless, the Assembly which met
                    in May 1733 affirmed the sentence of the synod, and appointed Mr Erskine to be
                    rebuked and admonished at the bar of the Assembly. Mr Erskine, however, declared
                    that he could not submit in silence to the rebuke and admonition, and presented
                    a written protest, to the effect, that as the Assembly had found him censurable,
                    and had rebuked him for doing what he conceived to be agreeable to the word of
                    God and the standards of the church, he should be at liberty to teach the same
                    truths, and to testify against the same or similar evils, on every proper
                    occasion. To this protest Messrs William Wilson, minister at Perth, Alexander
                    Moncrieff, minister at Abernethy, and James Fisher, minister at Kin-claven, gave
                    in <hi rend="italic">a</hi> written adherence, under the form of instrument. The
                    Assembly having refused to permit the protest to be read, the four protesters
                    left the paper on the table and withdrew, intending to return to their
                    respective charges, and act agreeably to their protest, as circumstances might
                    require. Here the matter would in all probability have terminated, as at this
                    period none of the four entertained any intention of a formal separation from
                    the national church. But an overruling Providence had ordered it otherwise. The
                    court had proceeded to a different business, when the protest, which had fallen
                    from the table, was accidentally picked up by a minister, who, perusing the
                    contents of it, rose with great indignation, and called the attention of the
                    Assembly to the insult which had been offered to their authority.<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>’ It is stated by Mr Adam
                    Gibb, that the person who picked up Mr Erskine’s protest was Mr James Nasmith,
                    minister at Dalmeny.</p></note> The protest being read, a great uproar ensued,
                    and the Assembly ordered their officer to summon the four brethren to appear at
                    the bar of the court next day. They obeyed the citation, and a committee was
                    appointed to retire with them in order to persuade them to withdraw their paper.
                    The committee having reported that their persuasions had produced no effect on
                    the minds of the brethren, the Assembly ordered them to appear before the

                    not comply, and testify their sorrow for their conduct, the Commission was
                    empowered to suspend them from the exercise of their ministry, and in case of
                    their acting contrary to the sentence of suspension, the Commission should
                    proceed to a higher censure.</p>
                <p>The Commission met in August accordingly, and the four ministers still adhering
                    to their protest, were suspended from the exercise of their office. At the
                    meeting in November, addresses were received from a number of presbyteries and
                    synods, recommending lenity and forbearance towards the suspended ministers, and
                    many members of the Commission strenuously supported the same view. The
                    question, however, was put, “Proceed immediately to inflict a higher censure,”
                    or “Delay the same till March and the votes being equal on both sides, Mr John
                    Gowdie, the modera<pb break="no" facs="ht:chi.28490924&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=77"

                    casting vote to proceed to a higher censure. At this stage of the proceedings
                    the Commission proposed certain terms of accommodation, which the suspended
                    ministers, after mature deliberation, declared they could not conscientiously
                    accept. The Commission, therefore, on the 16th of November 1733, passed sentence
                    upon them; loosing their relation to their respective charges, declaring their
                    churches vacant, and prohibiting all ministers of the Church of Scotland from
                    employing them in any ministerial function.</p>
                <p>The sentence being intimated to them, they protested that their ministerial
                    office and relation to their respective charges should be held as valid as if no
                    such sentence had passed; that they were now obliged to make a <hi rend="italic"
                    >secession</hi> from the prevailing party in the ecclesiastical courts; and that
                    it should be lawful for them to preach the gospel, and discharge all the duties
                    of the pastoral office, according to the word of God, and the principles and
                    constitution of the Church of Scotland.</p>
                <p>The Secession properly commenced at this date. Accordingly the ejected ministers
                    declared in their protest, that they were laid under the disagreeable necessity
                    of seceding, not from the principles and constitution of the Church of Scotland,
                    to which they expressed their steadfast adherence, but from the present
                    church-courts, which had thrown them out from ministerial communion. In the new
                    and trying circumstances in which they were placed, they conducted themselves
                    with great caution and prudence. A few weeks after their expulsion from the
                    national church, they met, according to previous appointment, at Gairney Bridge,
                    a small village in the neighbourhood of Kinross, on the 5th of December 1733.
                    Having spent the whole of that and the greater part of the succeeding day in
                    prayer and pious conference, they finally resolved to constitute themselves into
                    a presbytery, under the designation of <hi rend="italic">the Associate
                    Presbytery.</hi> This presbytery, at its first formation, consisted only of the
                    four ejected ministers; for though Messrs Ralph Erskine and Thomas Mair were
                    present at this interesting meeting, they were merely spectators. Anxious,
                    however, to avoid every thing like rashness or precipitancy, and cherishing a
                    solemn impression of the responsibility attached to their conduct, in the
                    remarkable circumstances in which they were placed, the seceding ministers
                    resolved to hold their meetings chiefly for prayer and religious conference, and
                    to defer proceeding to any judicial acts till they should see whether the
                    ecclesiastical courts would retrace their steps. They considered it necessary,
                    however, to publish a Testimony to the doctrine, worship, and government of the
                    Church of Scotland, and a statement of the grounds of their secession from the
                    national church. This has been since known by the name of the Extrajudicial
                    Testimony.</p>
                <p>In the Assembly which met in May 1734, a conciliatory spirit was manifested by
                    the ruling party; the agitated state of popular feeling, and the knowledge that
                    the Seceders had many friends among the clergy themselves, disposed them to make
                    some concessions to prevent the spread of disaffection. When the commission-book
                    was examined, there were some reservations made in the approval of its
                    proceedings; the act of 1730, forbidding church-courts to record dissents and
                    protests, and the act of 1732, respecting the settlement of vacant parishes,
                    were repealed; the Commission was appointed to petition his majesty and the
                    parliament for the repeal of the patronage act; and they authorized the Synod of
                    Perth and Stirling to receive the ejected ministers into the communion of the
                    church, and restore them to their respective charges, but with this ex press
                    direction, that the “synod should not take upon them to judge of the legality or
                    formality of the former procedure of the church judicatories in relation to this
                    affair, or either approve or censure the same.” But as the appearances of
                    reformation which had been exhibited were, in the opinion of the four seceding
                    brethren, dictated merely by a calculating worldly policy, and by no real regard
                    for the cause of truth, after solemn and repeated deliberation, they were
                    unanimously of opinion that, in existing circumstances, it was their duty to
                    remain in a state of separation, till they should see unequivocal and decided
                    evidence that the cause of defection was in reality abandoned. Having prepared a
                    statement of the reasons of their refusal, and the terms upon which they were
                    willing to return to the Established Church, they published it some time before
                    the meeting of Assembly 1735. The proceedings of the Assemblies of 1735 and 1736
                    seemed to the seceding ministers fully to justify the opinion which they had
                    formed respecting the measures proposed in the preceding Assembly, and to
                    dispel, for the time at least, all hopes of a re-union with the Established
                    Church; and they now considered it “full time to proceed to the exercise of the
                    powers with which they were intrusted by the Head of the church, for the
                    vindication of His truths and ordinances, and for the relief of the Christian
                    people, by supplying them with sermon."<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    They now prepared what they termed an Act, Declaration, and Testimony to the
                    doctrine, worship, government, and discipline of the Church of Scotland, and
                    condemning the numerous instances of defection from these, both in former and in
                    the present times. Some time after this, having received the accession of Messrs
                    Ralph Erskine of Dunfermline, Thomas Mair of Orwell, Thomas Nairn of Abbotshall,
                    and James Thomson of Burntisland, the Associate Presbytery now consisted of
                    eight members. Numerous applications for sermon having been received from all
                    parts of the country,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>During the years 1737-38, upwards of seventy petitions for sermon were laid

                    now renounced all hopes of a re-union with the church, resolved to adopt
                    measures for extending and perpetuating the benefits of the Secession; and
                    accordingly Mr Wilson of Perth, a person of great ability and learning, was
                    chosen professor of divinity, and intrusted with the education of candidates for
                    the ministry.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Me Wilson
                    devoted the months of March, April, and May, to bis course of theological
                    tuition. He not only read his lectures, but conducted the whole business of the
                    class, in the Latin language.</p></note> These measures necessarily produced a
                    complete separation between them and the Established Church. The Assembly of
                    1739 declared the refractory ministers worthy of deposition; but, from motives
                    of expediency, delayed giving sentence against them till next year, when they
                    were all deposed, and ordered to be ejected from their churches. In some places,
                    such as Stirling and Perth, the seceding ministers were forcibly excluded from
                    their usual places of worship the first Sabbath after the decision of the
                    Assembly, while in others, such as Dunfermline and Burntisland, they continued
                    to occupy their pulpits for at least two years after sentence of deposition was
                    pronounced against them. All of them, however, continued to discharge the duties
                    of the ministry in their respective congregations, who still adhered to them,
                    erected places of worship for them, and provided for their support. Meanwhile
                    cases of violent settlements of ministers increased throughout the country, and
                    the opposition was frequently so formidable, and popular excitement so great, as
                    to render the attendance of a guard of soldiers necessary at ordinations. These
                    contests had of course a powerful influence in increasing the adherents of the
                    seceding ministers. New accessions were made to them from all quarters. Some
                    even of the probationers of the Established Church placed themselves under their
                    superintendence, and their theological hall was in such a<pb break="no"

                    flourishing condition that, in the year 1741, it was attended by a greater
                    number of students than any of the Scottish universities except Edinburgh.<note

                <p>The numbers of the seceding ministers continuing rapidly to increase, a new
                    arrangement was adopted on the 11th of October 1744, by which they were formed
                    into three presbyteries, under one synod. The first meeting of the Associate
                    Synod was held at Stirling on the first Tuesday of March 1745, at which period
                    it had under its inspection about thirty settled congregations and sixteen
                    vacancies in Scotland, besides several congregations in Ireland. The Seceders,
                    in common with the great body of the religious Presbyterians in Scotland, both
                    clergy and laity, entertained great veneration for the national covenants; and
                    as the practice of public covenanting had, for a considerable period, been
                    neglected in Scotland, they expected that the revival of it would have a
                    powerful effect in advancing the work of reformation. An overture to this
                    purpose had been deliberately prepared by a committee of presbytery, which,
                    after various amendments and enlargements, was finally adopted by the presbytery
                    at Stirling, on the 23d of December 1743. And on the 28th of the same month,
                    which was observed as a day of solemn fasting and humiliation, the confession of
                    sins was read, and the engagement to duties subscribed by fifteen ministers, in
                    the presence of a numerous assembly. And when the presbytery met at Edinburgh,
                    on the 14th of February 1744, they enacted that the renewing of the covenant
                    should be the term of ministerial and Christian communion. An unhappy
                    controversy now, however, arose respecting the religious clause of some
                    burgess-oaths, which, it was alleged, was utterly inconsistent with the oath of
                    the covenants and with the Secession Testimony.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>’ The following is the clause referred to: “I
                    protest before God and your Lordships, that I profess and allow with my heart
                    the true religion presently professed within this realm, and authorized by the
                    laws thereof; and I shall abide thereat, and defend the same, to my life’s end,
                    renouncing the Roman religion called papistry.”</p></note> One party insisted
                    that no Seceder should be allowed to swear this oath, while the other urged the
                    exercise of mutual forbearance. So sharp was the contention between them, that
                    at the meeting of synod in April 1747, after several long and stormy
                    discussions, an entire separation took place between the contending parties.
                    Never, perhaps, was the truth of Father Paul’s remark more strikingly verified,
                    “In verbal contentions, the smallness of the difference often nourishes the
                    obstinacy of the parties.” Those who condemned the swearing of the burgess oath
                    as sinful, and inconsistent with the Secession Testimony, were called
                    “Antiburghers,” and the other party, who contended that it should be declared
                    not to be a term of communion, were designated “Burghers.” The latter made
                    various attempts to bring about a reconciliation with the opposing party, by
                    proposing a meeting for prayer and friendly conference, but without success. And
                    the “Antiburghers” not only refused to agree to the proposal, but, after several
                    previous steps, went the length of passing sentence of deposition and
                    excommunication, with all due formality, on Messrs Ebenezer and Ralph Erskine,
                    James Fisher, and the other ministers who had adopted the opposite views
                    respecting the swearing of the burgees oath. Each party claimed to itself the
                    name and lawful constitution of the Associate Synod; but, for the sake of
                    distinction. the Burghers were termed the Associate, and the Antiburghers the
                    General Associate Synod. A furious controversy raged between them for a number
                    of years, and, both from the pulpit and the press, the one party indulged in
                    invectives against the other. In the course of time, however, this hostility
                    subsided; a feeling of cordiality gradually gained ground; and, after a
                    separation of nearly eighty years, the two bodies were again united into
                    one.</p>
                <p>These divisions among the Seceders afforded an excellent opportunity to the
                    dominant party in the national church to have regained their lost influence with
                    the people; but, instead of availing themselves of it to check the progress of
                    the Secession, they only became more resolute in enforcing the law of patronage.
                    The doctrine which they taught at this time in their pulpits, it has been said,
                    “could neither be called Christian nor heathen, but was a compound of both and
                    all petitions for the redress of grievances, and all resistance to their
                    arbitrary decrees, were silenced by the strong arm of power. “The language of
                    the majority in Assemblies at this time,” says the late Sir Henry
                    Moncrieff,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>’ Appendix to
                    Life of Dr Erskine, by Sir H. Moncrieff Wellwood, Bart., p. 464.</p></note>
                    “universally was, that the secession from the church, instead of increasing, was
                    on the decline, and that the superior character and talents of the established
                    clergy were gradually weakening its resources, and would ultimately exhaust
                    them. Experience has not verified these sanguine expectations. At the distance
                    of a few years after Dr Robertson retired, the people, disgusted with
                    unsuccessful processes before the Assembly, relinquished the plan of their
                    predecessors, and came seldom to the Assembly with appeals from the sentences of
                    the inferior courts appointing the settlement of presentees whom they resisted.
                    But they began to do more quietly, or with less observation than formerly, what
                    was not less unfriendly to the establishment. In ordinary cases, they now leave
                    the church-courts to execute their sentences without opposition, and set
                    themselves immediately to rear a meeting-house, which very frequently carries
                    off a large portion of the inhabitants of the parish.” This state of comparative
                    quiescence was not, however, produced without long and severe struggles; and for
                    many years the disputes in the church-courts respecting the settlements of
                    ministers were incessant. In the year 1751, an unpopular minister having been
                    presented to the church and parish of Inverkeithing, the presbytery of
                    Dunfermline refused to proceed with his settlement, and the synod of Fife, who
                    were next appointed to ordain him, proved equally refractory. The affair was
                    brought before the Assembly of 1752, and they peremptorily enjoined the
                    presbytery of Dunfermline to proceed with the ordination of the presentee, and
                    ordered all the members of presbytery to attend on that occasion. Six ministers
                    who absented themselves from conscientious scruples were brought to the bar of
                    the Assembly. One of their number, Mr Thomas Gillespie, minister of Carnock, was
                    immediately deposed, and three others were afterwards suspended. Mr Gillespie,
                    notwithstanding this sentence, continued to discharge his ministerial duties,
                    and a few years afterwards he and Mr Thomas Boston of Oxnam and Mr Collier
                    formed themselves into a presbytery, and became the founders of that numerous
                    and respectable body of dissenters entitled the Synod of Relief.</p>
                <p>When such proceedings were systematically carried on in the courts of the
                    Established Church, it is not to be wondered at that the spirit of disaffection
                    should continue to spread among its members, and that the numbers of the
                    Seceders rapidly increased, in spite of the strife that prevailed among
                    themselves at this period. Not only did the Associate Synods steadily extend
                    their influence in Scotland by the accessions which they were constantly making
                    to the number of their adherents, but they sent preachers to England, to
                    Ireland, and even to America, and erected a considerable number of Secession
                    congregations in these countries. The controversy respecting the burgess-oath<pb

                    xml:id="kp-eb0720-0079-0065"/> gradually exhausted itself; but towards the close
                    of the eighteenth century, both synods were disturbed by an angry discussion
                    respecting the power of the magistrate in matters of religion, and the
                    obligation of the national covenant upon posterity. In 1796 the synod commenced
                    their revision of the Testimony, a business of no small importance and
                    difficulty, as this document “consisted of two hundred octavo pages, and
                    included all the controversial points in divinity and church-government which
                    had been discussed in this country for successive generations.”</p>
                <p>During the progress of this laborious work, which lasted for a period of nearly
                    eight years, considerable dissatisfaction was expressed by a small minority; and
                    when at length the revision was brought to a close in May 1804, and the
                    Introduction, Narrative, and Testimony, as corrected and enlarged, were adopted
                    by the synod as the term of admission for those who shall apply for joining in
                    communion with them, five ministers, Messrs Whytock, Aitken, Chalmers, Hog, and
                    M‘Crie, protested against the decision, and, after various ineffectual attempts
                    at accommodation, left the body, and formed themselves into a distinct
                    presbytery.</p>
                <p>Nearly about this period a fierce controversy was carried on in the Associate or
                    Burgher Synod respecting the same subject, which was under consideration for a
                    considerable time, and various controversial publications issued from the press
                    respecting it. At length, in April 1797, the synod by a majority agreed to the
                    following motion. “That whereas some parts of the standard books of this synod
                    have been interpreted as favouring compulsory measures in religion, the synod
                    hereby declare that they do not re-</p>
                <p>3uire an approbation of any such principle from any candi-ate for license or
                    ordination; and whereas a controversy has arisen among us respecting the nature
                    and kind of the obligation of our solemn covenants on posterity, whether it be
                    entirely of the same kind upon us as upon our ancestors who swore them, the
                    synod hereby declare, that while they hold the obligation of our covenants upon
                    posterity, they do not interfere with that controversy which has arisen
                    respecting it, and recommend it to all their members to suppress that
                    controversy, as tending to gender strife, rather than godly edifying.”
                    Notwithstanding this decision, the ferment which had been excited by the
                    discussion on this subject rather increased than abated, and the question was
                    again brought under the notice of the synod in September 1799. After a
                    lengthened discussion, it was decided by a large majority, that “the synod
                    adjourn the further discussion of this question till a future meeting, and in
                    the mean time appoint a committee to draw up a synodical address to the people
                    of their charge, expressive of their adherence to the doctrine, worship,
                    discipline, and government of the Church of Scotland.” Against this decision
                    several members protested, and two of them, Messrs Willis and Hyslop, declared
                    in their protest, that as the synod had refused to reverse their former act,
                    they would no longer acknowledge their authority. In consequence of this
                    declaration their names were erased from the roll, and shortly afterwards they,
                    along with Mr Watson, minister of Kilpatrick, constituted themselves into a
                    distinct presbytery, and became the founders of that body which is ordinarily
                    known by the appellation of the Original Burgher Synod. An attempt was made by
                    these separatists to obtain possession of the property belonging to the <hi
                    rend="italic">synod,</hi> by alleging that they had abandoned the principles
                    which their predecessors in the Secession had always maintained. An appeal to
                    the courts of law was made on this point, in the case of the Associate
                    congregation in Perth. Mr Jervie, one of the ministers of this congregation,
                    joined the Original Burgher Synod, while his colleague Mr Aikman continued in
                    connection with the Associate Synod. The congregation were also divided in
                    sentiment, and each party claimed the exclusive possession of the manse and
                    place of worship. After a long and expensive litigation, in the course of which
                    the process was carried from the inferior courts to the House of Lords, and
                    thence remitted back to the Court of Session, it was ultimately decided that the
                    defenders had not departed from the original standards and principles of the
                    association, and that the pursuers had separated from the congregation to which
                    they belonged, without any assignable cause, and without any fault on the part
                    of the Associate Synod. They had, therefore, no right to disturb the defenders
                    in the possession of their property. The question was one of great importance,
                    and the principle laid down in this instance as the ground of judgment, has been
                    since regarded as the settled law of the country in all similar cases.</p>
                <p>No other event of much importance occurred in the history of the Secession
                    Church, till the period when the two great branches of which it was composed
                    were again happily united into one. A junction had previously taken place
                    between the Burgher and Antiburgher ministers in America, Nova Scotia, and
                    Ireland. For a number of years an amicable feeling had gradually gained ground
                    among the ministers and people connected with both branches of the Secession,
                    and their intercourse in bible, missionary, and other religious societies tended
                    powerfully to strengthen the feeling of mutual regard. From the moment that the
                    proposal of a junction was made, both synods entered on the matter with
                    cordiality and zeal. The religious public generally took considerable interest
                    in the movement. The town councils of Glasgow and Paisley abolished the
                    religious clause of the oath which had occasioned the strife, and the Convention
                    of Royal Burghs unanimously recommended its entire abolition, for the express
                    purpose of removing any obstacles that might obstruct the progress of this
                    desirable event At length the articles of union having been agreed upon and
                    sanctioned by both synods, and all the necessary preliminaries settled, the
                    union was completed on the 8th of September 1820, in Bristo Street church,
                    Edinburgh, the spot where, seventy-three years before, the separation had taken
                    place.</p>
                <p>All the ministers of the Associate Synod became members of the United Synod; but
                    Professor Paxton, and other nine ministers of the General Associate or
                    Antiburgher Synod, refused to concur in the union, and soon after formed a
                    junction with Professor Bruce, Dr M‘Crie, and other members of the
                    Constitutional Associate Presbytery, who withdrew from the Antiburgher body in
                    1806.</p>
                <p>Since the period of the union the Secession Church has continued rapidly to
                    increase in numbers and strength, and the extraordinary controversy which is at
                    present agitating the whole country has brought the Seceders much more
                    prominently into view than during any preceding era of their church. The
                    question respecting the power of the magistrate in religious affairs had
                    frequently been discussed among Seceders themselves, but of late years it has
                    become a matter of national interest. The founders of the Secession Church
                    doubtless approved of the interference of the civil magistrate in matters of
                    religion; but they appear to have changed their opinions on this subject at no
                    distant period after their secession from the Established Church, as appears
                    from the language of the Associate presbytery as early as 1743, in their answers
                    to Mr Nairn: “If true religion became a part of the civil constitution, it
                    inevitably follows that the church became a part of the state, which doctrine,
                    as it is absurd in itself, lays a plain foundation for Erastianism, overturning
                    the distinction betwixt the kingdom of our Lord Jesus Christ and the kingdoms of
                    this world.” The same sentiments were expressed by the Reverend Adam Gibb in his
                    Display of the Secession Testimony, published in 1774, and by the Antiburgher
                    Synod in the revision of their Testimony. This explicit condemnation of the
                    connection between church and state was one of the<pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:chi.28490924&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=80" xml:id="kp-eb0720-0080-0066"/>
                    principal grounds of the separation of Professor Bruce and Dr M‘Crie from the
                    Antiburgher Synod; and the refusal of the Burgher Synod to reverse the act which
                    made this subject a matter of forbearance, was the sole reason why Messrs
                    Willis, Hyslop, and others, renounced their connection with that body. The
                    controversy slumbered during a period of about thirty years from this date; but
                    about the year 1829 it was again resumed, and since that time has increased to
                    such a degree, that the harmony between churchmen and dissenters has been broken
                    up, and the hopes which were formerly cherished of a re-union between the
                    Secession and the Establishment have, for the present at least, been completely
                    extinguished. Proposals were made in 1834, for a union between the Secession and
                    the Synod of Relief, and the measure is still under the consideration of both
                    churches. In the mean time the most friendly intercourse is maintained between
                    them, and, from the harmonious feeling manifested on the subject, in all
                    probability the union will ere long be consummated.</p>
                <p>The exposition of ecclesiastical polity, which is given under the article <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Presbyterian,</hi> applies to the constitution of the United
                    Associate Synod. They have lay-elders, kirk-sessions, and presbyteries; but
                    instead of a General Assembly, they meet in synod once a year, the synod being
                    their supreme court. They have the same standards and the same confession as the
                    Established Church. They believe that the Holy Scriptures are the sole criterion
                    of truth, and the only rule of faith and manners; and that “the Supreme Judge by
                    which all controversies of religion are to be determined, and all the decrees of
                    councils, opinions of ancient writers, doctrines of men and private spirits, are
                    to be examined, and in whose sentence we are to rest, can be no other than the
                    Holy Spirit speaking in the Scriptures.” They are fully persuaded, however, that
                    the standards of the Church of Scotland exhibit a just and consistent view of
                    the meaning and design of the Holy Scriptures with regard to doctrine, worship,
                    government, and discipline. They therefore hold the Westminster Confession of
                    Faith, the Larger and Shorter Catechisms, as expressive of the sense in which
                    they understand the Scriptures; and they so far differ from the dissenters in
                    England, that they hold these standards to be not only articles of peace, and a
                    test of orthodoxy, but as a bond of union and fellowship. They consider a simple
                    declaration of adherence to the Scriptures as too equivocal a proof of unity in
                    sentiment, because Arians, Socinians, and Arminians make such a confession of
                    their faith, while they retain sentiments which, they (the Seceders) apprehend,
                    are subversive of the great doctrines of the gospel. They believe that Jesus
                    Christ is the only King and Head of the Church, which is his body; that it is
                    his sole prerogative to enact laws for the government of his kingdom, which is
                    not of this world; and that the church is not possessed of a legislative, but
                    only of an executive power, to be exercised in explaining and applying to their
                    proper objects and ends those laws which Christ has published in the Scriptures.
                    Those doctrines which they teach relative to faith and practice are exhibited at
                    great length in an explanation of the Westminster Assembly’s Shorter Catechism,
                    by way of question and answer, composed chiefly by the late Mr Fisher of
                    Glasgow, and published by desire of the synod. They catechise their hearers
                    publicly, and visit them from house to house once every year.</p>
                <p>In many of their congregations they celebrate the Lord’s Supper four times, in
                    the remainder twice in the year; and they examine their young people strictly
                    concerning their knowledge of the principles of religion previously to their
                    admission to that sacrament. They will permit none to partake of the ordinance
                    of the Lord’s Supper who are ignorant of the principles of the gospel, or who
                    are scandalous and immoral in their lives. They condemn private baptism, nor
                    will they admit those who are grossly ignorant and profane to be sponsors for
                    their children. They never accept a sum of money as a commutation for any
                    offence; and those of the delinquents who do not submit to adequate censure are
                    publicly declared to be fugitives from discipline, and are expelled the society.
                    They condemn all clandestine and irregular marriages, nor will they marry any
                    person unless the banns of marriage have been regularly proclaimed in the parish
                    church.</p>
                <p>Believing that the people have a natural right to choose their own pastors, the
                    settlement of their ministers always proceeds upon a popular election, and the
                    candidate who is elected by the majority of the communicants is ordained among
                    them. Convinced that a charge of souls is a trust of the greatest importance,
                    they carefully watch over the morals of their students, and direct them to such
                    a course of reading and study as they judge most proper to qualify them for the
                    profitable discharge of the pastoral duties. At the ordination of their
                    ministers, they use a formula nearly of the same kind with that of the
                    Established Church, which their ministers are bound to subscribe when called to
                    it; and if any of them teach doctrines contrary to the Scriptures or the
                    Westminster Confession of Faith, they are sure to be expelled from their
                    communion. It must be noticed, however, that they are not required to approve of
                    any thing in the standards of the church which teaches compulsory or persecuting
                    and intolerant principles in religion.</p>
                <p>The education of candidates for the ministry has always been reckoned a matter of
                    the greatest importance by the Secession Church. The course of study is very
                    nearly the same as that adopted by the Establishment. Students, before being
                    admitted to the Theological Hall, must attend at least three years at one of the
                    universities; and the course of preparatory study required of them includes
                    Latin, Greek, Logic, Moral Philosophy, and Mathematics; a knowledge of Hebrew is
                    also required, so that they may be enabled to enter on the critical study of the
                    Old Testament Scriptures as soon as they commence their course of theology. The
                    study of natural philosophy may be deferred till after commencing the study of
                    divinity; but students must produce the certificate of the professor of that
                    science, and be examined as to their proficiency in it, either before admission
                    to the Divinity Hall, or immediately after their first session in it. And it is
                    strongly recommended to them to attend also such classes as they may have access
                    to for the study of geology, chemistry, and other branches of physical science.
                    Students who have a view to the Christian ministry are examined by the
                    presbyteries at the close of each session, that their proficiency may be
                    ascertained, and that they may be prevented from advancing to the higher
                    branches of study till they have acquired a competent knowledge of those which
                    precede them. During the whole course of the student’s education, his
                    improvement in personal religion is kept steadily in view. Before he is
                    encouraged to prosecute preparatory studies, strict inquiry is made into his
                    piety, as well as his talents and capability of acquirement; his progress in
                    personal religion as well as in literature is constantly watched over; and he
                    cannot be admitted into the Divinity Hall till he is a member in full communion
                    with the Secession Church.</p>
                <p>The Secession has four professors of divinity, each giving instruction in one
                    great department of theological science, or explanatory of the duties of the
                    Christian ministry. I. The professor of biblical literature, whose duty it is to
                    give a course of lectures on the history, evidence, and interpretation of the
                    sacred books; to direct the reading of the students, and to examine them on
                    these subjects; to read to them portions of the original Scriptures critically,
                    and to require from them explicatory and critical exercises. 2. The professor of
                    exegetical theology, who gives lectures and conducts examinations on one or more
                    of the books of the<pb break="no" facs="ht:chi.28490924&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=81"

                    the Apostles, and one or more of the doctrinal epistles; and who also gives a
                    view of the divine dispensations, as these are detailed in the Holy Scriptures.
                    The course of the present professor embraces a critical exposition of the
                    principal prophecies of the Messiah, the doctrines of Jesus Christ, and the
                    Epistles to the Romans, Galatians, and Hebrews. 3. The professor of systematic
                    theology. 4. The professor of pastoral theology and ecclesiastical history,
                    whose duty it is to explain the qualifications of the ministerial character, and
                    the duties of the pastoral office; and to give instruction in all the services
                    which, as teachers or rulers in the church, ministers are called upon to
                    perform, such as conducting the public devotions of the church, the composition
                    and delivery of pulpit discourses, ministerial visitation of families, public
                    catechising, visitation of the sick, the government and discipline of the
                    church, giving also an abstract of ecclesiastical history. The term of study is
                    five years, and the duration of the annual session two months; and it is
                    rendered imperative on students to attend the whole time. They are usually from
                    five to six hours a day in the classroom. For the first and second sessions of
                    their attendance at the hall, they are committed to the care of the professor of
                    biblical literature and exegetical theology, and the professors of systematic
                    and pastoral theology during the last three years of their course. During the
                    vacation the students are under the superintendence of their respective
                    presbyteries, who meet and converse with them as to their progress in their
                    studies, and hear and criticise their trial discourses. The examinations and
                    exercises prescribed on trials for license and ordination are much the same as
                    in the Established Church.</p>
                <p>The Secession has produced a respectable proportion of authors distinguished in
                    various departments of literary pursuit. To say nothing of living authors, the
                    works of Dr Jamieson, the profound and ingenious author of the Scottish
                    Dictionary, and of several learned defences of some of the fundamental
                    principles of religion, entitle him to a place among the distinguished men of
                    his age and country; and the writings of the founders of the Secession, and of
                    Lawson, Dick, Belfrage, Pollock, and others, are well known and highly esteemed
                    in religious and literary circles.</p>
                <p>The United Associate Synod now comprehends twenty-two presbyteries, composed of
                    361 congregations, exclusive of missionary stations both at home and abroad. The
                    following statement will show the regular and steady progress which it has made
                    during the period of one hundred and six years which has elapsed since its
                    origin.</p>
                <p>“When the Associate Presbytery was first constituted by the fathers of the
                    Secession, on the 6th of December 1733, the number of the brethren who took this
                    important step amounted only to <hi rend="italic">four.</hi></p>
                <p>“When the General Assembly pronounced sentence of deposition on the members of
                    the Associate Presbytery on the 15th of May 1740, their number had increased to
                    <hi rend="italic">eight.</hi></p>
                <p>“Five years after this, when the Associate Presbytery constituted itself into a
                    synod, on the first Tuesday of March 1745, the number of ministers amounted to
                    <hi rend="italic">twenty-six.</hi></p>
                <p>“When the division occasioned by the burgess oath controversy took place, on the
                    9th of April 1747, the number had increased to <hi rend="italic"
                    >thirty-two.</hi></p>
                <p>“When the re-union was accomplished, on the 5th of September 1820, the number of
                    ministers belonging to the two synods that were united on that occasion amounted
                    to <hi rend="italic">two hundred and sixty-two.</hi></p>
                <p>“Since that event took place a period of nineteen years has elapsed, and the
                    number of ordained ministers who are members of the United Associate Synod
                    amounts at the present period to <hi rend="italic">three hundred and
                    fifty-seven,</hi> being an in crease, since the re-union, of nearly <hi
                    rend="italic">one hundred</hi> ministers.”</p>
                <p>From accurate returns made by the different congregations, it has been
                    ascertained that the population connected with the Secession Church, including
                    young and old, amounts to 261,345; the number of communicants is 126,070; the
                    sabbath-schools and classes, 716; the number of scholars, 37,612. The average
                    number of persons connected with each congregation is 730, the average number of
                    communicants is 349. The stipends of the ministers vary from L.70 to L.450. The
                    average paid to each minister, exclusive of sacramental expenses, is L.131. In
                    the country, in addition to the stipend, the minister is generally furnished
                    with a dwelling-house. None of the ministers have or ever had a legal bond
                    securing their incomes.</p>

                <p>A considerable number of missionaries and catechists are maintained in Canada,
                    Jamaica, and other places, either by the synod or by individual congregations in
                    connection with the Secession Church; and many congregations, particularly in
                    the larger towns, support one or more local missionaries at their own
                    expense.</p>
                <p>The Presbyterian Synod of Ireland in connection with the United Associate Synod
                    comprehends nine presbyteries and 134 congregations. Proposals are at present
                    making for a union between this body and the Synod of Ulster. The Synod of Nova
                    Scotia contains five presbyteries and twenty-four congregations.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Associate Synod of Original Seceders.</hi> This body separated
                    from the Antiburgher Synod in 1806, and formed themselves into a distinct
                    presbytery, called at first <hi rend="italic">The constitutional Associate
                    Presbytery;</hi> but after their junction with the few ministers who refused to
                    accede to the union of the Burghers and Antiburghers in 1820, they assumed the
                    name of <hi rend="italic">The Associate Synod of Original Seceders.</hi> This
                    body now extends to four presbyteries, comprehending thirty-six congregations.
                    They have a professor of divinity of their own, and, with the exception of their
                    opinion respecting the interference of the magistrate in religious matters, they
                    are identical in their leading principles with the United Associate Synod. The
                    late Dr M‘Crie, the able and learned biographer of Knox and Melville, was a
                    minister of this body.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Original Burgher Associate Synod.</hi> In our history of the
                    Secession Church we gave a brief statement of the controversy which led to the
                    separation of this body from her communion. They extended latterly to four
                    presbyteries, including forty-two congregations. A short time ago, however, they
                    made a formal application to be received into the communion of the Established
                    Church. The proposal met with a favourable reception from the General Assembly,
                    and at the meeting of the Burgher Synod in 1839 a majority of the members agreed
                    to accept of the terms offered by the Assembly, and have accordingly returned
                    into the bosom of the national church. The minority seem as yet not to have
                    determined as to the course which they will pursue.</p>
