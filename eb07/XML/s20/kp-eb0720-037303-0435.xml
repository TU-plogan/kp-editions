                    lawyer, was the second son of James Skene of Ramore, and of Janet the second
                    daughter of Alexander Burnet of Leys. He thus derived his lineage from the
                    ancient family of Skene of Skene. We may place his birth about the year 1540. He
                    is said to have been partly educated at King’s College, Aberdeen; but he is
                    known to have been incorporated at St. Andrews in the year 1556; and in this
                    university he took the degree of A.M. In 1564 and 1565 he taught as one of the
                    regents of St. Mary’s College. According to Dempster, he spent a great part of
                    his youth in Norway, Denmark, and Poland, and had thus an opportunity of
                    acquiring a familiar acquaintance with modern languages, as well as of extending
                    his knowledge of men and manners.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    imbued with some knowledge of the civil law. He appears to have begun his
                    travels in 1567, and to have returned in 1574.<note anchored="true"

                    legal profession, and was admitted as an advocate on the 19th of March 1575. He
                    speedily acquired some degree of distinction as a lawyer.</p>
                <p>The earl of Morton, then regent of the kingdom, had formed a plan for reducing
                    the laws into a more easy form and method. The execution of the plan was
                    committed to Skene and to Sir James Balfour, president of the court of session.
                    Among other ostensible coadjutors, we find Lord Glammis, chancellor, Lord
                    Ruthven, and William Baillie of Provand, who likewise attained to the dignity of
                    president. The only result of this commission is supposed to have been the
                    compilation of a book which passes under the title of Sir James Balfour’s
                    Practicks. “If I might be allowed to indulge in conjecture,” says Mr. Thomson,
                    “I should be inclined to suppose, that the conception or project of this digest
                    of the laws may have originated with Balfour; that his own exile afterwards
                    precluded him from continuing to take any part in its execution; that the active
                    drudgery of the proposed investigation was devolved upon younger men; and that
                    the unfinished result of their labours is perhaps no other than the volume of
                    Practicks to which the name of Sir James Balfour has been traditionally
                    annexed.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Dempstcri
                    Historia Ecclesiastica Gentis Scotorum, p. 600.</p></note> It is at least
                    evident that the work must have been interpolated; for, as Lord Hailes has
                    remarked, it mentions certain acts of parliament, and the names of certain
                    peers, that did not exist till after the death of Balfour. Of this compilation,
                    which was not printed till 1754, the value has never been highly estimated. The
                    labours of Skene, whatever may have been their nature or extent, were, on the
                    10th of June 1577, rewarded by the grant of an annual pension of “ten chalders
                    of meal,” payable out of the revenues of the abbey of Aberbrothock.</p>
                <p>In the year 1589 he was employed in another capacity. Sir James Melville was
                    selected by the king as his ambassador to the court of Denmark, for the purpose
                    of negoci∙ ating a marriage with a Danish princess; and he required the advice
                    and assistance of a lawyer, with a special reference to the Danish claims on
                    Orkney. “When I schew his maieste,” says Melville, “that I wald tak with me, for
                    man of law, Mester Jhon Skein, his maieste thocht then that ther wer many better

                    part of this undertaking devolved upon Skene; and after an interval of five
                    years, he published “The Lawes and Actes of Parliament maid be King lames the
                    First and his Svccessovrs, Kinges of Scotland: visied, collected, and extracted

                    present mode of reckoning, the book was published in the year 1598. With a
                    separate title, it includes a treatise “De Verborum Significatione. The
                    Exposition of the Termes and difficill Wordes, conteined in the fovre bvikes of

                <p>In September 1594 he had been appointed to the office of Clerk Register, in the
                    room of Alexander Hay of Easter Kennet, whom he also succeeded as one of the
                    Judges of the Court of Session. He was admitted on the 30th of November. For his
                    preferment he is said to have been indebted to the influence of Walter Stewart,
                    prior of Blantyre, who had married a sister of Skene’s wife, Helen the daughter
                    of Sir James Somerville of Cambusnethan. In 1596 he was nominated one of the
                    commissioners of the exchequer, commonly described as the Octavians; but being
                    viewed by the people as a dangerous junto, they relinquished their office in the
                    course of the following year. In 1604 he was associated with other commissioners
                    for discussing the terms of a union between the two kingdoms.</p>
                <p>About the beginning of the year 1607 he had prepared another work for the press;

                    and literature,” the privy council, after having examined it, addressed a letter

                    procuring some remuneration to the editor, a sum of money was ordered to be paid
                    by the sherifls, bailies, stewards, and other judges, and likewise by the
                    prelates, earls, lords, and boroughs of the kingdom. A commission was appointed
                    for the purpose of fixing the rate of the different contributions. James
                    Carmichael, minister of Haddington, was selected as the fittest person for
                    correcting the press; and on the 13th of October 1608, the privy council

                <p>The labours of Sir John Skene were highly valued by his contemporaries, who must
                    have found them useful at a period when so little had been effected for
                    illustrating either the principles or the history of our law. It is not however
                    to be concealed that his publications are deficient in critical accuracy, and
                    even in editorial fidelity. It is well known that the treatise “De Legibus et
                    Consuetudinibus Regni Angliae,” commonly ascribed to Glanville, was at an early
                    period adopted in Scotland, with a few changes and modifications; and that,
                    under this new form, it bears the title of <hi rend="italic">Begiam
                    Majestatem,</hi> from the initial words of the prologue. Ranulph Glanville was
                    chief justice of England during the reign of Henry the Second, and he still
                    retained his office when Richard succeeded to the throne.<note anchored="true"

                    although it perhaps was not written by him, yet it seems to have been wholly

                    by no means describes the chief justice as the author. From these words, says
                    Lord Lyttelton, I infer that the book was not written by Glanville himself, “but
                    by some clergyman, under his direction and care; I say clergyman, because it is
                    written in Latin, which could hardly be done but by a clergyman of that

                    was however anxious to exhibit <hi rend="italic">Begiam Majestatem</hi> as the
                    original, and to represent it as having been composed and divulged by the
                    authority of David the First, who closed his reign in the year 1153. From what
                    manuscripts he derived his text, he has not thought proper to specify; but
                    several are to be found which contain a reference to Glanville by name. Henry,
                    under whom he acted as chief justice, did not begin his reign till the year
                    1154. Lord Cromarty’s MS. contains references to the gloss on the Decretals of
                    Gregory IX. and to the Decretals of Boniface VIII.<note anchored="true"

                    Boniface from 1294 to 1303. It is sufficiently evident that a writer in the
                    reign of David could not quote such authorities. Of this circumstance Skene was
                    sufficiently aware; and the passages which refer to Glanville and the canon law
                    are silently excluded from his edition. This is not merely a defect in literary
                    accuracy; it is a want of that ordinary fidelity which every editor is bound to
                    exercise. If he had excluded such passages from the text, and stated in the
                    notes his reasons for rejecting them as spurious, his conduct would not have
                    been liable to censure.</p>

                    gister; but his attempt was defeated by the dexterity of Sir Thomas Hamilton,
                    afterwards successively earl of Melrose and of Haddington. “Thinking to get his
                    son provided to his office,” says Spotswood, he “had sent him to court with a
                    dimission of the place, but with a charge not to use it, unless he found the
                    king willing to admit him: yet he, abused by some politick wits, made a
                    resignation of the office, accepting an ordinary place among the Lords of
                    Session. The office upon his resignation was presently disponed to the advocate;
                    which grieved the father beyond all measure. And the case indeed was pitiful,
                    and much regrated by all honest men; for he had been a man much employed, and
                    honoured with divers legations, which he discharged with good credit, and now in
                    age to be circumvented in this sort by the simplicity or folly of his son, 'twas
                    held lamentable. The king being informed of the abuse by the old mans complaint,
                    was very careful to satisfie him, and to have the son reconciled to his father,
                    which after some travel was brought to pass: yet so exceeding was the old man’s
                    discontent, as within a few days he deceased.”<note anchored="true"

                <p>At that period the legal profession not unfrequently opened the road to
                    emoluments and wealth comparatively great. He acquired the demesnes of
                    Curriehill and Redhall in the county of Edinburgh, and Edinganoch in the county
                    of Aberdeen. His title on the bench was Lord Curriehill. His son Sir James Skene
                    succeeded him on the 12th of June 1612, and became president of the Court of
                    Session on the 14th of February 1626. On the 15th of October 1633, he died in
                    his own house near the grammar school. The second son, named John, was appointed
                    one of the principal clerks of Session in 1614. He purchased the estate of
                    Hallyards. About twenty years ago, his last descendant, Elizabeth Skene,
                    bequeathed to the Advocates Library a collection of family papers, together with
                    a very curious collection of ancient music, which appears to have belonged to
                    this ancestor. The <hi rend="italic">Shene Papers</hi> have been carefully bound
                    in a folio volume; and the music has very recently been published by Mr. Dauney,

                    Alexander Hay of Fosterseat, a judge and privy councillor. The second daughter
                    was married to Sir William Scott of Ardross; the third to Robert Lermont,

                <p>The clerk register had a brother named Alexander, who was likewise an advocate
                    and an author. For some time at least, he must have adhered to the popish

                    of Edinburgh for attending mass, but was released at the intercession of William
