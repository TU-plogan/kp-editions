                    significant corrections to the OCR text, predominantly in cases of confusing "c"

                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra
                    space around the <gi>pb</gi> tag. Where a word is hyphenated at a <gi>pb</gi>,

                <p><label type="entry">SKYE</label>, the largest of the western islands of Scotland,
                    is situated between the outer range of the Hebrides, and the mainland of
                    Scotland, from which it is separated by a narrow strait, varying from a gun-shot
                    to three miles in breadth. It forms part of the county of Inverness, and is
                    divided into seven parishes. The extreme length of the island is about
                    forty-five miles, and its extreme breadth twenty-four miles; but a better idea
                    of its dimensions will be formed, by measuring it across the middle, which will
                    give a mean breadth of fifteen miles. These measurements do not, however, give
                    any idea of the superficial extent of the island, in consequence of the
                    remarkable indentations of the coast, no part of the island being distant four
                    miles from the seashore. The area of the island is computed at 700 square miles,
                    and contains therefore 448,000 acres, of which 30,000 are arable. It is divided
                    into five districts. The south-east district, which is close upon the mainland,
                    is called S1eat. The greater portion of the central part of the island is named
                    Minginish, whilst the northern extremity is divided by Loch Snizort and Loch
                    Follart into three extensive tracts of land, called Trottemish, on the
                    north-eastern, Water-nish on the north-west, and Kilmuir on the west side.</p>
                <p>The position of Skye protects it in some measure from the storms that assail the
                    outer range of islands. The numerous lochs provide it with a variety of
                    excellent bays and harbours, which point it out as admirably adapted for
                    carrying on the fisheries, but which, from the habits of the people, has never
                    been prosecuted to any extent. The surface of the island is invariably hilly,
                    and may be called one great mountainous moorland, presenting three distinct
                    assemblages of mountains, which are separated by intervening tracts of high and
                    undulating land. Kilmuir plain, and a small tract of land near Loch Braccadale,
                    are the only exceptions.</p>
                <p>In that part of the country, in the southern border of Minginish, occurs the
                    greatest assemblage of mountains. They are divided into two portions, intimately
                    united, but characterised by striking differences in their external outlines and
                    general features. The range called the Cuchullins, so often mentioned by Ossian,
                    average in height from 2000 to 3000 feet above the level of the sea. On the:
                    west side of the island, the land is from 600 to 1000 feet in height, and its
                    surface is covered with brown heath. The northeastern portion of the island,
                    Trotternish, offers more variety, and it attains an altitude of 2000 feet in
                    height. The shore scenery is famed for the caves with which they abound, and the
                    mountainous parts of the island for wild and rugged scenery, equal in grandeur
                    to any in the Highlands.</p>
                <p>The south-east portion of the island, from the point of Sleat to Kyle-rhea,
                    consists of regular stratified rock, which, whether primary or secondary, extend
                    in a line from southwest to north-east; but the remaining mass of the island
                    must be considered as formed of unstratified rock, all belonging to the family
                    of trap, (including under that term syenite), and all incumbent on the
                    stratified rocks, and of posterior date.</p>
                <p>From the height of the hills, and the proximity of the sea, the air seldom
                    continues long of the same temperature; sometimes it is dry, offener moist, and
                    in the latter end of winter and beginning of spring cold and piercing. At an
                    average, three days in twelve, throughout the whole year, are scarcely free from
                    rain, far less from clouds. These, attracted by the hills, sometimes break in
                    useful and refreshing showers; at other times suddenly bursting, they pour down
                    their contents with tremendous noise, and impetuous torrents deluge the plains
                    below, and render the smallest rivulet impassable, which, together with the
                    stormy winds so common in this country in the months of August and September,
                    frequently blast the hopes of the husbandman. Snow has been often known to lie
                    on the ground from three to seven weeks.</p>
                <p>Skye is not well adapted for agriculture. The soil is good, but too light for the
                    culture of wheat; oats are raised in considerable quantities, which, with barley
                    and potatoes, form the agricultural produce of the island. Much might be done in
                    the improvement of the land, for the subsoil is every where of the finest
                    quality, and both in the trap and the gneiss districts, the calcareous rock is
                    found to be decomposed to the depth of several feet, and yielding a loam of
                    excellent quality. The greater part, however, is suffocated with peat or stones,
                    and is swampy and rocky. The peat is nevertheless thin, and by burning the peat,
                    and turning up the rock, either by manual labour, or by the subsoil plough, and
                    proper drainage, the agriculture of the island, in course of time, would be much
                    improved. The land is also rendered cold by the want of trees, for which the
                    soil and climate are well adapted. Skye is unquestionably a grazing country, and
                    the proprietors have wisely directed their attention to the improvement of the
                    stock of black cattle and sheep, and to the enlargement of their farms, of which
                    they have latterly in many places given leases. Kelp in former years was
                    manufactured to a considerable extent, but that branch of industry is now nearly
                    annihilated. The climate is, as already stated, damp, and the farmers in
                    consequence are all provided with wattled barns, in which they may dry their
                    scanty crops in the rainy season. The <hi rend="italic">caschrome,</hi> or
                    ancient crooked spade, is a good deal used by the poor, and the <hi
                    rend="italic">quern,</hi> or handmill, is still to be found in some of the
                    remote districts of the island. The roads in Skye are much superior to those of
                    Mull, and they traverse the island in various directions.<pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:chi.28490924&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=443" xml:id="kp-eb0720-0443-0381"/>
                    The people are of short stature, robust, and healthy. They generally profess the
                    Protestant religion; but education is in a very low state. In 1831, one half of
                    the population were unable to read in any language. Great numbers have lately
                    emigrated to America. The towns in Skye are of no importance. The population in
                    1821 amounted to 20,627; and in 1831, to 22,796, of whom 11,883 were
                    females.</p>
                <p>There are two or three fairs held annually at Portree, the principal town, to
                    which almost every part of Skye sends cattle. The commodities which are sold
                    there are horses, cows, sheep, goats, hides, butter, cheese, fish, and wool. In
                    Skye appear many ruins of Danish forts, watch-towers, beacons, temples, and
                    sepulchral monuments. All the forts are known by the term Dun; such as
                    Dun-Skudborg, Dun-Derig, Dun-Skeriness, Dun-David, and so on.</p>
