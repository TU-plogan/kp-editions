                    of</hi></label>. The natural agreeableness, disagreeableness, and indifference
                    of our sensations and perceptions, present to the mind an important and
                    extensive field of inquiry; and on this subject we shall here make a few
                    observations. All our senses have been certainly bestowed upon us for wise and
                    beneficent purposes; and accordingly we find, that all of them, when properly
                    cultivated, or exercised and improved, are capable of affording us pleasure. The
                    senses of smell and of taste seem rather intended for the preservation of our
                    animal existence, and in this point of view are properly an object of the
                    natural history of man; whilst the other three seem to be more peculiarly
                    intended for our mental improvement, and accordingly form the object of
                    intellectual and of moral philosophy. And agreeably to this we know that we
                    derive a great deal of useful knowledge, in an easy and simple manner,
                    concerning the objects that surround us, in the early part of life, from all the
                    senses, particularly from sight and touch, and this too without labour or study.
                    But this is not the only purpose for which the senses were designed.</p>
                <p>It being thus certain that the senses were bestowed upon us partly to preserve
                    our animal existence, and partly for our mental improvement, it seems
                    reasonable, even <hi rend="italic">a priori,</hi> to expect that nature would
                    attach some pleasure to such use and exercise of them as are calculated to
                    promote these ends, and pain to the contrary; particularly in those instances in
                    which she has left the management of them subject to our own control. And
                    accordingly we cannot but observe what delight we derive from our senses,
                    especially in the morning of life, by which it would seem that nature intended
                    thus winningly to invite us to the proper exercise and improvement of them, and
                    as it were unconsciously acquire much useful knowledge. It is this species of
                    pleasure that supports and excites boys in the constant and often immoderate
                    exercise of their organs of voluntary motion, the powers of which are thus
                    increased and invigorated.</p>
                <p>The exercise and improvement of the senses being subservient to our intellectual
                    improvement, nature has also kindly attached much refined and rational pleasure
                    to the mental exertions; so that we are thus seduced, as it were, to the
                    cultivation of the various extraordinary powers and faculties of the mind.</p>
                <p>It is evident that nature has given such organs and faculties to man. as are
                    calculated not only to make him live, but also to render life agreeable. Here
                    too we obtain a slight glimpse at least of some of the final causes of the
                    pleasures of sense. But if it be asked how it happens that there are such wide
                    diversities between our sensations, some being by nature very agreeable to all
                    men, and some as disagreeable, whilst there are others so indifferent as to give
                    neither pleasure nor pain, we must confess that we can give no satisfactory
                    answer, to show how so many very different sensations are produced by vnrious
                    kinds of impressions made on certain organs of the body, and how all these
                    different impressions excite such sensations as suggest not only corresponding
                    perceptions and external qualities, but at the same time affect the mind with
                    pleasure, pain, trouble, anxiety, or disgust. To be successful in these
                    inquiries, we must presuppose some knowledge of the nature of the connection
                    subsisting between the mind and the body, which there is reason to think is
                    placed beyond the limits prescribed by nature to human research.</p>
                <p>The pleasure or pain which constantly attends certain<pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:chi.28490924&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=111" xml:id="kp-eb0720-0111-0097"/>
                    sensations is not uniform in degree, but varies considerably, not only in
                    different individuals, but even in the same persons at different times. It is
                    not thus with the sensations themselves. These are always constant and uniform.
                    The same kind of impression, when the organs are sound, uniformly and invariably
                    produces similar sensations; and these are as invariably followed by the
                    perception of their own peculiar exciting causes. For any particular impression
                    is never known to excite in the same person a new sensation, or the perceptions
                    of an external object different from that which it previously suggested,
                    excepting in cases of disease. And when it does rarely occur, as in those who
                    cannot distinguish a particular colour, smell, or taste, from certain others, we
                    uniformly attribute it to disease or malconformation. Were we not thus to have
                    uniformly similar sensations and perceptions of external objects from similar
                    impressions, the senses would not be at all subservient to our intellectual
                    improvement, since, by giving different lessons concerning the same or similar
                    objects at different times, they would render it impossible for us to be certain
                    of any thing, or to benefit by experience.</p>
                <p>The effects of custom, which are at all times so considerable and evident with
                    respect both to the mind and the body, as in the case of particular organs or
                    faculties much improved by attention and exercise, have little or no influence
                    at all in interrupting or modifying this uniformity in our sensations and
                    perceptions. For no sound or properly organized person will, either naturally or
                    by custom, ever mistake hardness for softness, or red for green, or sweet for
                    bitter. But the influence of custom in modifying the pains and pleasures of
                    sense is well known and considerable. For a person who can most accurately
                    distinguish sweetness from sourness, will, at the same time, either by
                    particular conformation, or more frequently in consequence of use and habit,
                    prefer wormwood or tobacco to honey.</p>
                <p>But although we may despair of ever being able to discover the physical cause of
                    the pleasures and pains of the senses, we may, however, advance a little by
                    observing and registering particular facts. It is accordingly of use to remark,
                    that every species of sensation, if its nature be otherwise unchanged, is
                    agreeable or disagreeable in proportion to its strength or intenseness. For
                    there is no sensation, however agreeable, that will not become disagreeable, and
                    even intolerable, if it be immoderately intense. And, on the contrary, those
                    which by their strength and nature are very troublesome, if rendered more mild
                    and moderate, become not only tolerable, but agreeable. Thus, with respect to
                    the senses, it would seem that pain and pleasure are only different degrees of
                    the same feeling; and when we consider the great varieties of which the
                    sensation, not only of different organs, but even of any one of them, is
                    susceptible, and that each degree of these may be accompanied with pleasure or
                    pain, more or less, we must conclude that the pains and pleasures of sense are
                    capable of numberless modifications both in degree and in kind.</p>
                <p>We frequently observe, that sensations which were at first agreeable, if often
                    repeated, lose their relish, though the nature and strength of the impressions
                    be the same; whilst others, from being at first very disagreeable, as the taste
                    of tobacco and opium, become very pleasing, though the nature and strength of
                    the impressions have suffered no change. For the explanation of such facts as
                    these we must have recourse to the effects of custom. Thus, in both these
                    opposite cases, the sensations, from being often repeated, lose part of the
                    strength and of the novelty of their first impressions; and, with respect to the
                    former instance, being unable to command the attention, they become in the
                    course of time almost wholly, or altogether neglected, whilst in the latter
                    case, from being very offensive, they become highly agreeable. But if it be
                    asked why habit and custom produce these effects, and in what manner, we are un
                    able to explain it farther, than by saying, since the fact is unquestionable,
                    that such is the nature of the human constitution. Of the effects themselves, no
                    man can entertain a doubt; and their causes, though at present unknown, may by
                    time and inquiry be further developed and simplified.</p>
                <p>“The labyrinth,” says Dr Reid, “may be too intricate, and the thread too fine, to
                    be traced through all its windings; but if we stop where we can trace it no
                    farther, and secure the ground we have gained, there is no harm done; a quicker
                    eye may in time trace it farther.”</p>
                <p>These principles are capable of affording us still farther explanations. Why are
                    new sensations always more agreeable, and variety so pleasing? Because they fix
                    the attention more, and are not as yet blunted by frequent repetition or by
                    habit. It is because some sensations lose their wonted effect by custom and by
                    repetition, that we require stronger ones, or at least stronger impressions on
                    the organs and nerves, to increase or continue our pleasures. It is also in
                    consequence of their becoming less poignant through habit that we may neglect so
                    many pleasures, which we hardly know to be such, till they have flown for ever;
                    and it is because in the morning of life every thing has more novelty, and
                    because habit has not destroyed their relish, that the pleasures of youth are
                    much more intense than those of age. The degree of pleasure is similar to that
                    which a blind man would feel on being made to see, or to that which a man would
                    enjoy on suddenly acquiring a new sensitive faculty, although by long use and
                    habit these pleasures are at present for the most part or wholly blotted
                    away.</p>
                <p>Although most sensations, when strong and lively enough to make themselves
                    accurately and easily distinguished, generally please most, each in its own kind
                    and manner; still, as there are different kinds of pleasure, different
                    sensations may please the mind in various ways; and accordingly, it is not from
                    the lustre of the midday sun, nor from the beautiful and lively appearance of
                    all nature at noon, solely, that the eyes can derive pleasure, any more than
                    grand musical sounds are the only things that please the ear. For we often
                    contemplate with a very different and a very considerable degree of pleasure the
                    sublime and awful scenes of nature, the twilight darkness of the shady grove,
                    and even the gloomy horror of night itself. We listen with delight. to the
                    tempest shaking the forest, as well as to the gentle murmurs of the passing
                    stream. There is even a time when nothing gives so much pleasure as darkness,
                    silence, and the absence of all sensation.</p>
                <p>Amidst the great variety of good and evil with which we are everywhere
                    surrounded, it is a matter of the highest importance to be able to discern
                    aright. This we should be incapable of doing were we not endowed with agreeable
                    as well as painful sensations. These serve to direct our choice. Whatever
                    contributes in any degree to our preservation, and to the improvement of our
                    organs and faculties, is accompanied with pleasure; and, on the contrary, when
                    we are threatened with danger, a painful sensation gives us the alarm. It is to
                    the establishment of this law that we are indebted for the duration of our
                    lives, the improved and vigorous state of our faculties, and the enjoyment of
                    that small portion of happiness allotted to us by nature. “God,” says a French
                    writer, “having endowed man with various faculties, bodily as well as
                    intellectual, in order to promote his happiness, also vouchsafes to conduct him
                    to this noble end, not only by the deductions of reason, but also by the force
                    of instinct and sensation, which are more powerful and efficacious principles.
                    Thus nature, by a sensation of pain, instantaneously apprises us of what might
                    prove hurtful to us; and, on the contrary, by an agreeable sensation, gently
                    leads us to whatever may tend to the preservation of our existence, and to the
                    perfect state of our faculties, these being the two points on which our
                    happiness depends. Our faculties can neither be of use, nor dis-<pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:chi.28490924&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=112" xml:id="kp-eb0720-0112-0098"/>
                    play themselves, farther than as we exercise them. Motion or action is therefore
                    so necessary to us, that without it we must inevitably sink into a deplorable
                    state of insensibility and languor. On the other hand, as we arc weak and
                    limited creatures, all excessive and violent action would impair and destroy our
                    organs; we must therefore use only moderate motion or exercise, since by these
                    means the use or perfection of our faculties is reconciled with our chief
                    interest, which is self-preservation. Now it is to this happy medium, we mean to
                    a moderate exercise of our faculties, that the Author of our nature has so
                    wisely annexed pleasure.</p>
                <p>The pleasures of sense are thus confined within narrow limits; for they cannot be
                    much increased without pain, or often repeated without losing their relish, at
                    least in a great measure; nor can they be long continued, partly for the same
                    reason, and because they exhaust the mind, or rather the nervous system. Hence
                    we see that our animal appetites are confined within a narrow range, as is
                    evident from the effects of excess in eating and drinking. All our sensitive
                    powers are impaired; whilst, on the contrary, our intellectual powers are
                    strengthened and improved by use and exercise. And in proportion as we indulge
                    our sensitive powers, our desires of indulgence increase, whilst the pleasures
                    which are the objects of these desires become regularly less poignant. These,
                    indeed, are wise regulations of nature; for it would seem as if she intended to
                    whisper gently to us in this way, by means of practical experience, that we are
                    not born solely for the enjoyment of pleasure, at least not for that of the
                    pleasures of the senses; for all of them, as we have already remarked, if much
                    indulged, lead to listlessness and disgust, and sometimes to considerable pain.
                    And indeed, just as pleasure passes thus readily into trouble and pain, so does
                    the sudden cessation of pain, at least when this has been considerable, produce
                    often extraordinary pleasure; so that we may here apply the beautiful allegory
                    of Socrates, “that although pleasure and pain arc contrary in their nature, and
                    have their faces turned different ways, yet that Jupiter has tied them so
                    together, that he who lays hold of the one draws the other along with it.”</p>
                <p>We have just said, that the sudden cessation of pain, at least when this has been
                    considerable, produces often extraordinary pleasure. But this opinion seems to
                    be denied by the author of an inquiry concerning taste. “Among the pleasures of
                    sense,” says Mr Knight, “more particularly among those belonging to touch, there
                    is a certain class, which, though arising from negative causes, are nevertheless
                    real and positive pleasures; as when we gradually sink from any violent or
                    excessive degree of action or irritation into a state of tranquillity and
                    repose. I say gradually, for if the transition be sudden and abrupt, it will not
                    be pleasant; the pleasure arising from the inverted action of the nerves, and
                    not from the utter cessation of action. From this inverted action arises the
                    gratification which we receive from a cool breeze when the body has been
                    excessively heated; or from the rocking of a cradle, or the gentle motion of a
                    boat, or easy carriage, after having been fatigued with violent exercise. Such,
                    too, is that which twilight, or the gloomy shade of a thicket, affords to the
                    eye after it has been dazzled by the blaze of the mid-day sun; and such,
                    likewise, is that which the ear receives from the gradual diminution of loudness
                    of tone in music.” That pleasure follows a gradual cessation of any violent
                    action or irritation, we mean not to deny; but we are at a loss to comprehend
                    how it follows that the transition from strong pain, if it be sudden and abrupt,
                    will not be pleasant.</p>
                <p>But although the pleasures of sense be thus limited, these limits are very
                    different with respect to the different senses. Some of them are soon exhausted,
                    and do not any longer distinguish well the objects that correspond to them; nor
                    are they pleased with those objects which were at first very agreeable, and
                    which they distinguish with sufficient accuracy; whilst others continue to
                    perform their functions longer, and to enjoy a more continued pleasure. Thus the
                    senses of smell and of taste are almost immediately satiated, the sense of
                    hearing more slowly; but the sight is in this respect the last of all to be
                    fatigued or satiated; whilst the pleasures that arise from the exercise of our
                    mental faculties are by far the most durable of all. “Exercise of the mind is as
                    necessary as that of the body to preserve our existence. The senses of other
                    animals, being more quick than ours, are sufficient to direct them to follow
                    what is agreeable to their nature, or to shun whatever is contrary thereto. But
                    we are endowed with reason in order to supply the deficiency of our senses; and
                    pleasure presents herself as an incitement to exercise, in order to keep the
                    mind from a state of hurtful inactivity. Pleasure is not only the parent of
                    sports and amusements, but also of arts and sciences; and as the whole universe
                    is, as it were, forced by our industry to pay tribute to our wants and desires,
                    we cannot but acknowledge our obligation to that law of nature which has annexed
                    a degree of pleasure to whatever exercises without fatiguing the mind. The
                    pleasure accompanying it is sometimes so great that it transports the very soul,
                    so that she seems as it were disengaged from the body. We know what is recorded
                    in history concerning Archimedes,<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>When Syracuse was taken by the Romane under Marcellus,
                    Archimedes was in bis study, so intent upon some geometrical problems, that he
                    neither heard the clamour of the Romans, nor perceived that the city was taken.
                    In this transport of study and contemplation, a soldier came on him with his
                    drawn sword; Archimedes, on seeing him, besought him to hold his hand till he
                    had finished the problem he was about. But the soldier, deaf to his entreaty,
                    ran him through the body, although Marcellus, upon entering the city, had given
                    orders that Archimedes should be spared.</p></note> and several other
                    geometricians, both ancient and modem. If we doubt the truth of such facts, we
                    must at least acknowledge their probability, since we meet every day with a
                    number of similar examples. When we see a chess-player so deeply immersed in
                    thought as to be in a manner lost to his outward senses, should we not imagine
                    him to be wholly engrossed with the care of his own private affairs, or of the
                    public weal? But the object of all this profound meditation is the pleasure of
                    exercising the mind by the movement of a piece of ivory. From this exercise of
                    the mind also arises the pleasure we sometimes take in refined and delicate
                    sentiments, which, after the manner of Virgil’s shepherdess <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Et fugit ad salices, sed se cupit ante videri),</hi> are sometimes artfully
                    concealed, but so as to afford us the pleasure of discovering them.”<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">Théorie det

                <p>From some of the foregoing remarks we likewise see that nature points out to us
                    the superiority and excellence of our mental faculties, thus suggesting to us
                    that we ought to cultivate them most, as being our better and nobler part, to
                    the cultivation of which that of our sensitive faculties should be merely
                    subservient. But although our pleasures are thus by nature rendered in a great
                    degree independent of ourselves, still we have it in our power to make them all
                    more durable, by varying and mixing them with one another, or by interposing
                    between those that are very agreeable others that are less pleasing, so as that
                    no individual pleasure shall be in excess.</p>
                <p>Besides the circumstances already noticed, there are others of a very different
                    kind, which have also considerable influence on the pleasures of the senses;
                    such as different conditions of the whole body, particularly of the nerves, or
                    of certain organs or functions, to which functions some organs of sense, and
                    perhaps even the sensation<pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:chi.28490924&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=113" xml:id="kp-eb0720-0113-0099"/>
                    of these, are in a great measure subservient. This is one of the causes why many
                    pleasures, which we cultivate with all our might, cannot be immortal. If a
                    person be thirsty, spring-water is nectar to him; if hungry, any kind of food is
                    agreeable, even the smell of food is grateful. To a man in a heat, or in a
                    fever, cold is pleasing; and to one in a cold fit nothing is so agreeable as
                    heat. To these same persons, at other times, so far are these things from being
                    agreeable, that they are often disgusting. The most decided glutton cannot
                    always relish a sumptuous feast.</p>
                <p>Besides the sensations excited by external objects, there are others also which
                    cause pain and pleasure. If the action of the muscles be strong, easy, and
                    cheerful, and not continued so as to fatigue us, it causes pleasure. On the
                    contrary, when this action is attended with a sense of listlessness, lassitude,
                    difficulty, and debility, it more or less causes pain. In fine, various states
                    and affections of the mind, such as the exercise of memory, imagination, and
                    judgment, nearly for similar reasons, are sometimes painful, at other times
                    agreeable. “Animi affectus, qui modici grate excitant, vehementes, aut graves et
                    diuturni, hujus pariter ac corporis vires frangunt; hominem interdum statim
                    extinguunt, saepius longa valetudine macerant. Somni etiam, quo ad exhaustas
                    vires reficiendas egemus, excessus, vel defectus, et animo et corpori nocet.”
                    “Desidia, sive animi sive corporis, utriusque vires languescunt: nimia
                    exercitatione haud minus laeduntur. Statuit enim provida rerum parens, ut
                    singularum partium, et universi corporis animique vires usu roborentur et
                    acuantur; et huic iterum certos fines posuit: ita ut neque quem voluit natura
                    usus impune omittatur, neque ultra modum intendatur.” <hi rend="italic"
                    >(conspectus Medicintae.)</hi><hi rend="italic">“Of</hi> such sensations and
                    feelings as are agreeable or disagreeable, we may remark,” says Dr Reid, “that
                    they differ much, not only in degree, but in kind and in dignity. Some belong to
                    the animal part of our nature, and are common to us with the brutes; others
                    belong to the rational and moral part. The first are more properly called
                    sensations, the last feelings. The French word <hi rend="italic">sentiment</hi>
                    is common to both.”</p>
                <p>“The Author of nature, in the distribution of agreeable and painful feelings,
                    hath wisely and benevolently consulted the good of the human species; and hath
                    even shown us, by the same means, what tenor of conduct we ought to hold. For,
                    first, the painful sensations of the animal kind are admonitions to avoid what
                    would hurt us; and the agreeable sensations of this kind invite us to those
                    actions that are necessary to the preservation of the individual, or of the
                    kind. Secondly, by the same means nature invites us to moderate bodily exercise,
                    and admonishes us to avoid idleness and inactivity on the one hand, and
                    excessive labour and fatigue upon the other. Thirdly, the moderate exercise of
                    all our rational powers gives us pleasure. Fourthly, every species of beauty is
                    beheld with pleasure, and every species of deformity with disgust; and we shall
                    find all that we denominate beautiful to be something estimable or useful in
                    itself, or a sign of something that is estimable or useful. Fifthly, the
                    benevolent affections are all accompanied with an . agreeable feeling, the
                    malevolent with the contrary. And, sixthly, the highest, the noblest, and most
                    durable pleasure is that of doing well and acting the part that becomes us; and
                    the most bitter and painful sentiment is the anguish and remorse of a guilty
                    conscience.” These observations with regard to the economy of nature in the
                    distribution of our painful and agreeable sensations and feelings are so well
                    illustrated by the elegant and judicious author of <hi rend="italic">Théorie des
                    Sentiments Agréables,</hi> that we deem it unnecessary to make any further
                    remarks on this subject. A little reflection may satisfy us that the number and
                    variety of our sensations and feelings are prodigious. For, to omit all those
                    which accompany our appetites, passions, and affections, our moral sentiments
                    and sentiments of taste, even our external senses, furnish a variety of
                    sensations differing in kind, and almost in every kind an endless variety of
                    degrees. Every variety we discern with regard to taste, smell, sound, colour,
                    heat, and cold, and in the tangible qualities of bodies, is indicated by a
                    sensation corresponding to it.</p>
                <p>The most general and the most important division of our sensations and feelings
                    is into the agreeable, the disagreeable, and the indifferent. Every thing we
                    call pleasure, happiness, or enjoyment, on the one hand, and, on the other,
                    every thing we call misery, pain, or uneasiness, is sensation or feeling. For no
                    man can for the present be more happy, or more miserable, than he feels himself
                    to be. He cannot be deceived with regard to the enjoyment or suffering of the
                    present moment.</p>
                <p>But, besides the sensations that are agreeable or disagreeable, there is still a
                    greater number that are indifferent. To these we give so little attention that
                    they have no name, and are immediately forgotten, as if they had never been; it
                    even requires attention to the operations of our minds to be convinced of their
                    existence. For this end we may observe, that to a good ear every human voice is
                    distinguishable from all others. Some voices are pleasant, and some
                    disagreeable; but the far greater part cannot be said to be the one or the
                    other. The same thing may be said of other sounds, and no less of tastes,
                    smells, and colours; and if we consider that our senses are in continual
                    exercise while we are awake, that some sensation attends every object they
                    present to us, and that familiar objects seldom raise any emotion pleasant or
                    painful, we shall see reason, besides the agreeable and disagreeable, to admit a
                    third class of sensations, that may be called indifferent. But these sensations
                    that are indifferent are far from being useless. They serve as signs to
                    distinguish things that differ; and the information we have concerning things
                    external comes by these means. Thus, if a man had not a musical ear so as to
                    receive pleasure from the harmony or melody of sounds, he would still find the
                    sense of hearing of great utility. Though sounds gave him neither pleasure nor
                    pain of themselves, they would give him much useful information; and the same
                    may be said of the sensations which we have by all the other senses.</p>
