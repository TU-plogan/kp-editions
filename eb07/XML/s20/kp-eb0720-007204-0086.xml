                <p><label type="entry">SECUNDUS, <hi rend="smallcaps">Joannes Nicoaius</hi></label>,
                    an elegant writer of Latin poetry, was born at the Hague in the year 1511. His
                    descent was from an ancient and honourable family in the Netherlands; and his
                    father Nicoaus Everardus, who was born in the neighbourhood of Middleburg, seems
                    to have been high in the favour of the Emperor Charles V., as he was employed by
                    that monarch in several stations of considerable importance. We find him first a
                    member of the grand parliament or council of Mechelen, afterwards president of
                    the states of Holland and Zealand at the Hague, and lastly holding a similar
                    office at Mechelen, where he died on the 5th of August 1532, aged seventy.</p>
                <p>These various employments did not occupy the whole of Everardus’s time.
                    Notwithstanding the multiplicity of his business, he found leisure to cultivate
                    letters with great success, and even to act as preceptor to his own children,
                    who were five sons and three daughters. They all took the name of Nicoaii from
                    their father; but on what account our author was called Secundus is not known.
                    It could not be from the order of his birth, for he was the youngest son.
                    Perhaps the name was not given him till he became eminent; and then, according
                    to the fashion of the age, it might have arisen from some pun, such as his being
                    <hi rend="italic">Poetarum nemini Secundus.</hi> Poetry, however, was by no
                    means the profession which his father wished him to follow. He intended him for
                    the law, and, when he could no longer direct his studies himself, placed him
                    under the care of Jacobus Valeardus. This man is said to have been every way
                    well qualified to discharge the important trust which was committed to him; and
                    he certainly gained the affection of his pupil, who, in one of his poems,
                    mentions the death of Valeardus with every appearance of unfeigned sorrow.
                    Another tutor was soon provided; but it does not appear that Secundus devoted
                    much of his time to legal pursuits. Poetry, and the sister arts of painting and
                    sculpture, had engaged<pb break="no"

                    his mind at a very early period; and the imagination, on which these lay hold,
                    can with difficulty submit to the dry study of musty civilians. Secundus is said
                    to have written verses when but ten years old; and from the vast quantity which
                    he left behind him, we have reason to conclude that such writing constituted his
                    principal employment. He found time, however, to carve figures of all his own
                    family, of his mistresses, of the Emperor Charles V., of several eminent
                    personages of those times, and of many of his intimate friends; and in the last
                    edition of his works, published by Scriverius, at Leyden, 1631, there is a print
                    of one of his mistresses with this inscription around it: <hi rend="italic"
                    >Vatis amatoris Julia sculpta manu.</hi></p>
                <p>Secundus having nearly attained the age of twenty-one, and being determined, as
                    it would seem, to comply as far as possible with the wishes of his father,
                    quitted Mechelen, and went to France, where, at Bourges, a city in the
                    Orleannois, he studied the civil law under the celebrated Andreas Alciatus.
                    Alciatus was one of the most learned civilians of that age; but that which
                    undoubtedly endeared him much more to our author, was his general acquaintance
                    with polite literature, and more particularly his taste in poetry. Having
                    studied a year under this eminent professor, and taken his degrees, Secundus
                    returned to Mechelen, where he remained only a very few months. In 1533 he went
                    into Spain with warm recommendations to the Count of Nassau and other persons of
                    high rank; and soon afterwards he became secretary to the cardinal archbishop of
                    Toledo, in a department of business which required no other qualifications than
                    what he possessed in a very eminent degree, a facility in writing with elegance
                    the Latin language. It was during his residence with this cardinal that he wrote
                    his <hi rend="italic">Basia,</hi> a series of wanton poems, of which the fifth,
                    seventh, and ninth <hi rend="italic">carmina</hi> of Catullus seem to have given
                    the hint. Secundus was not, however, a servile imitator of Catullus. His
                    expressions seem to be borrowed rather from Tibullus and Propertius; and in the
                    warmth of his descriptions he surpasses every thing that has been written on
                    similar subjects by Catullus, Tibullus, Propertius, C. Gallus, Ovid, or
                    Horace.</p>
                <p>In 1535 he accompanied the Emperor Charles V. to the siege of Tunis, but gained
                    few laurels as a soldier. The hardships which were endured at that memorable
                    siege were but little suited to the soft disposition of a votary of Venus and
                    the muses; and upon an enterprise which might have furnished ample matter for an
                    epic poem, it is remarkable that Secundus wrote nothing which has been deemed
                    worthy of preservation. Having returned from his martial expedition, he was sent
                    by the cardinal to Rome to congratulate the pope upon the success of the
                    emperor’s arms, but was taken so ill on the road, that he was not able to
                    complete his journey. He was advised to seek, without a moment’s delay, the
                    benefit of his native air; and that happily recovered him.</p>
                <p>Having now quitted the service of the archbishop of Toledo, Secundus was employed
                    in the same office of secretary by the bishop of Utrecht; and so much had he
                    hitherto distinguished himself by the classical elegance of his compositions,
                    that he was soon called upon to fill the important post of private Latin
                    secretary to the emperor, who was then in Italy. This was the most honourable
                    office to which our author was ever appointed; but before he could enter upon
                    it, death put a stop to his career of glory. Having arrived at Saint Amand, in
                    the district of Tournay, in order to meet, upon business, with the bishop of
                    Utrecht, he was, upon the 8th of October 1536, cut off by a violent fever, in
                    the very flower of his age, not having quite completed his twenty-fifth year. He
                    was interred in the church of the Benedictines, of which his patron the bishop
                    was abbot; and his near relations erected to his memory a marble monument, with
                    a plain Latin inscription.</p>
                <p>The works of Secundus have gone through several editions, of which the best and
                    most copious is that of Scriverius already mentioned. It consists of, 1. Julia,
                    eleg. lib. i.; 2. Amores, eleg. lib. it.; 3. Ad Diversos, eleg. lib. iii.; 4.
                    Basia, styled by the editor <hi rend="italic">incomparabilis er divinus prorsus
                    liber;</hi> 5. Epigrammata; 6. Odarum liber unus; 7. Epistolarum liber unus; 8.
                    Epistolarum liber alter, heroico carmine scriptus; 9. Funerum liber unus; 10.
                    Sylvie et Carminum fragmenta; 11. Poemata nonnulla fratrum; 12. Itineraria
                    Secundi tria; 13. Epistolae totidem, soluta oratione. Of these works it would be
                    superfluous in us to give any character, after the ample testimonies prefixed to
                    them by Lelius Greg. Gyraldus, the elder Scaliger, Theodore Beza, and others
                    equally celebrated in the republic of letters, who all speak of them as
                    excellent.</p>
