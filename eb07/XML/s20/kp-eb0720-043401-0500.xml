                    significant corrections to the OCR text, predominantly in cases of confusing "c"
                    and "e." Isolates 90 entries that were mistakenly included at the end of prior
                    entries in v1 and v2. Normalizes ordinal numbers. Separates metadata in
                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra
                    space around the <gi>pb</gi> tag. Where a word is hyphenated at a <gi>pb</gi>,

                <p><label type="entry">SOCIETIES</label>, associations voluntarily formed by a
                    number of individuals for promoting knowledge, industry, or virtue. They may
                    therefore be divided into three classes; societies for promoting science and
                    literature, societies for encouraging and promoting arts and manufactures, and
                    societies for diffusing religion and morality and relieving distress. These,
                    however, are so numerous and fluctuating, that it would be difficult to offer
                    any thing like an accurate account of them. The reader is referred for
                    information on the subject to the articles, <hi rend="smallcaps">London Dublin,
                    Edinburgh,</hi> and the other towns and countries where these institutions have
                    been established. We shall only notice the Royal Societies of London and
                    Edinburgh.</p>
                <p>The Royal Society of London is an academy or body of persons of eminent learning,
                    instituted by Charles II., for the promoting of all the different branches of
                    physical knowledge. The origin of this society is traced by Dr. Sprat, its
                    earliest historian, no farther back than to “some space after the end of the
                    civil wars” in the seventeenth century. The scene of the first meetings of the
                    learned men who laid the foundation of it, is by him fixed in the university of
                    Oxford, at the lodgings of Dr. Wilkins, warden of Wadham College. But Dr. Birch,
                    on the authority of Dr. Wallis, one of its earliest and most considerable
                    members, assigns it an earlier origin. According to him, certain worthy persons,
                    residing in London about the year 1645, being “inquisitive into natural and the
                    new and experimental philosophy, agreed to meet weekly on a certain day, to
                    discourse upon such subjects, and were known by the title of <hi rend="italic"
                    >The Invisible</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Philosophical college”</hi> In the
                    years 1648 and 1649, the company who formed these meetings was divided, part
                    retiring to Oxford and part remaining in London; but they continued the same
                    pursuits as when united, corresponding with each other, and giving a mutual
                    account of their respective discoveries. About the year 1659 the greater part of
                    the Oxford society returned to London, and again uniting with their
                    fellow-labourers, met once, if not twice a-week at Gresham College, during
                    term-time, till they were scattered by the public distractions of that year, and
                    the place of their meeting made quarters for soldiers. On the restoration in
                    1660 their meetings were revived, and attended by a greater concourse of men
                    eminent for their rank and learning. They were at last taken notice of by the
                    king, who having himself a considerable taste for physical science, was pleased
                    to grant them an ample charter, dated the 15th of July 1662, and afterwards a
                    second dated 15th April 1663, by which they were erected into a corporation,
                    consisting of a president, council, and fellows, for promoting natural
                    knowledge; and to give their investigations, against which strange prejudices
                    were entertained, every possible support, he sometimes honoured their meetings
                    with his presence.</p>
                <p>Their manner of electing fellows is by balloting. Their council consists of
                    twenty-one, including the president, vice-president, treasurer, and two
                    secretaries, eleven of which are continued for the next year, and ten more added
                    to them; all being chosen on St. Andrew’s day.</p>
                <p>The services which this illustrious society has rendered to the public are very
                    great. They have improved naval, civil, and military architecture; advanced the
                    security and perfection of navigation; improved agriculture; and put not only
                    this kingdom, but also Ireland, the plantations, &amp;c, upon planting. They
                    have registered experiments, histories, relations, observations, &amp;c., and
                    reduced them into one common stock; and have, from time to time, published those
                    which they reckoned most useful, under the title of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Philosophical Transactions,</hi> &amp;c. They have a library adapted to their
                    institution; towards which Mr. Henry Howard, afterwards duke of Norfolk,
                    contributed the Norfolcian library, and which has been vastly increased by a
                    continual series of benefactions.</p>
                <p>The Royal Society of Edinburgh was incorporated by royal charter on the 29th of
                    March 1783, and has for its object the cultivation of every branch of science,
                    erudition, and taste. Its rise and progress towards its present state was as
                    follows. In the year 1718 a literary society was established in Edinburgh by the
                    learned Ruddiman and others, which in 1731 was succeeded by a society instituted
                    for the improvement of medical knowledge. In the year 1739 the celebrated
                    Maclaurin conceived the idea of enlarging the plan of this society, by extending
                    it to subjects of philosophy and literature. The institution was accordingly
                    new-modelled by a printed set of laws and regulations, the number of members was
                    increased, and they were distinguished from that time by the title of <hi
                    rend="italic">The Society for Improving Arts and Sciences,</hi> or more
                    generally by the title of <hi rend="italic">The Philosophical Society of
                    Edinburgh.</hi> Its meetings, however, were soon interrupted by the disorders of
                    the country during the rebellion in 1745; and they were not renewed till the
                    year 1752. Soon after this period the first volume of the Transactions of the
                    Philosophical Society of Edinburgh was published, under the title of <hi
                    rend="italic">Essays and Observations, Physical and Literary,</hi> and was
                    followed by other volumes of acknowledged merit. About the end of the year 1782,
                    in a meeting of the professors of the university of Edinburgh, many of whom were
                    likewise members of the Philosophical Society, and warmly attached to its
                    interests, a scheme was proposed by the late Dr. Robertson, principal of the
                    university, for the establishment of a new society on a more extended plan, and
                    after the model of some of the foreign academies. It appeared an expedient
                    measure to solicit the royal patronage to an institution of this nature, which
                    promised to be of national importance, and to request an establishment by
                    charter from the crown. The plan was approved and adopted; and the Philosophical
                    Society, joining its influence as a body in seconding the application from the
                    university, his majesty, as we have already observed, was graciously pleased to
                    incorporate The Royal Society of Edinburgh by charter.</p>
                <p>Members are elected by ballot. The general business of the society is managed by
                    a president, two vice-presidents, with a council of twelve, a general secretary,
                    and a treasurer. These officers are chosen by ballot annually on the last Monday
                    of November. All public deeds, whether of a civil or of a literary nature, are
                    transacted by this board, and proceed in the name of the president or
                    vice-president.</p>
                <p>As it was thought that the members would have a greater inducement to punctual
                    attendance on the meetings of the society, if they had some general intimation
                    of the nature of the subjects which were to be considered, and made the topics
                    of conversation, it was therefore resolved to divide the society into two
                    classes, which should meet and deliberate separately. One of these classes is
                    denominated the <hi rend="italic">Physical class,</hi> and has for its
                    department the sciences of mathematics, natural philosophy, chemistry, medicine,
                    natural history, and whatever relates to the improvement of arts and
                    manufactures. The other is denominated the <hi rend="italic">Literary
                    class,</hi> and has for its department literature, philology, history,
                    antiquities, and speculative philosophy. There are many valuable papers in the
                    volumes that have been published of the <hi rend="italic">Transactions</hi> of
                    this society.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic smallcaps"> Society</hi><hi rend="italic">Isles,</hi> a cluster
                    of isles, so named by Captain Cook in 1769. They are situated between the
                    latitudes of 16. 10. and 16.55. south, and between the longitudes of 150. 57.
                    and 152. west. See <hi rend="smallcaps">Polynesia.</hi></p>
