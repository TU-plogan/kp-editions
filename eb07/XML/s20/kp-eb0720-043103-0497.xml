                <p><label type="entry">SNOW</label>, a well-known meteor, formed by the freezing of
                    the vapour of water in the atmosphere. It differs from hail and hoar-frost, in
                    being as it were crystallized, which they are not. This appears in examining a
                    flake of snow by a magnifying glass; when the whole of it will appear to be
                    composed of fine shining spicula diverging like rays from a centre. As the
                    flakes fall down through the atmosphere, they are continually joined by more of
                    those radiated spi cula, and thus increase in bulk like the drops of rain or
                    hailstones. Dr. Grew, in a discourse of the nature of snow, observes, that many
                    parts thereof are of a regular figure, for the most part stars of six points,
                    and are as perfect and transparent ice as any we see on a pond. Upon each of
                    these points are other collateral points, set at the same angles as the main
                    points themselves; among which there are divers other irregular, which are
                    chiefly broken points, and fragments of the regular ones. Others also, by
                    various winds, seem to have been thawed and frozen again into irregular
                    clusters, so that it seems as if the whole body of snow were an infinite mass of
                    icicles irregularly figured; that is, a cloud of vapours being gathered into
                    drops, the said drops forthwith descend; upon which descent, meeting with a
                    freezing air as they pass through a colder region, each drop is immediately
                    frozen into an icicle, shooting itself forth into several (points; but these
                    still continuing their descent, and meeting with some intermitting gales of
                    warmer air, or in their continual waftage to and 1fo, touching upon each other,
                    some of them are a little thawed, blunted, and again frozen into clusters, or
                    entangled so as to fall down in what we call flakes.</p>
                <p>The lightness of snow, although it is firm ice, is owing to the excess of its
                    surface, in comparison to the matter contained under it; as gold itself may be
                    extended in surface till it ride upon the least breath of air.</p>
                <p>The whiteness of snow is owing to the small particles into which it is divided;
                    for ice, when pounded, will become equally white. An artificial snow has been
                    made by the following experiment. A tall phial of aquafortis being placed by the
                    fire till it is warm, and filings of pure silver, a few at a time, being put
                    into it, after a brisk ebullition, the silver will dissolve slowly. The phial
                    being then placed in a cold window, as it cools, the silver particles will shoot
                    into crystals, several of which running together, will form a flake of snow,
                    which will descend to the bottom of the phial. While they are descending, they
                    represent perfectly a shower of silver snow, and the flakes will lie upon one
                    another at the bottom, like real snow upon the ground.</p>
                <p>According to Signor Beccaria, clouds of snow differ in nothing from clouds of
                    rain, but in the circumstance of cold that freezes them. Both the regular
                    diffiision of the snow, and the regularity of the structure of its parts,
                    particularly some figures of snow or hail which fall about Turin, show that
                    clouds of snow are acted upon by some uniform cause like electricity; and he
                    endeavours to show how electricity is capable of forming these figures. He was
                    confirmed in his conjectures by perceiving, that his apparatus for observing the
                    electricity of the atmosphere never failed to be electrified by snow as well as
                    rain. Professor Winthrop sometimes found his apparatus electrified by snow when
                    driven about by the wind, though it had not been affected by it when the snow
                    itself was falling. A more intense electricity, according to Beccaria, unites
                    the particles of hail more closely than the more moderate electricity does those
                    of snow, in the same manner as we see that the drops of rain which fall from
                    thunder-clouds are larger than those which fall from others, though the former
                    descend through a less space.</p>
                <p>But we are not to consider snow merely as a curious and beautiful phenomenon. The
                    Great Dispenser of universal bounty has so ordered it, that it is eminently
                    subservient, as well as all the works of creation, to his benevolent designs.
                    Were we to judge from appearances only, we might imagine, that so far from being
                    useful to the earth, the cold humidity of snow would be detrimental to
                    vegetation. But the experience of all ages asserts the contrary. Snow,
                    particularly in those northern regions where the ground is covered with it for
                    several months, fructifies the earth, by guarding the corn or other vegetables
                    from the intenser cold of the air, and especially from the cold piercing
                    winds.<pb break="no" facs="ht:chi.28490924&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=498"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0720-0498-0432"/> Snow or ice water is always deprived of its fixed
                    air, which escapes during the process of congelation. Accordingly, as some of
                    the inhabitants of the Alps who use it for their constant drink, have enormous
                    wens upon their throats, it has been ascribed to this circumstance. If this were
                    the cause of these wens, it would be easy to remove it by exposing the
                    snow-water to the air for some time. But several eminent physicians have
                    rejected the notion that snowwater is the cause of these wens; for in Greenland,
                    where snow-water is commonly used, the inhabitants are not affected with such
                    swellings; and on the other hand, they are common in Sumatra, where snow is
                    never seen.</p>
