                    rend="italic">Richard Brinsley</hi></label>, a distinguished dramatist and
                    politician, was born at Dublin in the month of September 1757, and baptized in
                    St Mary’s Church on the fourth of the following month. His grandfather and
                    father each attained a celebrity, by the friendship with which the former was
                    honoured by Swift, and by the competition, and even rivalry, which the latter so
                    long maintained with Garrick. His mother, too, was a woman of considcrable
                    talents. Her affecting novel, Sidney Biddulph, could boast amongst its
                    panegyrists Mr Fox and Lord North; and in the tale of Nourjahad she employed the
                    graces of oriental fiction to deceive her readers into a taste for true
                    happiness and virtue.</p>
                <p>At the age of seven years, Richard Brinsley Sheridan was, with his eldest brother
                    Charles Francis, placed under the tuition of Mr Samuel Whyte of Grafton Street,
                    Dublin; and after being little more than a year under his care, they were
                    removed to England, where Mr and Mrs Sheridan had lately gone to reside. In the
                    year 1762, Richard was sent to Harrow, Charles being kept at home as a fitter
                    subject for the instructions of the father. At that time, Dr Sumner was at the
                    head of the school, and Dr Parr, who to the massy erudition of a former age
                    joined the free and enlightened intelligence of the present, was one of the
                    under masters. Both he and Dr Sumner endeavoured, by all possible means, to
                    awaken in Sheridan a consciousness of those powers which he manifestly
                    possessed; but remonstrance and encouragement were equally thrown away upon the
                    good-humoured indifference of their pupil. One of the most valuable acquisitions
                    he derived from Harrow, however, was that friendship with Dr Parr, which lasted
                    throughout his life, and which identity of political opinion tended not a little
                    to invigorate.</p>
                <p>On his leaving Harrow, where he continued until about his eighteenth year, he was
                    brought home by his father, who, with the elder son, Charles, had lately
                    returned from France, and taken a house in London. Here the two brothers for
                    some time received private tuition from Mr Lewis Kerr, an Irish gentleman, who
                    had formerly practised as a physician; and they also attended the fencing and
                    riding schools of Mr Angelo, at the same time receiving from their father
                    instructions in English grammar and oratory. Of this advantage, however, the
                    elder son appears alone to have availed himself; and Richard, determined to owe
                    all to nature, was found as impracticable a pupil at home as at school. But,
                    however inattentive to his studies he may have been at Harrow, it is evident,
                    from a letter of his school-fellow, Mr Halhed, that he had already distinguished
                    himself in poetry, and, in conjunction with his friend, had translated the
                    seventh Idyl, and many of the lesser poems of Theocritus. In the year 1770, when
                    Halhed was at Oxford, and Sheridan with his father at Bath, they commenced a
                    correspondence (of which Halhed’s share only remains), and, with all the hope
                    and spirit of young adventurers, began and prosecuted several works, of which
                    none but their translation of Aristaenetus ever saw the light.</p>
                <p>In this copartnership of genius, their first joint production was a play in three
                    acts, called <hi rend="italic">Jupiter,</hi> written in imitation of the
                    burletta of Midas. Of this piece Halhed, who had furnished the burlesque scenes,
                    entertained great hopes; nor were those of Sheridan less earnest and sanguine;
                    yet that habit of dilatoriness, which is too often attendant upon genius, and
                    which, throughout life, was remarkable in the character of Mr Sheridan,
                    prevailed so far, that though he received from his friend the sketch of this
                    piece in 1770, it was not till May next year that the probability of the arrival
                    of the manuscript was announced to Mr Foote. Another of their projects was a
                    periodical miscellany, the idea of which originated with Sheridan. The title
                    intended by him for this paper was Herman’s Miscellany, to which Halhed
                    objected, and proposed The Reformer, as a newer and better name. But this paper,
                    for want of auxiliaries, never proceeded beyond the first number, which was
                    written by Sheridan. It is the characteristic of fools to be always beginning;
                    and this is not the only point in which folly and genius resemble each other.
                    Amongst the many literary works projected by Sheridan at this period, were a
                    collection of Occasional Poems, and a volume of Crazy Tales, to the former of
                    which Halhed suggests, that “the old things they did at Harrow, out of
                    Theocritus,” might form a useful contribution. But neither of these came to any
                    thing; and the translation of Aristaenetus was the only fruit of their literary
                    alliance that, as we have already stated, ever arrived at sufficient maturity
                    for publication.</p>
                <p>The passion, however, that now began to take possession of his heart was little
                    favourable to his advancement in serious studies. In the neighbourh∞d of Miss
                    Linley, the arts and the sciences were suffered to fall asleep, and even the
                    translation of Aristaenetus itself proceeded but slowly. After various fortune,
                    however, it at length made its appearance in August 1771, contrary to the advice
                    of the bookseller, and, as it might have been expected, from the unpropitious
                    season at which it appeared, complete failure was the consequence. The
                    disappointment of the authors was no doubt proportioned to the sanguine
                    expectations they had indulged. But as to Mr Sheridan, he sought for consolation
                    in the society of Miss Linley, who had now become the star of his attraction,
                    and the centre round which revolved all his hopes. This lady, indeed,
                    notwithstanding the drawback of her profession as a singer, appears to have
                    spread her gentle conquests to an extent almost unparalleled in the annals of
                    beauty. “Her personal charms, the exquisiteness of her musical talents, and the
                    full light of publicity which her profession threw upon both,” says Mr Moore,
                    “naturally attracted round her a crowd of admirers, in whom the sympathy of
                    common pursuit soon kindled into rivalry, till she became at length an object of
                    vanity as well as of love. Her extreme youth, too (for she was little more than
                    sixteen when Sheridan first met her), must have removed, even from minds the
                    most fastidious and delicate, that repugnance they might have justly felt to her
                    profession, if she had lived much longer under its tarnishing influence, or
                    lost, by frequent exhibitions before the public, that fine gloss of feminine
                    modesty, for whose absence not all the talents and accomplishments of the whole
                    sex can atone.”<pb break="no" facs="ht:chi.28490924&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=219"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0720-0219-0201"/> Even at this early age, she had been on the point
                    of marriage with Mr Long, an old gentleman of considerable fortune in Wiltshire;
                    but, on her secretly representing to him, that she never could be happy as his
                    wife, he generously took upon himself the whole blame of breaking off the
                    alliance, and even indemnified the father by settling L.3000 upon his daughter.
                    Mr Sheridan, who owed to this liberality not only the possession of the woman he
                    loved, but the means of supporting her during the first years of their marriage,
                    uniformly spoke of Mr Long with all the kindness and respect which such a
                    disinterested character merited. Meanwhile, in love, as in all besides, the
                    power of a mind like Sheridan’s made itself felt through all obstacles; and he
                    won the entire affections of the Syren, though the number and wealth of his
                    rivals, amongst whom were a brother and friend, the ambitious views of the
                    father, and the temptations to which she was hourly exposed, kept his fears and
                    jealousies continually on the watch. But, whilst this was the case, a new and
                    unexpected difficulty awaited him.</p>
                <p>Captain Mathews, a married man, and intimate with Miss Linley’s family, had for
                    some time harassed her with those discreditable addresses, which it is equally
                    painful to disclose and intolerable to endure. To the threat of
                    self-destruction, he is said to have added the still more unmanly menace of
                    ruining her reputation, if he could not undermine her virtue. Terrified by his
                    perseverance, she confided her distresses to Sheridan, who lost no time in
                    expostulating with him upon the cruelty, libertinism, and hopelessness of his
                    pursuit. Such a remonstrance, however, was but little calculated to conciliate
                    the forbearance of this professed man of gallantry; so that, early in 1772, Miss
                    Linley adopted the resolution of flying to France, and taking refuge in a
                    convent. At this time Sheridan was little more than twenty, and Miss Linley just
                    entering her eighteenth year. Landing at Dunkirk, they proceeded to Lisle, where
                    they procured an apartment in a convent, with the intention of remaining there
                    until Sheridan should have the means of supporting her as his wife. On the first
                    discovery of the elopement, Mathews busied himself making inquiries into the
                    affair. During the four or five weeks that the young couple «’ere absent, he
                    never ceased to haunt the Sheridan family with all sorts of exaggerated rumours;
                    and at length, urged on by the restlessness of revenge, he inserted a violent
                    and inflammatory advertisement in the Bath Chronicle, in which he publicly
                    posted Mr Sheridan as a scoundrel and a liar. The consequences of this were such
                    as might have been expected. The party now returned from the Continent, and,
                    without loss of time, Sheridan called out Mathews. His second on the occasion
                    was Mr Ewart, and the particulars of the duel, which was fought with swords, are
                    stated by himself in a letter addressed to Captain Knight, the second of
                    Mathews. From this it appears that Mathews, being worsted, was obliged to beg
                    his life; after which he signed an ample apology, in which he retracted the
                    expressions he had made use of, as “the effects of passion and
                    misrepresentation,” and begged pardon for his advertisement in the Bath
                    Chronicle.</p>
                <p>With the odour of this transaction fresh about him, Mr Mathews retired to his
                    estate in Wales, and there found himself universally shunned. An apology may be,
                    according to circumstances, either the noblest effort of manliness, or the last
                    resource of fear; and, from the reception which this gentleman everywhere
                    experienced, it is evident that to the latter class of cases his late retraction
                    had been referred. In this crisis, a Mr Barnett, who had but lately come to
                    reside in his neighbourhood, took upon himself the duty of urging a second
                    meeting with Sheridan, as the only means of removing the stigma left by the
                    first; offering, at the same time, to be the bearer of the challenge. This offer
                    was accepted, and the parties met at Kingsdown, where a desperate encounter
                    ensued, in which Mr Sheridan’s sword was broken, and himself severely wounded. A
                    narrative of this affair, drawn up by Mr Barnett, and sanctioned by the
                    concurrence of Captain Paumier (Sheridan’s friend) in the truth of its material
                    facts, was soon afterwards published; whilst the comments which Sheridan thought
                    it necessary to make have been found in an unfinished state amongst his papers.
                    As soon as Sheridan was sufficiently recovered of his wounds, bis father sent
                    him to pass some months at Waltham Abbey, Essex, where he continued, with but a
                    few short intervals of absence, from August or September</p>
                <p>1772, till the spring of the following year.</p>
                <p>During this period, he evinced considerable industry, particularly in an abstract
                    which he made of the History of England, and in a collection of remarks on Sir
                    William Temple’s works, especially his essay on Popular Discontents, on which
                    his observations are tasteful and just. Still his situation was at this lime
                    singularly perplexing. He had won the heart, and even the hand, of the woman he
                    loved, yet saw his hopes of possessing her farther off than ever. He had twice
                    risked his life against an unworthy antagonist, yet found the vindication of his
                    honour incomplete. He felt within himself all the proud consciousness of genius,
                    yet, thrown upon the world without a profession, he looked in vain for a channel
                    through which to direct its energies. Even the precarious hope which his
                    father’s favour held out had been purchased by an act of duplicity, which his
                    conscience condemned; for he not only had promised that he would instantly
                    abandon the pursuit, but had even taken an oath that he would never marry Miss
                    Linley. To a mind so young and so ardent, the pressure of these various
                    anxieties must, of course, have been great; in fact they could only have been
                    adequately described by him who felt them; and there still exist some letters,
                    written by him during this time, which betray a sadness and despondency,
                    sometimes breaking out into aspirings of ambition, sometimes rising even into a
                    tone of cheerfulness, that ill concealed the melancholy underneath. But it was
                    impossible that Sheridan could be always under a cloud. Misunderstandings there
                    no doubt were, arising probably from those paroxysms of jealousy into which he
                    must have been continually thrown; but reconcilement was with no great
                    difficulty effected; and at length Mr Linley, convinced that it was impossible
                    to keep them much longer asunder, consented to their union, which took place on
                    the 13th of April</p>
                <p>1773.</p>
                <p>A few weeks previous to his marriage, Sheridan had been entered a student of the
                    Middle Temple. It was not to be expected, however, that talents like his would
                    submit to toil for the distant and dearly-earned emoluments which a life of
                    labour in this profession might secure; nor, indeed, did his circumstances admit
                    of any such patient speculation. A part of the sum which Mr Long had settled
                    upon Miss Linley, and occasional assistance from her father, were now the only
                    resources left him, besides his own talents. Mrs Sheridan’s celebrity as a
                    singer was a ready source of wealth, and offers of the most advantageous kind
                    were pressed upon them by the managers of concerts, both in town and country.
                    But her husband at once rejected all thoughts of allowing her to re-appear in
                    public, and, instead of profiting by the display of his wife’s talents, adopted
                    the manlier resolution of seeking independence by his own. How decided his mind
                    was upon the subject, appears by a letter written to Mr Linley about a month
                    after the marriage. At East Burnham, whence this letter is dated, they were no«·
                    living in a small cottage, to which they had retired immediately on their
                    marriage; and to it they often looked back with a sigh, in after times, when
                    they were more prosperous and less happy. Towards winter they went to lodge for
                    a short time with Storace, the intimate friend of Mr Linley, and in the
                    following year attained that first step<pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:chi.28490924&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=220" xml:id="kp-eb0720-0220-0202"/>
                    towards independence, a house to themselves. During the summer of 1774, they
                    passed some time at Mr Canning’s and Lord Coventry’s; but so little did these
                    visits interfere with the literary industry of Mr Sheridan, that he had not only
                    at that time finished his play of the Rivals, but was on the point of “sending a
                    book to press.”</p>
                <p>On the 17th of January 1775, the comedy of the Rivals was brought out at Covent
                    Garden. This play failed on its first representation, chiefly owing to the bad
                    acting of Mr Lee in Sir Lucius O’Trigger. Another actor was, however,
                    substituted in his stead, and the play being lightened of this and some other
                    incumbrances, rose at once in public favour and patronage. The best comment on
                    this lively play is to be found in the many smiling faces that are lighted up
                    whenever it appears. With much less wit, it exhibits more humour than the School
                    for Scandal, and the dialogue is more natural, as coming nearer the current of
                    ordinary conversation. The characters, however, are not such as occur very
                    commonly in the world, and for our knowledge of them we are indebted to their
                    confessions rather than to their actions. Lydia Languish, in proclaiming the
                    extravagance of her own romantic notions, prepares us for events much more
                    ludicrous and eccentric than those in which she is concerned; in the composition
                    of Sir Lucius O’Trigger, his love of fighting is the only characteristic
                    strongly brought out; and the wayward, captious jealousy of Falkland, though so
                    highly coloured in his own representation, is productive of nothing answerable
                    to such an announcement. The character of Sir Anthony Absolute is perhaps the
                    best sustained and most natural of any, and the scenes between him and Captain
                    Absolute are genuinely dramatic. Mrs Malaprop’s mistakes have often been
                    objected as improbable from a woman in her rank of life; but though some of them
                    are extravagant and farcical, they are almost all amusing; and the luckiness of
                    her simile, “as headstrong as an <hi rend="italic">allegory</hi> on the banks of
                    the Nile,” has been acknowledged by all whose taste is not too refined to be
                    moved by the genuine comic.</p>
                <p>Mr Sheridan now employed the summer recess in writing the Duenna, whilst his
                    father-in-law, Mr Linley, assisted in selecting and composing the music for it.
                    In hands so willing, the work made speedy progress, and, on the 21 st November,
                    the Duenna was performed at Covent Garden. The run of this opera has, we
                    believe, no parallel in the annals of the drama. The Beggar’s Opera had a career
                    of sixty-three nights; but the Duenna, more fortunate, was acted no less than
                    seventy-five times during the season, the only intermissions being a few days at
                    Christmas, and the Fridays in every week. In order to counteract this great
                    success of the rival house, Garrick found it necessary to bring forward all the
                    weight of his best characters; and he had even recourse to the expedient of
                    playing off the mother against the son, by reviving Mrs Frances Sheridan’s
                    comedy of the Discovery, and acting the leading character in it himself. The
                    Duenna, in fact, is one of the very few operas in our language which combine the
                    merits of legitimate comedy with the attractions of poetry and song. The
                    “sovereign of the soul," as Gray calls music, always loses by being made
                    exclusive sovereign; and the division of her empire with poetry and wit, as in
                    the instance of the Duenna, doubles her real power. The intrigue of this piece
                    is constructed and managed with considerable adroitness, having just material
                    enough to form three acts, without being encumbered by too much intricacy, or
                    weakened by too much extension. And as to the wit of the dialogue, except in one
                    or two instances, it is of that accessible kind which lies near the surface, and
                    which, as it is produced without effort, may be enjoyed without wonder.</p>
                <p>Towards the close of the year 1775, Garrick intending to part with his moiety of
                    the patent of Drury lame theatre, and retire from the stage, Mr Sheridan made
                    him an offer as purchaser, and eventually became patentee and manager. The
                    progress of the negociation cannot be better related than in some of Sheridan’s
                    own letters, addressed to Mr Linley, which Mr Moore has printed. It appears,
                    indeed, that the contract was perfected in June 1776; and in a paper drawn up by
                    Mr Sheridan many years afterwards, the shares of the respective purchasers are
                    thus stated, viz. Mr Sheridan, two fourteenths of the whole, L.10,000; Mr
                    Linley, the same, L.10,000; and Dr Ford, three fourteenths, L.15,000. Whence Mr
                    Sheridan’s supply came, or to whom he was indebted for this seasonable aid, has
                    never been known. Not even to Mr Linley, whilst entering into all other details,
                    does he hint at the fountain-head from which it was to come; and, indeed, there
                    was something mysterious about all his acquisitions, whether in love or in
                    learning, in wit or in wealth. Finally, in reference to this subject, the first
                    contribution which the new manager furnished to the stock of the theatre was an
                    alteration of Vanburgh’s comedy, the Relapse, which was brought out on the 24th
                    of February 1777, under the title of a Trip to Scarborough.</p>
                <p>Mr Sheridan was now approaching the summit of his dramatic fame. He had already
                    produced the best opera in the language, and there now remained for him the
                    glory of writing also the best comedy. As this is a species of composition
                    which, more perhaps than any other, seems to require a knowledge of human nature
                    and the world, it is not a little extraordinary that nearly all our first-rate
                    comedies should have been the productions of very young men. Those of Congreve
                    were all written before he was five-and-twenty. Farquhar produced the Constant
                    Couple in his two-and-twentieth year, and died at thirty. Vanburgh was a young
                    ensign when he sketched out the Relapse and the Provoked Wife; and Sheridan
                    crowned his reputation with the School for Scandal at six-and-twenty. And it is
                    still more remarkable to find, as in the instance before us, that works, which
                    we might suppose to have been the offspring of a careless but vigorous fancy,
                    should, on the contrary, have been the slow result of many doubtful experiments,
                    gradually unfolding beauties unseen even by him who produced them, and at length
                    arriving step by step at perfection. That the School for Scandal was produced by
                    this tardy process, is evident from the sketches of its plan and dialogue which
                    Mr Moore has produced, and which serve to throw a remarkable light on the first
                    slow workings of genius, out of which its finest transmutations arise. The
                    reader who may feel curious on this subject is referred to Mr Moore’s clear and
                    masterly exposition. Suffice it to mention, that there are two distinct
                    sketches, in the second of which particularly, is shown the condensing process
                    which his wit must have gone through before it attained its present proof and
                    flavour. There appear also to have been originally two plots, which the author
                    incorporated into one; yet, even in the details of the new plan, considerable
                    alterations were subsequently made, entire scenes suppressed or transposed, and
                    the dialogue of some completely rewritten.</p>
                <p>This play was produced on the 8th of May 1777, and its success was decided and
                    triumphant. Indeed, long after its first uninterrupted run, it continued to be
                    played regularly two or three times a week; and on comparing the receipts of the
                    first twelve nights with those of a later period, it will appear how little the
                    attraction of the piece had abated by repetition. The beauties of this comedy
                    are so universally known, that it cannot be necessary to dwell upon them. With
                    but little interest in the plot, no very profound or ingenious development of
                    character, and a group of personages, not one of whom has any legitimate claims
                    upon either our affection or esteem, it yet, by the admirable skill with which
                    its materials are managed, the happy contrivance of the situations, that
                    perpetual play of wit which never tires, and a finish almost faultless, it
                    unites the suffrages at once of the refined and the simple, and is not less
                    successful in<pb break="no" facs="ht:chi.28490924&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=221"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0720-0221-0203"/> satisfying the tastes of the one, than in
                    ministering to the enjoyment of the other. And this is the true triumph of
                    genius in all the arts. In painting, sculpture, music, or literature, those
                    works which have pleased the greatest number for the longest space of time, may
                    be pronounced the best; for, however mediocrity may enshrine itself in the
                    admiration of the few, the palm of excellence can only be awarded by the many.
                    The defects of the School for Scandal, if they can be allowed to amount to
                    defects, are in a great measure traceable to the amalgamation of two distinct
                    plots, out of which the piece was formed. From this cause has devolved that
                    excessive opulence with which the dialogue is almost overloaded, and which
                    Sheridan himself used to mention as a fault which he was conscious of in his
                    work. From beginning to end it is a continued sparkling of point and polish; and
                    the whole of the characters might be comprehended under one common designation
                    of wits, even Trip, the servant, being as shining and brilliant as the rest. “In
                    short,” says Mr Moore, “the entire comedy is a sort of El Dorado of wit, where
                    the precious metal is thrown about by all classes, as carelessly as if they had
                    not the least idea of its value.”</p>
                <p>Soon after the appearance of this comedy, Sheridan made a further purchase of
                    theatrical property, amounting to L. 17,000; and amongst the visible signs of
                    his increased influence in the affairs of the house, was the appointment, this
                    year, of his father to be manager. At the beginning of the year 1779, Garrick
                    died, and Sheridan, who had followed his body to the grave, wrote a monody to
                    his memory, which was recited after the play in the month of March following. In
                    the course of the same year he produced the entertainment of the Critic, which
                    was his last legitimate offering at the shrine of the dramatic muse. In this
                    incomparable farce, we have a striking instance of the privilege which genius
                    assumes of taking up subjects that had passed through other hands, and giving
                    them new value and currency. The plan of the Rehearsal was first adopted for the
                    purpose of ridiculing Dryden; but although there is much laughable humour in
                    some of the dialogue, the salt was not of a very conservative nature, and the
                    piece continued to be served up to the public long after it had lost its relish.
                    Fielding tried the same plan in a variety of productions, but without much
                    success, except, perhaps, in the comedy of Pasquin. It was reserved for Sheridan
                    to give vitality to this form of dramatic humour, and to invest even his
                    satirical portraits with a generic, which, without weakening the particular
                    resemblance, makes them representatives of the whole class to which the original
                    belonged. Bayes, on the other hand, is a caricature made up of little more than
                    personal peculiarities, but may amuse as long as reference may be had to the
                    prototype, but fall lifeless the moment the individual that supplied them is no
                    more.</p>
                <p>Having terminated his dramatic career, in which he had been eminently successful,
                    Sheridan now prepared to act a part in a widely different scene. His thoughts
                    had been gradually drawn to the seducing subject of politics, on which he had
                    tried his hand at some very fair remarks on absenteeism; he had also rendered
                    some service to the party with which he had connected himself, by taking an
                    active share in a periodical publication called the Englishman; and his first
                    appearance before the public was made in conjunction with Mr Fox, at the
                    beginning of 1780, when the Resolutions on the State of the Representation,
                    together with a Heport on the same subject, were laid before the public. The
                    dissolution of parliament, which took place in the autumn of 1780, at length
                    afforded the opportunity to which his ambition had so eagerly looked forward;
                    and Stafford was destined to have the honour of first choosing him for its
                    representative. It is not our intention, however, to investigate his political
                    with the same minuteness as his literary life; and this is the less necessary,
                    seeing that the amplest narrative would probably be the heaviest, and that the
                    masterly pen of Lord Brougham has sketched an outline which must be fully
                    sufficient to satisfy the inquiries of the most curious and inquisitive.</p>
                <p>“His first effort,” says Lord Brougham, “was unambitious, and it was
                    unsuccessful. Aiming at but a low flight, he failed in that humble attempt. An
                    experienced judge, Woodfall, told him it would never do; and counselled him to
                    seek again the more congenial atmosphere of Drury Lane. But he was· resolved
                    that it should do; he had taken his part; and as he felt the matter was in him,
                    he vowed not to desist till he had brought it out. What he wanted in acquired
                    learning and natural quickness, he made up by indefatigable industry. Within
                    given limits, towards a present object, no labour could daunt him; no man could
                    work for a season with more steady and unwearied application. By constant
                    practice in small matters, or before private committees, by diligent attendance
                    upon all debates, by habitual intercourse with all dealers in political wares,
                    from the chiefs of parties and their more refined coteries, to the providers of
                    daily discussion for the public, and the chroniclers of parliamentary speeches,
                    he trained himself to a facility of speaking, absolutely essential to all but
                    first-rate genius, and all but necessary even to that; and he acquired what
                    acquaintance with the science of politics he ever possessed, or his speeches
                    ever betrayed. By these steps he rose to the rank of a first-rate speaker, and
                    as great a debater as a want of readiness, and need for preparation, would
                    permit.</p>
                <p>“He had some qualities which led him to this rank, and which only required the
                    habit of speech to bring them out into successful exhibition; a warm
                    imagination, though more prone to repeat with variations the combinations of
                    others, or to combine anew their creations, than to bring forth original
                    productions; it fierce, dauntless spirit of attack; a familiarity, acquired from
                    his dramatic studies, with the feelings of the heart and the ways to touch its
                    chords; a facility of epigram and point, the yet more direct gift of the same
                    theatrical apprenticeship; an excellent manner, not unconnected with that
                    experience; and a depth of voice which perfectly suited the tone of his
                    declamation, be it invective, or be it descriptive, or be it impassioned. His
                    wit, derived from the same source, or sharpened by the same previous habits, was
                    eminently brilliant, and almost always successful. It was, like all his
                    speaking, exceedingly prepared, but it was skilfully introduced, and happily
                    applied; and it was well mingled also with humour, occasionally descending to
                    farce. How little it was the inspiration of the moment, all men were aware who
                    knew his habits; but a singular proof of this was presented by Mr Moore when he
                    came to write his life; for we there find given to the world, with a frankness
                    which must almost have made the author shake in his grave, the secret note-books
                    of this famous wit; and are thus enabled to trace his jokes, in embryo, with
                    which he had so often made the walls of St Stephen’s shake, in a merriment
                    excited by the happy appearance of sudden unpremeditated effusion.</p>
                <p>“The adroitness with which he turned to account sudden occasions of popular
                    excitement, and often at the expense of the Whig party, generally too
                    indifferent to such advantages, and too insensible to the damage they thus
                    sustained in public estimation, is well known. On the mutiny in the fleet, he
                    was beyond all question right; on the French invasion, and on the attacks upon
                    Napoleon, he was almost as certainly wrong; but these appeals to the people, and
                    to the national feelings of the House, tended to make the orator well received,
                    if they added little to the statesman’s reputation; and of the latter character
                    he was not ambitious. His most celebrated speech was certainly the one upon the
                    Begum charge, in the proceedings against Hastings; and nothing can exceed the
                    accounts left us of<pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:chi.28490924&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=222" xml:id="kp-eb0720-0222-0204"/>
                    its unprecedented success. Not only the practice then first began, which has
                    gradually increased till it greets every good speech, of cheering, on the
                    speaker resuming his seat, but the minister besought the House to adjourn the
                    decision of the question, as being incapacitated from forming a just judgment
                    under the influence of such powerful eloquence; whilst all men on all sides vied
                    with each other in extolling so wonderful a performance. Nevertheless, the
                    opinion has now become greatly prevalent, that a portion of this success was
                    owing to the speech having so greatly surpassed all the speaker’s former
                    efforts, to the extreme interest of the topics which the subject naturally
                    presented, and to the artist-like elaboration and beautiful delivery of certain
                    fine passages, rather than to the merits of the whole. Certain it is, that the
                    repetition of great part of it, presented in the short-hand notes of the speech
                    on the same charge, in Westminster Hall, disppoints every reader who has heard
                    of the success which attended the earlier effort. In truth, Mr Sheridan’s taste
                    was very far from being chaste, or even moderately correct. He delighted in
                    gaudy figures; he was attracted by glare, and cared not whether the brilliancy
                    came from tinsel or gold, from broken glass or pure diamond; he overlaid his
                    thoughts with epigrammatic diction; he 'played to the galleries,’ and indulged
                    them, of course, with an endless succession of claptraps. His worst passages by
                    far were those which he evidently preferred himself, full of imagery, often
                    far-fetched, oftener gorgeous, and loaded with point that drew the attention of
                    the hearer away from the thoughts to the words; and his best by far were those
                    where he declaimed, with his deep clear voice, though somewhat thick utterance,
                    with a fierce defiance of some adversary, or an unappeasable vengeance against
                    some oppressive act; or reasoned rapidly, in the like tone, upon some plain
                    matter of fact, or exposed as plainly to homely ridicule some puerile sophism;
                    and in all this his admirable manner was aided by an eye singularly
                    piercing,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi
                    rend="smallcaps">It had the singularity of never winking.</hi></p></note> and a
                    countenance which, though coarse, and even in some features gross, was yet
                    animated and expressive, and could easily assume the figure of both rage, and
                    menace, and scorn. The few sentences with which he thrilled the House, on the
                    liberty of the press, in 1810, were worth, perhaps, more than all his elaborated
                    epigrams and forced flowers on the Begum charge, or all his denunciations of
                    Napoleon, 'whose morning orisons and evening prayers are for the conquest of
                    England, whether he bends to the God of Battles or worships the Goddess of
                    Reason ;’ certainly far better than such pictures of his power, as his having
                    ‘thrones for his watchtowers, kings for his sentinels, and for the palisades of
                    his castle sceptres stuck with crowns.’ ‘Give them,’ said he in 1810, and in a
                    far higher strain of eloquence, ‘a corrupt House of Lords; give them a venal
                    House of Commons; give them a tyrannical prince; give them a truckling
                    court,—and let me but have an unfettered press; I will defy them to encroach a
                    hair’s breadth upon the liberties of England.’ <hi rend="italic">OS</hi> all his
                    speeches, there can be little doubt that the most powerful, as the most chaste,
                    was his reply, in 1805, upon the motion which he had made for repealing the
                    Defence Act. Mr Pitt had unwarily thrown out a sneer at his support of Mr
                    Addington, as though it was insidious. Such a stone, cast by a person whose
                    house, on that aspect, was one pane of glass, could not fail to call down a
                    shower of missiles; and they who witnessed the looks and gestures of the
                    aggressor, under the pitiless pelting of the tempest which he had provoked,
                    represent it as certain that there were moments when he intended to fasten a
                    personal quarrel upon the vehement and implacable declaimer.</p>
                <p>“When the just tribute of extraordinary admiration has been bestowed upon this
                    great orator, the whole of his praise has been exhausted. As a statesman, he is
                    without a place in any class, or of any rank; it would be incorrect and
                    flattering to call him a bad, or a hurtful, or a shortsighted, or a middling
                    statesman; he was no statesman at all. As a party man, his character st∞d lower
                    than it deserved, chiefly from certain personal dislikes towards him; for, with
                    the perhaps doubtful exception of his courting popularity at his party’s
                    expense, on the two occasions already mentioned, and the much more serious
                    charge against him of betraying his party in the Carlton House negociation of
                    1812, followed by his extraordinary denial of the facts when he last appeared in
                    parliament, there can nothing be laid to his charge as inconsistent with the
                    rules of the strictest party duty and honour; although he made as large
                    sacrifices as any unprofessional man ever did to the cause of a long and
                    hopeless opposition, and was often treated with unmerited coldness and
                    disrespect by his coadjutors. But as a man his character stood confessedly low.
                    His intemperate habits, and his pecuniary embarrassments, did not merely tend to
                    imprudent conduct, by which himself alone might be the sufferer; they involved
                    his family in the same fate; and they also undermined those principles of
                    honesty which are so seldom found to survive fallen fortunes, and hardly ever
                    can continue the ornament and the stay of ruined circumstances, when the tastes
                    and the propensities engendered in prosperous times survive through the ungenial
                    season of adversity.”</p>
                <p>Sheridan was indeed most unfortunate. Whilst death was fast gaining on him, the
                    miseries of life were thickening around him; nor did the last corner where he
                    now lay down to die, afford him any asylum from the clamours of his legal
                    pursuers. Writs and executions came in rapid succession, and bailiffs at length
                    got possession of the house. A sheriff’s officer arrested the dying man in his
                    bed, and was about to carry him off in his blankets to a spunging house, when he
                    was prevented by an intimation of the responsibility he must incur, if, as was
                    but too probable, his prisoner should expire on the way. In the mean time, the
                    attention and sympathy of the public were awakened to the desolate condition of
                    Sheridan, by an article which appeared in the Morning Post, written, it seems,
                    by a gentleman who, though on no very cordial terms with him, forgot every other
                    feeling in a generous pity for his fate, and in honest indignation against those
                    who had deserted him. But it was now too late. Its effect, indeed, was soon
                    visible in the calls made at Sheridan’s door, amongst which the Duke of York and
                    the Duke of Argyll appeared as visiters; but the spirit that these unavailing
                    tributes might once have comforted was fast losing the consciousness of every
                    thing earthly; and, after a succession of shivering fits, he fell into a state
                    of exhaustion, which continued till his death. He expired on Sunday, the 7th of
                    July 1816, in the sixty-fifth year of his age, and was buried on the Saturday
                    following, many royal and noble persons crowding round his insensible clay,
                    whose notice, had it been earlier, might have soothed and comforted his
                    death-bed, and saved his heart from breaking. <hi rend="smallcaps">(a.)</hi></p>
