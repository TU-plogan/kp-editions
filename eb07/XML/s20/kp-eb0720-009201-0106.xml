                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra

                <p><label type="entry">SENEGAL</label>, a great river of Western Africa, which, like
                    the Gambia and Rio Grande, has its source in a group of mountains situated a
                    short distance to the north-west of Temboo, in Foota Jallon. Mollien places the
                    source of the Ba Fing, the middle branch of the Senegal, in latitude 10° 10'
                    north, longitude 11° 18' west; and that of the Falerne, the western branch, in
                    latitude 10° 20' north, and longitude 11° west. This traveller thus describes
                    the spot whence the former mighty stream issues. “Ascending the stream, I
                    perceived two basins, one above the other, from which the water gushed forth;
                    and still higher a third, which was only humid, as well as the channel that led
                    to the basin immediately below it. The negroes consider the upper basin as the
                    principal source of the river. These three springs were situated about the
                    middle of the side of the mountain. In the rainy season, two ponds, at equal
                    distances above the upper source, supply it with water by two deep channels. The
                    Senegal, called Baleo (Black River) in the Poula language, and Bafing in
                    Maudingo, which has the same signification, or Foura, which means simply the
                    river, runs at first from north to south, then passes at a little distance to
                    the south of Teembo, and afterwards pursues a western direction,” which, we may
                    add, it maintains till its embouchure in the Atlantic Ocean. We are indebted
                    chiefly to the enterprises of the French for our knowledge of the Senegal, of
                    which river they were long the sole masters as high as the cataract of Feloo,
                    and at the mouth of which they fixed the capital of the factories they possessed
                    from Arguin to Sierra Leone. Amongst the copious descriptions of this great
                    river, we avail ourselves of that of M. Golberry. The course of the Senegal,
                    from its mouth to the rock of Feloo, the boundary of French navigation, is
                    nearly 280 leagues, although the distance in a direct line is not more than 160
                    leagues. This cataract, which is situated sixty miles above Galam, is the
                    principal one on the river; forty miles above it is that of Govinea. The
                    windings of the Senegal are remarkably tortuous and circuitous. As far as the
                    rock of Feloo, the country through which it flows is a level, having so small an
                    inclination that a very slight interruption is sufficient to divert the course
                    of the stream, so that it frequently seems on the point of returning to its
                    source. It is only navigable during the rainy season; but Adanson informs us
                    that he found the river, at its greatest ebb, from twenty to thirty feet deep at
                    Podor, sixty leagues up, where, however, the influence of the tide reaches. The
                    greatest rise of the tide at the mouth of the river is two feet and a half. Here
                    there is a bar, which prevents the entrance of all vessels drawing ten feet of
                    water, although immediately within it there is sufficient depth for ships of any
                    size. The entrance of the bar has shifted from time to time, owing to the
                    influence of opposing currents. Sand-banks and rocks embarrass the navigation;
                    enormous trees and portions of the bank are continually borne down by the
                    current; frequent hurricanes and storms are encountered, followed by dead calms;
                    and the burning atmosphere, when not violently agitated, becomes extremely
                    oppressive, so that the voyage into the interior has always proved highly
                    detrimental to Europeans. Were it not for these perils, it would be particularly
                    interesting to the naturalist, as the extremely picturesque banks present a rich
                    variety of the noblest productions of the vegetable kingdom, whilst the
                    extensive forests abound with all kinds of wild animals. Amongst others,
                    elephants are seen in large troops. In the shallow parts of the river are a vast
                    number of hippopotami, and caymans of prodigious size. The whole length of the
                    river is estimated at 800 miles, its embouchure taking place in latitude 16° 5'
                    north. About eight leagues below Galam, at the village of Tafa-lisga, the
                    Senegal receives the Falemé, which may be navigated during the rainy season by
                    vessels of sixty tons. The easterly and inferior arm of the Senegal, called the
                    Kokora, is formed of a number of streams which rise between 5° and 7° of west
                    longitude, and 12° and 13° of north latitude. The Ba Fing and the Kokora unite a
                    short distance above Feloo, and the combined streams then take the name of the
                    Senegal.</p>
