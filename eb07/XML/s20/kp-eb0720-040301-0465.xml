                    sensations of smell are excited by certain effluvia, which, in the open air, are
                    always issuing from the surfaces of most bodies, and striking on the extremities
                    of the olfactory nerves, give them a peculiar sort of impression, which is
                    communicated to the brain. The particles which issue thus from bodies are
                    extremely volatile, and produce sensation by a degree of contact, which, though
                    insensible, is still more efficient than if it were more gross and palpable. It
                    is by a similar species of insensible contact that the eyes and ears are
                    affected by external objects; while, in the excitation of the sensations of
                    touch and of taste, an actual and sensible contact of the object with the organ
                    is necessary. The organs of smelling are the nostrils and olfactory nerves; the
                    minute ramifications of the latter being distributed throughout the whole
                    concavity of the former.</p>
                <p>The effluvia from odorous bodies are constantly floating about in the atmosphere,
                    and must of course be drawn into the nostrils along with the air in inspiration;
                    “so that there is,” as Dr. Smith observes, “a manifest appearance of design in
                    placing the organ of smell in the inside of that canal through which the air is
                    continually passing in inspiration and expiration.” It has been affirmed by
                    Boerhaave, that the matter in animals, vegetables, fossils, and the like, which
                    chiefly affects the sense of smelling, is that attenuated substance, inherent in
                    their oily parts, called <hi rend="italic">spirits;</hi> because, when this is
                    taken away from the most fragrant bodies, what remains has scarcely any smell at
                    all; but this, he says, if poured on the most inodorous bodies, gives them a
                    fragrancy.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See also Sir
                    William Drummond’s Academical Questions, book i. chap. 9.</p></note> ’ We cannot
                    however enter at present upon this inquiry.</p>
                <p>The sense of smell has a close alliance with that of taste; and it seems probable
                    from the proximity in the situation of their organs in all animals, that both
                    are principally intended to guide them in the choice of their food; so that from
                    this close connection, they are better enabled to choose what is good for them,
                    and to reject what would be injurious. This is the opinion of Dr. Reid, as it
                    was, in a very early period of the history of philosophy, that of Socrates and
                    of Cicero.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>’ “Ut
                    gustus," says a learned physiologist, “cibi itineri, sic olfactus ostio viarum,
                    quas aer subire debet, custos praeponitnr, moniturus ne quid noxii, via quse
                    semper patet, in corpus admittatur. Porro, ut gustus, sic quoque olfactus ad
                    salutarem cibum invitat, a noxio aut corrupto, putrido imprimis vel rancido,
                    deterret.”</p><p>“When thou seest the moutb, through which animals take in
                    whatever they desire, always placed near the nose and eyes, thinkest thou not,
                    say Socrates to Aristodemus, that this is the work of a providence." (Xenophon’s
                    Memorabilia, book i. chap. 4.)</p></note> Dr. Reid also remarks, that the sense
                    of smell probably serves the same purpose in the natural state of man; but it is
                    not always a sure guide for this purpose. The organs of smell differ, like those
                    of the other senses, according to the destination of the animals to which they
                    belong; and we know, that this sense is in man much less acute, than in many
                    other animals. We see, that in the choice of their food, they are guided by the
                    senses of smell and of taste, except when man has brought them into a sort of
                    unnatural state by domestication. And this circumstance renders it probable,
                    that both these senses were intended to serve the same purpose in the natural
                    state of our species, although less calculated for this end than they were in
                    the brutes, on account of the great superiority of their smelling organs.
                    Besides, since it is probable that man, in the natural state, acts more by
                    instinct than when civilized in society, so also it is reasonable to think, that
                    he may possess some of the senses, this of smell tor instance, in greater
                    acuteness than we do. This indeed we are assured to be a fact; for we are told
                    in the <hi rend="italic">Histoire des Antilles,</hi> that there are negroes who,
                    by the smell alone, can distinguish the footsteps of a Frenchman from those of a
                    negro.</p>
                <p>The sense of smell is much more obtuse in man than in some of the lower animals.
                    Dogs we know possess a power of smelling, of which we can scarcely form a
                    conception, and which it is happy for us we do not possess;<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>• “The excessive eagerness which dogs express
                    on smelling their game, seems to be but little connected with the appetite for
                    food, and wholly independent of any preconceived ideas of the objects of their
                    pursuit being tit for it. Hence several kinds of them will not eat the game
                    which they pursue with such wild impetuosity; and of which the scent seems to
                    animate them to a degree of ecstacy far beyond what the desire of food can
                    produce.” (Knighton Taste.)</p></note> and birds of prey are said to possess
                    this sense in still greater acuteness. But although this be more perfect, still
                    the sense of smelling in man, who has other means of judging of his food, is
                    such as to fit him for deriving enjoyment from a diversity of scents,
                    particularly those of flowers and perfumes, to which dogs and other animals seem
                    perfectly insensible. It has been said, we are aware, that some animals, the
                    elephant for instance, are capable of this enjoyment;<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>• There is an animal to which, naturalists
                    say, perfume is so agreeable and so necessary, that nature has provided it with
                    a little bag stored with an exquisite odour. “On pretend,” says Buffon, “que la
                    mangouste ouvre cette poche, pour se rafraichir lorsqu' elle a trop
                    chaud.”</p></note> but of this fact we cannot help being very doubtful.</p>
                <p>There is a very great sympathy between the organs of smell and of taste; tor any
                    defect or disease of one is generally attended with some corresponding defect or
                    disease of the other. There is also a greater similarity between the sensations
                    of both these, than between those of any other two senses; and hence it is, that
                    we can sometimes tell the taste of an object from its smell, and <hi
                    rend="italic">vice versa.</hi> Hence also the reason why we apply the same
                    epithets to the names of both these classes of sensations; as a sweet smell or
                    taste.</p>
                <p>It deserves also to be remarked, that both these senses seem subservient to the
                    preservation of the animal existence, rather than to any other purpose. They
                    accordingly constitute an object of the natural history of man, rather than of
                    intellectual or of moral philosophy. The other three senses, on the contrary,
                    seem rather intended for, as they certainly are essential to, our intellectual
                    improvement, and become, of course, a proper object of investigation in the
                    sciences of moral philosophy, or metaphysics.</p>
                <p>The advantages derived by man and the other animals from the sense of smelling
                    are not confined to the assistance which it affords them in the choice of their
                    food. Most bodies in nature, when exposed to the open air, are constantly
                    sending forth emanations or effluvia of such extreme minuteness as to be
                    perfectly invisible. These diffuse themselves through the air, and however
                    noxious or salutary, would not be perceived without the sense of smelling,
                    which, if not vitiated by unnatural habits, is not only a faithful monitor when
                    danger is at hand, but conveys to us likewise the most exquisite pleasures. The
                    fragrance of a rose, and of many other flowers, is not only pleasant, but gives
                    a refreshing and delightful stimulus to the whole system, while the odours
                    proceeding from hemlock, or any noxious vegetable, or other substance, are
                    highly offensive to our nostrils. Hence we are naturally led to seek the one
                    class of sensations, and to avoid the other.</p>
                <p>In some species of animals the sense of smell seems to be connected with certain
                    mental sympathies, as those of hearing and sight are in all that possess them in
                    any high degree; for not only their sexual desires appear to be excited by means
                    of it, but other instinctive passions, which, according to the usual system of
                    nature, should be still more remote from its influence. Dogs, although wholly
                    unac<pb break="no" facs="ht:chi.28490924&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=467"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0720-0467-0405"/> quainted with lions, will shudder at their roar;
                    and an elephant that has never seen a tiger, will in the same manner show the
                    strongest symptoms of horror and affright at the smell of it. “The late Lord
                    Clive,” says an ingenious writer, “exhibited a combat between two of these
                    animals at Calcutta; but the scent of the tiger had such an effect upon the
                    elephant, that nothing could either force or allure him to go along the road,
                    where the cage in which the tiger was inclosed, had passed, until a gallon of
                    arrack was given him. Upon this, his horror suddenly turning into fury, he broke
                    down the paling to get at his enemy, and killed him without difficulty.”</p>
                <p>If riding along a road, near which a dead horse, or part of its carcass, happens
                    to be lying, we know, that our horse although he sees it not, cannot be made to
                    pass the place but with difficulty. Where blood has been shed, particularly that
                    of their own species, oxen will assemble, and upon smelling it, roar and bellow,
                    and show the most manifest signs of horror and distress; and yet these symptoms
                    could not arise from any associated notions of danger or death, since they
                    appear in such as never had any opportunities of acquiring them. They must
                    therefore be instinctive like other instinctive antipathies and propensities.
                    But although in their mutual intercourse, animals make much use of the sense of
                    smell, still it does not seem to be further concerned in exciting their sexual
                    desires, than in indicating their object.</p>
                <p>Some of those splenetic philosophers, who are ready upon all occasions to quarrel
                    with the constitution of nature, have taken the liberty of condemning their
                    Maker, because it has pleased his unfathomable wisdom to bestow in some
                    instances upon the brutes senses and instincts more perfect than he has given to
                    man, without reflecting that he has given to man an ample equivalent; for it may
                    be asked with the poet,</p>
                <p>Is not bis reason all these powers in one?</p>
                <p>Is Heaven unkind to man and man alone? Shall be alone, whom rational we call. Be
                    pleased with nothing if not blessed with all?</p>
                <p>With respect to that unknown peculiarity of bodies, which is the cause of our
                    sensations of smell, the opinions of philosophers have been very various. Until
                    of late, the doctrine of Des Cartes and Locke on this subject was pretty
                    generally received; but, since the publication of Dr. Reid’s works, his opinion,
                    which we deem the most correct and satisfactory, has become very popular. We
                    will endeavour to abridge his account of this matter. For this purpose, let us
                    suppose a person, who has grown up without the sense of smell, to be immediately
                    endowed with the use of this organ, and placed near some flowers of an exquisite
                    savour. When he examines what he feels in such a situation, he can find no
                    resemblance between this new sensation, and any thing with which he is already
                    acquainted. He finds himself unable to explain its nature, and cannot ascribe to
                    it figure, extension, or any known property of matter. It is a simple affection,
                    or feeling of mind, and, considered abstractedly, can have no necessary
                    connection with the nerves, the nostrils, or effluvia, or with any thing
                    material whatever. By the nature of his constitution he is however led to refer
                    this peculiar sensation to the nostrils, as its organ; and when, from
                    experience, and by means of touch, he learns that external objects have the
                    power of exciting this sensation, he concludes, that there must exist in bodies
                    some unknown cause by which it is excited. In the first part of this process he
                    considers the feeling, or sensation, abstractedly. As such, it exists in the
                    mind only; and cannot exist there but when the mind is conscious of it. His
                    consciousness soon enables him to distinguish different sorts of smells, all of
                    them very distinct from one another, but, conformably to the nature of all
                    sensation, extremely simple. He concludes, that each of these must have a
                    distinct cause; and finding, by experience, that this cause is an unknown
                    something in bodies, he concludes, that it must be a property of matter, and,
                    for want of another, gives it the name of smell. When he removes an odorous body
                    from the organ, the sensation vanishes; when the body is again applied, the
                    sensation is excited; and hence it is, that he is led naturally to connect the
                    sensation with this unknown peculiarity of bodies by which it is produced. But
                    since we see, that the sensation is, in a great degree, related to other objects
                    besides its unknown cause, to the mind in which it exists, for instance, and to
                    the organ which is its instrument, it may be asked why it becomes associated in
                    the mind with its cause only? The reason seems pretty obvious. No single
                    sensation, or class of sensations, is more connected with the mind, than any
                    other of which it is susceptible. Nor is the connection subsisting between the
                    organ and any of the sensations peculiar to it, greater than that which subsists
                    between it and every other sensation of which it is the inlet. Hence the
                    connection between the smell of an orange and the mind, or between it and the
                    nostrils, is very general, and cannot, in the former instance, distinguish it
                    from any other sensation of whatever kind, nor, in the latter, from any other
                    particular smell. But the connection between this sensation and the orange is
                    peculiar and permanent; and we accordingly find them always associated in the
                    mind, just as we associate the notion of fire with the sensation of burning. The
                    relation which a sensation of smell, or any sensation, bears to the mind, to an
                    organ, or to the memory and conception of itself, is common to all sensations.
                    The relation which any sensation bears to its own cause, suppose of the
                    sensation of smell to a particular virtue or quality of bodies, is common to it
                    with every other sensation, when considered with respect to its peculiar cause.
                    And finally, a sensation of any kind bears the same sort of relation to the
                    memory and conception of itself, that any other feeling or operation of mind
                    bears to the conception and memory of that particular feeling or operation.</p>
                <p>Whatever then be the nature of the minute particles of bodies by which our
                    sensations of smell are excited, we cannot help considering their unknown cause
                    as a virtue or quality of matter. Like all other modifications of material
                    substance, it must be confessed, that this can have no resemblance to the
                    sensations of mind. But we are not therefore to conclude with the followers of
                    Des Cartes and Locke, that this secondary quality is a mere sensation;
                    especially as we can readily conceive it existing where it is not smelled, or
                    even after supposing the annihilation of every sentient being throughout the
                    universe. The existence of the sensation we know to be momentary and fugitive;
                    but in the existence of its cause we can, without difficulty or inconsistency,
                    conceive a permanency independent of mind and of its sensations.</p>
                <p>The doctrine which we have been illustrating has of late been called in question
                    by a sceptical writer, who, it appears to us, has upon this occasion been
                    entirely deficient in his accustomed acuteness. Dr. Reid’s speculations seem so
                    frill, so clear and convincing, that we are at a loss to conceive how his
                    meaning can be misunderstood; and yet the argument and objections of the writer
                    to whom we allude, derive all their plausibility from a misinterpretation of Dr.
                    Reid’s meaning, and from a deviation from the established use of language. “An
                    eminent metaphysician,” says this author, “has declared that he has not the
                    least difficulty in conceiving the air perfumed with aromatic odours in the
                    deserts of Arabia; and he has decided, that the man who maintains smells to
                    exist only in the mind must be mad, or must abuse language and disgrace
                    philosophy. There are some authors, nevertheless, who differ widely on this
                    subject from the learned metaphysician. Is it possible for a sensation to exist
                    where there is no sentient? The authors to whom I allude think it impossible.”
                    And so, we may tell this learned author, does Dr. Reid, if he will take his word
                    for it. Of the sensation of smell he remarks, “It<pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:chi.28490924&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=468" xml:id="kp-eb0720-0468-0406"/>
                    is indeed impossible, that it can be in any body; it is a sensation, and a
                    sensation can be in a sentient thing only.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Reid’s Inquiry, ch. ii. sect. 2.</p></note> Again, “I can
                    think of the smell of a rose when I do not smell it; and it is possible that
                    when I think of it, there is no rose any where existing; but, when I smell it, I
                    am necessarily determined to believe that the sensation really exists. This is
                    common to all sensations, that, as they cannot exist but in being perceived, so
                    they cannot be perceived but they must exist.”<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>’ Reid’s Inquiry, chap. ii. sect.
                    3.</p></note> ® But, continues this acute metaphysician, “a smell is nothing
                    else than a sensation. It is a feeling, which may be agreeable or disagreeable;
                    which may, as some think, be excited by various combinations of elements; but
                    which, since it is a feeling, cannot be those elements which are said to cause
                    it, and cannot exist where there is no creature to perceive it. What is to be
                    understood, in philosophical strictness, by the perfumes of the desert? We can
                    excuse the poet when he makes the ocean smile,<note anchored="true"

                    philosopher is no such magician, and had better not wander through the regions
                    of fancy in search of sensations where there is no sentient.” And is it then
                    true that the word smell means only a sensation? A sensation is no more than an
                    effect; it is a transient modification of the mind, which the mind itself can
                    never produce. It must then have some cause which is external to the mind. Now,
                    it is to this cause, and not to the sensation, that the name smell is most
                    frequently applied in all languages; and it is this cause which Dr. Reid
                    supposes capable of existing in the deserts of Arabia, where there is no
                    sentient being to perceive it. But let us hear himself. <hi rend="italic"
                    >“We</hi> have considered smell as signifying a sensation, feeling, or
                    impression upon the mind; and in this sense it can only be in a mind or sentient
                    being; but it is evident that mankind give the name of smell much more
                    frequently to something which they conceive to be external, and to be a quality
                    of body; they understand by it something which does not at all infer a mind, and
                    have not the least difficulty in conceiving the air perfumed with aromatic
                    odours in the deserts of Arabia, or some uninhabited island where the human foot
                    never trod.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Inquiry,
                    chap ii. sect. 8</p></note> “The faculty of smelling is something very different
                    from the actual sensation of smelling; for the faculty may remain when we have
                    no sensation. And the mind is no less different from the faculty, for it
                    continues the same individual being when the faculty is lost. What is smell in
                    the rose? It is a quality or virtue of the rose, or of something proceeding from
                    it, which we perceive by the sense of smelling; and this is all we know of the
                    matter. But what is smelling? It is an act of the mind, but is never imagined to
                    be a quality of the mind. Again, the sensation of smelling is conceived to infer
                    necessarily a mind or sentient being; but smell in the rose infers no such
                    thing. We say, this body smells sweet, and that stinks; but we do not say, this
                    mind smells sweet, and that stinks; therefore smell in the rose, and the
                    sensation which it causes, are not conceived, even by the vulgar, to be things
                    of the same kind, although they have the same name.”<note anchored="true"

                <p>There are some other remarks on Dr. Reid’s opinion, in the work upon which we
                    have been commenting, which we shall pass by; we may however notice the author’s
                    concluding argument. After mentioning some examples, he observes, “Now, in these
                    instances, we see men and animals, that must have perception of smell, if I may
                    be per-mitte'd to say so, altogether different from each other. Is not smell
                    sensation when the spaniel finds sport in the field tor his master; when the
                    shark pursues through the ocean its expected victim; and when the camel conducts
                    the thirsty wanderer to a fountain of fresh water, across the burning sands of
                    the Arabian desert? If no animal had the sensation of smell, there would be no
                    odour; for aroma and oils may be thought to be material compositions, but are
                    neither agreeable nor disagreeable feelings.” If men and animals differ in their
                    perceptions of smell, and, no doubt, difference of organization will cause them
                    to do so, the conclusion should not be, we think, that smell is merely
                    sensation, but that there is actually something external which is the cause of
                    their sensations, and about which they differ. A rose put to the nostrils of a
                    man, and then to those of a dog, may excite very different sensations; but we
                    cannot think that the peculiarity of the rose, which excites those different
                    sensations, varies by thus changing the position of the rose. If at table one
                    person mistakes mutton for beef, and another thinks that it is venison, the
                    conclusion may be, that it is neither venison nor beef; but no man in his
                    senses, can conclude that there is no meat at the table. But, “is not smell
                    sensation when the spaniel finds sport in the field ?” There is sensation no
                    doubt; but we may be permitted to ask, what would become of the spaniel’s
                    sensation of smell and of his master’s sport, were there no game in the field?
                    What of the shark’s sensation of smell and pursuit, were there no victim in the
                    ocean? and what of the camel and the thirsty wanderer, were there no fountain of
                    fresh water in the Arabian desert? ‘The smell of a rose signifies two things,”
                    says Dr. Reid; “first, a sensation which can have no existence but when it is
                    perceived, and can only be in a sentient being or mind; secondly, it signifies
                    some power, quality, or virtue in the rose, or in effluvia proceeding from it,
                    which hath a permanent existence independent of the mind, and which, by the
                    constitution of nature, produces the sensation in us. By the original
                    constitution of our nature, we are both led to believe that there is a permanent
                    cause of the sensation, and prompted to seek after it; and experience determines
                    us to place it in the rose. The names of all smells, tastes, sounds, as well as
                    heat and cold, have a like ambiguity in all languages; but it deserves our
                    attention, that these names are but rarely, in common language, used to signify
                    the sensations; for the most part, they signify the external qualities which are
                    indicated by the sensations.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Inquiry, ch. ii. sect. 9.</p></note> We have been induced
                    thus to discuss this topic at some length, because we regretted to see Dr.
                    Reid’s opinion and reasoning misrepresented; and we shall now conclude, not as
                    this modern Berkleian does, “that if no animal had the sensation of smell, there
                    would be no odour,” but, that if there were no odour or external cause of smell,
                    no animal would have this sensation.</p>
