                <p><label type="entry">SELF-DEFENCE</label> implies not only the preservation of
                    one’s life, but also the protection of one’s property, because without property
                    life cannot be preserved in a civilized nation. The extent of property essential
                    to life is indeed small, and this consideration may enable us to decide a
                    question which some moralists have made intricate. By what means, it has been
                    asked, may a man protect his property? May he kill the person who attacks it, if
                    he cannot otherwise repel the attack?</p>
                <p>That a man, in a state of nature, may kill the person who makes an attack on his
                    life, if he cannot otherwise repel the attack, is a truth which has never been
                    controverted; and he may do the same in civil society, if his danger be so
                    imminent that it cannot be averted by the interposition of the protection
                    provided for individuals by the state. In all possible situations, except the
                    three following, whatever is absolutely necessary to the preservation of life
                    may be lawfully performed; for the law of self-preservation is the first and
                    most sacred of those laws which are impressed on every mind by the Author of
                    nature.</p>
                <p>The three excepted situations are those of a soldier in the day of battle, of a
                    criminal about to suffer by the laws of his country, and of a man called upon to
                    renounce his religion. The soldier hazards his life in the most honourable of
                    all causes, and cannot betray his trust, or play the coward, without incurring a
                    high degree of moral turpitude. He knows that the very profession in which he is
                    engaged necessarily subjects him to danger; and he voluntarily incurs that
                    danger for the good of his country, which, with great propriety, annexes to his
                    profession peculiar privileges and much glory. The criminal under sentence of
                    death cannot, without adding to his guilt, resist the execution of that
                    sentence; for the power of inflicting punishment is essential to society, and
                    society is the ordinance of God. The man who is called upon to renounce his
                    religion ought to submit to the most cruel death rather than comply with that
                    request, since religion is his only security for future and permanent happiness.
                    But in every other situation, that which is absolutely necessary to the
                    preservation of life is undoubtedly lawful. Hence it is that a person sinking in
                    water is never thought to be guilty of any crime, though he drag his neighbour
                    after him by his endeavours to save himself; and hence, too, a man in danger of
                    perishing by shipwreck may drive another from a plank which cannot carry both of
                    them, for since one of two lives must be lost, no law, human or divine, calls
                    upon either of them to prefer his neighbour’s life to his own.</p>
                <p>But though the rights of self-defence authorize us to repel every attack mode
                    upon our life, and in case of extremity to save ourselves at the expense of the
                    life of our innocent neighbour, it is not so evident that, rather than give to
                    an unjust demand a few shillings or pounds, we may lawfully deprive a
                    fellow-creature of life, and the public of a citizen. A few pounds lost may be
                    easily regained; but life when lost can never be recovered. If these pounds,
                    indeed, be the whole of a man’s property; if they include his clothes, his food,
                    and the house where he shelters his head; there cannot be a doubt that, rather
                    than part with them, he may lawfully kill the aggressor, for no man can exist
                    without shelter, and food, and raiment. But it is seldom that an<pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:chi.28490924&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=96" xml:id="kp-eb0720-0096-0082"/>
                    attempt is made, or is indeed practicable, to rob a man at once of all that he
                    possesses. The question, then, of any importance is, may a man put a robber to
                    death rather than part with a small portion of his property? Paley doubts
                    whether he could innocently do so in a state of nature,</p>
                <p>“because it cannot be contended to be for the augmentation of human happiness,
                    that one should lose his life or limb, rather than another a pennyworth of his
                    property.” He allows, that in civil society the life of the aggressor may always
                    be taken away by the person aggrieved, or meant to be aggrieved, when the crime
                    attempted is such as would subject its perpetrator to death by the laws of his
                    country.</p>
                <p>To us, however, he seems to lose sight of his own principles. No legislature can
                    have a right to take away life in civil society, but in such cases as
                    individuals have the same right in a state of nature. If therefore a man in the
                    state of nature have not a right to protect his property by killing the
                    aggressor, when it cannot be otherwise protected, it appears to us self-evident
                    that no legislature can have a right to inflict the punishment of death upon
                    such offences; but if the laws inflicting death upon the crime of robbery be
                    morally evil, it is certain that an individual cannot be innocent when he
                    prevents robbery by the death of the robber, merely because he knows that the
                    laws of his country have decreed that punishment against those convicted of the
                    crime. But we think that the protection of property by the death of the
                    aggressor may be completely vindicated upon much more general principles. It is
                    necessary in every state, that property be protected, or mankind could not
                    subsist; but in a state of nature every man must be the defender of his own
                    property, which in that state must necessarily be small; and if he be not
                    allowed to defend it by every means in his power, he will not long be able to
                    protect it at all. By giving him such liberty, a few individuals may, indeed,
                    occasionally lose their lives and limbs for the preservation of a very small
                    portion of private property; but we believe that the sum of human happiness will
                    be more augmented by cutting off such worthless wretches than by exposing
                    property to perpetual depredation; and therefore, if general utility be the
                    criterion of moral good, we must be of opinion that a man may in every case
                    lawfully kill a robber rather than comply with his unjust demand.</p>
                <p>But if a man may without guilt preserve his property by the death of the
                    aggressor, when it cannot be preserved by any other means, much more may a woman
                    have recourse to the last extremity to protect her chastity from forcible
                    violation. This, indeed, is admitted by Paley him-self, and will be controverted
                    by no man who reflects on the importance of the female character, and the
                    probable consequences of the smallest deviation from the established laws of
                    female honour.</p>
