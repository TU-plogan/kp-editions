                <p><label type="entry">SHAWLS, <hi rend="smallcaps">Figured</hi></label>. This
                    article has, within less than forty years, become a very considerable branch of
                    our manufactures. For a long period the district of Cashmere, a province of
                    Hindustan, formerly subject to the king of Candahar, produced articles of this
                    description in such perfection as to make them highly prized both in Europe and
                    in Asia. The date at which this manufacture took its rise is not known; but ever
                    since the British established themselves in India, Cashmere shawls have been
                    considered as one of the most valuable manufactures of the East.</p>
                <p>These shawls are made both long and square, the former generally measuring
                    fifty-four inches wide, and a hundred and twenty-six long; the latter are from
                    sixty-three to seventy-two ioches square. The finest of them are composed of a
                    material exquisitely soft and warm, surpassing in this respect probably any
                    other material that has ever been fabricated into clothing. It is recorded that,
                    at the most flourishing period of this manufacture, the district of Cashmere had
                    not less than 40,000 looms or frames employed in it. This district produced also
                    a fine article of cloth, which has also been imitated in this country, and is in
                    extensive use, called Cashmeres or Cassimeres. These manufactures were
                    sufficient to draw to the district of Cashmere, merchants and commercial agents
                    from Northern India, Turkey, Persia, and Tartary; and the increasing prosperity
                    of this industrious and ingenious people was only checked by the oppressions of
                    their own government, or the rapacity of the bordering states.</p>
                <p>These shawls were not more prized for their fine, soft texture, than for the
                    chaste beautiful-coloured flowering with which they were ornamented. Long
                    practice, united to a natural delicacy of taste, enabled the manufacturers to
                    dye the numerous colours of an unfading and brilliant hue, and to arrange them
                    in such a manner as to produce a harmony and elegance such as no article made in
                    Europe has ever fully equalled. The value put upon them by the traders who
                    brought them to the different markets runs from L.5 to L.100, and those of the
                    finest texture and greatest extent of figure sold for still higher prices. At a
                    time when there was a duty of eighty per cent. upon their importation into this
                    country (when, however, many were smuggled), a celebrated dealer in the article
                    in London possessed a shawl for which he asked five hundred guineas.<note

                    is now (1840) thirty per cent.</hi></p></note> *</p>
                <p>As this country became more and more engaged in a variety of manufactures, and
                    the ingenuity of so many persons was put upon the stretch, it was but natural
                    that attention should be turned to a manufacture at once so curious and so much
                    prized. It was long before the manufacturers of this country ascertained the
                    material of which the Cashmerian shawls were made, or by what process they were
                    fabricated; and hence the first specimens that were produced in imitation of
                    them in this country were very inferior. The merit of commencing, and bringing
                    to a high degree of perfection, British shawls, belongs exclusively to
                    Edinburgh, and the principal seat of the manufacture all along has been in
                    Scotland. About thirty-four years ago the late Miss Bowie, who, with her father,
                    had for a number of years been engaged in the gold-lace manufacture, attempted
                    to make square shawls of the more simple patterns, in imitation of the Cashmere,
                    by means of the sewing-needle, from a fabric made of silk, spun from the waste
                    made in reeling the finest Italian silk. This plan was tedious and expensive,
                    and in effect fell far short of the originals.</p>
                <p>The manufacture of damask had been carried on in Edinburgh for a long period. The
                    process by which the figures are produced in this elegant fabric first suggested
                    the idea that a similar contrivance might produce a close imitation of the
                    Indian shawls, both in the form of the figures and the distribution of the
                    colours attained. To accomplish this, and to train children to insert the
                    coloured yam with their fingers, were simultaneously attempted by several
                    manufacturers in Edinburgh; but although this article was manufactured by means
                    of the fingers in Cashmere, it was soon found that the higher price of labour in
                    Britain ren-<pb break="no" facs="ht:chi.28490924&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=211"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0720-0211-0193"/> dered it hopeless to establish the
                    shawl-manufacture on this principle.</p>
                <p>The part of a loom termed a lay was at last constructed, and fitted up with boxes
                    to hold the number of shuttles for the colours required. This the weaver managed
                    by a simple application of the thumb of his left hand, whereby he was enabled,
                    without stopping his loom, to throw in the coloured yarn, and make it catch the
                    threads of the warp as they were raised by the draw-boy, and thus form the
                    intended figure. Patterns required from five to twelve different colours, and
                    consequently as many shuttles. The loom being mounted on a plan similar to that
                    employed for weaving damask, required one, two, and sometimes three boys,
                    according to the extent of the pattern, to draw up the threads in their order,
                    the shuttle being driven through: where not required to form the figure, the
                    coloured yarn remained loose and useless over the whole breadth of the shawl,
                    and required to be cut off with scissors. There was thus a great waste of
                    material; but as one weaver, with one or two boys, could produce as much work in
                    a single week, as a Cashmerian, with still more hands, on his plan of working,
                    could produce in twelve months, the saving was still very great. In place of
                    using any thing like an ordinary loom, the Cashmere manufacturer had the threads
                    called the warp placed in an upright frame, and the piece worked with the
                    fingers much in the same way as tapestry used to be made. A single shawl of some
                    of the most extensive patterns occupied a whole family from one to two
                    years.</p>
                <p>The material of which the finest shawls were made, was procured from a goat found
                    in the range of mountains lying to the north and north-west of the district of
                    Cashmere. This animal is called by them the Thibet-goat, after the mountains
                    they inhabit. The skins of these animals are covered with a coat of strong hair
                    five or six inches in length; at the roots of this hair is found, in small
                    quantities, the very soft woolly substance of which the shawls are made.
                    Napoleon caused a breed of these goats to be brought to France, from the hair of
                    which shawls were made; and it has now become an article of commerce, and is
                    spun in considerable quantities both in Britain and in France. France spun and
                    manufactured it for several years before this country succeeded in importing or
                    making it; and to that country we are still indebted for a superior article of
                    yarn, which sells in this country, the doubled or warp at 48s. per pound weight,
                    and the single or weft at 30s. There are two circumstances which must at all
                    times make this article costly: the wool is obtained from the skin after death,
                    and not while the animal is alive; and the fine part requires to be picked from
                    the hairy part by the hand, no machine having yet been found capable of
                    performing the separation adequately. It farther appears that these goats are
                    found, in their natural state, only in ranges of the highest mountains; and as
                    they do not yield a fleece like sheep, it is manifest that the supply of the
                    article must at all times be very limited. During the earlier period of the
                    manufacture of shawls in this country, they were either compost'd of silk spun
                    from waste, or from a mixture of this article with the finest Saxony wool,
                    carded and spun together; the flowering being composed of the same material, or
                    of worsted; and some of the colours were of cotton only. In this state of the
                    manufacture, the makers in Edinburgh received from L.2 to L.10 sterling for each
                    shawl; and for several years the demand was good.</p>
                <p>The shawl-manufacture was soon established in several places, more particularly
                    at Norwich, Glasgow, Paisley, and at Lyons in France, and a variety of trials
                    continued to be made to lessen the expense of production. The plan of mounting,
                    at this stage of the manufacture, in preparing the loom and figure, cost in many
                    instances from L.40 to L.50 before weaving was commenced; each loom requiring
                    one, and some of the large patterns two and even three boys, to draw the cords
                    during the process of weaving. There was also the expense of clipping off all
                    the coloured yam except such as was taken up to form the figure. To lessen these
                    expenses various means had been tried, but without success.</p>
                <p>During the short peace of Amiens in 1802, a straw-hat maker in Lyons, of the name
                    of Jacquard, happened to see, in an English newspaper, an advertisement offering
                    a premium to any one who should contrive a machine for making nets. This led him
                    to turn his attention to the study of mechanics, and after many fruitless trials
                    he succeeded in contriving a machine which fully answered the purpose. He was
                    sent for, on this account, by Napoleon, and while at Paris, a superb shawl was
                    about to be woven for the Empress Josephine; and for its production they
                    employed a very costly and complicated loom, which had cost more than 20,000
                    francs. It appeared to Mr Jacquard that the same results might be produced by
                    less complicated machinery. Intense study and perseverance enabled him to
                    produce the machine that now bears his name. Mr Jacquard was rewarded with a
                    decoration of honour, and a pension of a thousand crowns per annum, and sent
                    with his machine to Lyons, the seat of the shawl and figured silk manufactures.
                    This contrivance not only superseded the use of the draw-boy, but also rendered
                    a great deal of tackling unnecessary; thus greatly simplifying and cheapening
                    the production, not only of shawls, but also that of figured articles of every
                    description.</p>
                <p>It is a striking instance of the ignorance and shortsightedness of the operatives
                    of Lyons, that when Jacquard introduced his invention, the people broke out into
                    open rebellion. He was denounced as an enemy of the people, and as the man who
                    had been scheming the destruction of their trade, and the starvation of
                    themselves and their families. Three several plots were laid to assassinate him,
                    and twice he was in great danger of losing his life. So strong was the tide of
                    prejudice and indignation, that the machine was ordered to be openly destroyed
                    by the public authorities, and was accordingly broken in pieces in the great
                    square of the city.</p>
                <p>The successful competition of foreigners, and the consequent decline of trade at
                    a subsequent period, induced some of the more intelligent manufacturers to think
                    of the man whose discovery was likely to bring some relief to the then depressed
                    manufacturers of Lyons. They made an experiment, and succeeded. Silks of the
                    greatest beauty were introduced at a lower cost, and now (1840) there is not a
                    mechanic, either in France or in Britain, who does not acknowledge the great
                    importance of Mr Jacquard’s invention. This may be fully conceived, from the
                    fact, that not only has it been very generally adopted by shawl-manufacturers,
                    but by makers of all kinds of damask, whether of silk or of linen, in Britain.
                    This improvement, together with a machine which the French had also contrived
                    about the same time, for cutting off the spare yam used in making the figures
                    (which completely superseded hand-labour), were both adopted in France some time
                    before they were introduced into Britain, which, with the advantage they derived
                    from having good yarn from the wool of the Thibet-goat, procured for the French
                    manufactures a decided advantage over the British for several years; and
                    notwithstanding a nominal protecting duty of thirty per cent. (but in reality
                    not affording more than twelve per cent. as facilities for smuggling were such,
                    that any one could have had an insurance for goods being safely delivered in
                    London, on paying to the French merchant twelve per cent. extra), goods were
                    brought over in great quantities, which, together with a general desire for
                    foreign productions, had the effect of ruining several British shawl-makers, as
                    well as some extensive dealers in the article. The improvements invented<pb

                    xml:id="kp-eb0720-0212-0194"/> by the French, however, quickly found their way
                    to this country, and being applied with energy, soon produced a re-action in
                    favour of Scotch manufacturers, and caused the French to suffer in their turn,
                    from having made too large quantities in the hopes of retaining the London
                    trade. British figured shawls are now manufactured equal, in point of elegance,
                    with any produced in France, and superior to those of every other country in
                    lowness of price. They are manufactured from the wool of the Thibet-goat, which
                    is as soft as, and more perfect in figure than, the best Cashmere, and probably
                    less than a tenth part of the cost. The material, however, used for the
                    flowering, being finer, and the colours being more durable in the manufactures
                    of Cashmere, they still retain a superiority over those of Europe.</p>
                <p>Edinburgh, from the commencement of this manufacture, has taken the lead in most
                    of the improvements connected with it, always producing the best goods of the
                    kind; but from the circumstance of labour of various kinds being lower in
                    Paisley and Glasgow, the manufacture has mostly been transferred to these
                    places. At one time there were about a thousand hands employed in Edinburgh in
                    this manufacture; now it scarcely gives work to one hundred.</p>
                <p>Shawls in imitation of Cashmere are made of a very great variety of qualities.
                    While some of those made of the finest materials and richest patterns still sell
                    for L.8 or L.10 each, there are a great many made of a mixture of silk and
                    cotton, silk and wool, cotton and wool, and some are made wholly of cotton, so
                    that figured shawls can be purchased at five shillings each. It is computed
                    that, at the present time, this description of shawls gives employment to at
                    least 20,000 hands. A great many are exported to America, as well as to other
                    parts of the world. See <hi rend="smallcaps">Weaving. (b. y.)</hi></p>
