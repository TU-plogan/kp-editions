                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra
                    space around the <gi>pb</gi> tag. Where a word is hyphenated at a <gi>pb</gi>,

                <p><label type="entry">SUEZ</label>, a seaport situated at the northern extremity of
                    the gulf of the same name. It is so incommodious that small boats can with
                    difficulty land at the quay even at high water The town is in a ruinous state,
                    walled on the west and southwest; but the wall is rapidly falling to decay. The
                    population only consists of about a dozen agents, who receive goods from the
                    ports of the Red Sea, and forward them to their correspondents at Cairo,
                    together with some shopkeepers, who deal chiefly in provisions. Neither
                    merchants nor artisans live in it. The pacha keeps a garrison here of about
                    fifty horsemen, with an officer, who commands the town, the neighbouring Arabs,
                    and the shipping in the harbour. Suez is one of the few harbours in the Red Sea
                    where ships can be repaired. Although the port is now little frequented, the
                    trade in coffee and India goods still passes this way to Cairo.</p>
                <p>The isthmus of Suez is a low-lying land, composed of shell limestone rock, mixed
                    with strata of siliceous limestone, and partly covered with sands or with saline
                    marshes. In several places the solid strata are with difficulty perceived by
                    their slight undulations; in the northern part in particular there is a vast
                    plain, varied only by sand-hills. To the east, the south-east, and the
                    south-west, the mountain-chains of Arabia Petraea and of Egypt skirt at a
                    distance the table-land of the isthmus, which is terminated at the Red Sea. The
                    lake Birket-el-Ballah adjoining Lake Menzaleh, Temsah or Crocodile Lake, and the
                    almost dry basin of the Bitter Lakes, form from north to south a series of
                    depressions, interrupted only by stripes of low land. The breadth of the
                    isthmus, in a straight line from the mouth of Tinch on the Mediterranean to the
                    northern point of the Gulf of Suez, is 878,844 feet, or nearly seventy-two
                    miles.</p>
                <p>The question whether or not the Isthmus of Suez has always existed, has given
                    rise to much discussion among the learned; some maintaining that this neck of
                    land was formerly covered by the sea, and that Africa was an island; others that
                    it must formerly have been much narrower than it is now; and others that it has
                    undergone little or no change. This latter hypothesis is defended by D'Anville,
                    in opposition to the opinions of Gossellin and Rosière, whose arguments are in
                    favour of the contraction of the gulf.</p>
                <p>The surface of the isthmus generally declines from the shores of the Red Sea
                    towards those of the Mediterranean; and the level of the latter is thirty feet
                    lower than that of the Gulf of Suez. There is a similar descent towards the
                    Delta and the bed of the river Nile; the level of the water of the Nile at
                    Cairo, when at its lowest, being about nine feet lower than the surface of the
                    gulf at low water. But the Nile rising sixteen cubits by the Nilometer, is nine
                    feet higher than the Red Sea at high water, and fourteen higher than the same
                    sea at low water. Besides these leading inclinations of the surface, there is a
                    particular one in the middle of the isthmus. The deep basin called the Bitter
                    Lakes is more than fifty-four feet lower than the level of the Red Sea, the
                    waters of which would enter and fill it if they were not prevented by a little
                    sandy isthmus about three feet above the level of the sea.</p>
                <p>From this it follows that the Red Sea never could have occupied the basin of the
                    Bitter Lakes in a constant manner, because its waters, if raised sufficiently
                    high to form such a communication, would have found no barrier to the north of
                    that basin: they would have flowed all the way to the Nile by the Ras-el-Ooadi,
                    and to the Mediterranean by the Ras-el-Mayah. The two seas thus brought into
                    contact would have reached a common level, and the strait would have become
                    permanent.</p>
                <p>But if a natural communication between the two seas has never existed within the
                    periods of human record, the traces and remains of a canal have been ascertained
                    with satisfactory precision. From Balbeis, on the old Pelusiac branch of the
                    Nile, now the Canal of Menedji, this canal reaches to Ablasch, the ancient Thou.
                    There it enters the narrow valley of Arabes-Tommylat, the level of which is
                    thirty-three feet lower than that of the Red Sea. It passes on to Abookes-heyd,
                    which is supposed to be the old Heroopolis. The basin of the Bitter Lakes might
                    have been filled at pleasure from the waters of the Nile.</p>
                <p>Beyond this basin the traces of the canal re-appear in the isthmus which
                    separates the lakes from the Red Sea, and show that the canal was continued the
                    whole way. According to Strabo, this canal was constructed by the Ptolemies; and
                    the Arabian writers assert that it was opened<pb break="no"

                    again by order of the Caliph Omar, and was used for navigation from the year 644
                    to 767; at which time another caliph caused it to be shut up. in order to
                    deprive a rebel chief of his supplies of provisions. While the French army was
                    in Egypt, some learned discussions were maintained on the practicability and
                    advantages of its restitution. But however useful its re-establishment might be
                    to the country through which it passes, it is very problematical if it could
                    ever be rendered a medium of commercial communication on a large scale.</p>
