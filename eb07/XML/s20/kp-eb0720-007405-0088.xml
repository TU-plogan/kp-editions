                <p><label type="entry">SEDUCTION</label> is the act of tempting and drawing aside
                    from the right path, and comprehends every endeavour to corrupt any individual
                    of the human race. This is the import of the word in its largest and most
                    general sense; but it is commonly employed to express the act of tempting a
                    virtuous woman to part with her chastity.</p>
                <p>The seducer of female innocence practises the same stratagems of fraud to get
                    possession of a woman’s person, that the swindler employs to get possession of
                    his neighbour’s goods or money; yet the law of honour, which pretends to abhor
                    deceit and which impels its votaries to murder every man who presumes, however
                    justly, to suspect them of fraud, or to question their veracity, applauds the
                    address of a successful intrigue, though it be well known that the seducer could
                    not have obtained his end without swearing to the truth of a thousand
                    falsehoods, and calling upon God to witness promises which he never meant to
                    fulfil.</p>
                <p>The law of honour is indeed a very capricious rule, which accommodates itself to
                    the pleasures and conveniences of higher life; but the law of the land, which is
                    enacted for the equal protection of high and low, may be supposed to view the
                    guilt of seduction with a more impartial eye. Yet for this offence, even the
                    laws of this kingdom have provided no other punishment than a pecuniary
                    satisfaction to they injured family; which, in England, can be obtained only by
                    one of the quaintest fictions in the world, by the father’s bringing his action
                    against the seducer for the loss of his daughter’s service during her pregnancy
                    and nurturing. (See Paley’s Moral Philosophy, book iii. part iii. chap. 3.)</p>
                <p>The moralist, however, who estimates the merit or demerit of actions, not by laws
                    of human appointment but by their general consequences as established by the
                    laws of nature, must consider the seducer as a criminal of the deepest guilt. In
                    every civilized country, and in many countries where civilization has made but
                    small progress, the virtue of women is collected as it were into a single point
                    which they are to guard above all things, as that on which their happiness and
                    reputation wholly depend. At first sight this may appear a capricious
                    regulation; but a moment’s reflection will convince us of the contrary. In the
                    married state so much confidence is necessarily reposed in the fidelity of women
                    to the beds of their husbands, and<pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:chi.28490924&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=89" xml:id="kp-eb0720-0089-0075"/>
                    evils so great result from the violation of that fidelity, that whatever
                    contributes in any degree to its preservation, must be agreeable to Him who, in
                    establishing the laws of nature, intended them to be subservient to the real
                    happiness of all his creatures. But nothing contributes so much to preserve the
                    fidelity of wives to their husbands, as the impressing upon the minds of women
                    the highest veneration for the virtue of chastity. She who, when unmarried, has
                    been accustomed to grant favours to different men, will not find it easy, if
                    indeed possible, to resist afterwards the allurements of variety. It is
                    therefore a wise institution, and agreeable to the will of Him who made us, to
                    train up women so that they may look upon the loss of their chastity as the most
                    disgraceful of all crimes; as that which sinks them in the order of society, and
                    robs them of all their value. In this light virtuous women actually look upon
                    the loss of chastity. The importance of that virtue has been so deeply impressed
                    upon their minds, and is so closely associated with the principle of honour,
                    that they cannot think but with abhorrence upon the very deed by which it is
                    lost. He therefore who by fraud and falsehood persuades the unsuspecting girl to
                    deviate in one instance from the honour of the sex, weakens in a great degree
                    her moral principle; and if he reconcile her to a repetition of the crime, he
                    destroys that principle entirely, as she has been taught to consider all other
                    virtues as inferior to that of chastity. Hence it is that the hearts of
                    prostitutes are generally steeled against the miseries of their
                    fellow-creatures; that they lend their aid to the seducer in his practices upon
                    other girls; that they lie, and swear, and steal without compunction; and that
                    too many of them hesitate not to commit murder, if it can serve any selfish
                    purpose of their own.</p>
                <p>The loss of virtue, though the greatest that man or woman can sustain, is not the
                    only injury which the seducer bringe upon the girl whom he deceives. She cannot
                    at once reconcile herself to prostitution, or even to the loss of character, and
                    whilst a sense of shame remains in her mind, the misery which she suffers must
                    be exquisite. She knows that she has forfeited what in the female character is
                    most valued by both sexes; and she must be under the perpetual dread of a
                    discovery. She cannot even confide in the honour of her seducer, who may reveal
                    her secret in a fit of drunkenness, and thus rob her of her fame as well as of
                    her virtue; and whilst she is in this state of anxious uncertainty, the agony of
                    her mind must be insupportable. That it is so in fact, the many instances of
                    child-murder by unmarried women of every rank leave us no room to doubt. The
                    affection of a mother to her new-born child is one of the strongest and most
                    unequivocal instincts in human nature; and nothing short of the extremity of
                    distress can prompt any one so far to oppose nature as to embrue her hands in
                    the blood of her imploring infant.</p>
                <p>Even this deed of horror seldom prevents a detection of the mother’s frailty,
                    which is indeed commonly discovered, though no child has been the consequence of
                    her intrigue. He who can seduce is base enough to betray; and assuredly no woman
                    can part with her honour and yet retain any well-grounded hope that her amour
                    shall be kept secret. The villain to whom she surrendered will glory in his
                    victory, if it was with difficulty obtained; and if she surrendered at
                    discretion, her own behaviour will reveal her secret. Her reputation is then
                    irretrievably lost, and no future circumspection will be of the smallest avail
                    to recover it. She will be shunned by the virtuous part of her own sex, and
                    treated as a mere instrument of pleasure by the other. In such circumstances she
                    cannot expect to he married with advantage. She may perhaps be able to captivate
                    the heart of a heedless youth, and prevail upon him to unite his fate to hers,
                    before the delirium of his passion shall give him time for reflection; she may
                    be addressed by a man who is a stranger to her story, and married while he has
                    no suspicion of her secret; or she may be solicited by one of a station inferior
                    to her own, who, though acquainted with every thing that has befallen her, can
                    barter the delicacy of wedded love for some pecuniary advantage. But from none
                    of these marriages can she look for happiness. The delirium which prompted the
                    first will soon vanish, and leave the husband to the bitterness of his own
                    reflections, which can hardly fail to produce cruelty to the wife. Of the secret
                    to which, in the second case, the lover was a stranger, the husband will soon
                    make a discovery, or at least find room for harbouring strong suspicions; and
                    suspicions of having been deceived in a point so delicate have hitherto been
                    uniformly the parents of misery. In the third case, the man married her merely
                    for her money, of which having got the possession, he has no further inducement
                    to treat her with respect. Such are some of the consequences of seduction, even
                    when the person seduced has the good fortune afterwards to get a husband. But
                    this is a fortune which few in her circumstances can reasonably expect. By far
                    the greater part of those who have been defrauded of their virtue by the arts of
                    the seducer sink deeper and deeper into guilt, till they become at last common
                    prostitutes. The public is then deprived of their services as wives and parents;
                    and instead of contributing to the population of the state, and to the sum of
                    domestic felicity, these outcasts of society become seducers in their turn,
                    corrupting the morals of every young man whose appetites they can inflame, and
                    of every young woman whom they can entice to their own practices.</p>
                <p>All this complication of evil is produced at first by arts which, if employed to
                    deprive a man of his property, would subject the offender to the execration of
                    his fellow-subjects, and to an ignominious death. But while the forger of a bill
                    is pursued with relentless rigour by the ministers of justice, and the swindler
                    loaded with universal reproach, the man who by fraud and forgery has enticed an
                    innocent girl to gratify his desires at the expense of her virtue, and thus
                    introduced her into a path which must infallibly lead to her own ruin, as well
                    as to repeated injuries to the public at large, is not despised by his own sex,
                    and is too often caressed even by the virtuous part of the other. Yet the loss
                    of property may be easily repaired; whilst the loss of honour is irreparable. It
                    is vain to plead in alleviation of this guilt, that women should be on their
                    guard against the arts of the seducer. Most unquestionably they should; but arts
                    have been used which hardly any degree of caution would have been sufficient to
                    counteract. It may as well be said that the trader should be on his guard
                    against the arts of the forger, and accept of no bill without previously
                    consulting him in whose name it is written. Cases, indeed, occur in trade, in
                    which this caution would be impossible. But he must be little acquainted with
                    the workings of the human heart, who does not know that situations likewise
                    occur in life, in which it is equally impossible for a girl of tenderness and
                    virtue to resist the arts of the man who has completely gained her
                    affections.</p>
