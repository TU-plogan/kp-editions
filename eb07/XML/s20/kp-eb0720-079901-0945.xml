                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra

                <p><label type="entry">SUIDAS</label>, a Greek lexicorapher, is supposed by
                    Fabricius to have lived during the latter part of the eleventh century; but
                    other writers are disposed to believe that he must have belonged to a more
                    recent period. His country and his personal history arc alike unknown. From
                    authors of various denominations he compiled an ample dictionary, which, with
                    all its imperfections, has been found a most valuable repository of ancient
                    erudition; and no scholar, intimately acquainted with the Greek language and
                    literature, is unacquainted with the Lexico of Suidas. The first edition, which
                    is very elegantly printed, was published by Demetrius Chalcondylus, Mediol.
                    1499, fol. He had access to several manuscripts. The text of Aldus has some
                    appearance of being derived from a different source, Venet. 1514, fol. A third
                    edition, with various interpolatione, followed after a longer interval, Basil.
                    1544, fol. It was succeeded by the Latin version of Wolfius, Basil. 1564, fol.
                    Basil. 1581, fol. An edition of the Greek text, accompanied with a Latin
                    version, was published by Aemilius Portus, Colon. Allobrog. 1619, 2 tom. fol. A
                    splendid and valuable edition was at length produced by Küster, Cantab. 1705, 3
                    tom. fol. Here the version of Portus has received innumerable corrections; and
                    from the collation of manuscripts, as well as by the aid of his own critical
                    sagacity, he effected a great reformation of the text. He was a man of superior
                    talents, and of profound erudition; but it is admitted that he ought to have
                    devoted a greater portion of time to so formidable an undertaking. His edition
                    was assailed by J. Gronovius in three different publications; and to this
                    virulent critic Küster replied in a <hi rend="italic">Diatribe
                    Anti-Gronoviana,</hi> of which a second edition was printed at Amsterdam, 1712,
                    8vo. The text of Suidas was afterwards illustrated by many other writers, nor
                    must we fail to mention the elaborate work of Toup, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Emendationes in Suidam,</hi> Lond. 1760-6, 3 tom. 8vo. Oxon. 1790, 4 tom. 8vo.
                    The labours of these learned men prepared the way for a most valuable edition,
                    recently published under the following title: “Suidae Lexico post Ludolphum
                    Kusterum ad codices manuscriptos recensuit Thomas Gaisford, S.T.P. Aedis Christi
                    Decanus, necnon Graecae Linguae Professor Regius.” Oxon. 1834, 3 tom. fol. The
                    third volume is very thin, and merely includes three Indices. By his edition of
                    Suidas, Dr Gaisford has made a great accession to his former reputation in a
                    department of learning in which he has no living rival in Great Britain.</p>
