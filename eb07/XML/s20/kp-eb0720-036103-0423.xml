                <p><label type="entry">SINDE</label>, an extensive kingdom of Hindustan, which
                    extends from the district of Shikarpoor on the frontier of Cabul, and the island
                    of Bukkor in the Indus, along the level plain, watered by that river to the sea;
                    in length about two hundred and fifty miles by eighty miles in average breadth.
                    The general boundaries are the British principality of Cutch and the Indian
                    ocean to the south; the kingdom of Jessulmere and the Rejistah, or Sandy Desert,
                    to the east, which extends from the territories of Cutch five hundred and fifty
                    miles in length by a hundred and fifty in breadth; the mountains of Belochistan
                    on the west; and the provincesof Seewistan and Babawulpoor on the north. It is a
                    flat alluvial country, situated between the 23d and 27th degrees of north
                    latitude, and the 67th and 71 st degrees of cast longitude; and is crossed in a
                    diagonal direction by the Indus and its brandies, which form adclta, in length
                    about a hundred miles along the coast. The lower part of this delta is
                    intersected by numerous rivers and creeks, like the delta of the Ganges, but it
                    has no trees on it, the dry parts being covered with brush-wood, and the
                    remainder, by much the greater part, being noisome swamps, or muddy lakes. The
                    streams which break off from the Indus, diverge in all directions into other
                    streams, which interlock into each other, and chequer the whole country. To
                    trace in detail those complicated branches into which the main stream is thus
                    divided would be useless. All those various streams which overspread the
                    country, greatly increase its fertility; but often prove pernicious to those who
                    dwell on the banks, by the exhalations which arise under a tropical sun, from
                    the annual inundations. “Few countries,” says Major Rennel, “are more
                    unwholesome to European constitutions, particularly the lower part of the
                    delta.”</p>
                <p>Sinde may be termed a level country, intersected with rocky hills. Those tracts
                    which are within the limits of the inundation, rival in fertility the borders of
                    the Nile-Even those parts which are at a distance from the river, are capable of
                    being cultivated, provided there is no failure in the periodical rains. This,
                    however, frequently happens, as no country in the world is more subject to
                    drought. During great part of the south-west monsoon, or at least in the months
                    of July, August, and part of September, which is the season of the periodical
                    rains in most parts of India, the atmosphere is generally clouded, but no rain
                    falls, except very near the sea. At Tatta, when it was visited by Captain
                    Hamilton, no rain had fallen for three years. Owing to this, and to the vicinity
                    of the sandy deserts, which bound this country on the east, and on the
                    northwest, the heats are so violent, and the winds from these quarters so
                    unwholesome, that the houses are contrived so as to be ventilated by means of
                    apertures on the top of them, resembling the funnels of small chimneys. During
                    the prevalence of the hot winds, the windows are shut in order to exclude the
                    lower and hottest current of the air, along with the clouds of dust which it
                    sets in motion; and the cooler portion descends into the house through the
                    funnels.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Rennel’s Memoir
                    of a Map of Hindostan. p. 290.</p></note> When Lieutenant now Colonel Pottinger
                    was at Tatta with the mission that was sent to the court of Hydrabad in 1808,
                    the rains were extremely violent; they descended so heavily that the streets
                    frequently ran like rivulets; and in the coolest apartment, the thermometer
                    usually ranged from 94 to 102; this was in June. Towards the middle of July it
                    became much cooler, and strong northerly gales set in, which cooled the air; and
                    at Hydrabad, during the summer season, the mission experienced the heaviest
                    falls of rain, which caused the Futelee river to overflow its banks; and owing
                    to the exhalations from a burning sun, the thermometer seldom falling below 102,
                    and the atmosphere at night being particularly oppressive, beyond, Colonel
                    Pottinger observes, what he had ever experienced in India, the followers of the
                    mission were attacked by fevers and other complaints; and it was only by taking
                    regular exercise, and using requisite precautions, that the gentlemen of the
                    mission continued to maintain themselves in health.<note anchored="true"

                <p>The country increases in barrenness as it recedes eastward from the Indus, and
                    its tributaries; and in the vicinity of the Northern Runn, it is described by
                    Dr. Burnes, who travelled through this country in 1825, as a dead unproductive
                    flat, a perfect desert, in which not a tree, house, nor human being, was to be
                    seen, and where it was even difficult to procure a little brackish water from
                    the stagnant marshes that were occasionally seen. For about fifty miles eastward
                    from Cutch, as far as the town of Rurce, and nearly the same distance from the
                    Indus the country presents the same aspect; namely, a sterile flat. The town of
                    Rurce, though superior to most of the towns in this country, yet being removed
                    beyond the freshes of the Indus had suffered severely from drought, so that the
                    inhabitants were reduced below 500.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>See Narrative of a Visit to the Court of Sinde, by James
                    Burnes, p 36.</p></note> The villages which are met with in this country, have
                    also the same miserable appearance, being far inferior to those of Cutch, on the
                    eastern side of the Runn. In place of the stone buildings, and tiled roofs,
                    which give an air of neatness and comfort to those of the latter country, they
                    are for the most part collections of low huts, composed of clay and thatch; and
                    even the mosques are built of the same frail materials, of rather greater
                    elevation indeed, and with a feeble attempt at ornament. Many of the inhabitants
                    inhabit grass hovels in the fields, from which, by hard labour, they extort a
                    miserable subsistence. When either food or forage fail, it is not unusual<pb
                    break="no" facs="ht:chi.28490924&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=424"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0720-0424-0362"/> for the whole population of a village to migrate
                    to another station, as choice or necessity prompts them. Westward, the country
                    gradually improves, and on approaching the region of the inundation, it presents
                    an appearance of extensive cultivation, and the richness of the soil is
                    everywhere remarkable, It is intersected by numerous canals from the branches of
                    the Indus, dug for the purposes of navigation, and over which small brick
                    bridges have been thrown, on which water wheels are placed, by which a supply of
                    moisture is distributed over the fields. The country in the vicinity of Hydrabad
                    assumes a hilly appearance; and westward of the Indus it is bounded by a pile of
                    barren mountains, that are quite as inhospitable, both as to soil and climate,
                    as the sandy desert which is seen at a distance from the Indus and its waters.
                    Near the sea at Kurachee, in latitude 24. 52. north, longitude 67. 17. east,
                    west of the river, the country is, for eight or ten miles, a dead flat; and as,
                    when it was visited by Pottinger, there had been a want of rain for several
                    seasons, the earth was quite burned, without the slightest trace of vegetation,
                    except some small stunted bushes scattered over the plain. But the inhabitants
                    assured him that in forty-eight hours after a plentiful fall of rain, the ground
                    would be a perfect grass plat, moisture being here, as in other hot regions, the
                    great agent of fertility.</p>
                <p>The climate is hot; the thermometer varying, in the months of June and July, from
                    90 to 100; and the country is within the range of the monsoons, and the
                    periodical rains. It is mentioned, however, by Dr. Burnes, that in January 1828,
                    the rain fell in torrents at Hydrabad, which was attended with more piercing
                    cold than he had ever experienced in Europe. In the northern parts of Sinde the
                    air is pure, and refreshed by the cooling breezes from the westward, so that the
                    heat is far from being intolerable. On the western bank of the river, from the
                    latitude of Schwan in 26. 6., there is a variety of feature in the face of the
                    country, some districts being mountainous, some flat, some intersected by ranges
                    of low mountains down to the sea.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                <p>The banks of the Indus near Hydrabad, and generally throughout its lower course,
                    are well cultivated, except where the Ameers, the rulers of the country, have
                    converted the most fruitful fields and districts into gloomy and impervious
                    forests for the preservation of game; those princes being unfortunately
                    passionately fond of hunting, and like all despotic princes, gratifying their
                    inclinations at whatever expense of misery to their subjects. It is mentioned
                    that one of the princes, Meer Futtch Ali, depopulated one of the most fertile
                    spots in the neighbourhood of Hydrabad, which yielded two to three lacs of
                    rupees annually, because frequented by a peculiar species of antelope, which he
                    found great pleasure in hunting. And the youngest brother, Mourad Ali, banished
                    the inhabitants of an ancient village and razed it to the ground, because the
                    crowing of cocks, and the grazing of cattle, disturbed the game in the
                    neighbouring lands, which were contiguous. The game laws of Europe are
                    sufficiently tyrannical; but they are fortunately corrected by the milder
                    influence of manners. During the swelling of the river, grain and other seeds
                    are reared; the remainder of the year is employed in the production of indigo,
                    sugar-cane, and all kinds of grain. They have also extensive pastures; and the
                    country would rapidly advance in wealth, but for the oppressive rapacity of the
                    government. It is the heavy taxes which ruin industry in this, as in most other
                    eastern countries. Every beegah of land watered by a canal or wheel, pays a
                    revenue of from l ½ to 31/ <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> rupees to the
                    government. A duty of one rupee is also charged on each kun war, or 120 pounds
                    of giain reaped by the farmers. Garden land producing fruit trees, pays 2 ½
                    rupees per bee gah; and the spring crop of tobacco is rated at 4 ½ rupees per
                    beegah. The tax on sugar is collected in kind, and is 4 ½ rupees per beegah. But
                    these are not the only exactions with which agriculture is burdened. Its produce
                    has to pay other dues in the market before it is allowed to be sold. Boats that
                    arrive at Tatta are all taxed in proportion to their value; and these exactions
                    generally exceed the original cost of the articles on which they are imposed.
                    The revenues that are derived from Kurachee, situated west of the Indus, at the
                    south-western extremity of Sinde, of which it has become of late years the
                    principal sea-port, are farmed, agreeable to the wretched policy that obtains
                    throughout this country; and in 1809, according to the information of the able
                    and enterprising traveller, Lieutenant Pottinger, there was paid on this
                    account, into the public treasury, 99,000 rupees, or L. 12,375; and the vender
                    was supposed to clear 12,000 rupees. The revenues have since increased to one
                    lack 23,000 rupees, equal to L.15,375. This increase of revenue is ascribed
                    solely to the local advantages of the port, being a central point between India
                    and the dominions of Cabul, as also Khorassan, Balk, Bokhara, &amp;c. The
                    disorderly state of the country, from the decreasing authority of the Khan of
                    Kelat, diverted the trade into this route through Sinde, the merchants finding
                    the heavy exactions imposed on them more tolerable than the risk of violence to
                    which they were exposed in other parts.</p>
                <p>It has been remarked that despotic power, wielded by wisdom and goodness, would
                    constitute the best government. But unfortunately, in Sinde it is wielded
                    neither by wisdom nor goodness, but is a fearful instrument of rapacity and
                    oppression, in the hands of the tyrants who rule the country, who, having no
                    conception that it is for their own interest that the people should thrive,
                    despoil them of their wealth, thus crushing the seeds of future accumulation,
                    and for ever preventing any improvement of the national revenues. Under this
                    short-sighted policy, the imposts and taxation in Sinde, according to Dr.
                    Burnes, whose work affords valuable information on this subject, are enormous,
                    and paralyze the whole trade and industry of the country. With the
                    characteristic recklessness of an arbitrary government, the revenues are farmed
                    to the highest bidders, who, as they are responsible to their task-masters for
                    the produce, and can never expect indulgence on any pretence, are obliged to
                    satisfy their rapacity, and to extort a revenue by whatever means from the
                    impoverished people. Were it not for the great natural advantages with which the
                    country is blessed, in the never-failing supply of moisture from the inundation
                    of the Indus, which renders the cultivator independent of the tropical rains,
                    her industry must have sunk under the manifold evils of ignorance and misrule.
                    This is <hi rend="italic">a</hi> source of fertility, of which no tyranny can
                    despoil this highly favoured land; and thus the bounty of Providence is here
                    more effectual to renovate, than the wickedness of man to destroy. The
                    cultivator looks with certainty to an abundant harvest, and is enabled to export
                    of his abundance to other countries. “Hence,” says the judicious traveller
                    already referred to, “there is an appearance of plenty and contentment
                    throughout this misgoverned land, which would surprise any traveller who did not
                    take every circumstance into consideration.” Certain checks, however imperfect,
                    no doubt exist to the excesses of despotic power. The farmers of the revenues
                    are generally Hindus, who have no influence with the Ameers, by whom they are
                    despised for their religion, and envied on account of their wealth; and on this
                    account, they are the more ready to listen to any complaints against their
                    oppressions from the Ryots, and to grant them redress. This, however, is but a
                    feeble safeguard against oppression; and it too often happens that the interests
                    of<pb break="no" facs="ht:chi.28490924&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=425"

                    spoliation of the helpless villager.</p>
                <p>The principal articles of domestic produce, which are exported chiefly from
                    Kurachee, are rice, ghee, hides, shark fins, potash, saltpetre, assafoetida,
                    bdellium, madder, frankincense, Tatta-cloths, indigo, oleaginous and other
                    seeds. From Mooltan, and the countries to the northward, are imported for
                    re-exportation, alum, musk, horses, Kashmeer shawls, dried fruit, diamonds,
                    lapis lazuli, turquoise, and other precious stones and gums. Other imports are
                    tin, iron, lead, steel, ivory, European manufactures, sandal and other scented
                    woods, from the south of India; swords and carpets from Khorasan and Candabar,
                    silk and other articles from the Persian Gulf. The merchants who are settled
                    here from Mooltan are the principal traders, and the wealthiest part of the
                    community. The exports from Sinde to Bombay consist of sharks’ fins and flesh,
                    bdellium, ghee, potash, saltpetre, hides, oil of sesame, wheat, assafoetida,
                    oil, raisins, almonds, colouring plants, pistachio flowers and nuts, shawls,
                    cloths, mustard, wild saffron, black cummin seed from Kerman, white cummin seed,
                    chintzes both from Sinde and Khorasan. In return are received from Bombay,
                    sugar, sugar-candy, steel, iron, tin, tutenaque, lead, cochineal, betel-nut,
                    black pepper, dried cocoa nuts, vermillion, red lead, quicksilver, Bengal and
                    China silks and cloths, cinnamon, cardamoms, cloves, nutmegs, sandal-wood,
                    grapes, china ware, pearls, aloes, and amuttas. A considerable trade is carried
                    on with Muscat, Cutch, and with Mooltan and Cabul. To Muscat the exports are
                    dressed leather, rice, wheat, sirshif oil, ghee, bdellium, chintzes, and other
                    cloths; for which the returns are dates, limes, roses, silk from the Persian
                    province of Ghilan, elephants’ teeth, pearls, almonds, preserved fruit, cowries,
                    slaves, arsenic, senna from Mecca, quince seeds, and gum. From Cutch it derives
                    a supply of cotton, snuff, unwrought iron found in Cutch, and the small Arabian
                    aloe. The Indus affords an easy means of intercourse with this province and the
                    countries to the northward, being navigable for small vessels to a great
                    distance from the sea. With Mooltan and Cabul the trade is carried on chiefly by
                    caravans, and also by merchants and travellers. It is proper to add, that the
                    trade in the Indus had greatly decayed, and had become merely nominal, the
                    ignorant and tyrannical policy of the Ameers having nearly crushed it in that
                    province, and the unsettled state of the countries to the northward rendering it
                    precarious in that quarter. In 1808 it was carried on by a few boats passing up
                    and down with grain, saltpetre, salt, and firewood; though, with the increasing
                    ascendancy of the British in this quarter, and the restoration of order and
                    peace in these former regions of anarchy, the former intercourse has revived,
                    and will now be carried on with greater security than ever. A factory,
                    established at Tatta in 1756 by the East India Company, which carried on a
                    considerable trade with the province of Sinde, and was withdrawn, probably from
                    the demoralised state and poverty of the country; though so late as the
                    beginning of the present century, Mr. Crow was a commercial resident at Tatta.
                    An unsuccessful attempt was since made in 1808 to renew the intercourse; but the
                    haughty and jealous chieftains who ruled in this province rejected all advances
                    on the part of the British. Ever since the occupation of Cutch by the British
                    troops in 1819, they viewed the extension of their dominions with distrust, and
                    maintained a cold and unfriendly attitude. No European officer was allowed to
                    cross the frontier from Cutch; and even a special envoy, who had proceeded from
                    Bombay in 1820, on the invitation of their own minister, was coldly received,
                    and it was only in 1825 that a most friendly letter was received, with an
                    invitation to Dr. Burnes to proceed without delay to Hydrabad, on account of the
                    alleged sickness of one of the principal chiefs. The invitation vas accepted,
                    and he was received with every mark of confidence. A treaty has been since
                    ratified in 1838 by the Ameers of Sinde, providing for the reception of a
                    British resident; to which office Colonel Pottinger has been appointed.</p>
                <p>The government of Sinde is a military despotism. After a long era of civil
                    commotion, Futtch Ali Khan was called to exercise the supreme power, who
                    generously admitted his three brothers, Ghoolam Ali, Kurm Ali, and Mourad Ali,
                    to a participation in his high destiny. He died in 1801, and Ghoolam Ali in
                    1811. The supreme power in Sinde is now vested in the two youngest and surviving
                    brothers, Meers Kurm and Mourad Ali, who are known as the chief Ameers, and
                    whose seals are affixed to all public documents issued in the name of the
                    government. But there are others of the family who are scarcely inferior in rank
                    to these princes, on whom has devolved the executive government. The two
                    deceased brothers, Futtch and Ghoolam Ali, left sons, to whom they bequeathed
                    their shares in the administration, and who, though they have been kept back by
                    their youth, and the grasping spirit of their uncles, had, when Dr. Burnes was
                    at Hydrabad in 1827, acquired ascendancy in the state; and since his departure,
                    one of them had risen in successful rebellion, and had raised himself to a
                    political equality with his relatives. The two sons of Mourad Ali, Noor Mahommed
                    and Nusseer Khan, are also among the heads of the government. All these chiefs
                    are in possession of respective portions of the revenues of Sinde. After the
                    death of Futtch Ali, the province was partitioned into four shares, of which the
                    largest belongs to Mourad Ali, who, on the plea of his having descendants,
                    continued to despoil his brother and Meer Mahommed of much of their possessions.
                    There are other nobles who are related to the royal family, and who are allowed
                    to assume the title of meer, or lord, but are not permitted to interfere in the
                    affairs of state, deriving their importance solely from their alliance with the
                    reigning princes. The real power centres in Meer Mourad Ali, who is represented
                    as a gloomy tyrant, a slave to avarice, and a plunderer of his people. At the
                    court of the Ameers, every thing is conducted on a scale of magnificence
                    scarcely equalled at any other court in Hindustan. The parade that was exhibited
                    when Colonel Pottinger and Dr. Burnes were severally received at court, is
                    described by these travellers; and they both agree in celebrating the surpassing
                    richness and splendour of the scene. The princes, says the former writer, wore a
                    vast number of jewels, beside those that were set in the hilts and scabbards of
                    their swords and daggers; and their waist-belts displayed some extraordinary
                    emeralds and rubies. They were seated on a thin felt, that extended all round
                    the circle, and over which was laid a silk mattrass, about an inch thick, spread
                    with a muslin cloth, embroidered in a most exquisite manner with gold and silver
                    flowers. They reclined on three large pillows, covered with similar embroidery,
                    which, with the display of jewels, gave the whole an inconceivably rich effect.
                    “Many of the officers of government,” he continues, “appeared in very good
                    style; and the general splendour and richness of the scene far surpassed any
                    thing we had expected to see at the court of Hydrabad.”<note anchored="true"

                    p. 367.</p></note> The dress of the princes, which was not ornamental, consisted
                    in fine muslin tunics, with costly sashes tied round their waists, and their
                    turbans of thin transparent gauze were of the largest dimensions, about 2 ½ feet
                    in diameter, and yet so neatly folded up, as to give them a very becoming
                    appearance. Dr. Burnes observes, that when he was first introduced at court,<pb
                    break="no" facs="ht:chi.28490924&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=426"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0720-0426-0364"/> the <hi rend="italic">coup d’oeil</hi> was
                    splendid, and that the spectacle approached nearer than any thing he had seen to
                    the fancies formed in childhood of eastern grandeur. The two principal Ameers
                    were seated amid a group of elegantly attired figures, at the end of a lofty
                    hall, spread with Persian carpetting, on their musnud, a slightly elevated
                    cushion of French white satin, beautifully worked with flowers of silk and gold,
                    the corners of which were raised by four massive and highly chased golden
                    ornaments, resembling pineapples, and, together with a long velvet pillow
                    behind, covered with rich embroidery, presented a very grand appearance. There
                    was no tinsel or gaudy display of scarlet; none of the incongruities seen at the
                    Hindoo courts, of gorgeousness and dirt; but a simple and becoming elegance, far
                    surpassing any thing he had seen in India. The Ameers and their attendants were
                    habited nearly alike, in tunics of fine white muslin, neatly prepared and
                    plaited, so as to resemble dimity, with sashes of silk and gold, wide Turkish
                    trousers of silk tied at the ankle, chiefly dark blue, and Sindian caps made of
                    gold brocade or embroidered velvet. “A pair of Cashmere shawls,” adds Dr.
                    Burnes, “of great beauty, generally white, thrown negligently over the arm, and
                    a Persian dagger at the girdle, richly ornamented with diamonds or precious
                    stones, completed the dress and decorations of each of the princes. All the
                    officers in attendance, judging from their dress and manners, seemed to be of
                    inferior rank. There was no crowding for places; the rabble had been shut
                    entirely out of doors; and there was a degree of stillness and solemnity
                    throughout the whole, and an order and decorum in the demeanour of each
                    individual, which impressed one with a feeling of awe and respect. I could not
                    have anticipated the brilliant collection of jewels and armour that is in
                    possession of these princes, and is of all things calculated most to surprise a
                    European stranger.” Colonel Pöttinger mentions with admiration the profusion of
                    pearls which they displayed; the size of one which the prince carried in his
                    hand, he declares was such as before be should have regarded as perfectly
                    incredible; and a perfect emerald, suspended from the hilt of a dagger which one
                    of the younger princes wore in his sash, was considerably larger than a pigeon’s
                    egg. They had still this emerald in their possession when Dr. Burnes visited the
                    court; and the immense treasure which they have accumulated from the spoil of
                    the country which they govern, consists in rubies, diamonds, pearls, and
                    emeralds, with which their daggers, swords, and matchlocks are adorned, or they
                    are worn as rings and clasps, on different parts of their dresses. Many of these
                    precious stones were purchased at reduced price, from the unfortunate princes of
                    the Cabul monarchy and the nobility, when they were reduced to ruin by the
                    revolutions which took place in that kingdom; and merchants are encouraged to
                    visit Sinde from all parts, in consequence of the avidity of the princes to buy
                    up the precious articles in which they deal. One or two Persian goldsmiths are
                    employed at court, who continue to display to the best advantage the jewellery
                    of their masters; and the art of inlaying letters of gold on steel has been
                    brought to the greatest perfection by these artizans. The Ameers of Sinde are
                    also remarkably curious in the qualities of swords and gun-barrels; and they
                    possess a more valuable collection of these articles than is to be met with in
                    any other part of the world. The value of a sword is estimated by the age and
                    fineness of the steel, or by the temper and watering. One which was shewn by
                    Kurm Ali to Dr. Burnes, dated 1122, <hi rend="smallcaps">(a.d.</hi> 1708,) was
                    valued at 2000 rupees, or about L.125. They have in their armoury swords that
                    have been worn by almost every prince renowned in Asiatic story; by Shah Abbas
                    the Great, Nadir Shah, Ahmed Shah Doranee, besides other equally illustrious
                    personages. Their blades are generally embellished with inscriptions in gold, of
                    verses from the Koran, or short prayers for aid and protection. They manage
                    their swords with great skill; and though they are not heavier than common
                    English sabres, Dr. Burnes mentions that he has seen one of them cut a large
                    sheep, with one stroke, in two pieces, a feat that depends on a certain mode of
                    striking that requires great practice and dexterity.</p>
                <p>The Ameers are passionately fond of hunting; and for this purpose large tracts of
                    fertile land are enclosed to prevent the egress of the quadrupeds, and are
                    converted into jungle; and once or twice a-month they visit their different game
                    preserves to enjoy the pleasures of the chace, though the manner of killing the
                    game in this country does not bear the appellation. Their mode of hunting does
                    not at all partake of the animation which belongs to that amusement in Europe.
                    Their plan is to close up all the wells, except the one in front of their tents,
                    to which, when the animals resort, being compelled by dire necessity, they are
                    then shot by the Ameers, amid the acclamations of their followers. They never
                    hunt on horseback; but sometimes, though rarely, go a deer shooting on camels,
                    and none, except themselves, are permitted to fire at any game. There is rarely
                    a sporting excursion which does not cost the lives of two or three of their
                    subjects, a matter of extremely little consequence in this tyrannical country,
                    either from their false aiming, or from the fury of the boars driven desperate.
                    The mode in which those hunting excursions are conducted, marks the jealous
                    policy of the tyrannical government. They are attended by large retinues; and
                    they never previously announce in which direction they mean to travel; nor will
                    any of the princes leave the other behind. They are afraid of leaving them this
                    short interval for intrigue, and, perhaps, rebellion; and it was by being left
                    for two or three hours behind, that one of the princes succeeded in his late
                    rebellion. Though related, they place no confidence in each other. They sleep in
                    apartments peculiarly contrived for safety, with loaded arms laid beside their
                    uneasy pillows; though these precautions are now somewhat relaxed, in
                    consequence of the long era of nearly forty years’ tranquillity which the
                    country has enjoyed under the existing regime. There is nothing like the spirit
                    of independence among the courtiers or nobility of Sinde. They only retain their
                    places by the most implicit obedience and the most fawning adulation to their
                    superiors; and their habitual propensity to flatter a European who is in favour
                    at court, or even each other, is ludicrous; scarcely two persons meet without
                    indulging in the most fulsome strain of oriental flattery; social life is
                    burdened with this ceremonious formality, which is the mark of inferior
                    civilization, and is common in Persia, Cabul, and generally among the
                    semi-barbarous tribes of Asia.</p>
                <p>The whole family of the Ameers are extremely strict, and mere bigots in their
                    intolerant religion. With one or two exceptions, they have become Sheahs, or
                    followers of Ali; who hate the sect of the Soonees even more bitterly than
                    Brahmins or Christians. They are remarkable for the intolerance with which they
                    persecute the Hindus, forming a considerable proportion of their subjects, who
                    are subjected to the most exasperating indignities, and often to the greatest
                    cruelties; they are forced to adopt the Mahometan dress, and to allow their
                    beards to grow. It is only lately that they have been allowed to ride on
                    horseback, and it is only the few who are in the immediate service of government
                    that are allowed the privilege and honour, as it is esteemed, of a saddle.
                    Merchants of wealth and respectability may be seen mounted on asses and mules,
                    consider ed unclean animals, such as none but the vilest outcasts in other
                    Asiatic countries can touch with impunity; and they are obliged to descend and
                    stand aside when any Musselman passes by. They are denied the free exercise of
                    their religion; the tom-tom can only be beat when special permission is granted;
                    and though images are placed in most of the temples at Hydrabad, the sound of
                    music never<pb break="no" facs="ht:chi.28490924&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=427"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0720-0427-0365"/> echoes from their walls; they are subjected to
                    other shocking and degrading cruelties revolting to humanity; any two of the
                    true believers, by declaring that they have heard a Hindoo repeat a verse in the
                    Koran, or the words “Mahomed the prophet,” may procure his immediate
                    circumcision, which this degraded and persecuted class consider the most cruel
                    calamity that can befal them, in which, as it is resorted to on the slightest
                    provocation, and performed with the deriding pretence that it is for their
                    eternal happiness, the torture of the mind is added to that of the body. On the
                    other hand, the most bigotted veneration is expressed for the Seynds, or
                    descendants of the prophet. The meanest wretch who can boast a connection,
                    however remote, with this holy stock, enjoys a station in society such as no
                    temporal man can bestow. If any one, under whatever provocation, would dare to
                    retaliate, by abusing or striking any one of this favoured class, he would be
                    torn to pieces by the enraged populace; and, in consequence of this high favour
                    which they enjoy, an idle herd of these wretches flock into Sinde from the
                    neighbouring countries, where, besides being useless members of the community,
                    and withal insolent and lazy, they debase the minds and drain the purses of the
                    deluded inhabitants.</p>
                <p>The Ameers commence business about two hours before day-break, each holding a
                    levee to hear compliments, and to adjust the affairs belonging to his
                    department. About sun-rise they repair to their apartments to dress, and appear
                    shortly afterwards in durbar, where the whole family regularly assemble for
                    transacting public business; all letters are then laid before them, which, being
                    read and considered, and some time passed in conversation, they withdraw to
                    their morning repast about ten or eleven o’clock. They again appear abroad about
                    two o’clock and remain together until dark, when they repair for the night to
                    their respective apartments. At the residences of the younger princes every
                    thing forms a contrast to the stately ceremonial of the elder Ameers; all
                    restraint is thrown aside, and every species of amusement, such as boar-baiting,
                    fencing, ball practice, and wrestling, are pursued with avidity. At the public
                    audiences in the durbar the Ameers, though courteous, are for the most part
                    haughty and reserved in their manners; nothing approaching to familiarity being
                    allowed between them and their most favoured servants. Under such a government
                    as has been described, justice is very imperfectly administered. The Koran is
                    the foundation of law as it is of religion; and between man and man disputes are
                    generally settled fairly enough by the cadi, except where bribery is employed,
                    when the best security for justice is a weighty purse. The Hindus generally
                    settle all disputes among themselves by punchayets or juries, as is practised in
                    many parts of Hindustan, as they have no encouragement to come before the ruling
                    authorities. The native inhabitants, the Beloches, according to their military
                    notions, generally take the law into their own hands, and act on the simple
                    principle of retaliation; nor do the authorities interfere, except where the
                    dispute extends to whole tribes, and seriously endangers the peace of the
                    country. In this case they interfere to settle matters by force or by
                    conciliation. A serious quarrel of this nature occurred when Dr. Burnes was at
                    Hydrabad, when the contending parties were sent for by the princes, who, with
                    much flattery and address, obtained a promise from them to desist.</p>
                <p>The military force of Sinde is very inefficient; their armed retainers are few in
                    number and contemptible in appearance. Several of the chiefs of the tribes
                    reside at court, and they can collect in a few days their followers, who are
                    generally employed in agriculture and other occupations. In this manner it is
                    estimated that 40,000 men may be collected. But though the iron rod of
                    oppression has repressed the daring spirit of the military classes, yet the
                    anarchy which has prevailed in this, as in other parts of Hindustan, has
                    nurtured, among the great body of the people, a spirit of disorder and a love of
                    plunder which is ready to break out on all occasions. The country is, in short,
                    filled with licentious banditti, and would have been, in the evil days that are
                    passed, a fit nursery of recruits for the Pindarie bands. “Like hungry
                    vultures,” says Dr. Burnes, “they would almost seem to scent the battle from
                    afar, for the train of dissension is no sooner lighted than war becomes their
                    universal cry, and it is incredible in how short time they flock to the
                    rendezvous.” The late insurrection of the princes was settled in a few days;
                    yet, in that short time, about 20,000 or 30,000 volunteers had joined the
                    different standards, and they were hourly crowding in when the adjustment took
                    place. In military qualities, the Sindian soldier ranks very low; he has no
                    discipline nor steadiness in the field, though he is brave and hardy; and his
                    vanity and gasconading are proverbial. The army presents, when assembled, a
                    motley and ill-accoutred assemblage of mercenaries from all quarters, chiefly
                    composed of ferocious adventurers from the mountains of Belochistan, to one of
                    whose rude tribes the reigning house traces its origin. The Ameers are well
                    aware of the inefficient state of their military force, and of the utter
                    hopelessness of any conflict with the British arms. And this furnishes the
                    explanation of their distance and reserve, justly fearing that any close
                    intercourse would only expose the nakedness of the land. It is not easy to
                    obtain any exact estimate of the revenue of Sinde. Colonel Pottinger states its
                    total amount, including those of all the collateral branches of the reigning
                    family, at sixty-one lacs of rupees yearly, equal to L.767,500 sterling, which
                    shews an increase, since 1809, several years previous to his estimate, of
                    L.232,750, the amount being, at that time, forty-two lacs and 78,000, or
                    L.534,000 sterling.</p>
                <p>The men of Sinde are dark in colour but are an exceedingly handsome race; above
                    the medium height of Asiatics, with good features and well-formed limbs. The
                    beauty of the women is proverbial, and it is remarked by Pottinger in his
                    instructive and excellent work, that though he had only casual opportunities of
                    seeing any of the higher class of females, yet among the dancing girls who came
                    to exhibit before them, there was not one who was not distinguished by
                    loveliness of face or the symmetry of her figure, and in most instances both
                    these requisites of beauty were strikingly combined. The dress of the men
                    consists of a loose shirt, a pair of trousers, puckered at the ancles, and a
                    quilted cotton or cloth cap, ornamented with flowers of silk or gold sewed round
                    the bottom: that of the women, with the exception of the cap, is much the same;
                    they wear beside, underneath their shifts, a silk jacket made to fit the form,
                    that laces behind; and when abroad, a cloth shirt wraps round the body, having
                    one end brought round the crown of the head, and serving as a veil to cover the
                    face from strangers. This traveller does not, however, commend, in the same
                    degree, the character of the people, in which the bad qualities, according to
                    his estimate, greatly predominate. They are, he observes, avaricious, full of
                    deceit, cruel, ungrateful, and strangers to veracity; and all the extenuation
                    which he offers for these vices is, that the present generation has grown up
                    under a government whose extortion, ignorance, and tyranny, is unequalled in the
                    world. The Sindians, however, he does not rate lower in the scale of morality
                    than the population and society of the other nations of Asia. Their good
                    qualities consist in personal bravery, abstinence, and obedience to their
                    superiors; for which they are reckoned the best mercenary soldiers in Hindustan.
                    In manners they are generally forward and unpolished; in intellect dark and
                    inapt, and in hospitality and fidelity signally regardless and deficient.</p>
                <p>The ancient history of Sinde is involved in obscurity. When Alexander of Macedon
                    invaded the country, it was<pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:chi.28490924&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=428" xml:id="kp-eb0720-0428-0366"/>
                    governed by Hindu Rajahs; and from that time little is known of its history till
                    the rise and progress of the Mahomedan power. It was conquered by a general
                    dispatched for this purpose by a lieutenant of the Ommade Caliph Walid in
                    Sejestim and Candahar; and flourished under the vicegerents of the prophet till
                    its conquest by the Sultan of Ghizni. It afterwards came under the jurisdiction
                    of the Soomrai, a native tribe, and was again reduced by Mahommed Ghori, and
                    annexed as a fief to the crown of Delhi, to which it remained attached for two
                    centuries. In the various conquests and revolutions which subsequently took
                    place in India, this country was the prize of the victor. It was finally subdued
                    by the armies of Acbar about the year 1580, since which period its rulers have
                    never ventured openly to avow their independence, though they have sometimes
                    evaded the payment of the tribute fixed, and have even frequently appeared in
                    arms against the lord paramount. Under the succeeding emperors the province of
                    Sinde was kept under strict subjection, though the unsettled aspect of Hindustan
                    sometimes encouraged the rulers of Sinde to withhold the tribute. In the mean
                    time the introduction of vast tribes of Beloches as mercenaries, had changed the
                    character of the population, and the rule of the family of Toor Khan had given
                    place to the tribe of Caloras, sprung, it is supposed, from adventurers that
                    followed the Persian army. The invasion of India by Nadir Shah in 1739, extended
                    the rule of Persia over Sinde and all the provinces west of the Indus; but his
                    assassination paved the way for the rise of the D∞ranee empire under Ahmed Khan
                    Seedozy, who declared himself king of Cabul, to whom Sinde after a time
                    submitted, and has ever since been considered subordinate, though frequently
                    rebelling and refusing to pay tribute. The country was long a scene of civil
                    dissension, different competitors contending for tire throne, the Talpoories, a
                    tribe of Beloche origin, rebelling against the house of Calora. Their
                    contentions were carried on with various success, and with ruin and misery to
                    the country, which was wasted in these wars. Ahmed Shah, the conquerer of the
                    Mahrattas in the battle of Panripart in 1761, exacted the tribute with all its
                    arrears. In 1786, Meer Futtch Allee, the eldest of four brothers, was confirmed
                    as ruler of the country. He admitted to a participation in his high destiny his
                    three younger brothers, Ghoulam Ali, Kurm Ali, and Mourad Ali; and they agreed
                    to reign together as the ameers or the lords of Sinde. Futtch Allee died in
                    1801, and Ghoulam Ali in 1811; and the country, as has been already mentioned,
                    is now partitioned between the surviving brothers, and their respective
                    sons.</p>
                <p>It is scarcely possible that this outlying country of Sinde can remain long
                    independent of British control. The late great and successful expedition, for
                    the purpose of restoring Dost Mahommed to the throne of Cabul, however
                    questionable its policy, has extended the power of the British in India into
                    countries where their name was scarcely known before. All the intervening states
                    through whose territories the army passed in its progress to the scene of
                    action, viewed the mighty movement with a mixed feeling of jealousy and awe.
                    Having seen the various states of India, its princes and chiefs, with their
                    dependent tributaries, successively swallowed up in the wide extending sway of
                    this European empire, they would willingly have joined in repelling its further
                    advances into the interior of Asia; but they were overawed; and the late
                    brilliant operations of the British will tend to confirm and extend their
                    political influence, and will in the end bring all such petty states as Sinde,
                    alternately the prey of despotism and anarchy, under the control or the direct
                    supremacy of that great power, whose mighty empire in the east, reared up by a
                    continued train of brilliant success for more than half a century, seems only a
                    step in her farther progress to the dominion of Asia.</p>
