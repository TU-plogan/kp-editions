                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra

                <p><label type="entry">SENSITIVE <hi rend="smallcaps">Plant</hi></label>. The
                    sensitive plants are well known to possess a kind of motion, by which the leaves
                    and stalks are contracted, and fall down on being slightly touched, or shaken
                    with some degree of violence.</p>
                <p>The contraction of the leaves and branches of the sensitive plant when touched is
                    a very singular phenomena, and different hypotheses have been formed by
                    botanists in order to explain it; but we are disposed to believe that these have
                    generally been deduced rather from analogical reasoning than from a collection
                    of facts and observations. We shall therefore give an account of all the
                    important facts which we have been able to collect upon this curious subject;
                    and then draw such conclusions as obviously result from them, without, however,
                    attempting to support any old, or to establish a new, hypothesis.</p>
                <p>First, it is difficult to touch the leaf of a healthy sensitive plant so
                    delicately that it will not immediately collapse, the foliola or little leaves
                    moving at their base till they come into contact, and then applying themselves
                    close together. If the leaf be touched with a little more force, the opposite
                    leaf will exhibit the same appearance. If a little more force be applied, the
                    partial footstalks bend down towards the common footstalk from which they issue,
                    making with it a more acute angle than before. If the touch be more violent
                    still, all the leaves situated on the same side with the one that has been
                    touched will instantly collapse, and the partial footstalk will approach the
                    common footstalk to which it is attached, in the same manner as the partial
                    footstalk of the leaf approaches the stem or branch from which it issues; so
                    that the whole plant, from having its branches extended, will immediately appear
                    like a weeping birch.</p>
                <p>Secondly, these motions of the plant are performed by means of three distinct and
                    sensible articulations; the first that of the foliola or lobes to the partial
                    footstalk, the second that of the partial footstalk to the common one, and the
                    third that of the common footstalk to the trunk; the primary motion of all which
                    is, the closing of the leaf upon the partial footstalk, which is performed in a
                    similar manner, and by a similar articulation. This, however, is much less
                    visible than the others. These motions are wholly independent of one another, as
                    may be proved by experiment. It appears, that if the partial footstalks are
                    moved, and collapse toward the petioli, or these toward the trunk, the little
                    leaves, whose motion is usually primary to these, should be affected also; yet
                    experiment proves that it is possible to touch the footstalks in such a manner
                    as to affect them only, and make them apply themselves to the trunk, while the
                    leaves feel nothing of the touch. But this cannot be, unless the footstalks are
                    so disposed as that they can fall to the trunk, without suffering their leaves
                    to touch any part of the plant in their passage, because, if they do, they are
                    immediately affected.</p>
                <p>Thirdly, winds and heavy rains make the leaves of the sensitive plant contract
                    and close; but no such effect is produced from slight showers.</p>
                <p>Fourthly, at night, or when exposed to much cold in the day, the leaves meet and
                    close in the same manner as when touched, folding their upper surfaces together,
                    and in part over each other, like scales or tiles, so as to expose as little as
                    possible of the upper surface to the air. The opposite sides of the leaves, or
                    foliola, do not come close together in the night, for when touched they apply
                    themselves closer together. Dr Darwin kept a sensitive plant in a dark place for
                    some hours after daybreak; the leaves and footstalks were collapsed as in its
                    most profound sleep, and on exposing it to the light, above twenty minutes
                    passed before it was expanded.</p>
                <p>Fifthly, in the month of August, a sensitive plant was carried in a pot out of
                    its usual place into a dark cave; the motion that it received in the carriage
                    shut up its leaves, and they did not open till twenty-four hours afterwards: at
                    this time they became moderately open, but were afterwards subject to no changes
                    at night or morning, but remained three days and nights with their leaves in the
                    same moderately open state. At the end of this time they were<pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:chi.28490924&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=115" xml:id="kp-eb0720-0115-0101"/>
                    brought out again into the air, and there recovered their natural periodical
                    motions, shutting every night, and opening every morning, as naturally and as
                    strongly as if the plant had not been in this forced state; and while in the
                    cave, it was observed to be very little less affected with the touch than when
                    abroad in the open air.</p>
                <p>Sixthly, the great heats of summer, when there is open sunshine at noon, affect
                    the plant in some degree like cold, causing it to shut up its leaves a little,
                    but never in any very great degree. The plant, however, is least of all affected
                    about nine o’clock in the morning, and that is consequently the most proper time
                    to make experiments on it. A branch of the sensitive plant cut off, and laid by,
                    retains still its property of shutting up and opening in the morning for some
                    days; and it holds it longer if kept with one end in water, than if left to dry
                    more suddenly.</p>
                <p>Seventhly, the leaves only of the sensitive plant shut up in the night, not the
                    branches; and if it be touched at this time, the branches are affected in the
                    same manner as in the day, shutting up, or approaching to the stalk or trunk, in
                    the same way, and often with more force. It is of no consequence what the
                    substance is with which the plant is touched, it answers alike to all; but there
                    may be observed a little spot, distinguishable by its paler colour, in the
                    articulations of its leaves, where the greatest and nicest sensibility is
                    evidently placed.</p>
                <p>Eighthly, Duhamel having observed, about the 15th of September, in moderato
                    weather, the natural motion of a branch of a sensitive plant, remarked, that at
                    nine in the morning it formed with the stem an angle of 100 degrees; at noon,
                    112 degrees; at three afternoon, it returned to 100, and after touching the
                    branch, the angle was reduced to 90. Three quarters of an hour afterwards, it
                    had mounted to 112; and at eight at night, it descended again, without being
                    touched, to 90. The day after, in finer weather, the same branch, at eight in
                    the morning, made an angle of 135 degrees with the stem; after being touched,
                    the angle was diminished to 80; an hour after, it rose again to 135; being
                    touched a second time, it descended again to 80; an hour and a half afterwards,
                    it had risen to 145; and on being touched a third time, descended to 135, and
                    remained in that position till five o’clock in the afternoon, when being touched
                    a fourth time, it fell to 110.</p>
                <p>Ninthly, the parts of the plants which have collapsed, afterwards unfold
                    themselves, and return to their former expanded state. The time required for
                    that purpose varies, according to the vigour of the plant, the season of the
                    year, the hour of the day, the state of the atmosphere. Sometimes half an hour
                    is requisite, sometimes only ten minutes. The order in which the parts recover
                    themselves varies in like manner; sometimes it is the common footstalks,
                    some-times the rib to which the leaves are attached, and sometimes the leaves
                    themselves are expanded, before the other parts have made any attempt to be
                    reinstated in their former position.</p>
                <p>Tenthly, if, without shaking the other smaller leaves, we cut off the half of a
                    leaf or lobe belonging to the last pair, at the extremity or summit of a wing,
                    the leaf cut, and its antagonist, that is to say, the first pair, begin to
                    approach each other; then the second, and so on successively, till all the
                    lesser leaves or lobes of that wing have collapsed in like manner. Frequently,
                    after twelve or fifteen seconds, the lobes of the other wings, which were not
                    immediately affected by the stroke, shut; whilst the stalk and its wing,
                    beginning at the bottom, and proceeding in order to the top, gradually recover
                    themselves. If, instead of one of the lesser extreme leaves, we cut off one
                    belonging to the pair that is next the footstalk, its antagonist shuts, as do
                    the other pairs successively, from the bottom to the top. If all the leaves of
                    one side of a wing be cut off, the opposite leaves are not affected, but remain
                    expanded. With some address, it is possible even to cut off a branch without
                    hurting the leaves or making them fall. The common footstalk of the winged
                    leaves being cut as far as three fourths of its diameter, all the parts which
                    hang down collapse, but quickly recover without appearing to have suffered any
                    considerable violence by the shock. An incision being made into one of the
                    principal branches to the depth of one half the diameter, the branches situated
                    between the section and the root will fall down; those above the incision remain
                    as before, and the lesser leaves continue open; but this direction is soon
                    destroyed, by cutting off one of the lobes at the extremity, as was observed
                    above. Lastly, a whole wing being cut off with precaution near its insertion
                    into the common footstalk, the other wings are not affected by it, and its own
                    lobes do not shut. No motion ensues from piercing the branch with a needle or
                    other sharp instrument.</p>
                <p>Eleventhly, if the end of one of the leaves be burned with the flame of a candle,
                    or by a burning-glass, or by touching it with hot iron, it closes up in a
                    moment, and the opposite leaf does the same, and after that, the whole series of
                    leaves on each side of the partial or little footstalk; then the footstalk
                    itself; then the branch or common footstalk; all do the same, if the burning has
                    been in a sufficient degree. This proves that there is a very nice communication
                    between all the parts of the plant, by means of which the burning, which only is
                    applied to the extremity of one leaf, diffuses its influence through every part
                    of the shrub. If a drop of aquafortis be carefully laid upon a leaf of the
                    sensitive plant, so as not to shake it in the least, the leaf does not begin to
                    move till the acrid liquor corrodes the substance of it; but at that time, not
                    only the particular leaf, but all the leaves placed on the same footstalk, close
                    themselves up. The vapour of burning sulphur has also this effect on many leaves
                    at once, according as they are more or less exposed to it; but a bottle of very
                    acrid and sulphureous spirit of vitriol, placed under the branches unstopped,
                    produces no such effect. Wetting the leaves with spirit of wine has been
                    observed also to have no effect, nor the rubbing of oil of almonds over them;
                    though this last application destroys many plants.</p>
                <p>From the preceding experiments the following conclusions may be fairly drawn.
                    First, the contraction of the parts of the sensitive plant is occasioned by an
                    external force, and the contraction is in proportion to the force. Secondly, all
                    bodies which can exert any force affect the sensitive plant; some by the touch
                    or by agitation, as the wind or rain; some by chemical influence, as heat and
                    cold. Thirdly, touching or agitating the plant produces a greater effect than an
                    incision or cutting off a part, or by applying heat or cold.</p>
                <p>Attempts have been made to explain these curious phenomena. Dr Darwin, in the
                    notes to his Botanic Garden, lays it down as a principle, that “the sleep of
                    animals consists in a suspension of voluntary motion; and as vegetables are
                    subject to sleep as well as animals, there is reason to conclude,” says he,
                    “that the various action of closing their petals and foliage may be justly
                    ascribed to a voluntary power; for without the faculty of volition sleep would
                    not have been necessary to them.” Whether this definition of sleep when applied
                    to animals be just, we shall not inquire. But it is evident the supposed analogy
                    between the sleep of animals and the sleep of plants has led Dr Darwin to admit
                    this astonishing conclusion, that plants have volition. As volition presupposes
                    a mind or soul, it were to be wished that he had given us some information
                    concerning the nature of a vegetable soul, which can think and will. We suspect,
                    however, that this vegetable soul will turn out to be a mere mechanical or
                    chemical one; for it is affected by external forces uniformly in the same way,
                    its volition is merely passive, and never makes any successful resistance
                    against those causes by which it is influenced. All this is<pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:chi.28490924&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=116" xml:id="kp-eb0720-0116-0102"/> a
                    mere abuse of words. The sleep of plants is a metaphorical expression, and has
                    not the least resemblance to the sleep of animals. Plants are said to sleep when
                    the flowers or leaves are contracted or folded together; but we never heard that
                    there is any similar contraction in the body of an animal during sleep.</p>
                <p>The fibres of vegetables have been compared with the muscles of animals, and the
                    motions of the sensitive plant have been supposed to be the same with muscular
                    motion. Between the fibres of vegetables and the muscles of animals, however,
                    there is not the least similarity. If muscles be cut through, so as to be
                    separated from the joints to which they are attached, their powers are
                    completely destroyed; but this is not the case with vegetable fibres. The
                    following ingenious experiment, which was communicated to us by a respectable
                    member of the university of Edinburgh, is decisive on this subject. He selected
                    a growing poppy at that period of its growth, before unfolding, when the head
                    and neck are bent down almost double. He cut the stalk where it was curved half
                    through on the under side, and half through at a small distance on the upper
                    side, and half through in the middle point between the two sections, so that the
                    ends of the fibres were separated from the stalk. Notwithstanding these several
                    cuttings on the neck, the poppy raised its head, and assumed a more erect
                    position. There is, therefore, a complete distinction between muscular motion
                    and the motions of a plant; for no motion can take place in the limb of an
                    animal when the muscles of that limb are cut.</p>
                <p>In fine, we look upon all attempts to explain the motions of plants as absurd,
                    and all reasoning from supposed analogy between animals and vegetables as the
                    source of wild conjecture, and not of sound philosophy. We view the contraction
                    and expansion of the sensitive plant in the same light as we do gravitation,
                    chemical attraction, electricity, and magnetism, as a singular fact, the
                    circumstances of which we may be fully acquainted with, but must despair of
                    understanding its cause.</p>
