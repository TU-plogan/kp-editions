                <p><label type="entry">SOCRATES</label>. The name of Socrates is familiar to every
                    one among his earliest classical recollections. Who has not heard of the
                    Athenian sage, the great moralist of heathenism, and his persecution and
                    constancy even to death? There is no name indeed which stands forth more
                    conspicuously in the history of the philosophy, or of the religion, or of the
                    <hi rend="italic">general</hi> civilization of the ancient world. It marks a
                    distinct era in the progress of the human race. The character of a great period
                    in the history of man is concentrated, in fact, in the life and teaching of this
                    extraordinary individual; and his name accordingly has descended to us with all
                    the importance of the crisis itself at which he flourished; recommended as it is
                    to our affection and admiration, not so much by the characteristics of his
                    personality, as by the tradition of his influence and authority.</p>
                <p>For when we come to consider his particular biography, we find our attention
                    arrested by little that belongs merely to the individual. We read of a long life
                    passed for the most part in uniform tenour within the walls of his native
                    Athens; and until we come to its tragical close, scarcely distinguished in point
                    of incident from that of the mass of his contemporaries. When, again, we ask for
                    writings from which, as from the proper mirror of the philosopher’s mind, we may
                    collect some express lineaments of his character and teaching, we find nothing
                    even on this ground on which our curiosity can fasten; so little have we derived
                    that interest, which the mention of Socrates now awakens, from himself
                    immediately; and so much, on the other hand, are we indebted for our
                    acquaintance with this philosopher to a popular feeling preserving and handing
                    down to us the name which represents the thought and character of an age.</p>
                <p>The conjuncture of events at the time of Socrates was<pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:chi.28490924&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=502" xml:id="kp-eb0720-0502-0436"/>
                    peculiarly favourable to the development of such a character. Socrates, born at
                    Athens in the year 469 or 470 <hi rend="smallcaps">b c.</hi> grew up to manhood
                    during those years when Athens, standing on the proud eminence of her victories
                    of Marathon and Salamis, was consolidating her power as a sovereign state and
                    seat of empire. In the course of the fifty years which intervened between her
                    triumphant resistance to the Persian invasion and the commencement of the
                    Peloponnesian war, Athens, like Rome in her struggle with her Italian
                    neighbours, had gradually converted her allies in the islands and on the coasts
                    of Asia Minor and Thrace into dependent subjects and tributaries. But Athens had
                    not, like Rome, the prudence to combine these scattered members of her empire,
                    elements of discord and trouble as much as of strength to the sovereign state,
                    by the free communication of the rights of citizenship. Nor indeed could this
                    wise expedient have availed in the case of Athens as in that of Rome. For the
                    states over which the empire of Athens extended were either independent
                    governments reluctantly submitting to her yoke, or the weak dependencies of a
                    rival power, and indisposed to acknowledge the sovereignty of Athens but so long
                    as that power wanted the vigour and the enterprize to head a coalition against
                    the common oppressor. There were thus in the very constitution of the Athenian
                    empire, materials of jealousy and disunion, which no line of conduct but the
                    impolitic one of surrendering an arbitrary rule into the hands of the people who
                    had groaned under it, could long have kept from explosion. And, in fact, it was
                    not the policy of Athens (masterly as that policy was under the hands of her
                    great leaders) which sustained her empire for more than fifty years, so much as
                    the inertness of her great rival, Lacedemon, and the difficulty of bringing the
                    several grievances of the subject-states to bear on some decisive point, capable
                    of influencing the movement of the whole in a strenuous concerted effort of
                    resistance. At length we see this effort in the outbreak of the Peloponnesian
                    war, as well as the difficulty of it in the complicated diplomacy by which that
                    great movement was preceded, and in the reluctance of Lacedemon to bring home to
                    herself the necessity of exertion.</p>
                <p>But, whilst Athens was thus aggrandizing herself against a day of retribution
                    from the insulted states of Greece, she enjoyed the sunshine of her day of
                    empire, in the brilliant assemblage, which she then witnessed within her walls,
                    of the great, and the learned, and the eloquent, from all parts of Greece.<note

                    enterprize were setting foot on every sea and land, her attractiveness as a home
                    of genius and civilization, was evidenced in the number of strangers frequenting
                    her porticos, and groves, and theatres, and temples, and the houses of her
                    nobles. During thirty years of this period of glory, the philosopher Anaxagoras
                    was employed in propagating there the doctrines of the Ionic school, honoured by
                    the patronage of her great men, and the revered master of her choicest spirits
                    in the newly-acquired taste for philosophical inquiry. During, also, a
                    considerable portion of the same period, the sophist Prodicus was domesticated
                    within her walls, surrounded by crowds of admiring pupils from the highest ranks
                    of her citizens, eagerly catching the inspiration of that rhetorical ability for
                    which he was famed. Occasionally, too, amongst the distinguished visitors of the
                    city, might be seen other illustrious professors of the day, also familiarly
                    known by the name of sophists, then a complimentary designation,—Protagoras of
                    Abdera, Gorgias of Leontium, Hippias of Elis,—drawn there by the demand for that
                    literary merchandize, of which they claimed the monopoly. There also were now
                    collected, as in a school of all arts, the great masters of the drama, of
                    sculpture, and painting, and music, and the gymnastic exercises. So that Athens,
                    at this time, contained within her own bosom abundant resources for the
                    enlargement of the mind, whether in the eminent men who formed her society, in
                    the lectures and conversation of the professors of science, or in noble works,
                    the specimens and examples of what genius could effect. Athens contained, also,
                    doubtless, much to enervate and corrupt the moral judgment, whilst she presented
                    every thing to exalt the imagination and refine the taste. Her political
                    institutions, well-balanced as they had been left by Solon, were now violently
                    disturbed. In the course of these years of imperial greatness and prosperity,
                    they received a large infusion of that licentious spirit, which the naval
                    successes of the Athenians had engendered in the lower order of the
                    citizens,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>’ Aristot.

                    suspended. The peremptory power of these judicial committees, in which the
                    people at large felt and exercised a despotic authority, became the real
                    executive of the state. Then came into intense activity the vile system of
                    sycophancy,—a system, under which the life and property of the wealthy were at
                    the mercy of every needy adventurer who could speak to the passions of the

                    injuriously on the character of the Athenian master, than it did elsewhere in
                    Greece. It was tempered by the social humour of the people. But the facility
                    thus afforded to the citizens of living in indolence and ease, and abandoning
                    all domestic employment for the excitement of the public assemblies, and the
                    courts, and the spectacles, naturally induced a neglect of the private and
                    domestic duties. There is reason to believe, that whilst the Athenians appeared
                    in the face of the world the most light-hearted of men, they were secretly
                    unhappy in their homes; living in listlessness from day to day on the alms of
                    their public pay; many of them reduced from affluence to poverty through the
                    loss of lands and property by the ravages and pressure of war, and yet unable or
                    unwilling to use the necessary exertions to relieve themselves from their
                    distress. It is evidently no singular instance which Xenophon has given of this
                    state of things at Athens, when he tells us of Aristarchus complaining to
                    Socrates of the number of poor female relatives who, from losses in the course
                    of the Peloponnesian war, were thrown on him for support. The difficulty which
                    Aristarchus felt, was, that he could not expect persons who were free-born and
                    his own kindred, to undertake any manual labour, so as to assist in maintaining
                    themselves. Happily, however, he adopts the friendly suggestion of Socrates, and
                    makes the experiment of setting them actively to work. The experiment succeeds;
                    and thus contentment and cheerfulness are introduced to a home where before all
                    was gloom and mutual suspicion.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>The story is beautifully told by Xenophon in his simple
                    manner in the <hi rend="italic">Memorabilia,</hi> book ii. chapter 7. See also
                    Mem. ii. 8.</p></note></p>
                <p>In the meantime, a great number of mechanics and tradesmen had risen to wealth
                    and importance, in consequence of the demand for every species of labour and
                    trade, resulting from the multiplied population of the city and its numerous
                    foreign dependencies and connexions, and, in particular, from the magnificent
                    public works carried on during the administration of Pericles. All this while,
                    Athens was becoming more and more a mercantile community, in the midst of strong
                    aristocratic prejudices, still surviving, and rendered, indeed, more intense by
                    the opposition growing up around them. In many instances, the older families
                    would be declining in wealth, exhausted by the burthens of the state or the
                    extravagance of individual expenditure; whilst new families, the creations of
                    successful trade and enterprize, would be obtaining influence by the force of
                    their wealth, and encroaching on the privileged ground hitherto occupied only by
                    right of birth. It may be easily conceived, therefore, that the mass of the
                    society of the city would be now all fermentation and restlessness; the one
                    class pushing their interests and their claims to equality founded on their
                    personal title, whilst the other obstinately clung to the exclusiveness and the
                    pride of hereditary right.</p>
                <p>But we shall best judge of the distempered state of the social atmosphere of
                    Athens, by adverting to the character of female society as it existed there. It
                    has often been remarked, as the glory of modern and Christian civilization, that
                    it has restored woman to her due place in the scale of social importance, and
                    thus most effectually chastened and elevated the general intercourse of human
                    life. In a country so essentially social as Greece, and especially at Athens, it
                    was practically impossible to impose on the women the absolute seclusion of
                    eastern despotism. Still it was even at Athens considered the rule of propriety,
                    that the wives and daughters of citizens should live in the strict privacy of
                    their homes, and be known and noticed as little as possible among the other sex,
                    even for their virtues.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    circles, the place which she should have held in Athenian society was filled by
                    other females, strangers to family ties, and attracted to Athens by the
                    licentiousness and wealth of an imperial city. The union of high intellectual
                    endowments, and a masculine dignity of understanding, in some distinguished
                    individuals of this class, with the graces of female loveliness, appealed with a
                    powerful interest to the sensual elegance of Grecian taste. We find,
                    accordingly, at Athens, at this time, forming, as it were, the female court of
                    the sovereign people, the Milesian Aspasia, and others of less name, living in
                    the profession of a scandalous course of life, not only without shame, but even
                    in the enjoyment of public respect. It was not the general of the commonwealth
                    only that felt the spell of the charms of Aspasia, but grave philosophers
                    resorted to her house; and even the ladies of private families, in violation of
                    the restrictions of custom, were taken there by their friends; all eager to hear
                    those interesting conversations, and lectures in political and rhetorical
                    science for which she was famed.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    judge how deeply corrupted must have been the standard of public opinion in
                    Greece, when female profligacy could thus veil itself from the eye of moral
                    observation, under the graces of splendid accomplishments of mind and person. So
                    thoroughly had refinement of intellectual taste and of manners, together with
                    the grossest impurity of morals, pervaded the whole society of Athens, that even
                    those who were elevated above the world around them in talents, and strength of
                    character, and kindliness of disposition, as Socrates was, imbibed in some
                    measure the poison of the infected atmosphere which they breathed.</p>
                <p>Such, then, was that state of things in which Socrates was trained, and which
                    will greatly account to us for that peculiar form which the character of his
                    philosophical teaching exhibits. For he was ever an Athenian instructing
                    Athenians. He spoke as one fully conversant with the habits of thought and
                    action of his countrymen; as knowing what kind of instruction they most needed,
                    and by what mode of address he might best win their attention. We might expect,
                    therefore, to see in him some leading traits of the Athenian civilization of his
                    time; a teaching, admirable indeed in its main features, but bearing, at the
                    same time, some marks of that corrupt state of society which called it forth,
                    and to which it was immediately addressed.</p>
                <p>The son of Sophroniscus a sculptor, and Phaenareté a midwife, and himself brought
                    up in his father’s art, he yet enjoyed those advantages of mental culture and
                    social refinement which were common to every citizen of the democratic Athens.
                    The meanness of his birth and his poverty, much as high birth and wealth were
                    esteemed there, would not exclude him from familiar intercourse with persons of
                    the highest rank and consideration in the state. Nor, indeed, could the
                    advantages of education be restricted to a privileged few, where every one lived
                    in public, and where knowledge was for the most part acquired and communicated
                    by conversation and oral discussion.</p>
                <p>If, in the general relaxation of discipline at Athens, the citizen was no longer
                    obliged to submit himself to a prescribed course of education under the eye of
                    the state, and it was<pb break="no"

                    left to each person to avail himself, or not, of the sources of instruction
                    presented in the intellectual society of the city, Socrates was not a person to
                    neglect the advantages placed in his way. Money he had not, to pay to the
                    Sophists, the great masters of his day. But he had from childhood an inquisitive
                    mind. He felt that he was thrown on his own resources of thought, and that he
                    must be his own master in the art of education. And to this great object he
                    appears to have bent, from the earliest time, all the powers of his energetic
                    mind, making it his constant employment to inquire from every one,<note

                    collect on every occasion, some hint towards the right prosecution of it. We may
                    picture to ourselves the young Socrates, resembling the Socrates of mature life,
                    freely entering into conversation with all to whom he had access; feeling and
                    acknowledging his own ignorance; listening attentively to all that he heard;
                    weighing and discussing it in his own mind with patience and acuteness; and not
                    resting until he had traced it out in all its bearings to the utmost of his
                    power. Thus would he gradually form and strengthen that faculty of observation,
                    and that analytical acumen for which he was afterwards so eminently
                    distinguished.</p>
                <p>Nor has Plato improbably put a prophecy of his future eminence in the mouth of
                    one of the great masters of the day, when he makes Protagoras say of him, with
                    the self-complacency of the man of established reputation: “For my part,
                    Socrates, I commend your spirit, and the method of your reasoning; for whilst in
                    other points I am no bad sort of person, as I think, I am the farthest from
                    being an envious one. For concerning you in particular, I have already observed
                    to many, that of all I meet, I admire you by far the most; of those of your own
                    age, even to the extreme; and I say too, I should not be astonished if you were
                    to turn out a man of celebrity for philosophy.”<note anchored="true"

                    ’ To the same effect is the story, that his father, being at a loss how to
                    educate him, consulted the Delphic oracle, and was advised to leave him entirely
                    to his own bent, inasmuch as he had a director in himself superior to a thousand

                    indications of a devotedness to those studies which became the business of his
                    manhood.</p>
                <p>The notice of a wealthy individual of Athens, the excellent Crito, appears to
                    have been early attracted to Socrates. Crito was of about the same age as
                    Socrates;<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Plato, Apo∣.
                    p. 78, <hi rend="italic">lμοs ηλuu0τηs.</hi></p></note> and an attachment to the
                    pursuit of philosophy, and an admiration of the character of Socrates, naturally
                    led to that intimacy which he now commenced with the young philosopher, and
                    steadily maintained through his subsequent life. Through him Socrates was
                    relieved from the necessity of earning his livelihood by the profession of a
                    sculptor; or, as Laertius expresses it, “was raised from the workshop.”<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Diog. Laert. in vit. ii.
                    4.</p></note> Sculpture, indeed, was in high honour at Athens, especially at
                    this time. For Phidias, enjoying the protection of Pericles, was now adorning
                    the city with the immortal productions of his own chisel, as well as other noble
                    works of art executed under his taste and direction. But to follow up the
                    profession with success, required a devotion of mind and hand that must preclude
                    the opportunities indispensable for the moral student. And though, for a time,
                    Socrates worked at the art,—and with success, if a statue of the Graces in the
                    citadel of Athens, attributed to him, were really his workmanship;<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Xenoph. Mem i. 2, ouoi

                    —we may imagine how distasteful the occupation, however intellectual in itself,
                    must have been to a mind, so eager for observation on living man, so intent on
                    mental and moral phenomena, as that of Socrates; and how gladly he would
                    exchange the labour of his paternal art for that philosophic leisure which
                    tl&gt;e friendship of Crito held out to him.</p>
                <p>The world of that day reproached the philosophers with servility, taunting them
                    with being ever seen at the “gates of the rich.” In some instances, the reproach
                    may have been just. But in general, the fact was the reverse. Their society
                    rather was courted by the great and wealthy, who were proud of the reputation of
                    being patrons of philosophy. To Socrates, indeed, the patronage of a man of
                    wealth would be peculiarly acceptable, not so much for the means of subsistence,
                    about which he was absolutely thoughtless and indifferent, as for the society
                    itself to which he would thus be introduced, and the opportunity of carrying on
                    his researches into philosophy, both by books and by the oral instructions of
                    its living professors. To him it would be the very means by which he would
                    enlarge his field of moral observation. The social evenings of Athens were the
                    natural sequences of the mornings of the agora, and the courts, and the council,
                    and the assembly. They prolonged in festive conversation that strife of words
                    and competition of argument, which had been begun in the busy and serious
                    discussions of the morning, and of which the last murmurs had scarcely died away
                    on the ear of the assembled guests. For Athenian life was a life of constant
                    excitement. What Demosthenes observed an hundred years afterwards, and an
                    apostle four hundred years later still, —that the Athenians did nothing but go
                    about and ask the news of the day,—was a characteristic of the people already
                    strongly developed at this period of their history. Socrates, who, in his own
                    person, gave a philosophical cast to this inquisitive spirit, would be
                    peculiarly interested by such opportunities of exercising it as were presented
                    in the animated encounters of the symposium. There he would see human nature
                    displayed in some of its most striking forms. There he would meet the citizen
                    full of years and honours, experienced in the arts of government and diplomacy,
                    and in the service of the state by land and sea; the poet flushed with his
                    victories in the dramatic contest; the sophist armed at all points for the
                    display; the philosopher expounding his theories; the orator, the idol of the
                    people in his day; the courtly patron of literature; and a circle of young men,
                    the flower of the highest rank in the state; each bearing his part in the free
                    and lively interchange of thought, emulously provoking one another to
                    discussion, and contending for the mastery in the conflict of debate.</p>
                <p>By such society Socrates would be effectually prepared for that active enterprize
                    of philosophy, which formed the whole engagement of his life. In the meagre
                    information handed down to us respecting the details of his history, we are not
                    able to ascertain at what precise period of life he began his career of public
                    teaching, or at least attracted notice as the philosopher of Athens. The
                    transition would probably be gradual, from the youthful inquirer, to the mature
                    and expert teacher of others. This transition would be the less perceptible in
                    the case of Socrates, from the circumstance, that he never professed to <hi

                    but still, at the last, as he had done from the first, merely to <hi

                    disdained the <hi rend="italic">profession</hi> of philosophy. He was disgusted
                    with the vain pretension advanced by the Sophists, of being masters of every
                    science, and capable of imparting instruction on any given subject. He
                    accordingly set out with the antagonist position, that he <hi rend="italic">knew
                    nothing:</hi> that his only wisdom, if he possessed any beyond other men,
                    consisted in his being <hi rend="italic">aware of</hi> his real ignorance,
                    whilst others ignorantly presumed on the possession of a knowledge which they
                    had not. His teaching, therefore, was only a continuation of the process of
                    educa-<pb break="no" facs="ht:chi.28490924&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=505"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0720-0505-0439"/> tion of his own mind, by extending it to the
                    minds of others. He was fond of describing it as an <hi rend="italic"
                    >examination</hi> or <hi rend="italic">scrutiny</hi> of the mind; a method of
                    finding out the real condition of each mind, and so of preparing it for the due
                    exercise of its powers in the practical emergencies of human life. He saw that,
                    the evils of life arose, in great part, from the wrong judgments of men,—from
                    their mistaking their own powers, presuming on their knowledge, and ability, and
                    the truth of opinions adopted without inquiry. He endeavoured then to effect the
                    cure of human error and unhappiness by a reformation of the intellect. The first
                    step towards this would be taken, if men could be only divested of this vain
                    self-confidence; if they could be brought to <hi rend="italic">suspect</hi> that
                    they might be mistaken in their judgments, and so to <hi rend="italic"
                    >question</hi> themselves. This preliminary labour was employment enough for any
                    one man’s life, especially in a society such as that of Athens, so entirely
                    infected with the sophistical leaven. Socrates wisely confined his exertions to
                    this simple object. He is content to excite inquiry,—to provoke discussion,—and
                    thus to suggest the necessity of self-discipline in order to right judgment. He
                    does not, like other philosophers, quit the seclusion of a study, or the field
                    of foreign travel, to come forth to the world the accomplished teacher of the
                    accumulated wisdom of years of solitary thought and reflection. Whilst
                    philosophizing in the agora and the streets of Athens, in the workshops of the
                    artizan, or at the banquets of the rich, he is still employed in the work of <hi
                    rend="italic">disciplining</hi> the mind. Thus he passes on insensibly from the
                    education of himself to the education of others, and it is difficult
                    consequently, or rather impossible, to say in his case, where the character of
                    the learner ends, or where that of the philosopher and teacher begins.</p>
                <p>Yet, entirely as Socrates disregarded all positive knowledge, and threw himself
                    on the resources of a shrewd and extensive observation of human nature, we must
                    not suppose that he neglected to inform himself in the existing systems of
                    philosophy, and the particular sciences as they were then understood and taught.
                    There is reason to believe, that he had accurately studied the systems of the
                    early physical philosophers of the Ionic school, as well as the moral and
                    mathematical theories of the Pythagoreans, and the dialectics of the school of
                    Elea. Without supposing him so deeply versed in the doctrines of the several
                    schools, as would be inferred from his exact discussions in the dialogues of
                    Plato, there is still ample evidence, from the more direct account of Xenophon,

                    as well as observed much, when he commenced his philosophic mission. Xenophon
                    indeed tells us that Socrates considered the physical and dialectical theories
                    of his predecessors as unprofitable. But he takes care to add, that Socrates was
                    not unacquainted with these theories. And in particular, as to the sciences of
                    astronomy and geometry, he thought the attention of the student wasted in
                    investigating their more abstruse theorems. But he was able (as Xenophon further
                    observes), to speak on the subjects of these sciences also from his own
                    knowledge of them.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    poet Euripides; if the anecdote be true, as related by Laertius, that on being
                    asked by Euripides, who had put them into his hand, what he thought of them, he
                    replied, alluding to the studied obscurity of that philosopher; “What I
                    understand is excellent; so also, I suppose, is what I do not understand; only
                    there is need of some Delian diver to reach the sense.”<note anchored="true"

                    the former eminent for his dialectical skill, the latter the most distinguished
                    geometrician of the time. And though his scanty means precluded his attendance
                    on the professional lectures of Prodicus, the fashionable teacher of rhetoric at
                    that day at Athens, it cannot be doubted that he would on several occasions have
                    been among the company assembled at the house of some wealthy citizen, and there
                    heard from the lips of that accomplished master of language those elaborate

                    and Prodicus, and who was his senior only by a few years, he appears to have
                    lived in habits of intimacy. With Euripides he would probably often have
                    discussed those ethical topics which the poet so greatly delighted to transfuse
                    into his tragic scenes, and associate with the interest of dramatic incident.
                    They were in fact brother-labourers in the same cause, though in different ways.
                    For whilst Euripides endeavoured to work a reformation of his countrymen, by
                    didactic addresses insinuated through their feelings, amidst the interest of
                    tragic story, Socrates appealed at once to their understandings, and amidst the
                    business or pastime of real life. The envy of contemporaries was prone to
                    attribute the excellence of the poet in some of his dramatic efforts, to the aid
                    of his philosopher-friend.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    is, that the benefit of their intercourse was mutual; that, whilst the poet’s
                    imagination was informed and chastened by the shrewd and severe wisdom of the
                    philosopher, the philosopher also, ever intent on his calling, would enlarge his

                <p>Instruction in music formed an important part of Athenian education. Socrates, it
                    seems, did not neglect the opportunities which the presence of the great masters
                    of the art in Athene afforded him of learning its principles. Connus accordingly
                    is claimed for him, as his master in music.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    musician, though not more eminent in the science which he professed, than as a

                    of Pericles, the intimate and counsellor of that great statesman, as well as his

                    are told, Socrates received instruction in the art. By these accounts, however,
                    we may probably understand, not that he became a proficient in the musical art,
                    but that he had listened to Damon as well as to Connus, discoursing on the
                    subject, and studied its theories under them, so far, at least, as music entered
                    into the general pursuit of philosophy.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                <p>It should be observed, indeed, that though Socrates strongly discouraged the <hi
                    rend="italic">presumption</hi> of knowledge in all with whom he conversed, he
                    did not disapprove of the acquisition of particular kinds of knowledge. He
                    communicated whatever he knew to every one that came in his way; and where he
                    was himself unacquainted with any subject, he referred his hearers to those who
                    possessed the information.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>’ Xenoph. Mem. iv. 7.</p></note> He was not in fact opposed to knowledge in
                    itself. He was glad to embrace it wherever it could be found. But he was an
                    enemy to the substitution of mere intellectual acquisitions,—and those often
                    superficial and unreal,—for <hi rend="italic">education</hi> of the mind and
                    character. He felt, and justly felt, that knowledge by itself was vanity. The
                    tendency of the age was to ascribe value exclusively to mental acuteness and
                    dexterity. Ingenuity and cleverness obtained the merit and the prize of wisdom.
                    His labour was to draw his countrymen from thinking too highly of their boasted
                    knowledge. He wished them to see how greatly they overrated intellectual
                    acquirements,—how much they had yet to learn if they would be real proficients
                    in wisdom.</p>
                <p>Socrates indeed appears to have regarded philosophy in the light of a sacred
                    mission, to which he was specially called, rather than of a study and exercise
                    of the mind. This notion of philosophy had already been exemplified by
                    Pythagoras and his followers. But they had realized it by forming themselves
                    into distinct communities or colleges; separating themselves from the world
                    around, by a solemn initiation, and the practice of an ascetic discipline.
                    Socrates, however, had no thought of changing the outward form of society. He
                    did not propose, like Pythagoras, to institute a refuge from the pollutions and
                    misery of the world, or to educate a peculiar brotherhood, who should afterwards
                    act on the social mass. He did not address himself to the few. His school was
                    all Athens, or rather indeed all Greece. Leaving society as it was, he sought to
                    infuse a new spirit into it, by carrying his philosophy into every department of
                    it. He therefore went about among all classes of people, preferring none,
                    despising none, but adapting his instructions to every variety of condition and
                    character. Thus did he in truth, according to the observation commonly applied
                    to him from the time of Cicero, bring down philosophy from heaven to earth; but
                    not so much by being the first to give a moral tone to philosophy, as by the
                    universality and philanthropy of his teaching. Philosophy in his hands was no
                    longer an exclusive and privileged profession. It no longer spoke as from an
                    oracular shrine, and in the language of mystery. It now conversed with every man
                    at his own home,—submitted to be familiarly approached and viewed without
                    reserve,—and, instead of waiting to be formally consulted by its votaries only,
                    volunteered to mingle in the business, and interests, and pleasures of every-day
                    life.</p>
                <p>His manner of life and of teaching is thus described by Xenophon.<note

                <p>“He was constantly in public. For early in the morning he would go to the walks
                    and the gymnasia; and when the agora was full, he was to be seen there; and
                    constantly during the remainder of the day, he would be wherever he was likely
                    to meet with the most persons; and for the most part he would talk, and all that
                    would might hear him.”</p>
                <p>The nature of his conversations is thus further reported by the same faithful
                    authority:</p>
                <p>“No one ever saw Socrates doing, or heard him saying, any thing impious or
                    profane. For not only did he not discourse about the nature of all things, as
                    most others, inquiring how, what by the sophists is called the universe,
                    consists, and by what laws each heavenly thing is produced; but he would point
                    out the folly of those who studied such matters. And the first inquiry he would
                    make of them was, whether they proceeded to such studies from thinking
                    themselves already sufficiently acquainted with human things; or whether they
                    thought they were acting becomingly in passing by human things, and giving their
                    attention to divine. He would wonder, too, it was not evident to them, that it
                    was not possible for men to find out these matters; since even those who most
                    prided themselves on discoursing of them, did not agree in opinion with each
                    other, but were affected like madmen in relation to one another. For of madmen,
                    whilst some did not fear even the fearful, others were terrified at things not
                    terrible; whilst some were not ashamed to say or do any thing even before the
                    multitude, others objected even to going out into the world; whilst some paid no
                    honour to sacred things, or altars, or any other religious object, others
                    worshipped even stones, and common stocks, and brutes. So of those who
                    speculated on the nature of the universe, whilst some thought that Being was one
                    only, others thought it was infinite in number; whilst some thought that all
                    things were in perpetual motion, others thought it impossible for any thing to
                    be moved; whilst some thought that all things were in a course of generation and
                    destruction, others thought that nothing could possibly be generated or
                    destroyed. He would further consider respecting them thus: whether, as the
                    learners of human things think they shall be able to make practical use of their
                    knowledge for themselves and any one else at pleasure, so also the searchers
                    into divine things hold, that having ascertained by what laws each thing<pb
                    break="no" facs="ht:chi.28490924&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=507"

                    pleasure winds, and waters, and seasons, and whatever else of the kind they may
                    want; or whether they have no such expectation, but it suffices them only to
                    know how every thing of this kind is generated. Such, then, was his manner of
                    speaking about those who busied themselves with these matters. But, for his
                    part, he was ever discoursing about human things, inquiring what was pious, what
                    impious, what honourable, what base, what just, what unjust, what sobriety, what
                    madness, what courage, what cowardice, what a state, what a statesman, what a
                    government of men, what the character of a governor; and about other subjects,
                    which, by being known, would make men honourable and virtuous, whilst those who
                    were ignorant of them, would justly be called slavish.”</p>
                <p>Xenophon has thus fully touched the character of the teaching of Socrates in its
                    leading points, and the nature of his constant occupation at Athens. The
                    intermissions of military service appear to have been the only occasions of any
                    variation in this uniform course of life. No other country had any charms for
                    him, as no other afforded such rich opportunities of conversing with men, and
                    studying human nature.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    his predecessors or successors in the path of philosophy. They travelled from
                    place to place searching for knowledge, storing their minds with various
                    observations, and making philosophy their formal business. Socrates, as he had
                    no stated school or place of audience, so he had no design of framing any system
                    of philosophy, or of enlarging the researches and discoveries of former
                    philosophers, or of pursuing knowledge as an ultimate object. He regarded
                    himself as called by the voice of Deity, to undertake the reformation of men,
                    and especially of his fellow-citizens, as constituting his proper sphere of
                    duty, from their corruptions of sentiment and conduct. He stood, therefore, by
                    the great stream of human life which was ever flowing at Athens, and watched its
                    course. He is said once to have visited Samos in company with Archelaus, the
                    disciple of Anaxagoras, and also to have gone to the Pythian and the Isthmian
                    games. With these exceptions, and those of the occasions of military service
                    abroad, he appears to have constantly remained at home, unattracted from the
                    town, the seat of his philosophic mission, by invitations even to the courts of
                    princes. In vain did Scopas of Cranon, and Eurylochus of Larissa, offer him
                    money, and invite him to visit them.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Diog. Laert. in vit.</p></note> He could refuse also the
                    hospitality of Archelaus, king of Macedonia, the same with whom the poet
                    Euripides found a kind and honourable refuge in his old age, from the envy of
                    his countrymen, and domestic grievance. His refusal of the invitation of
                    Archelaus is said indeed to have been accompanied with the declaration of his
                    feeling, that he could not brook the acceptance of a favour which it was
                    entirely out of his power to return.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    was a stranger, as Plato represents him, even to the immediate neighbourhood of
                    the city. The banks of the Ilyssus, even then classic ground, rich with
                    legendary associations, could not seduce him from the agora and the crowd; so
                    that he seemed scarcely at home beyond the walls of Athens.<note anchored="true"

                <p>No Athenian, however, could decline the military service of the state. And this
                    service, at the time of Socrates, often engaged the citizen in hazardous
                    enterprizes and long absences far from his home. The first occasion on which
                    Socrates is related to have served, was in the Chersonese at Potidaea, just
                    before the opening of the Peloponnesian war. The service in which the Athenian
                    soldiers were engaged here was one of great hardship. It was in the winter
                    season, and the climate in those parts was most severe. Amongst those who
                    distinguished themselves by their resoluteness and gallantry, none was so
                    conspicuous as the philosopher. Whilst others were clothing themselves with
                    additional garments, and wrapping their feet in wool, he was observed in his
                    usual dress, and walking barefoot on the ice, with more ease than others with
                    their shoes. Nor even amidst these circumstances, did he merge the character of
                    the philosopher in that of the soldier. He was seen one morning at sun-rise
                    fixed in contemplation. At noon he was in the some position, and still in the
                    evening, and so continued through the night, until the sun-rise of the following
                    day. Such, too, was his bravery in the engagements at Potidaea, that he earned
                    for himself the prize of distinction, but readily sacrificed his claim to the
                    wishes of the generals, in favour of a more illustrious candidate in the person
                    of Alcibiades. Alcibiades himself would have refused the honour as due rather to
                    Socrates; for to the unwillingness of Socrates to leave him wounded on the
                    field, he had been even indebted for his own life, and the preservation of his
                    arms, after the battle. But the philosopher, with a true magnanimity, insisted
                    on the award of the generals.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                <p>The next occasion of military service, in which he was scarcely less
                    distinguished than at Potidaea, was in the eighth year of the Peloponnesian war,
                    at the battle of Delium in Boeotia. The battle was an unsuccessful one to the
                    Athenians, and they were forced to retreat in disorder. Alcibiades was also
                    present on this occasion, and overtook Socrates in company with Laches, one of
                    the generals, on the way. He was on horseback, and comparatively therefore out
                    of danger, whilst they were on foot. He had opportunity, therefore, of admiring
                    the presence of mind which Socrates displayed on the occasion, even beyond
                    Laches, and the steadiness and vigilance with which he kept the enemy from
                    pressing upon them, and so secured their retreat.<note anchored="true"

                    says that Socrates saved Xenophon, who had fallen from his horse in the battle
                    of Delium, (in vit. Soc. ii. 5-7.) But this cannot be true, as Xenophon would be
                    much too young at that time for military service. In the Deipnosophists of
                    Athenaeus, (v. 55), doubt is thrown on these accounts of the military service of
                    Socrates, and instances are given of the historical inaccuracy of Plato. The
                    objections, however, as there given, are evidently thrown out in the wav of
                    discussion, and not with perfect seriousness, as if the speaker re illy thought
                    them of weight.</p></note></p>
                <p>These incidents seem to rest on indisputable evidence. The account of them is put
                    into the mouth of Alcibiades by Plato, in that most ingenious of his dialogues,

                    unfortunate expedition to Delium. No particulars are mentioned of this
                    adventure. But the fact itself is sufficiently attested. Nor, though it follows
                    immediately on the affair of Delium, is it improbable on that account. For at
                    this busy period of the war, when the Athenians were making demonstrations of
                    their power, by the presence of their forces in different places at once, and
                    when Brasilias was pushing his successes against them in Thrace, no individual
                    of the military age, (and Socrates was not more than forty-six or forty-seven
                    years of age at this time), would enjoy any long interval of relaxation from
                    foreign service.</p>
                <p>With these exceptions, Socrates appears then to have constantly resided at
                    Athens. All this time, throughout his whole life indeed, he lived in great
                    poverty, content with the least that might suffice for mere sustenance and
                    clothing from day to day.</p>
                <p>Yet it was no artificial, and melancholy, and fanatical life that he led. He
                    accustomed himself to a strict moderation, not with any view to the
                    mortification of the body, or as thinking that abstinence was in itself a
                    virtue, but in order to self-command; by rendering himself as independent as
                    possible of the circumstances of the body, to disencumber the soul of every
                    burthen and obstruction to its free operation. There was nothing, indeed, of
                    austerity in his life or manner. He might be seen walking barefoot, but it was
                    not for the pain that it might inflict. It was only that he might bear cold and
                    privations of every kind the better, and suffer the less inconvenience when
                    exposed to necessary hardships, and require the less for his ordinary
                    subsistence. So far was he from studying a discipline of bodily severity for its
                    own sake, that he was observed at times mingling in the social festivities of
                    his fellow-citizens with the full freedom of Athenian conviviality, and shewing
                    that he could bear excesses which mastered others, without losing his
                    self-command.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Plato,

                <p>One account, indeed, but not a very credible one, as it rests on the authority of
                    Aristoxenus, an invidious writer, states that he was supported by the alms of
                    friends, contributed from time to time for his relief. With his very limited
                    wants, and his ready access to the house of Crito and other liberal patrons of
                    philosophy at Athens, he would not have to depend on this precarious charity.
                    The pittance which sufficed for the humblest citizen would suffice for him. He
                    is said to have inherited a patrimony of seventy or eighty minae.<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>About L.400 of our money.
                    Plutarch (in his life of Aristides) finds fault with Demetrius Phalereus for
                    having endeavoured to remove the imputation of poverty from Socrates, by stating
                    that Socrates had land of his own and seventy minae put out to intereat by
                    Crito. Demetrius, however, seems only to have stated what he believed to be the
                    truth. The idea of bis extreme indigence originated probably with the
                    caricatures of bis profession of poverty by the comic poets; and true as it was
                    substantially, was afterwards, it seems, maintained by bis friends and admirers,
                    as the evidence of the consistency of his life with his avowed contempt for
                    worldly possessions.</p></note> But this sum, it is added, he lost (though the
                    time is not stated when the loss occurred) by the failure of the person with
                    whom it had been placed at interest. He possessed also a house in Athens; and he
                    was able, however scantily, to support a family. So that we cannot suppose he
                    was absolutely destitute of all resources of subsistence. He appears then rather
                    to have voluntarily renounced every kind of worldly possession, so far as his
                    own personal comfort was concerned, than to have been absolutely reduced to want
                    by the pressure of circumstances. Poverty, in fact, was his profession, and not
                    the mere necessity of his case. If he prided himself in any thing, it was in his
                    avowal of his contempt for riches, and disregard of domestic interests and
                    comforts, in contrast with the general habits of an age of selfish activity and
                    profusion. The means of enriching himself, at least of extricating himself from
                    want, were often placed in his power, and he as often rejected them. Alcibiades
                    offered him land on which he might build a house, but he refused it pointedly,
                    observing, “Had I wanted shoes, would you have offered me leather to make shoes
                    for myself?—and ridiculous should I have been in taking it.” Charmides would
                    have given him slaves, as a source of revenue by their labour. This offer also
                    he refused.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>• Diog.

                <p>In the domestic relations of life, he lived an Athenian among Athenians. He
                    differed from other heads of families at Athens in this respect, that in his
                    dedication of himself to his philosophic mission, he took no thought about the
                    management of his private affairs. His home was abroad; his household the people
                    of Athens. Still he discharged the duties of a husband, and the father of a
                    family; and that under trying circumstances, unless the proverbial severity of
                    temper of his wife Xanthippe be esteemed an idle scandal of the day. No
                    Athenian, indeed, was truly domestic, in the sense of making his home the scene
                    of his highest interest and enjoyment. Nor was Socrates domestic in this sense.
                    Still less was he so than other Athenians; inasmuch as his very profession of
                    life was a call from the bosom of his family. But in the midst of these
                    avocations from his immediate home, and the vexations to which he was subjected
                    there, he was not estranged from the ties of domestic affection. Xenophon has
                    recorded a simple and touching trait of the character of Socrates under this
                    particular point of view—a trait the more interesting, as almost every thing
                    else that we know of the philosopher is drawn from his life in public. It occurs
                    in the course of a conversation between Socrates and bis son Lamprocles, who had
                    complained of the insufferable temper of his mother Xanthippe. “What,” said he
                    to the youth, “do you think it more annoying to you to hear what she says, than
                    it is to the actors, when in the tragedies they say every thing bad of one
                    another ?” “But they, I conceive,” re plied the son, “bear it easily, because
                    they do not suppose that the speaker, in contradicting them, intends to hurt
                    them, or that, in threatening, he intends to do them any ill.” “Then are you,”
                    resumed Socrates, “vexed, when you well know that what your mother says to you,
                    she says, not only intending no evil, but even wishing more good to you than to
                    any one else; or do you regard your mother as unkindly affected towards you ?”
                    Lamprocles disclaiming this latter supposition; “Do you, then,” he added, “say
                    of her, who is both kind to you, and takes every possible care of you when you
                    are sick, that you may recover, and want nothing proper for you, and who,
                    moreover, prays to the gods in your behalf for many a good, and pays vows,—that
                    she is vexatious? For my part, I think, if you cannot bear such a mother, you
                    cannot bear what is good for you.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    disasters in Sicily, the Athenians made a decree authorizing double marriages,
                    with the view of recruiting their exhausted population. But this statement does
                    not appear to be borne out by the earlier authorities on the subject of Athenian
                    legislation. Nor is it probable that a law should have been enacted, directly
                    sanctioning a form of polygamy. It appears, that during the pressure and
                    confusion of the Peloponnesian war, persons obtained the freedom of the city of
                    Athens, whose title was objectionable on the constitutional ground of their not
                    being born of citizen-parents on both sides. Thus had Pericles, after the death
                    of his two legitimate sons, obtained the admission of his son, Pericles, by
                    Aspasia, to the privilege of citizenship;<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    supposition, that a decree passed at Athens sanctioning bigamy.</p>
                <p>Some difficulty, however, arises on the subject of the marriage of Socrates, from
                    the conflict of authorities. Whilst it is asserted on the one hand, that he was
                    married to Myrto and Xanthippe at the same time; on the other hand, others
                    assign them both as his wives, but in succession, and also differ as to the
                    order of succession. But the silence of Plato and Xenophon respecting any other
                    wife of Socrates butXan-thippe, and their coincidence in speaking of her only as
                    the mother of his children, may be regarded as sufficiently decisive of the
                    point against every subsequent authority. Indeed, the reference to Aristotle,
                    given by Laertius, which is the chief ground for believing that Socrates was
                    married also to Myrto, is very questionable. Plutarch doubts whether the
                    treatise to which Laertius appeals for the fact, is the genuine work of
                    Aristotle. From the manner, too, in which the name of Myrto appears to have been
                    introduced in the account, nothing more may have been intended, than that
                    Socrates found her in a state of widowhood and distress from poverty, and took
                    care of her at his own home.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    such an act of friendliness to the disconsolate Myrto. And, if this be the case,
                    as is probable, it would only add an interesting instance of that liberal

                    unexampled in the history of domestic life. Instead of confirming the censorious
                    remark, he turned it, according to his usual method, to a practical illustration
                    of his philosophy. “If Xanthippe was hard to be controlled,” was the tenour of
                    his answer, “it was only a proper discipline to him for the management of men;
                    as those who would be masters in horsemanship, began with managing the most

                    by his habitual neglect of his domestic concerns, and the duty of exertion
                    consequently imposed on Xanthippe beyond Athenian women in general. She appears
                    indeed to have tenderly loved her husband, if Plato has faithfully traced the
                    picture of her visit to his prison, and her extreme anguish at that trying hour.

                    the disciples of the philosopher, above every other incident of his life, and of
                    which persons then living must have retained a lively recollection, he took his
                    outlines at least of these interesting particulars from the real state of the
                    case.</p>
                <p>But the allusion to these circumstances brings us prematurely to the solemn
                    tragedy which closed his intrepid and energetic career. We have yet to
                    contemplate him pursuing tor many a year his unwearied labour of awakening his
                    countrymen from their dreams of knowledge and happiness to the realities of
                    their condition in the world. Great indeed must have been the address, which
                    could recommend the severe and wholesome truths inculcated by him, to the
                    hearing of the vain and volatile Athenians. To none is the practical application
                    of a principle, so condemnatory of human folly and impertinence, as the maxim,
                    “know thyself,” truly welcome. And yet this was the burthen of the teaching of
                    Socrates for a series of years, among a people, whom it was far easier to please
                    by praising to excess, than not to displease by censuring ever so slightly. They
                    would listen, indeed, patiently to general invectives on their publicconduct,
                    conveyed in the impassioned eloquence of their orators; as persons will even now
                    sympathize with general descriptions of the depravity of human nature, or of
                    whole classes of men. But all refuse the pain of direct self-appli-<pb

                    of their knowledge. They saw his superiority to the Sophists, on the very ground
                    on which the Sophists set up their pretensions. Many, accordingly, flocked to
                    him as the best master in political science and dialectical skill, particularly
                    as he was always accessible, and his instructions were perfectly gratuitous.
                    Some, too, of a better nature than the rest, were won by the honest and manly
                    purpose which shone through his teaching and manner on all occasions; whatever
                    disguise of irony, or humour, or sophistry, he might assume. There were even
                    some of the young men, whose habits of life were reproved, and principles
                    condemned, by his searching interrogatories, but who yet were won to attention
                    by the charm of his instruction, and patiently heard from him truths which they
                    would not have listened to from any other lips. For who else could stay, even
                    for a moment, the wild impetuosity of Alcibiades, or the ferocious arrogance of
                    Critias? Their motives in resorting to Socrates were chiefly selfish and
                    political. It was in pursuit of their schemes of ambition that they sought his
                    society. Still he was able to retain them for a time at least, though they found
                    his instructions very different from what they calculated on receiving; and so
                    long as they continued to associate with him, they exercised a degree of
                    self-restraint which strikingly contrasted with the habitual profligacy of their
                    lives.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Xenoph. Mem. i.

                    whom the feeling of shame was scarcely known, yet felt abashed before Socrates;
                    that he was enchanted by him as by the flute of Marsyas, and constrained to
                    acknowledge his own deficiences and neglect of private duty in the midst of his
                    officious zeal for the public service. And this feeling, Alcibiades says, was
                    general; for that there was no one, woman, or man, or boy, that could hear him,
                    or even his words repeated by the most indifferent speaker, but felt taken by
                    surprize, and riveted in attention.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                <p>This attention, too, it should be observed, was excited by the address of
                    Socrates, amidst much in his outward form and mien, that, by exciting ridicule,
                    might have repelled the sentiment of respect. The comparison of him to the satyr
                    Marsyas, with all allowance made for comic exaggeration, was true in more
                    respects than that of the enchantment of his conversation. His countenance,
                    strongly marked by that arch intelligence, which half-concealed, half-betrayed,
                    the earnest deep thought, under the light veil of irony and humour, presented
                    features resembling those of the grotesque images of the Sileni. There were the
                    prominent dilated eyes, scarcely parted by the low ridge of the nose, the broad
                    expanded nostrils, the wide mouth with its thick lips, such as the sculptors
                    delighted to represent in those rude but poetic forms.<note anchored="true"

                    cave, but full and obtuse. Prejudices accordingly drawn from the personal
                    appearance of Socrates may reasonably be believed to have tended to render his
                    teaching unwelcome in its first impressions. But soon this fastidiousness would
                    give way as he proceeded; and those who began to listen with a smile at the
                    uncouthness of his form, and the quaintness of his manner, would be attracted to
                    admiration of the intelligent and kindly expression which lighted up those rude
                    features, and would find themselves lingering in his presence in spite of
                    themselves.</p>
                <p>The story of Euthydemus “the handsome," as he was called, may be taken as a
                    specimen of such an effect. Euthydemus, proud of his personal accomplishments,
                    and not wishing to be thought indebted to any one for his learning and
                    eloquence, had studiously avoided the society of Socrates. Socrates, however,
                    with his usual dexterity, contrives to excite his attention, and gradually
                    interests him in conversation. Euthydemus shrinks back at first on his
                    self-conceit, but at length is so won upon by the persuasive reason of the
                    philosopher, as freely to acknowledge his own ignorance and need of instruction;
                    and, ever afterwards, he is found by the side of Socrates, his devoted admirer
                    and follower.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>• Xenoph.
                    Mem. iv. 2.</p></note></p>
                <p>Some, indeed, took offence at the plain truths which Socrates brought home to
                    them, and no longer frequented his society.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>’ Ibid. 40.</p></note> But these were the inferior sluggish
                    minds, which no arts of address could rouse to a sense of their intellectual
                    poverty. Generous, susceptible minds overcame their first reluctance, and
                    yielded themselves fully to his guidance. The faithful attachment of many was
                    evidenced, to the last moment of the philosoper’s life. He might have commanded
                    the use of Crito’s wealth, bad he desired it. Such, indeed, was the confidence
                    which Crito reposed in his sincerity of purpose, and so highly did he value his
                    instructions, that to no other would he commit the education of his sons, but
                    made them fellow disciples with himself of his own revered master and friend.
                    And this friendship was warmly requitted by Socrates. For it was by his counsel
                    that Crito was saved from the malicious arts of the sycophants. These pests of
                    Athenian society were not to be encountered by the simple testimony of a life
                    contradicting their mercenary calumnies; and Crito was one of those who would
                    rather pay their money, and compromise the attack, than take the trouble of
                    defending themselves. They were only to be foiled by turning their own weapons
                    against themselves. By the suggestion of Socrates, accordingly, Crito enlisted
                    in his service a clever individual of this class, Archedemus, who effectually
                    checked the iniquities of which his patron was the object, by
                    counter-prosecutions of the sycophants, and exposure of their conduct; acting as
                    a watch-dog, according to Xenophon’s description, against those rapacious
                    wolves.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Ibid. ii.
                    9.</p></note></p>
                <p>The devotedness of Plato and Xenophon to their master, speaks from every line of
                    their writings. These writings are, in fact, as much monuments of the influence
                    of Socrates over their minds, as of their own genius. And what human teacher has
                    ever had such glorious trophies erected of the conquests of his philosophy as
                    the extant works of these master minds? Entirely different as they are in
                    character,—the one flowing with the full stream of impassioned feeling, and
                    lively elegant imagination, and the abundant treasures of literary and
                    traditionary wisdom,—the other sensible and acute and practical, forcible by his
                    very simplicity and the terseness of his unaffected eloquence,—they bear
                    distinct yet conspiring evidence of the ascendancy of that mind which could
                    impart its own tone and character to such disciples. Both of them, indeed, lead
                    us to think that they felt his society as a kind of spell on them. For, when
                    Plato speaks of the charm of the discourses of the Sophists, he seems to speak
                    in irony of them what he thought in truth of Socrates himself. So too, when
                    Xenophon introduces Socrates describing himself as skilled in “philters and
                    incantations,” he is evidently presenting that idea which the conversations of
                    Socrates impressed on his own mind. He seems almost to confess this of himself
                    when he informs us, how Socrates triumphantly appealed to the marked devotedness
                    of his followers, in saying, “Why think you that this Apollodorus and
                    Antisthenes never quit me? Why too, that Cebes and Simmias come here from
                    Thebes? Be assured, that this is not without many philters, and incantations,
                    and spells.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Ibid. iii.
                    2.</p></note></p>
                <p>To the same honourable band of attached disciples might be added many other names
                    afterwards renowned in the annals of Grecian history and literature. Isocrates,
                    Aristippus, Antisthenes, each of whom became afterwards masters themselves, were
                    content to follow in his train. Antisthenes especially, who, by perverting the
                    Socratic simplicity of life into a profession of austerity, became the founder
                    of the Cynic school, was never from his side. He would walk from the Piraeus to
                    Athens, a distance of about four miles, every day, in order to be with Socrates.
                    And whilst Cebes and Simmias came from Thebes, Euclid, the founder of the
                    Megaric sect, was not deterred by the bitter hostility between Athens and his
                    own city of Megara, from seeking the society of Socrates at the hazard of his
                    life. Even during the war, when the Megareans were excluded by a rigid decree,
                    he continued his visits to Athens, adopting, it is said, the disguise of female
                    attire, and so passing unobserved into the city at nightfall, and returning at
                    daybreak.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Aul. Gell. vi
                    10.</p></note> The same individual gave still more conclusive evidence of his
                    zealous attachment to Socrates afterwards; when he opened his house and his
                    heart to receive, at Megara, his brother disciples, in their panic on the death
                    of their master. So strong was the tie of reverence and affection which
                    subsisted between the philosopher and those whom he drew around him. They
                    formed, indeed, a sort of select family, each of whom was engaged in the pursuit
                    of his own peculiar employments and tastes in the world, whilst all looked up to
                    Socrates as their father and head, and ever recurred to his society as to their
                    common home.</p>
                <p>This domestic intercourse subsisted in the midst of a city harassed with
                    jealousies and dissensions, and with severe afflictions of war and pestilence.
                    Socrates remained unmoved through all these convulsions of the city, preserving
                    a constant evenness of temper, so that Xanthippe could testify of him, that she
                    never saw him returning at evening with a countenance changed from that with
                    which he left home in the morning.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    was assaulted by a riotous party of young men, personating the Furies, in masks,

                    irritated by the interruption, suffered them to indulge their mirth; only he
                    required them to pay that tribute which he exacted from every one that came in
                    his way, to stop and answer his questions, as if he had met them in the Lyceum,
                    or any other accustomed place of his daily conversations. Himself sound in mind
                    and body, (for his habitual temperance saved him from the infection of the
                    plague which so obstinately ravaged Athens,) he was enabled to give advice and
                    assistance to all of his country in the midst of the physical and moral
                    desolation, in which every one else seems, more or less, to have
                    participated.</p>

                    nature herself would have gently closed the scene of his philanthropic
                    exertions, when the hand of human violence interposed to hasten the approaching
                    end.</p>
                <p>The annals of party spirit at Athens had already recorded many a deed of dark and
                    wanton cruelty. But they were yet to be stained with the iniquity of a
                    persecution even to death, of him, who had been the greatest benefactor and
                    ornament, not only of Athens, but of the whole community of the Grecian
                    name.</p>
                <p>The banishment by ostracism had this redeeming merit, that it was an avowal in
                    the face of Greece, of the envious and factious spirit, which drove from the
                    state the individual whose talents or virtues too greatly distinguished him from
                    among his fellow-citizens. The enmity to which Socrates fell a sacrifice,
                    exhibits a deeper character of malignity; inasmuch as it masked itself under a
                    hypocritical zeal for religion and virtue, and thus courted public sympathy for
                    proceedings, against which every voice in Athens and in all Greece should have
                    indignantly protested. Ostracism, again, was content to remove the obnoxious
                    great man from the eyes of his fellow-citizens. The attack on Socrates was
                    satisfied with nothing short of the destruction of its victim.</p>
                <p>It was in the midst of the tranquil, but busy course of his daily engagement,
                    that Socrates was suddenly arrested, and without, it seems, any previous
                    intimation of the intended attack, summoned to the porticoof the king-Archon, to
                    answer a charge of impiety.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                <p>The accusation was in this form: “Socrates is guilty of the crime of not
                    acknowledging the gods whom the state acknowledges, but introducing other new
                    divinities: he is guilty also of the crime of corrupting the young.” The penalty
                    proposed was death. It has been commonly supposed that the charge was laid
                    before the court of Areopagus. But it would appear rather, from the course of
                    the trial, to have been before one of the popular courts, and probably, from the
                    great number of dicasts or jurors who voted on the cause, before the principal
                    court, the Heliaea.</p>
                <p>The circumstances connected with the accusation remain, after the utmost inquiry
                    now possible, involved in considerable mystery. We are told that Melitus was the
                    accuser, and that he was supported in the prosecution by Anytus and Lycon. These
                    three individuals are also said to have represented distinct classes of persons
                    interested in the proceedings; Melitus, who was himself a poet, appearing in
                    behalf of the offended poets; Anytus, a wealthy tradesman and demagogue,
                    resenting the affronts of his brother-tradesmen; Lycon, an orator, or politician
                    by profession, standing up as the assertor of the pretensions of his factious
                    order. But these particulars, though they may account to us in a great measure
                    for the success of the prosecution, do not exhibit the secret agency by which it
                    was effected. The accusers themselves were men of no note or importance in the
                    state. Melitus was a young man; a vain and weak person, it seems, of whom
                    nothing more is known than that the accusation was made in his name. Nor of
                    Anytus and Lycon have we anything to mark the importance, beyond the fact, that
                    the former was included, together with Alcibiades and Thrasybulus, among the
                    persons exiled by the Thirty, and the notice taken of him by Plato, where he
                    represents him the inexorable foe of every thing in the shape of a philosopher,
                    and as parting from a conversation with Socrates in anger.<note anchored="true"

                    sufficient pretext or weight to so grave an accusation. Nor can we suppose that
                    it was even the combined interest of the three classes represented by the three
                    accusers—the poets, the tradesmen, and the orators—which carried the
                    condemnation of so respected a person. The ground of the attack must lie deeper;
                    and the men whose names appear so prominently in this fatal conspiracy against
                    the life of the venerable old philosopher, could only have been the puppets
                    moved by some secret and more commanding force. The trial would seem to have
                    been only a solemn pageant, exhibited before the public, as a prelude and
                    justification of a deed of murder already resolved on by its real though
                    invisible perpetrators. Whilst the charges themselves, as set forth by the
                    nominal accusers, were but feebly sustained, it is evident that no defence,
                    however just and able, could have availed to avert the sentence of condemnation.
                    The body of jurors before whom the cause was heard, appear to have been disposed
                    to acquit the accused, if we may judge from the number of votes which were given
                    in his favour; and yet the majority were overruled. This in itself would lead us
                    to think that some secret influence had been exercised, to obviate the chance of
                    failure of the ordinary ostensible means of judicial assault. And so Socrates
                    himself appears to have felt; if Plato and Xenophon have faithfully reported the
                    substance of his reply to the accusation in their Apologies. His defence, as
                    there represented, is that of one who retires, on his own consciousness of
                    right, from a bootless conflict with adversaries who are not to be appeased by
                    argument and persuasion. It does not set forth the strength of his cause as
                    against an opponent, but simply asserts the truth and merit of the course of
                    life which he had been pursuing.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    the circumstances of the trial and condemnation of Socrates, we must obtain a
                    deeper insight into the moving power of Grecian politics, —the spirit of the
                    heathen religion, and the mode of its action on the conduct of states and
                    individuals. This appears to be the proper solution of the case of Socrates. The
                    circumstances of the case evidently point to this. And though, from the want of
                    information, we cannot very distinctly trace the working of the religion of the
                    times in the particular instance before us, we may, from a closer consideration
                    of the facts, not unreasonably suspect its active operation and
                    instrumentality.</p>
                <p>Speculators have sometimes spoken of the mild and tolerant spirit of paganism.
                    The observation, however, is superficial and untrue. The facility with which the
                    polytheistic worshipper transferred his offerings and prayers to every new idol,
                    has been mistaken for a readiness to admit any variation from the established
                    worship, or any freedom o. opinion respecting divine things, without offence.

                    or any attempt to bring the subject into discussion. It was not only the
                    primitive Christians that were stigmatized by heathens as atheists, because they
                    renounced the divinities of the heathen creed, but the same reproach was long
                    before cast upon those among the heathens themselves, who, with however pious
                    disposition, ventured to speculate on religion. A traditionary religion will
                    tolerate any laxity of thought or conduct which professedly admits its
                    authority, whilst it peremptorily puts down every thing which impugns the
                    principle of absolute deference to its authority. Thus we shall find, that,
                    where that principle is carried to the utmost, there co-exists with it a
                    scarcely concealed infidelity, and an unrestrained licentiousness of conduct;
                    and, at the same time, also an extreme sensitiveness in regard to deviation from
                    the orthodox profession and language. We have unhappily seen this in those
                    Christian countries, where the true faith, the principle of devout submission to
                    the word of God, has been transformed and perverted into a doctrine of implicit
                    deference to the authority of the ministers themselves of that word. There,—as,
                    for example, in Spain and Italy,—where the authority of the church is bowed to
                    most submissively, practical infidelity and immorality shew their front with
                    impunity, whilst the expression of opinion or argument on questions of theology
                    is discouraged and silenced, if no longer now, as once, crushed at its outbreak
                    by the dark terrors of an Inquisition. The same fact was intensely exemplified
                    in heathen Athens. At no place was piety, as piety was understood by heathens,
                    more in honour. No state boasted such a tradition of sacred associations as
                    Athens. In none were there so many festivals and solemnities of religious
                    observance, as in Athens.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    religion hold such sway. Witness their power over Alcibiades, at the moment of
                    his political triumph, and amidst the caresses and admiration of his
                    fellow-citizens, when he felt himself obliged to relinquish his command in
                    Sicily, and desert his country, rather than encounter at home the threatened
                    prosecution for his profanation of sacred things. Witness their power again in
                    the instance of the same Alcibiades, at his restoration to the command of the
                    army, when, to conciliate their favour, he delays the urgent expedition, and
                    keeps the soldiers under arms along the road by which the sacred procession
                    passed from Athens to Eleusis. Witness further, the frequent prosecutions at
                    Athens on charges of impiety of which we read, and of which we have monuments in
                    extant orations. But, amidst this strictness of external profession, in no place
                    was there a more entire license as to practical irreligion. Their festivals
                    abounded with rude and obscene mirth. Their drama, whilst it inculcated in
                    direct precept the belief and worship of the gods, indulged in the most profane
                    ribaldry and ludicrous representation of sacred things. Yet were these follies
                    and excesses tolerated, because under them a regard was still maintained to the
                    authority which upheld the religion, as in the “mysteries” and “moralities”
                    enacted with the connivance of the papal power in modern times; and the people
                    at large were satisfied with a religious system, which was exhibited to them as
                    so good-humoured and humane. They were tolerated, indeed, but not without the
                    like injury to the religious feelings, as in the parallel cases, where a
                    corrupted secular Christianity has ventured on the like palliations of its
                    despotism. For all the while the people were losing their hold of the popular
                    religion. Those who thought at all on the subject, either rejected it
                    altogether, or accounted it a mere matter of opinion and external ordinance;
                    whilst those, on the other hand, who were content to receive every thing
                    traditionary as divine on the mere principle of deference to the priests,
                    readily engrafted every new superstition on the received religion. Thus, whilst
                    infidelity and superstition grew up at Athens, and flourished together, and
                    often perhaps in the same mind, the connexion between religion and morality was
                    altogether lost sight of and dissolved. Men began to regard themselves as
                    devout, and friends of the gods, whilst they were committing deeds of violence
                    and lust, and blindly and wickedly endeavoured to support the cause of religion
                    by forcible suppression of the truth, and persecution of those who subjected
                    their tenets or their rites to the test of inquiry. Thus, whilst Aristophanes
                    was amusing the people, not of Athens only, but from all parts of Greece, at the
                    public festivals, with ludicrous representations of the popular theology, and
                    loosening more and more any existing associations of reverence towards the
                    objects of their worship, severe prosecutions were carried on from time to time
                    against all who in any way made religion a matter of debate, or seriously
                    brought it into question with the people. The same persons can take part in the
                    vulgar low jest, and shew their real contempt of religion by their carelessness
                    about oaths and the practical duties of religion, and yet join zealously in the
                    prosecution of offenders against established notions of religion. It is the same
                    habit of mind in both cases; a habit of looking at religion as a general rule of
                    orthodox profession,—as a rule binding on a community, and a test of its
                    soundness of doctrine,—rather than as a personal concern, and a trial of the
                    spirit of a man. “He has brought Gentiles into the temple, he has abolished
                    circumcision, he has profaned our religion,” was the outcry against St. Paul;
                    and yet these same persons thus clamorous against the apostle, were minding
                    earthly things all the while, sticklers for externals, yet idolaters in their
                    personal religion, as men of covetousness, and slaves to the appetites of the
                    body.</p>
                <p>At Athens, accordingly, though there was no freedom of religious opinion, the
                    religion might be employed to excite festive mirth, and gratify the levity and
                    licentiousness of a dissolute yet intellectual populace, amidst the charms of
                    poetry and music and the solemn graceful dance. For then the associations of
                    deference to the mysterious agency which held together the traditions of the
                    popular creed were not violently broken asunder. There still remained in the
                    minds of the people an awe at the indefinite mystic truth, hidden under the
                    embroidered veil held before their eyes. They knew that the splendid drama of
                    religion, which at once gratified their refined intellectual taste and their
                    sensibility, was not the whole of their religion. They had also the Eleusinian
                    mysteries; rites of religion performed in secrecy, and fenced round with the
                    terror of death to him that should divulge them; delegated to a few, the
                    initiated only, and incommunicable to the vulgar; of which the popular rites
                    were but the rude symbols.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    the profane, as being merely the pantomime in which some recondite interior
                    religion was dimly and wildly shadowed. The people laughed at what they saw and
                    heard at their festivals. But amidst their laugh there was evidently a feeling
                    of awe, which subdued the luxury of their mirth; a consciousness that, whilst
                    they sportively shook the chain of their superstition, its iron entered into
                    their soul. We see, on the other hand, Aspasia, the favourite of Pericles, at
                    the time of the greatest popularity of that most popular leader, summoned before
                    the courts, to answer a charge of impiety, and scarcely defended by the
                    eloquence and the tears of Pericles himself, from the inexorable power, whose
                    vengeance she had provoked by her philosophical speculations. Protagoras,
                    admired as he was and courted at Athens for his talents in his profession of a
                    Sophist, was expelled from the city and borders of Attica by the Athenians, and
                    his books were collected by proclamation and burnt in their agora, for his
                    avowed scepticism as to the existence of the gods.<note anchored="true"

                    king-archon. As the wife of this officer of the state, she was admitted to the
                    rites of religion, and solemnly inducted into the mystic temple of Bacchus at
                    Limns. But it was unlawful for any but a true-born citizen to enter into the

                    papal inquisitors, suffered imprisonment at the hands of Athenian persecutors,
                    for having asserted the material nature of the heavenly bodies, and only escaped
                    death by the intervention of Pericles, and by exile from his adopted home. The
                    extent again, to which prosecutions for offences against the popular religion
                    could be carried at Athens, is shewn in the number of persons who were
                    imprisoned on suspicion of being implicated in the impieties charged on
                    Alcibiades, and the execution of so many, on that occasion of panic, on the
                    unsupported evidence of secret informers. Lastly, not many years before the
                    accusation of Socrates, Diagoras the Melian, and Theodorus of Cyrene, were
                    branded with the epithets of atheists; and the former was forced to fly from
                    Athens on a charge of profanation of the rites, with the price of a talent set
                    on his head for any one who should kill him. And long after the time of
                    Socrates, the same spirit subsisted to drive Aristotle from the Lyceum, and
                    later still, to intimidate the speculations of Epicurus. So strictly was the <hi
                    rend="italic">authority</hi> of the established worship guarded by a jealous and
                    watchful inquisitorial power, in a state which boasted of its perfect liberty of
                    speech, its <hi rend="italic">παρρησiα,</hi> above all others.</p>
                <p>In fact, there was no liberty of speech on this subject in Greece. Every thing
                    relating to religion was to be received as handed down from former ages; as the
                    wisdom of an immemorial antiquity, home along on the lips of the priest and the
                    prophet, or impressed on mystic rituals, the hereditary trust of sacred
                    families, or symbolized in the pomp and pageant of festivals and games, in the
                    graceful majesty of temples, and the solemn shadows of sacred groves. The inward
                    devotion of such a religion naturally took the form of silence, and reserve, and
                    awe. It was concentrated in the simple dread of profanation. The more
                    superstitious indeed a people is, the more necessary is it that the rites of
                    their religion should be strictly shut up from all inquiry, and a feeling of
                    reserve should be inculcated as essential to the religious character. It is the
                    indefiniteness of superstition that holds together the system. Let any one part
                    of the vaguely-floating system be touched too palpably, and the whole crumbles.
                    Thus it has been found, that superstition and infidelity have always gone hand
                    in hand. Diagoras was made an atheist from being at first superstitious. The
                    Athenian people, in like manner, from their superstitious character, were
                    peculiarly exposed to a reaction of impiety. And it was but a wise policy,
                    therefore, that the religion of Athens should be jealously guarded with an awe
                    forbidding all inquiry into its truth.</p>
                <p>The colloquial and lively spirit of the Athenians mitigated the intensity of this
                    feeling in the minds of the people at large; and the managers of the system were
                    fain to relieve it, by blending recreation, and mirth, and interesting
                    spectacles, with its public celebration. Grecian superstition accordingly,
                    whilst it bore the essential marks of its oriental origin, in the submissiveness
                    exacted of its votaries, and its mystic reserve, assumed also the mask of
                    cheerful expression characteristic of the genius of the people. Still we see
                    that submissiveness and that reserve strongly marked in the stern denial of the
                    right, not only of private judgment on questions of religion, but even of
                    bringing such questions at all into discussion.</p>
                <p>Now, though, as we have already observed, we cannot distinctly trace the steps by
                    which this spiritual despotism was brought to bear on Socrates, we cannot doubt
                    that his was a case which must have attracted its notice. During more than forty
                    years, Socrates had been seen at Athens, going about among all classes of the
                    people, exciting among them a spirit of moral inquiry, urging on them the
                    importance and the duty of self-knowledge, of taking no opinion on mere hearsay,
                    or indolent and self-satisfied trust, but of bringing every thing to the test of
                    discussion and learning, of acquainting themselves, as their first step to
                    knowledge, with the depth and extent of their ignorance. Observers saw in this
                    extraordinary teacher, one of their own citizens, educated in their own
                    institutions, familiar with the habits of Athenian life, ever at home among
                    themselves, recommending himself alike to the young and the old, by the honest
                    though quaint dignity of his manner, and the interest and charm of his
                    conversation. He was not, like Anaxagoras, or Protagoras, or Prodicus, a
                    stranger sojourning among them; a philosopher or rhetorician by profession, or
                    one pursuing philosophy as a trade and a source of subsistence, waiting to be
                    resorted to and courted by the affluent and noble, and reserving himself for
                    occasions of display or profit; but he was found, an Athenian among Athenians,
                    in the market place, in the streets, in the work-shops, at the tables of the
                    wealthy, himself seeking out persons to instruct, asking questions of all around
                    him, and engaging them, even in spite of themselves, in conversation with
                    him.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Plato, Euthyphro. 3

                    spoken, according to the observation already made, as from an oracular shrine,
                    to those only who came to inquire of it as votaries and disciples. With
                    Socrates, philosophy walked abroad, insinuating itself into the scenes and
                    business of daily life, and drawing forth the secret treasures of men’s minds
                    with its own hands. According to that homely but apt illustration of his mode of
                    teaching, which he was so fond of employing, from midwifery,<pb break="no"

                    his method freely offered its services in assisting at the birth of the thought
                    with which the pregnant mind was labouring. He busied himself, he used to say,
                    with the officiousness of his maternal art, in exploring the genuineness of the
                    fruit of the intellectual womb, which his dexterous questions had brought to
                    light.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See especially
                    Plato’s Theaetetus in illustration of this.</p></note> Such a person then could
                    not but fix on himself the eyes of every attentive observer of the state of
                    society in Athens. Such teaching evidently could not but have a very
                    considerable influence on public opinion. Particularly when he was seen to be
                    acceptable to men of all parties in the state, to the leaders of the
                    aristocratic faction as well as the humblest citizen, it could not but be
                    inferred that his influence was not a transitory one, dependent on the
                    predominance of any party, but that it would reach to the fundamental
                    constitution of the society at large of the city, and be a leaven of
                    fermentation to the whole mass. What, then, it would naturally be asked, must be
                    the effect of such a teacher on existing opinions in religion? He taught,
                    indeed, that men should acquiesce in what was established in religion; that they
                    should inquire no further here than what simply was the law of the state. He
                    treated, too, the popular imagery of religion with respect. For he would often
                    clothe his instructions in the language of the legends and traditions of their
                    mythology. Nor did he attempt to explain them away, though he waived all
                    discussion of them. He was seen, too, on all stated occasions, sacrificing at
                    the altars of the gods, and joining in the rites.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Plato, Eιιthyphr. <hi rend="subscript">
                    l</hi> pp. 11-13, and Phaedrus.</p></note> But, it would be asked, if the
                    citizens were taught to examine into received opinions generally, would they
                    abstain from carrying this principle into the subject of religion? Would they
                    continue still blindly and submissively to follow the voice of authority? Would
                    they not rather, so far as they were disciples of Socrates, begin to speculate
                    on divine things, abandoning that reverence which they had hitherto maintained
                    for the objects of public worship, disputing and discussing without reserve, and
                    exposing to the vulgar gaze what had been all along venerated in mystic silence,
                    and under the veil of symbol? The mercurial temperament of the Athenian was just
                    the soil in which the seeds now scattered by the hand of Socrates might be
                    exacted to vegetate. The excessive prosperity, too, of Athens, during the fifty
                    years immediately following the Persian war, and then its condition of struggle
                    against internal faction and tl&gt;e confederate arms of Peloponnesus, were
                    circumstances calculated to foster the profane irreligious spirit in a
                    light-hearted people. Then, instances were not wanting of young men, the
                    intimates of Socrates, and whose minds had been especially cultivated by
                    conversation with him, who proved in the end traitors to the religion, as well
                    as to the civil liberties of their country. Critias,<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Critias is placed by Sextus Empiricus among
                    the atheists. He is said to have resolved all religion into the enactments of
                    legislators providing against the secret commission of crimes, by inculcating
                    the all-seeing power of the gods. He gives also several lines from a poem of
                    Critias to this effect. Adv. Math. lib. viii. p. 318.</p></note> afterwards one
                    of the thirty tyrants, and Alcibiades, at once the pride and the pest of his
                    fellow-citizens, whom they loved and hated, and banished and longed for by
                    turns, were striking evidences to the superficial observation of the evil
                    apprehended from the teaching of Socrates. For here were young men of genius,
                    susceptible by nature of the fullest influence of the lessons of the
                    philosopher. And yet these had failed under his hands. What, therefore, might
                    not be expected of minds of inferior order? How would not the religion and the
                    institutions of the city fall into profane neglect and contempt, should the
                    Socratic spirit of inquiry be imbibed by the next generation of citizens? The
                    observation, indeed, was only a very superficial one, which would infer from
                    such instances the evil of the teaching which these individuals misapplied.
                    Still it is plain, that such cases were pointed at with invidious reference to
                    Socrates and philosophy in general. We find the orator Aeschines attributing the
                    death of Socrates to the circumstance of his having educated Critias;<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Aescbin. con.
                    Timarch.</p></note> * not that he must be supposed to have believed this to have
                    been the whole account of the trial and condemnation of Socrates; but as an
                    orator, he states for the purposes of his argument, what he conceives would be
                    readily believed as part of the account of that event. Plato also studiously
                    addresses himself to the defence of philosophy, from objection on this ground,
                    with evident allusion to Alcibiades and the like cases; arguing that the same
                    individuals who were most susceptible of the good of philosophy, were also such
                    as would be the most apt to abuse it. And probably he had the same design, and
                    refers to the degenerate sons of Pericles himself, as an instance in point to
                    those who cherished the memory of that great man, and of the times in which he
                    flourished, to show that the philosopher was not to be held responsible for the
                    extravagances and vices of the disciple.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                <p>The exhibition of the comedy of “The Clouds,” appears to have been designed to
                    bring before the people the supposed evil tendency of the teaching of Socrates,
                    as exemplified in such distinguished instances. It was produced in the year <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b c.</hi> 423, when the philosopher had attained his
                    forty-seventh year, and was at the height of his reputation throughout Greece,
                    and about twenty-three years before his death. There we have Socrates introduced
                    by name under broad caricature, as the representative of the class of sophists,
                    and a consummate master of the arrogant pretension, and sordid cunning, and
                    impiety of the class. The clouds are his only divinities. A profligate
                    spendthrift youth, and a dotard father, are his dupes. The inquisitive method
                    which Socrates practised, is also held up to ridicule and contempt, by
                    identifying it with the frivolous questionings of the grammarians, and
                    dialecticians, and rhetoricians of the day, and with the perverse sophistry
                    which held truth a matter of indifference, or, which amounted to the same thing,
                    called every man’s opinion truth, and boasted of its skill to make the worse
                    appear the better cause. It was but too evident to Athenian spectators at least,
                    that the Socrates of Aristophanes was not the Socrates whom they had been
                    accustomed to see and converse with in real life. And the play accordingly
                    failed at the first exhibition. Not all its charms of poetry, and humour, and
                    skilful composition, could obtain for it a favourable reception. Though
                    Aristophanes was aware that the portrait which he had drawn, was not a portrait
                    of the individual, but of the class, there can be little doubt, that he
                    calculated on the sympathy of the people, in giving the name of Socrates to his
                    personification of the sophistical spirit; and that he felt it necessary to
                    depreciate the influence of Socrates as the commanding influence of the day, by
                    attributing to his method all the vices of the schools of the sophists. Socrates
                    is honoured and complimented in the very attempt to weaken the respect for his
                    instructions, and to awaken a clamour against him. The failure of “The Clouds,”
                    at the first representation, and one account adds, even at the second, (for the
                    play is said to have been retouched for the third time), has<pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:chi.28490924&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=516" xml:id="kp-eb0720-0516-0450"/>
                    been attributed to the influence of Alcibiades. Alcibiades indeed has been
                    supposed by some commentators to have been no less the object of attack in the
                    play than Socrates himself, and to have been designated under the name of
                    Phidippides, the youthful and accomplished victim of the sophist. There are
                    certainly some traits in the character of Phidippides, which would seem to point
                    at Alcibiades, whom perhaps the poet, bold as he was, could hardly venture to
                    bring on the stage by name or closer description at this particular time. And we
                    may perhaps justly allow some weight to party influence in neutralizing the
                    effect of “The Clouds” at its first exhibition. Still, when we observe in other
                    instances the great power which the comic muse could wield against a political
                    opponent, as in the attack on Cleon in “The Knights,” we cannot but think that
                    there was some strong countervailing feeling in the estimation of Socrates
                    himself. If the account of Aelian be true, Socrates could join in the laugh
                    raised against him; for he was present in the theatre during the acting of the
                    play, and finding that he was the object of attraction, placed himself where all
                    could command a view of him.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Aelian, Var. Hist.</p></note> He knew, and every one in
                    Athens knew, that he was a very different person from the sophists with whom the
                    play identified him. They indeed were corrupters of the young; for they
                    unsettled every established principle in the minds of the young, and gave no
                    substitute for what they profligately swept away. They left the young to be
                    drifted away by the tide of their passions, with no criterion of truth or of
                    right beyond the present opinion or the present interest. But Socrates, whilst
                    he taught the young to inquire into the truth of their opinions, lessened their
                    presumption and self-confidence, by shewing them how apt they were to mistake
                    mere assumptions for knowledge, and to be conceited of their ignorance. His
                    object was truth, and accurate knowledge. He stated difficulties and objections,
                    but not in the spirit of a sceptic, but in order to awaken curiosity, to clear
                    away confusion of thought, and inculcate sound principles of judgment and
                    conduct. He could well then laugh at the jest which glanced from him to its
                    proper objects, the sophists themselves, the very persons against whom his whole
                    teaching was directed. He felt doubtless that he had a hold on the people at
                    large, which the sophists had not. They were for the most part known only to the
                    great and wealthy; those who could receive them into their houses, as they went
                    from city to city through Greece; who sought their society as patrons of
                    literature, or aspirants after political distinction, and who could pay for
                    their instructions.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>’

                    contrary was accessible to all. He would receive no money from any one. He was
                    the frequent guest of the rich; but he was no less the associate of the artizan
                    and the poor. And too many must have been present in the theatre, when the
                    Socrates of “The Clouds” was amusing the audience by his sleight-of-hand
                    philosophy, who would remember the real Socrates as a man of honesty, and truth,
                    and disinterested benevolence, from whom they had received much useful counsel
                    from time to time, and whom they had ever found affable, and at leisure to enter
                    into their feelings and views with patience and kindness. If we compare the
                    Socrates of the Memorabilia of Xenophon with the Socrates of “The Clouds,” we
                    may judge how great was the contrast to those who compared the well-known
                    philosopher of the agora with his portrait as drawn by Aristophanes. If we can
                    smile at the caricature of “The Clouds,” and yet love the excellent moralist of
                    the Memorabilia, we may also conceive how harmless the satire of Aristophanes
                    would really be against the object of it; whilst the jokes of the poet, true as
                    to the personal peculiarities of the philosopher, amused a volatile and clever
                    people. For them to have confounded Socrates with the class of sophists, would
                    have been in them the like palpable mistake, as it would be to confound the
                    philosopher Bacon, on account of some points of resemblance, with the alchemist
                    and empiric of the preceding ages.</p>
                <p>It might seem matter of reproach against Aristophanes, that, in selecting the
                    name of Socrates to represent the sophistical spirit which had then so largely
                    corrupted the education and the government of Athens, he pointed the shafts of
                    the comic muse against the very person who was in truth its most successful
                    antagonist. In such a view of the case, however, sufficient justice would not be
                    done to the discernment of the poet. He shrewdly observed in Socrates the master
                    genius which would ultimately cast into the shade all those busy professors of
                    the art of education, who, under the name of sophists, or professors of all
                    knowledge, were then attracting the notice of the world to themselves and their
                    doctines. Socrates, in himself, Aristophanes could not but admire and recommend
                    to the imitation of his country. He doubtless knew Socrates to be a true patriot
                    no less than himself,—to be steadily aiming to bring back the Athenians to the
                    purity of their institutions, from which they had so sadly degenerated, by his
                    instructive conversations, as he was by the satirical strokes of the drama.
                    Socrates, too, appears to have been his personal friend; for Plato introduces
                    them in his Banquet as meeting on terms of intimacy, about the very time of the
                    exhibition of “The Clouds.” But with that freedom which the state of manners,
                    under an absolute democracy, sanctioned and encouraged, Aristophanes did not
                    scruple to bring even the revered name of Socrates on the stage, to give the due
                    point to his satire. He overlooked the individual, the Socrates with whom he
                    familiarly conversed, and presented before the spectators what he saw in
                    Socrates, the living speaking impersonation of the influence of education on the
                    character of a people, for good or for evil. Anaxagoras, or Protagoras, or
                    Prodicus, or any other of the well-known philosophers or sophists of the day,
                    might have occupied the foreground in the comedy of “The Clouds ;” had the poet
                    sought to give merely a fugitive sketch of the sophistical spirit of his times,
                    or to single out for ridicule some of its external superficial features. This is
                    what Plato has done on many occasions, and especially in that most animated
                    picture in the dialogue entitled Protagoras, where he groups together the
                    figures of the leading sophists in such admirable relief with each other, and
                    such happy contrast with the unpretending but dignified form of his own loved
                    master and friend. Such a view, however, could not have answered the design of
                    Aristophanes in his play of “The Clouds.” His object was to seize the deep,
                    influential characters of the system of education which was then extending
                    itself throughout Greece, and especially as it was manifested at Athens, the
                    great sch∞l of all Greece. Naturally, therefore, and wisely, he fixed his eye on
                    an Athenian—and that Athenian, Socrates,—not only as the first Athenian who had
                    appeared in the office of a philosophical instructor, but who, as an Athenian,
                    gave to his lessons the character of Athenian civilization, and fitly
                    exemplified the influence of philosophical education in the hands of an
                    Athenian, and as operating on Athenians.</p>
                <p>The poet, indeed, as addressing the eye and the ear of the ordinary observer, and
                    not Athenians only, but strangers of the Grecian name from all parts, mingles
                    with his colouring some playful lights borrowed from the forms of the well-known
                    professional sophists of the day. But neither are these representations, nor the
                    allusions which he <pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:chi.28490924&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=517" xml:id="kp-eb0720-0517-0451"
                    />makes to the real eccentricities of manner and uncouthness of person in
                    Socrates, the points on which he desires to fix the attention of the theatre. It
                    is the important modification of the Athenian character, under a system of
                    education which had now reached its maturity. Under the administration of
                    Pericles, that system had already infected the policy of the state, and
                    perverted its courts of justice into sinks of corruption and oppression. Now, at
                    length, it was found domesticated at Athens in the sanctuary of private life. An
                    Athenian had appeared in the character of a professor of philosophy; and around
                    him were gathered citizens of all ranks, from the noble youth who aspired to the
                    helm of the state, and the wealthy patron of literature, to the mean artizan who
                    worked at the forge, and the drudge of the market. What was further to be
                    observed now, was, that the system came recommended by the eloquence of lively
                    and exciting conversation. And how powerful must have been such conversation, as
                    it came forth from the lips of the speaker in the elegant and terse Attic idiom!
                    It was no wonder, therefore, that the comic poet should have seized this moment
                    for portraying the danger which he anticipated to his country from the
                    fashionable education of the day, and thrown all the force of his ridicule on
                    the most attractive form in which it then presented itself, as displayed in the
                    personal teaching and example of Socrates.</p>
                <p>The testimony of Plato is to the same effect. Plato has not given us an exact
                    portrait of Socrates any more than Aristophanes has; for he has evidently
                    transferred to the Socrates of his Dialogues, not less of his own cast of mind
                    and manner, than Aristophanes did to the Socrates of his comedy, of the general
                    tone of the sophists. And this is to be accounted for, as in the case of
                    Aristophanes, from the fact, that Plato regarded Socrates as the impersonation
                    of the philosophy of the times. He felt that, to give his own doctrines a proper
                    authority and weight, he could not employ a more effectual organ than the tongue
                    of him who had first given to philosophy an Attic expression, and from whom it
                    would henceforth derive its proper Grecian character.</p>
                <p>But though the drama of “The Clouds” was unsuccessful as an attack on Socrates,
                    if it were intended as such, or as an attack on the sophists under the name of
                    Socrates, which is the more probable view of its design, it must not be supposed
                    that the play produced no effect unfavourable to Socrates. The tradition, that
                    Aristophanes was employed by Anytus and Melitus to write down Socrates, does not
                    seem altogether without reason; though it can hardly be literally true, when we
                    look to the distance of time which intervened between the production of the play
                    and the accusation. In the <hi rend="italic">Apology</hi> of Plato there is an
                    allusion to the prejudice excited in the young men by the representation given
                    of the philosopher in this play. Nor had “The Clouds” been the only attack on
                    Socrates by Aristophanes; not to mention other comic writers who had made him
                    the object of their humour. In the year 405, not more than five years before the
                    prosecution, the play of “The Frogs” had been exhibited, in which a pointed
                    allusion is made to the influence of Socrates in terms of reprobation.<note

                    play of “The Birds” was produced in the middle of this interval between “The
                    Clouds” and “The Frogs,” in the year 414; and in that again the Athenians are
                    warned against the corruptions and enchantments of the philosopher.<note

                    formal accusation of Socrates, might have received their earliest prejudices
                    against the philosopher by what they heard in the theatre then,.—prejudices,
                    too, which the course of events, the miseries of the Peloponnesian war, and the
                    anarchy consequent upon it, may have ripened into exasperation.<note

                    For they saw their country fallen from its proud station in Greece, to the

                    to a change of habits since the days of Marathon and Salamis,—to their having
                    deserted the palaestra and the field, and become, from a body of devoted

                    he expresses his wonder how the state ever began to decline. Socrates imputes
                    their degeneracy to their neglect of the institutions of their ancestors. The
                    particulars mentioned are, want of respect to elders, neglect of bodily

                    science from all parts of Greece. He had, in fact, converted Athens into a

                    had in the Academia, and Aristotle in the Lyceum ;—there might be seen around
                    him in familiar conversation, in every part of the city, day after day, the
                    statesmen, and orators, and generals of the republic,—philosophers of
                    established repute from other cities,—the sons of the noblest families of Athens
                    as well as of the humblest citizens,—and the resident foreigners and occasional
                    visitors of the city; some seeking instruction in the art of government, some
                    investigating by his guidance the chief good of man, some studying the theory of
                    eloquence and criticism, some exploring, by the light of his searching
                    questions, the depth of metaphysics, and the subtile speculations of the earlier
                    philosophers; all according to their different pursuits, and in their different
                    degrees, receiving information and general mental culture from the great
                    Athenian sage. Those who clung to the thought of Athens in its days of military
                    glory and empire, would painfully observe how great a change had taken place in
                    the internal habits of the city. Formerly it was enough for the intellectual
                    improvement of the youth, that in childhood he had the grammarian for his
                    instructor, and as he grew up to manhood, was consigned to the poets;<note

                    persons whom he invited to him. He could spend a whole day in disputing with
                    Protagoras on so subtile a question as the theory of causation;<note

                    thing tending to the development of mental energy, and such the encouragement he
                    gave to the change of taste then in progress by his own example. In the person
                    of Socrates was found the genius formed to preside over the growing taste for
                    literary and philosophical refinement, and to give it the form of an established
                    institution. What, therefore, were merely indefinite fears at the time of the
                    exhibition of “The Clouds,” assumed a more distinct character of alarm to
                    ancient prejudices within a quarter of a century afterwards. The rapidity and
                    violence of several successive revolutions of the government during the latter
                    part of that interval, further prepared the minds of the people for any sudden
                    outbreaks of party spirit, and made every man an object of suspicion to his

                    seized on the government able to retain it long on the same footing. A struggle
                    ensued; in which the individuals of contending parties only sought to provide,
                    each for his own aggrandizement and interest, or at least his own safety, under
                    the constant expectation of some counter-revolution.<note anchored="true"

                    Socrates should have succeeded before an Athenian jury at this period of morbid
                    sensitiveness of the public mind.</p>
                <p>An accusation of impiety was, we must remember, too, an accusation of a political
                    offence. A change of the popular religion was a change of the fundamental
                    constitution of a Greek state. And as in the absolute rule of a single despot,
                    so in the tyranny of a multitude, the reputation of zeal for religion is
                    studiously maintained from policy, if from no higher motive, to throw around its
                    arbitrary acts the reverence and fear due to the religious character. The
                    teaching of Socrates was indeed eminently religious, but it differed from what
                    the state regarded as such. He proved the existence of an invisible divine
                    power, wisely designing and governing all things, and inculcated the duties of
                    piety and morality as flowing from the belief of such an agency. Such clearly
                    was not the state-religion.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    religion on other grounds. A pious Athenian, and yet not pious after the manner
                    of the Athenians, was, in their view, an introducer of new gods. He might well
                    be believed to be a worshipper of the clouds and the air, when he pointed out to
                    them, that the gods would not receive the sacrifice offered by wicked men,<note

                    that even their silent counsels were not concealed from the divine cognizance,
                    and that justice was an indispensable duty of the worshipper of the gods.<note

                <p>That the accusation further should be credible, as brought in this form, is not
                    strange, when it is known that, during the Peloponnesian war, the worship of new
                    gods had been introduced into the city; as at Rome during the depression of its
                    fortunes in the first years of the second Punic war. So greatly had the
                    vicissitudes of fortune influenced the minds of men, observes Livy, describing
                    this effect,—so great was the influx of religion, and that chiefly foreign, into
                    the state,—that either the men or the gods appeared to have suddenly become
                    different.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi

                    reproof which Euripides puts into the mouth of Theseus, of the austere life of
                    Hippolytus, would seem to point at some ascetic devotees among the Athenians
                    themselves, practising a more refined and scrupulous religion, distinct from
                    that of the vulgar;</p>

                    introduction of new objects of worship, new fanatical rites, in which the women
                    chiefly officiated, and in which a gross licentiousness mingled with the gloom
                    and solemnities of barbaric superstition.</p>
                <p>Again, education was intimately connected with politics in a Grecian state. The
                    state took in hand its youthful citizens, and trained them according to its
                    peculiar institutions, and in its own spirit. At least, in all the early
                    constitutions, great attention was paid to education. Lycurgus made Sparta a
                    constant school of war to his citizens. So too Solon, though he had, with
                    greater knowledge of human nature than Lycurgus, adapted his institutions to the
                    people for whom he legislated, provided that the people should be trained to the
                    system of laws prescribed to them. But this care of the early legislators had
                    begun to be lost sight of in practice.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    Sparta it was still nominally reverenced. In Athens, an entire relaxation of the
                    educational discipline had taken place already in the time of Socrates.
                    Pericles, flattering the democratic spirit of the Athenians of his day, could
                    boast of their ease from labours and the obligation of exercises, and
                    congratulate them on the courage which they could display at the time of action,
                    without being inured beforehand by a course of hardy discipline.<note

                    But now, whilst the state was remiss in not enforcing education according to its
                    ancient system, a new system had grown up, the offspring of the luxury and
                    refinement of its days of imperial greatness. This new and unauthorized
                    education was diffused throughout the mass of the inhabitants beyond the pale of
                    the citizens. Solon’s law imposed the duties of<pb break="no"

                    the exercises on the citizens, but excluded the slaves from the gymnasium. Now
                    all classes were hearers of the philosopher; the smith, the carpenter, the
                    fuller, the dresser of leather, were engaged in discussing problems of ethics
                    and politics, no less than the high-born and wealthy citizen, and the orator,
                    and the statesman, and the general. This was an evident indication of a
                    corresponding change in the government itself a change, which really came to
                    maturity not long after the time of Socrates, when the machinery of the
                    government passed from the hands of the generals and the men of practical
                    ability, into those of the orators of the republic, and when rhetoric, or
                    oratory, became the master science, and only another name for politics.<note

                <p>Those, then, whose attention had been drawn to the person of Socrates many years
                    before, and had then only laughed at the exaggerations of the comic muse, might
                    naturally begin to suspect, in the progress of events at Athens, that there was
                    a real danger to the institutions of the country couched under the humorous mien
                    and conversation of the real Socrates. They would now, as they watched his
                    increasing influence and reputation, recal their early associations of the
                    ludicrous with the name of Socrates, not with the good humour with which they
                    were originally received, but with the undefined fears since acquired, in the
                    course of their daily observation, of one in whose hands the destinies of their
                    country seemed to be placed. They would probably then think that they had judged
                    his case too leniently before as spectators, and that they were now called upon
                    to pronounce authoritatively as judges, not so much from the representations and
                    arguments of the. accusers, as from their own experience of the great change
                    which their country had evidently undergone, and was still undergoing. Even
                    indeed at the time of trial, nearly half of the great body of jurors were in
                    favour of his acquittal; and Melitus would have failed altogether, but for the
                    speeches of Anytus and Lycon, men of popular and rhetorical powers, who
                    addressed the court in support of the charge; so strongly did the weight of his
                    personal character, and the interest which he had excited by his friendly and
                    instructive intercourse with every class of citizens, prevail in his favour.</p>
                <p>We should take into account, further, the general neutrality of Socrates on
                    questions of politics, and his decisive energy on particular political
                    occasions, in which he was called upon by the circumstances of his position to
                    take part. Both lines of conduct would create enemies. Neutrality in a state
                    distracted with parties is the most unpopular course which can be adopted;
                    however candid and reasonable the principle of such conduct may be, all parties,
                    look with jealousy at one who will not be associated with them in the guilt and
                    the danger of party-struggles. They envy him his exemption from their violence,
                    his reputation of candour, his safety under every vicissitude of
                    party-ascendancy. Corcyra, as a state, was obnoxious to the other states of
                    Greece for its neutral policy. So was the individual at Athens who kept aloof
                    from public business, amidst that restless pragmatical spirit which actuated the
                    state and its citizens. Athenians could not understand and appreciate the
                    motives of one who abstained from the public assemblies, and the courts, and the
                    theatres,—who shrank from all public offices,—was a member of no faction or
                    club,—engaged in no trade,—disregarded even his own domestic concerns,—and lived
                    a private man, where every one else was the servant of the public, busy with the
                    affairs of the state, and incessantly pushing his own interests by his political
                    activity.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>’ Thucyd. ii.

                    parties.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Plutarch,
                    Solon, 20, tom. i. p. 354, ed. Reiske.</p></note> Solon wished, to interest the
                    people in the maintenance of the constitution which he had given them; and
                    accordingly, obliged them by penalties to attend to public affairs. This was
                    evidently his reason for compelling their attendance in the assemblies and
                    courts, as also for this singular provision. The increased action of the
                    democratic spirit in the time of Socrates must have greatly fostered the opinion
                    thus declared in their ancient laws. And thus we find philosophers in general
                    held in disrepute at Athens, on account of their inactivity and unconcern in
                    public affairs. The busy sophist, the orator, and the man of the world, censured
                    them as pusillanimous, and indolent, and incapable of the duties of a citizen.
                    Some of the early philosophers, indeed, had been distinguished as statesmen, and
                    legislators, and generals. The Pythagoreans in Magna Graecia appear still to
                    have sustained this character in some measure. But now philosophers were
                    observed, for the most part, to lead a contemplative life of leisure, and to
                    present a striking contrast to the general society of Grecian states. Plato
                    takes every opportunity in his writings of defending philosophy from this
                    calumny directed against the persons of its votaries, evidently treating it as a
                    grievance which he had felt in his own case. Aristotle also indicates the
                    prevalence of the same objection against philosophers at his day, when he
                    studiously maintains that exertions of the mind in mere speculation are to be
                    regarded as even more really practical than those which are directed to external
                    results.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Aristot. Pol.

                    a puzzle to many of his contemporaries. They wondered that he should freely
                    dispense the treasures of his wisdom, and not convert' it into a marketable
                    commodity. Whilst they gave him credit for integrity, they regarded such -a
                    proceeding as mere folly.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    to qualify others for public life, without taking part in it himself, if he
                    really knew what it was to be a statesman. But he was content, in reply, to
                    point to the number whom he had laboured to render capable of public duties, as
                    a more effectual service on his part to the state, than a mere personal
                    activity.</p>
                <p>But though the general conduct of Socrates was to avoid all interference in
                    affairs of state, he had shewn on one or two very important occasions his
                    patriotic feeling, and the energy with which he could carry it into effect. He
                    had served with distinguished courage at Potidaea, Amphipolis, and Delium, as we
                    have seen; and proved himself, on those hard-fought days, one who, as Pericles
                    characterizes the Athenians, could philosophize without effeminacy, and, without
                    being inured to the dangers of the field, could brave them at the moment of
                    trial with no diminished spirit. But still greater occasions of trial were those
                    of civil exertion at home, to which he was called not long before the accusation
                    of impiety. Perhaps one of the most memorable instances of resolute firmness
                    which history presents, is to be observed in the fact, that when the uproar of
                    faction was demanding the iniquitous condemnation of the generals who commanded
                    at Arginusae, Socrates stood alone among his colleagues in office, and refused
                    to put the question to the vote, as the epistates, or superintendent of the<pb

                    the council of Five Hundred for thirty-six days of the year; fifty out of the
                    whole tribe being chosen by lot as its representatives during this period. These
                    fifty were further subdivided into tens; and each of these tens, under the name
                    of proëdri, served a week in succession, as it was allotted, until the official
                    term of the tribe was completed. Again, of these ten presidents, seven were
                    appointed by lot, to occupy the chair in succession during their week of office;
                    each one of the seven becoming in his turn epistates, or superintendent for a
                    day. The tribe Antiochis, to which Socrates belonged, happened to be the
                    presiding tribe on the occasion of the impeachment of the generals; and it came
                    to the lot of Socrates to be in the chair of office on the day when the question
                    of their condemnation was so passionately debated. The generals had nobly done
                    their duty to their country, and gained the most brilliant victory which had
                    been achieved at sea in the course of the war by the Athenian arms. But the
                    crisis was an unfortunate one for them. Athens was then on the verge of ruin.
                    The jealousy of parties was at its height. The hopelessness of recovering the
                    lost ground by military strength at this time, gave an opening and encouragement
                    to personal intrigue, and the arts of an unscrupulous diplomacy; and a victory,
                    however honourable to their arms, and hopeful as to the future, seems only to
                    have been hailed with very doubtful congratulations by the struggling factions
                    of the city; each looking at it rather as it might act for or against his
                    party,—as it might tend to the strength of his rivals or their depression,—than
                    as a great public triumph. However this may be, for the event remains a matter
                    of perplexity to the historian, the successful generals were brought to trial
                    through the treachery of their own officers, on the specious charge of having
                    neglected the collecting of the dead bodies of their men after the action.<note

                    28.</p></note> The charge was specious, because it was partly true, and was
                    attested indeed by the very officers who were sent by them on that service, and
                    who were now brought as witnesses against their commanders. It was true, so far
                    as the endeavour to collect the dead bodies had been frustrated by a violent
                    storm which followed the engagement. Still the endeavour had been made. The
                    charge was further specious, because it appealed to religious prejudices, as
                    well as to the democratic spirit. The generals seemed to have been regardless of
                    the solemn rites due to the dead, and of the persons and feelings of the lower
                    orders of the people. The occasion therefore furnished abundant topic of
                    invective to the demagogues; and their addresses too fatally succeeded in
                    obtaining an ungrateful and factious vote of death against the generals.
                    Socrates was threatened with criminal information by the orators of the people;
                    and the people themselves were urging on his assailants, and clamouring against
                    him. Still he remained unmoved, and would not put the unjust question to the
                    vote; preferring the hazard of bonds and death to himself, on the side of the
                    law and right, to a compliance with the popular will in an illegal act.<note

                    The iniquity was perpetrated ultimately in spite of his resistance; but he at
                    least did his utmost to prevent it.</p>
                <p>Such was his conduct under the ascendancy of the democratic power. Afterwards,
                    when the oligarchy was established, and the Thirty were exercising their acts of
                    cruelty and extortion without restraint, he was the first to give a check to
                    their tyranny. In their career of confiscation and blood, they marked out Leon
                    of Salamis for destruction. They conceived that the terror of their power would
                    compel even Socrates to be a ready instrument to their rapacity; and they were
                    desirous also doubtless to implicate him in the criminality of the act.
                    Accordingly, they appointed him with four others to go to Salamis, and bring
                    Leon to Athens, that he might be put to death. They were disappointed, however,
                    in their expectation, so far as they depended on Socrates as an instrument in
                    the dark deed. The order was executed, and the unhappy Leon was sacrificed to
                    their cruel avarice and fears. But Socrates had no hand in it, and resisted it
                    as far as he could. Unawed by their stern command, he said nothing, but as soon
                    as he had left the Tholus, the place where the Thirty were assembled, he left
                    his four colleagues to proceed on their bloody errand and went home. He would
                    not, indeed, have dared thus to disobey the order with impunity; he would surely
                    have felt their vengeance ;—for there is nothing that tyrants resent more than a
                    clemency volunteered by the ministers of their cruelties,<note anchored="true"

                <p>By these intrepid acts, Socrates had shewn that the philosopher, in declining the

                    ><p>Cicero, De Divin, i. 49.</p></note> so did Socrates defend philosophy in his
                    own person, and by his conduct on these great occasions, against the imputation
                    of inactivity and selfish ease. It is quite evident, too, that such a spirit as
                    that displayed in these remarkable instances, had he entered into political
                    life, would have subjected him to violent collisions with the successive leaders
                    of party at Athens. “You well know, Athenians,” are the words which Plato’s
                    “Apology” puts into his mouth, “that had I long ago attempted to take part in
                    political affairs, I should long ago have perished, and I should neither have
                    done yon any service nor myself. And be not aggrieved with me for saying the
                    truth. For there is no one of men that can be safe, in giving a spirited
                    opposition either to you or to any other popular government, and in preventing
                    the occurrence of many unjust and iniquitous things in the state; but he that
                    would in reality fight for the right, must, if he would be safe but a little
                    while, lead a private life and not engage in public business.”<note

                <p>The time, then, appears to have arrived, when the accusation was brought by
                    Melitus, for his exemplification of the truth of this observation in his own
                    person. He had hitherto avoided the impending storm by the quiet tenour of his
                    private life. But he had done enough to offend the partizans of either extreme
                    in the state. Both extremes would be united against him in their enmity to all
                    moderation; for the ascendancy of such counsels as his, would have been a
                    death-blow to their own reckless lust of power. Hence, they were readily
                    disposed to concur in sacrificing him to their mutual resentments. And we thus

                    of every poor man at Athens, no less than of the rich and noble, requited with
                    prosecution and death by those very hands conjoined in the unnatural act, which
                    each should have warded off the blow inflicted by the other. The genius of
                    Intolerance was indeed behind the scene, mixing the poisoned cup for its
                    destined victim. But the actors on the public stage of the trial were, at the
                    same time, wreaking their own vengeance on a political opponent; and the more
                    exasperated against him, in proportion as, by his imperturbable demeanour and
                    real inoffensiveness, he seemed to defy their assaults, and to throw them back
                    on the consciousness of their injustice and ingratitude towards him.</p>
                <p>Nor can there be any doubt, that there were many individuals, whose pride he had
                    hurt, whose ignorance he had exposed, whose ill-humour he bad irritated, and
                    who, such is the infirmity of human nature, would rejoice in the opportunity of
                    revenge by the verdict of a public condemnation of his doctrine. In affronting
                    the sophists by his free discussions of their pretensions, he had excited,
                    doubtless, the hostility of many of the higher order of citizens, their patrons
                    and disciples. Many fathers of families too must then have been suffering from
                    that corruption of public morals which, under the teaching of the sophists, had
                    clothed itself with plausibilities of argument, and impudently arrogated, for
                    its vain pretensions, the importance of philosophy. Disobedient, profligate
                    sons, lifting their hands against their fathers, and adding bitterness to their
                    unnatural rebellion, by the hollow false-hearted principles upon which they had
                    learned to justify it,—forward, petulant youths, insulting the dignity of age by
                    their pretensions to superior wisdom, and their turbulence,—these were the
                    fruits of sophistical education, which came home to every family at Athens. Few
                    that felt the evil in their own homes, would stop to inquire whether Socrates
                    was the teacher whom they had to blame for their suffering. Most would hastily
                    conclude, that all such instruction of the young was pernicious, and their
                    offence at the mischievous doctrine of the sophists would become a disgust to
                    philosophy and philosophers.</p>
                <p>Some, indeed, would distinctly trace to Socrates the annoyance which they had
                    experienced from particular individuals. There were many who had frequented the
                    society of Socrates, with no sincere intention of profiting by his lessons,—who
                    observed his inquisitive manner, and its effect in convicting and refuting the
                    errors of those with whom he conversed, and who endeavoured, for their own
                    wanton gratification, to imitate him in their intercourse with others. These
                    would take delight in confounding and perplexing others, and exposing and
                    ridiculing their pretensions to wisdom. It is easy to conceive, that the
                    superficial resemblance to the manner of Socrates in these persons, and the
                    vexation produced by it, would excite angry objection against the real method of
                    Socrates.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Xenophon

                    affront.</p></note> These persons would be pointed at as his disciples. These
                    would be referred to as instances of the evil tendency of the teaching of the
                    philosopher himself; the discredit of the spurious disciples being reflected on
                    the master, to whom it belonged not in any degree.</p>
                <p>It appears, further, as might have been expected, that the doctrines of Socrates
                    were studiously misrepresented at the time. Allusions or illustrations employed
                    by him in his reasonings were construed into positive opinions on the subjects
                    to which he thus referred. For example, when, inculcating honest industry, he
                    quoted Hesiod,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Op. 311.

                    right or wrong, for the sake of gain. When he quoted from Homer the account of
                    Ulysses silencing the uproar of the people, against the practice of employing
                    worthless persons in the public service, it was represented, that he approved

                    misrepresentation), a general charge of corrupting the young was thrown out
                    against him, unsupported by any specific statements of the means of corruption
                    which he employed. As in the polemics of later days, so in the controversy
                    between Socrates and his assailants, the obloquy of general hackneyed terms of
                    reproach was resorted to as the substitute for definite grounds of imputation.
                    Thus were the off-hand allegations against all philosophers,—“that they searched
                    into the things in the air and the things under the earth, and rejected all
                    belief in the gods, and made the worse appear the better reason,”<note

                    of these charges requires to be more particularly noticed, because it has
                    reference to a peculiarity in the conduct of Socrates which gave it a colour of
                    truth.</p>
                <p>The mind of Socrates appears to have been deeply imbued with religious feeling.
                    The observation of final causes particularly excited his interest; so much so,
                    as to lead him to think that no other account should be attempted to be given of
                    the phenomena of the world, but as they are the results of a wise and benevolent
                    design. He delighted thus in contemplating every thing in a moral and religious
                    point of view. He thought that the introduction of physical and mechanical
                    causes into the study of nature, only perplexed and misled the mind. He had at
                    first been greatly attracted by the speculations of Anaxagoras. What won his
                    attention in the system of this philosopher, was its distinguished merit beyond
                    all previous systems, in assigning mind as the master principle of the universe.
                    But when he came to study the writings of Anaxagoras more closely, he was
                    grievously disappointed, and threw up the system in disgust. For he found that
                    it lost sight of the grand and true principle with which it set out, and, after
                    all, constructed the universe out of mere material and mechanical elements.<note

                    He saw, indeed, how futile, as to any real knowledge of the universe, had been
                    the inquiries of the early philosophers. As an Athenian, he participated in that
                    general prejudice against physical science, which Athenians had ignorantly
                    imbibed against all philosophy, when they characterized it as idle talk and
                    drivelling dotage. But as a genuine philosopher, in spite of his Athenian
                    prejudices, he saw and felt that there was a real moral agency pervading the
                    world; and he judged that, by observation of this, principles of real use for
                    the right direction of human life might be discovered. Tinctured too, as an
                    Athenian, with the superstition of his countrymen, and at the same time
                    correcting it by his superior judgment and feeling, he was disposed to draw
                    every phenomenon into his moral and religious theory of the universe. To stop to
                    inquire into any thing whether it might be explained on simple natural causes,
                    or to doubt its moral design, would appear to his mind as sceptical and profane.
                    Hence, we see at once displayed in him the common character of the Athenian, in
                    his dislike of physical science, and his susceptibility of superstitious
                    influences from the most trivial things; and, on the other hand, the wisdom and
                    religiousness of the true philosopher, in his constant devout disposition to
                    refer all things to a providential design and moral agency.</p>
                <p>It is well known how anxiously the heathens watched the most minute
                    circumstances, not only in their religious rites, but in the actions of daily
                    life, as intimations of the will of the gods. Not only dreams and visions, but
                    flights of birds, the meeting any particular object, sneezing, a voice, or any
                    sound, and the like trivial things, were regarded with seriousness and awe.
                    Socrates felt the mystic influence of such incidents; only he thought more
                    deeply on them than the generality, and that,—not with the vulgar emotions of
                    fear or of hope, according as the omen might be interpreted,—but with calm and
                    pious reference to the benevolent design which he attributed to them as divine
                    intimations. Further, not only did he apply this sentiment to the outward
                    circumstances of daily life; but he also took into his view the state of his own
                    mind. He conceived that he received at times mysterious signs distinctly
                    perceptible to himself, not indeed of any positive good to be expected from a
                    particular course of conduct, but of precaution,—warnings against evil
                    concerning others as well as himself. These presages he interpreted,—or others
                    perhaps, taking his account of his impressions in too literal a manner, have so
                    represented it,—as a voice addressed to him on each occasion. Instances too, are
                    alleged in which this divine voice was the means of saving him and those who
                    obeyed its direction, from danger. In the retreat of the Athenians after the
                    unfortunate battle at Delium, it is said to have prevented his taking a
                    particular road, and thus saved him, together with Alcibiades and Laches, from
                    being pursued and overtaken by the enemy; whilst others taking another way were
                    overtaken and slain.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    circumstance, according to Plutarch, was a great occasion of the fame at Athens
                    of the “demonion,”—or “genius,” as it was called by Latin writers,—of
                    Socrates.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Ibid. p.
                    299.</p></note> ’ To this voice is attributed his active devotion of his life to
                    the moral reform of his countrymen by private and personal addresses to them,
                    and his refraining at the same time from all political exertion.</p>
                <p>The name of a particular daemonion, or genius, was evidently not assigned by
                    Socrates himself to these extraordinary presages, while he confidently declared
                    their reality. It was rather the misconstruction of the vulgar, and of his
                    assailants, interpreting what he affirmed generally of divine intimations, as
                    assertions of the presence of some particular divinity ascertained by his own
                    convictions, and distinct from the gods worshipped at Athens. Heathens were
                    incapable of forming a notion of the Deity, but as a local and tutelary god.
                    They could not rise to the sublime conception of the one universal Being, <hi
                    rend="italic">το δαιμόνιον,</hi> the God in all the world, than whom there is
                    none else. In the view of Socrates, this belief in a presaging voice addressed
                    to his private ear, was nothing more than an extension of the prophetic science,
                    or divination of the heathen world, to practical purposes, and to the
                    cultivation of religious feelings.</p>
                <p>It must be remembered, that the Athenians had their augurs or prophets among the
                    regular officers of the republic, without whose presence no matter of public
                    counsel or of war was ever transacted. These were the recognized interpreters of
                    the divine will. But Socrates claimed a special authority for the presages with
                    which he was peculiarly favoured, and thus seemed to innovate on the science,
                    and encroach on the established forms, of divination. He enjoined, indeed, a
                    devout reference to the Delphic oracle, in all questions of hazardous conduct,
                    teaching that, whilst human reason was the guide in all matters of human power,
                    in those, on the contrary, which were out of human power, as the future event of
                    actions, resort should be had to every means offered for exploring the will of
                    the gods. He professed to have adopted his own course of life on the evidence of
                    such communications. He advised Xenophon to consult the Delphic oracle, as to
                    whether he should do well in accepting the invitation of Proxenus to join the
                    expedition of Cyrus.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>•

                    sources of divine information, he combined a suspicion of the pretenders to
                    prophecy, who were countenanced by the popular superstition,—the fcoμdrτ&lt;ιr

                    from observation of some passing incident, or some rapid conclusion respecting
                    the consequences of actions—a kind of intuitive judgment and forecaste, mingling
                    and confounding itself with his religious impressions,—a second hearing, as it
                    were,—a perception of a voice unperceived by the common ear, mysteriously
                    telling of danger to come from some particular course of conduct. Thus was a
                    pretext given to his enemies to say, that he introduced “new divinities ;”
                    whilst public opinion tolerated the grossest pretensions to divine revelations,
                    and a system of mercenary imposture founded on them. Public opinion upheld the
                    system of divination as it existed, with its external array of augurs, and
                    prophets, and ceremonial. Socrates, on the contrary, led every man to consult
                    the will of the Deity, not without devout preparation in the inward recesses of
                    his own mind, nor without reference to his own obedience and moral

                    introduced nothing new beyond others who, acknowledging the reality of
                    divination, make use of omens, and voices, and objects pre-<pb break="no"

                    sented on the way, and sacrifices. For these do not conceive, that the birds,
                    and the persons that meet them, know what is expedient to those who divine by
                    them, but that the gods, by means of them, signify this. And so he held.</p>
                <p>But the generality say, that they are dissuaded and persuaded by the birds, and
                    the objects that meet them; whereas Socrates spoke of it as he thought. For he
                    said that it was the Divinity, <hi rend="italic smallcaps"> to</hi><hi

                <p>But how great was the change from the practical devotion of the mind here taught
                    by Socrates, from that popularly entertained at Athens! The history of
                    divination, as it was regarded, not at Athens only, but throughout Greece, is
                    but a picture of the invidiousness and malignity of the human heart transformed
                    into attributes of the Divine Being. Let us only hear Solon, as he is described
                    by Herodotus, speaking of the Deity as a principle of envy and turbulence, and
                    as guided by no fixed course in the disposition of human affairs; and we may
                    judge what a task he had enterprized, who entered into conflict with this inward
                    and subtile idolatry of human passions, established by the heathen system of
                    divination. It was indeed teaching divinities new to Athenian ears, when
                    Socrates inculcated an inward reformation of the character of those who would
                    look for the favour of the gods, or expect a special interposition and direction
                    from the benevolent principle which guided the course of the moral world.</p>
                <p>Whereas, too, the popular divination was employed on the most trivial occasions,
                    and made the substitute for the proper exertion of men’s faculties on matters
                    cognizable by them, Socrates differed from this prevalent notion of the subject.
                    He contended, that, where the line of conduct was plain, men should use the best
                    of their judgment in acting,—that they should use their experience and reason in
                    learning what the gods had given them to learn by such means, and only have
                    resort to consultation of the Divine will by the extraordinary means of
                    divination, where the results of conduct were uncertain. Thus might he be
                    construed as dissuading men from the use of divination, when he only dissuaded
                    from an improper use of it, and exhorted to a rational activity.</p>
                <p>We may see from the story of Aristodicus of Cyme, how the practice existed among
                    the Greeks, of endeavouring to obtain from the oracles sanctions even to
                    iniquities and impieties. Aristodicus consults the oracle whether he may
                    surrender an unhappy fugitive; and the oracle permits him, dexterously
                    reproving, by the very permission, the attempt to cast the burthen of personal
                    responsibility on the oracle itself, and to cover an immoral act with the veil
                    of religious duty.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    Glaucus in Erato, c. 86. The oracles were consulted, also, on frivolous matters,
                    such as the petty thefts of Amasis. Euterpe, c. 174.</p></note> Divination, in
                    fact, was indolently resorted to in the heathen world, to relieve the mind of
                    the labour and anxiety of thought, and the searchings of conscience. And
                    Socrates addressed himself to the correction of this practice, by recommending,
                    as we have seen, exertion of the judgment, and the acquisition of information on
                    all matters within the sphere of human reason. He would thus provoke the
                    hostility of many a professed diviner, who made a trade of his art, and would
                    find individuals of this class ready to join in the outcry raised against him,
                    of innovation on the popular theology.</p>
                <p>The jealousy of the sophists in particular, the very class with whom the
                    accusation of Melitus identified him, would also swell the popular envy against
                    him on this head. For the sophists, among their pretensions, claimed to be
                    regarded as endued with a predictive sagacity, so as to be expert practical
                    guides respecting the future.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    them in this point in two ways,—both as directing persons to have recourse to
                    their own judgment, and the regular means of information on all ordinary
                    questions to which human reason was competent; and as teaching a reference to a
                    secret divine intimation on all other matters beyond the compass of man’s
                    understanding. For in both respects would the sophists find their course
                    interfered with. The use of men’s own judgment, or the appeal to the signs of
                    the Divine will, would equally lessen the value for those counsels which they
                    pretended to impart.</p>
                <p>What added still further to this invidious feeling was, that the reputation of
                    Socrates now eclipsed theirs throughout Greece. And Socrates appears himself
                    confidently to have appealed to this public estimation of his character against
                    the partial censures of his countrymen at the time of his trial. He vindicated
                    his assertion of divine intimations specially granted to him, by referring to
                    the oracle of Delphi as having honoured him with its distinct approbation.
                    Chaerephon, in the devoutness of his admiration of his master, had, on some
                    occasion, consulted the oracle respecting him, and obtained an answer that
                    Socrates was the wisest of men. The authenticity of the anecdote has been
                    questioned. But the introduction of it in the two “Apologies,”<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>• Xenoph. Apol. p. 249.
                    Plato, Apol. p. 48.</p></note> may be taken as a voucher of its substantial
                    truth. It at any rate shews the favourable opinion which had been conceived of
                    him out of Athens itself; that, as Lycurgus had been complimented by the verdict
                    of an oracle, so the same tribute of public applause might, with equal
                    probability, be assigned to Socrates.</p>
                <p>According to Laertius, the sentence of condemnation was carried by a majority
                    consisting of 281 votes. The number was little more than sufficient to decide
                    the question on that side; for it only exceeded the number of votes of acquittal
                    by three. “Had but three votes only fallen differently,” says Socrates himself,
                    in the “Apology” of Plato, <hi rend="italic">“</hi> I should have been
                    acquitted.” Nor, indeed, would Melitus alone, without the aid of Anytus and
                    Lycon, (he is made there confidently to declare) have obtained even a fifth part
                    of the votes to save him the penalty of a thousand drachmas, affixed by the law
                    to an unsustained prosecution. But when the penalty of death was further put to
                    the vote, and he was found unwilling to propose the substitution of any other
                    penalty, such as a fine or exile, but evinced his indignant contempt of their
                    unjust sentence, by asking rather, in his ironical way, instead of even a slight
                    punishment, the highest honour of the state, that of a public maintenance in the
                    Prytaneum, the multitude of the jurors was so exasperated by the unbending
                    spirit thus displayed, that eighty additional votes were given on the hostile
                    side, determining the sentence of death. So evidently was the whole case ruled
                    by passion and the arts of demagogues exciting the people to treat it as a
                    slight on their majesty, rather than as a cause in a court of justice. Otherwise
                    it could not have happened, that when the previous question of guilt had been
                    carried with nearly an equal number of dissentients, the severest penalty should
                    have obtained such an accession of voices in its favour.</p>

                    disapproved the affected artificial rhetoric of his times, and the practice of
                    appealing to the passions against the judgment of the hearer, so neither would
                    he study beforehand what he should say on the occasion of his trial. Twice had
                    he essayed (he observes to Hermogenes) to consider what he should say in his
                    defence, and as often had he been prevented by those secret divine intimations
                    to which he habitually referred his conduct.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    friends in pleading his cause. The celebrated orator Lysias composed an oration
                    for this purpose. On reading it, he expressed his admiration of it, hut declined
                    it as unsuitable to him. When Lysias wondered that he could admire it, and yet
                    say it was unsuitable, he observed, in his usual manner of illustration, by an
                    apposite case; “Would not also fine coats and shoes be unsuitable to me?” Plato,
                    however, it is said, could not be restrained from appearing in his behalf, and
                    made an effort to address the court. But the uproar was so great, that on his
                    uttering the words, “ascend the bema,” he was met with the cry, “descend,” and
                    forced to abandon the attempt.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                <p>So neither, again, would he resort to those appliances to the feelings which were
                    usual in the Athenian courts. The Athenian juryman expected that the defendant
                    should come before him in the character of a suppliant, and entreat his clemency
                    rather than claim his justice. He was to be assailed with prayers and tears, no
                    less than with arguments addressed to his understanding. But Socrates would not
                    condescend to these methods of persuasion. He would not produce his wife and
                    children in the court, to excite compassion, or bring forward his connexions and
                    friends to intercede in his behalf He felt it unbecoming in him at his age, and
                    with his reputation as a philosopher, to supplicate for his life. It would have
                    given to his whole previous demeanour the appearance of insincerity and
                    hypocrisy. It would have shewn that dread of death, against which all his
                    teaching had been directed.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    practice in the Athenian courts, to propose his own estimate of the offence.
                    Afterwards, indeed, he softened this bold vindication of his merits, by adding,
                    in the same ironical manner, that he could perhaps pay the fine of a mina of
                    silver, and would therefore fix that amount of damages; or that as Plato, Crito,
                    Critobulus, and Apollodorus, suggested the sum of thirty minae, and would he

                <p>He displayed throughout the trial, the same calm and cheerful temper which
                    characterized his ordinary behaviour. There were in his manner, even at that
                    solemn crisis, touches of the same ironical humour, the same half-earnest,
                    half-playful strokes of argumentative attack, which had given so much interest
                    and point to his daily familiar conversations; and when the trial was over, he
                    evinced no further emotion than the indignation of a sincere and honest man. at
                    the malicious and mischievous arts by which the result had been accomplished. He
                    was sustained by the consciousness that no crime had been proved against him;
                    whilst his assailants must feel the reproaches of conscience for the real im
                    piety and iniquity of which they had been guilty; some for having instigated
                    others to bear false witness against him; some for having themselves borne this
                    false witness. The disgrace of the condemnation fell not on him, he asserted,
                    but on those who had passed such a sentence. He consoled himself with the
                    thought, that it was the will of the Deity, and it was best for him now to die;
                    that, though condemned by his present judges, like another Palamedes, he should
                    receive from posterity that verdict of approbation which was withheld from

                    which I have been in the habit of troubling you, if they appear to you to
                    concern themselves either with money or any thing else in preference to virtue.
                    And if they would seem to be something when they are nothing, reproach them as I
                    do you, that they take no concern about what they ought, and think themselves to
                    be something when they are nothing. And if you do this, I shall have suffered
                    justice at your hands, both myself and my sons. But it is now time to depart;

                    observed with eye and mien and step composed, in perfect unison with his
                    previous address. On perceiving some of those who accompanied him, weeping, "
                    Why is this,” he said; “is it now that you weep? did you not long ago know,
                    that, from the moment of my birth, the sentence of death had been decreed
                    against me by nature? If, indeed, I were perishing beforehand in the midst of
                    blessings flowing in upon me, it would be plain that I and my kind friends would
                    have to grieve; but if I terminate my life at a time when troubles are expected,
                    for my part I think you ought all to be in good heart, as feeling that I am

                    unjust sentence. Acknowledging the affectionate feeling thus shewn to him in a
                    familiar manner, by passing his hand over the head of his attached disciple, he,
                    at the same time, gently reproved him, saying, “Would you then, my dear
                    Apollodorus, rather see roe dying justly than unjustly?” and smiled at the
                    question. On seeing Anytus pass by, he could not forbear, it is said, the
                    expression of a strong censure on the conduct of that individual towards his own
                    son. He foretold, what the unhappy result proved too true, that the heart of

                    commemoration, of the safe return of Theseus and his devoted companions to
                    Athens, from the fatal labyrinth of Crete, and the acquittal thenceforth of

                    of a vessel to Delos with sacrifices to Apollo, and other religious rites. When
                    the priest of Apollo had once crowned the stern of the sacred vessel with the
                    festive garland, it was not lawful to pollute the city by a public execution,
                    until the solemn pomp should have been performed, and the vessel had returned.
                    This ceremony had been performed only the day before the trial of Socrates. Thus
                    he obtained the respite of thirty days between his trial and execution.</p>
                <p>These were days of high interest and importance not only to his sorrowing
                    friends, but to the cause of that admirable practical philosophy which all his
                    previous life had inculcated. During this time he employed himself in literary
                    exercises which he had never practised before. He composed a poem in honour of
                    the god Apollo, whose festival was then in course of celebration. And feeling

                    illustrative of the serenity of his mind. Now, too, in his prison, with the
                    chains on his body, and the near prospect of a violent death, he could discourse
                    with an unanswerable cogency and eloquence of argument, of the vanity of human
                    things, and the real happiness of man, as consisting in the cultivation of the
                    spiritual and immortal principles of his nature. He had professed his whole life
                    to be a meditation or discipline of death. He now had the opportunity.—which, as
                    a philosopher, (could the voice of natural instinct have been silenced,) he
                    would most have desired,— of realizing, by his own example, that death to which
                    his thoughts and pursuits had been studiously directed. Unlike his successors in
                    the schools of the Stoics, he did not advocate a doctrine of suicide, however he
                    depreciated the importance of human life. With that good sense which restrained
                    his religion and his philosophy from running into fanaticism, he held it to be
                    impious in any one to release himself, by his own hand, from that post of duty

                    however, he had not courted death, or rashly placed himself in the way of it, he
                    felt that, in the circumstances in which he was now placed, he was called to go
                    through this last act of his philosophic profession. He seems, indeed, to have
                    rejoiced in the opportunity thus afforded him of summing up his philosophy in
                    one great principle, from which every observation and argument, in the course of
                    previous teaching, had been drawn, by demonstrating, so far as reason could
                    avail to demonstrate the fact, the absolute and eternal existence of the great
                    principles of moral truth. The occasion was one which the genius of Plato would
                    not fail to seize as most felicitous for the development of its own enthusiastic
                    and transcendental view of the philosophy of Socrates. Plato, accordingly, has,
                    in that most exquisite of his Dialogues, the Phaedo, invited us to the couch of
                    Socrates, on the last sad morning of his imprisonment, to listen to the
                    philosopher, with the chill of death almost upon him, discoursing on the
                    immortality of the soul. The affectionate and eloquent disciple doubtless shed
                    natural tears over his dying master. But he wished also to elevate his own
                    philosophy to the dignity of being the dying confession of the great sage of
                    Athens. And he wished, further, that his own philosophy should speak, as it
                    were, the funeral oration over him to whom it was indebted for its earliest
                    inspirations, and pour its own libation on his tomb. Thus he has especially
                    elaborated the last scene of his master’s life, and made us contemplate with the
                    deepest interest the death of Socrates, not only as an act of heroic
                    self-devotion and patient martyrdom to the truth, taught by the great sage
                    himself, but as a splendid episode in the dramatic development of his own
                    philosophy.</p>
                <p>During his imprisonment, Socrates was not denied the solace of receiving his
                    friends, and conversing with them day after day. Early each morning might be
                    seen a company of devoted friends, whom nothing could separate from him,
                    assembled at the hall of justice, where the trial had taken place, and which was
                    close to the prison, watching for the jailor to open the gate and admit them.
                    Being admitted, they would commonly remain with him in the prison until evening,
                    engaged in earnest and instructive conversation. His wife and children, too,
                    appear to have been constantly with him.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>&gt; Plato, Phaedo. p. 60 a. Op. i. p. 135.</p></note> He
                    was importuned by these affectionate followers to suffer them to effect his
                    escape. Crito earnestly entreated him to be allowed to execute a plan which he
                    had concerted for rescuing him. Simmias, the Theban, also brought a sum of money
                    with him to Athens for that purpose. Cebes and others were equally ready with
                    their resources. They argued, that, so far from being at a loss what to do with
                    himself out of Athens, as he had said on his trial, they could ensure him
                    friends in Thessaly, and many other places, who would most gladly welcome him,
                    and protect him. But to none of these importunities would he yield. He answered,
                    that, while he highly estimated their kindness, he was pledged to obey reason
                    only, and that he saw no ground in his present circumstances for taking a
                    different view of his case. As for the duty of providing for his children, by
                    preserving his own life,—a consideration which Crito appears to have strongly
                    pressed on him,—this was not now a matter for him to consider ;—it was for those
                    to consider, who, as his Athenian judges, treated life and death as such light
                    concerns; for his part, he must look simply to what was right or wrong to be
                    done.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Plato Crito, p.
                    48, c. Op. i. p. 111.</p></note> Thus steadily and calmly did he persevere in
                    his resolution of awaiting the utmost extremity.</p>
                <p>At length it was announced that the Theoric galley had been seen off Sunium, and
                    might very shortly be expected to arrive at Athens. Crito proceeded in anxious
                    haste to the prison, and being well-known to the jailor from his frequent visits
                    there, obtained admission at a very early hour. He found Socrates asleep, and
                    sat by him in silence, wondering to see him sleep so soundly in so much trouble,
                    until he at length awoke to receive the fatal intelligence. This he received
                    with the same composure as if it had been some ordinary communication. His only
                    answer to Crito was, that he was quite resigned to the will of the gods, if it
                    were so, but that he was persuaded by a dream, from which he had just waked,
                    that the vessel would not come that day, but the following one. His reliance on
                    dreams as divine intimations, has been already mentioned. He told Crito,
                    accordingly, of his having dreamed that a woman of noble form, clothed in white,
                    came to him and called him, and said to him in the words of Homer,<note

                    deep-soiled Pthia thou shaft come.” The event, at any rate, accorded with his
                    expectation from the dream. On the morrow the vessel reached the harbour of
                    Piraeus; and the following day was appointed for the execution.</p>
                <p>By the dawn of that day, the sorrowing party again met at the accustomed place,
                    and wore informed by the jailor, that the Eleven,—the officere who superintended
                    the public executions,—had given orders that the chains should be taken off, and
                    that Socrates should die on that day. After being kept waiting some time, they
                    went in and found the philosopher already loosed from his chains, and sitting on
                    the couch, with Xanthippe and his youngest child in her arms, by his side. By
                    his desire they conduct her home, the kind Crito<pb break="no"

                    entrusting her to the care of his attendants, amidst cries of passionate grief,
                    which had broken forth from her afresh at the sight of them now come to bid
                    their last farewell. The occasion naturally leads to the conversation which
                    follows a discussion, according to Plato, on the immortality of the
                    soul,—Socrates interrogating and arguing with all his wonted vivacity; whilst
                    the party around him answer and listen with eager interest, and, as may
                    naturally be conceived, with undescribable sensations of mingled delight and
                    pain. Crito would have dissuaded him from this exertion, for he feared, from
                    what he had been told by the executioner, that the heat of the body thus
                    produced, would add to his discomfort in his last moments, by rendering the
                    effects of the poison more lingering. He only observed, that “it mattered not;
                    the executioner should only be ready to do his duty, and mix the draught twice,
                    or even thrice over, if it should be found necessary.”<note anchored="true"

                <p>The discourse being brought to a close, he rose to proceed to the bath, as an
                    immediate preparation for his death; when Crito detained him for a while, to ask
                    his last commands about his children, or any other matter in which their
                    services might gratify him. He replied, “that he had nothing new to say beyond
                    what he had ever been saying,— that by attending to themselves, they would most
                    gratify him and his, as well as themselves, in all they might do, though they
                    might even make no promise now; but that if they neglected themselves, and were
                    unwilling to follow in the track pointed out in all that he had said to them up
                    to this last occasion, all that they could do would be of no avail, however
                    much, and however earnestly, they might promise at the present moment.”<note

                    eagerness still to do some act of kindness to his revered friend, subjoined,
                    “But in what way are we to bury you?” This mode of speaking of his burial, gives
                    occasion to a very characteristic reproof from him, of this solicitude on the
                    part of Crito. “As you please,” was his answer, “if at least you can take me,
                    and I do not escape from you.” Then gently smiling, and looking off to the
                    surrounding company, he added, “I cannot, my friends, persuade Crito, that I am
                    the Socrates that is now conversing, and ordering every thing that has been
                    said; but he thinks that I am that man whom he will shortly see a corpse, and
                    asks how you should bury me. But what I have all along been talking so much
                    about,—that when I shall have drunk the poison, I shall no longer stay with you,
                    but shall, forsooth, go away to certain felicities of the blest,—this I seem to
                    myself to have been saying in vain, whilst comforting at the same time you and
                    myself. Bail me therefore, to Crito the opposite bail to that which he bailed me
                    to the judges; for he was bail for my staying; but do you be bail for my <hi
                    rend="italic">not</hi> staying when dead, but going away; that Crito may bear it
                    more easily, and may not feel aggrieved for me, as if I were suffering something
                    dreadful, when he sees my body either burning, or being interred; nor may say at
                    the burial, that he lays out, or carries out, or inters <hi rend="italic"
                    >Socrates.</hi> For,” he continued, turning himself again to Crito, “be assured,
                    excellent Crito, that the speaking improperly is not only wrong in itself, but
                    also produces some evil in the soul. However, take courage, and say that you are
                    burying <hi rend="italic">mg body;</hi> and bury it as may be agreeable to you,
                    and in the manner you may hold most lawful.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                <p>He then went into another apartment to bathe, Crito following him, whilst the
                    rest of the party awaited his return. After bathing, he received his
                    children,—two of whom were yet little ones, the third a youth,—and the females
                    of his family. Having conversed some time with these in the presence of Crito,
                    and given them his final commands, he dismissed them, and came out again to the
                    assembled friends. This affecting interview had occupied a considerable time,
                    and when he returned, it was near sunset. He had not long sat down, when the
                    officer of the Eleven presented himself, and respectfully intimated to him that
                    the fatal moment was at hand. The noble and gentle demeanour of the philosopher
                    during his imprisonment had won upon this man; and used as he had been to the
                    scenes of execration and horror within those walls, he was struck by the
                    contrast in the case of Socrates, and bursting into tears as he gave his
                    message, turned himself away, and retired. Socrates himself was touched by this
                    demonstration of considerate feeling. He cordially returned the salutation,
                    promising <hi rend="italic">a</hi> ready compliance with the order. Then
                    addressing the company, he observed, “How courteous the man is! through all the
                    time he would come to me, and would converse with me sometimes, and was the best
                    of men; and now how generously does he weep for me!” He then called for the
                    poisoned cup. Crito’s affection would still have delayed it, for he urged that
                    the sun was not yet gone down, and that others on the like occasions had not
                    used such despatch, but had supped and drunk beforehand as they pleased.
                    Socrates answered that this might be reasonable for others; for him it was
                    reasonable not to do so; and persisted in requiring the cup to be brought. The
                    process of bruising the hemlock took some time; but at length the man who was to
                    administer the poison came with it now ready for the draught. He calmly inquired
                    what he was to do; and, being told that he was only to walk about after drinking
                    it, until he found a heaviness in the legs, and then to lie down, he took the
                    cup into his hand without the slightest change of colour or of countenance. But
                    before he put it to his lips, partly, it seems, from religious feeling, and
                    partly in humour, he further asked whether he might make a libation to any one
                    from the cup. Nor did even his usual quaint manner of putting a question, which
                    he knew would somewhat surprise the hearer, forsake him on this occasion; for he
                    looked at the man, at the same time, with that peculiar glance usual to him,
                    which his contemporaries jocosely designated by a word denoting its resemblance
                    to the manner in which the bull glares around him with the head downward.
                    Learning that the whole draught was not more than sufficient for the fatal
                    purpose, he said, “At any rate one may, and ought to pray to the gods, that the
                    migration hence to those regions may be prosperous; which indeed I do pray, and
                    so may it be!” With these words, he drank off the poison with the most perfect
                    composure and readiness.</p>
                <p>At the sight of this, the bystanders could no longer command their emotions.
                    Their tears flowed profusely. Some rose up from their seats,—Crito set the
                    example,— and covered their faces, to give vent to their sorrow. Apollodorus
                    sobbed aloud. He gently expostulated with them for this outbreak of grief,
                    saying, “What are you doing, my friends, so strangely? I indeed sent away the
                    women not least on this account, that they might not offend in such a way; for I
                    have heard that one ought to die amidst auspicious sounds: I pray you,
                    therefore, be tranquil, and bear up.” This rebuke had the effect of repressing
                    their tears. The heaviness which he had been led to expect from the working of
                    the poison now began to come on, and he left off walking, and reclined, with his
                    face upward, and covered over. The torpor gradually spread towards the upper
                    regions of the body,—the lower parts becoming, one after the other, congealed,
                    and insensible,—until it reached the heart. In this interval, he uncovered
                    himself, and said, “Crito, we owe a cock to Esculapius; pay it, I pray you, and
                    neglect it not ;” intimating probably that now all the diseases of life were
                    healed, and that he was restored to real and pure existence by the death of the
                    body. These were his last words. Crito asked whether he had any thing more to
                    say, but received no answer. There was no further indication of life,<pb

                    uncovered him, and they observed his eyes fixed; upon which Crito, faithful in
                    the last respectful attentions to his beloved friend, the now departed
                    philosopher, closed the mouth and the eyes.</p>
                <p>Thus died Socrates, when he had now completed his seventieth year, <hi

                    happy in his own estimation, and in that of his admiring disciples, in having
                    terminated his life in so glorious a manner, with unimpaired faculties of mind
                    and body, and after a defence sustained with so much truth, and justice, and

                <p>His death spread dismay at the moment among those who had been most conspicuous
                    in their attachment to the philosopher, as they naturally dreaded the
                    overflowings of that malignant spirit which had swept down their master. The
                    chief of these appear to have fled to Megara, where they could reckon on finding
                    a refuge from Athenian hostility, and a home with their fellow-disciple, the
                    friendly Euclid. It is remarkable, however, that Isocrates, timid as he was by
                    nature, should not have scrupled to remain at Athens, and to testify his
                    affectionate regret for his master, by appearing the next day in public, clothed
                    in mourning.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    the fall of its great victim, the spirit of persecution was sated for a time. An
                    act had been perpetrated, to which the eyes of all Greece would be intently
                    turned; and the greatness of the sacrifice seems at the moment to have absorbed
                    the attention of its agents and instruments, in the contemplation of it and its
                    possible effects. If we may believe the representation of subsequent writers,
                    shame and repentance soon followed the cruel act; and those who were most
                    ostensibly involved in its guilt, were either banished or sentenced to death, or
                    laid violent hands on themselves. Of the banishment of Anytus, and the death of
                    Melitus, we are told by Laertius, that Antisthenes was the immediate cause. In
                    what way he was instrumental to the death of Melitus, is not stated. But with
                    regard to Anytus, Antisthenes is said to have occasioned his banishment,
                    apparently without the intention of doing so, by a stroke of practical humour.
                    For meeting with some young men from Pontus, inquiring for Socrates, whose fame
                    had induced them to visit Athens, he conducted them to Anytus, who, as he
                    observed to them, was “wiser than Socrates upon which, the indignation of the
                    bystanders was excited, and they drove Anytus forth from the city.<note

                    retribution due to their offence, it would not follow that they suffered from
                    their countrymen on account of the part they had taken against Socrates. The
                    ascendancy of another political faction, (and Athens was ever fluctuating
                    between contending parties), would be quite sufficient to account for their
                    overthrow and desperation. On the other hand, the testimony of Plutarch is
                    explicit to the point, though he mentions no individuals by name, that the
                    sycophants who had assailed Socrates became the objects of popular hatred to
                    such a degree, that none would associate with them in any way, not even to
                    return them an answer when addressed by them, and that at last they hanged
                    themselves, being no longer able to endure the public execration.<note

                <p>This at any rate is certain, that persecution, as it ever does, overwrought its
                    part in the case of Socrates. It oppressed, indeed, the individual, but it gave
                    the seal of martyrdom to the cause in which he had been engaged. It produced a
                    temporary intimidation, under which men would hear less of the name and teaching
                    of Socrates openly avowed, but throughout which the admiration and love of the
                    heroic philosopher would be cherished in secret, and his doctrine would be
                    fostered in the shade, to appear in the sunshine of a future day. If the
                    Athenians had desired to plant the root of philosophy in their city, they could
                    not more effectually have done so, than by their violence against Socrates.
                    Such, in fact, was the result. Philosophy henceforth obtained an Athenian
                    naturalization and name; and the schools of Athens may date their period of
                    nearly a thousand years from this memorable act, which, in its intent and
                    spirit, fiercely but blindly endeavoured to extinguish there the very profession
                    of philosophy.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The

                <p>The cause, however, in which Socrates had been engaged, was too true, for any
                    opposition to it, though conducted with the greatest prudence, to have been long
                    successful. It had also already advanced too far, and interested too many
                    persons in the maintenance of it, to be put down by a sudden blow. The burning
                    of a book, or a formal condemnation of the opinions of a writer, are but futile
                    means, as experience shews, of suppressing obnoxious doctrines. How much less
                    could opposition avail, where, as in the case of Socrates, the offending
                    doctrines had been scattered over, not the pages of a book, but the strenuous
                    exertions of a long life,—already engraved in characters which no obliterating
                    hand could reach, and doubtless so worked into many a mind, as not to be
                    distinguishable from its own proper convictions,—doctrines too, so confirmed by
                    the noble example of their teacher, in carrying them out to their full
                    consequences by his death? For the death of Socrates, it should be observed, was
                    not simply a test of his sincerity in his teaching. It was this, and still more.
                    It was the ultimate and decisive opposition to those false principles, against
                    which every action and discourse of his life had been directed. He had been all
                    along exposing the presumptuousness and vanity of the principles on which men
                    ordinarily judged and acted. He was now further to shew, that this opposition on
                    his part was not to be daunted by those principles, when set in formidable array
                    against his own life; and that, professing a low estimate of the present life,
                    he would not disown or shrink from that profession at the moment of greatest
                    trial.</p>
                <p>If we inquire, accordingly, what was the substance of the positive teaching of
                    Socrates, we must address ourselves to the contemplation of his active life, and
                    his resigned patient death. He had no design of establishing philosophy as a
                    literary pursuit or intellectual pastime; though he probably foresaw, that that
                    taste for inquiry into truth which he was ever awakening, must soon lead to the
                    formation of <hi rend="italic">a</hi> philosophical literature at Athens. He
                    already witnessed, indeed, the commencement of such a literature, the result of
                    this excitement, if it be true that he had read the Lysis of Plato, and observed
                    respecting it, “How much the young man makes me say that I never said !”<note

                    others, with crude and superficial notions and principles.</p>
                <p>If we look, then, to the course of his practical teaching, —to the general tenor
                    of his conversations and actions, and the example throughout of his life and
                    death,—we shall find that his whole labour was directed to the establishment of
                    true moral and religious principles, in opposition to the false and mischievous
                    principles which, he observed, were commonly acted upon and avowed in the world.
                    The excellence and supremacy of self-knowledge was what he was ever inculcating;
                    and of self-knowledge, not as a matter of intellectual curiosity, or for its
                    value as a science, but in order to self-government and to happiness. He found
                    that this was the last kind of knowledge which men ever thought of acquiring;
                    that they had, in fact, no concern about it; or that if they were reminded of
                    its necessity, they presumed on their possession of it already. His first
                    effort, then, was to open the minds of men to a perception of the value of this
                    knowledge, and of their own need of it. The questions which he would put—the
                    refutations which he addressed to the various propositions or conclusions
                    elicited from others in the course of his conversations—the perplexities to
                    which he would reduce them—and the unsatisfied state in which he would commonly
                    leave them, after exciting their doubts—all had a direct tendency to convince
                    men of the insufficiency of their intellectual acquirements, and of their want
                    of some more adequate and availing information.<note anchored="true"

                    science, and of all merely speculative knowledge, in comparison with that which
                    was useful for human life. For he was far from an utilitarian, in the modern
                    sense of that term. He did not value particular studies, because they ministered
                    to the necessities or conveniences of human life, or undervalue them because
                    they had no such bearing. But he saw that his clever and ingenious countrymen
                    were studious of intellectual refinement—that they delighted in the specious,
                    and the admirable, and the subtile, more than in the solid and the
                    unostentatious qualifications of the good member of a private family and the
                    useful citizen. He was aware, too, from his own acquaintance with the existing
                    physical philosophy, how imperfect that knowledge was, how entirely
                    hypothetical, and incapable of practical application. We must make allowance,
                    therefore, in estimating his objection to speculative science, for the polemical
                    spirit in which he assailed a branch of knowledge then, at once, so barren, and
                    so encroaching in its claims on public attention. We must regard him as
                    preparing the way for the due cultivation of the other, the higher as well as
                    more important knowledge, that of man’s own nature, then so little thought of,
                    and so neglected. This seems to be invariably his design on every occasion,
                    whatever may be the immediate purport of his discourse.</p>
                <p>When he came to direct the minds of men, once awakened to the importance of moral
                    study, to the subject itself of human nature, he had to encounter on the very
                    threshold the most perverse notions. All their maxims of life were based on the
                    absolute importance of the present life. The body, and its present appetites and
                    desires, were regarded as the whole of man. The tyrant, in the enjoyment of
                    absolute power to gratify every passion without restriction or penalty, was
                    considered as the apt representation of the highest human felicity. All men’s
                    plans of life accordingly were directed to the acquisition of power for
                    themselves. They studied to improve their external circumstances, and not
                    themselves. Then their religion was merely the fear of mysterious powers
                    influencing the prosperous or adverse events of the present world, and which
                    were therefore to be conciliated or appeased by offerings and vows. Socrates set
                    himself strenuously to refute these vain presumptions. He argued the folly of
                    supposing, that men really accomplished their own washes in gratifying each
                    prevailing inclination. He showed, that whilst they did what they pleased at the
                    moment, they did not in fact attain that pleasure which they sought; and led
                    them therefore to surmise, that there must be some end of human pursuit beyond
                    the gratification of the passions, and further, some ultimate end to the whole
                    sum of the active energies of the soul, beyond the present life, and distinct
                    from all bodily associations. But he not only suggested such a thought by
                    shewing the reasonings on the opposite view of human life to be inconsequential
                    and absurd; he further practically refuted the prevailing fallacies on the
                    subject, by his own example on the other side. He proved to the world, by
                    divesting himself of all the worldly accessaries of happiness, and depending
                    exclusively on the internal resources of his mind and character, and by his
                    perpetual cheerfulness under those privations, that happiness did not result
                    from externals, or from the body, but from the internal nature of man, nor from
                    any thing positive and absolute in that nature, so much as from its state of
                    discipline and command over the appetites of the body. Theories of morals were
                    yet to be formed. It remained for Plato to erect the true and sublime standard
                    of human conduct in the perfections of the Divinity, and for Aristotle
                    afterwards to shew the application of the law of habits to the subject. Socrates
                    has the merit of having prepared the way for these developments of the subject,
                    by demonstrating the folly of seeking the ideal of happiness in any enjoyment of
                    the body, or in any thing present.</p>
                <p>So also as to religion, though he could not advance, in his conceptions of the
                    retributive justice of the Divine Being, beyond the circle of darkness which
                    limits the natural observation of man, he proved the absurdity of supposing that
                    mere external punishment was the only suffering undergone for offences
                    committed. Secret faults, as he pointed out, did not escape with impunity. He
                    appealed to the remorses of conscience, to shew how surely, however invisibly,
                    wrong doing was visited with its punishment; and whilst in his own mind he
                    concluded that there would be a future state, in which each man would receive
                    the merited consequences of his actions, he must also have excited, in the minds
                    of his hearers, a strong though undefined apprehension of a period of general
                    retribution after death in another world. At least they must have seen that it
                    was not so certain, as they may have once supposed, that though a present
                    punishment may have been evaded, punishment would not follow at a future day. In
                    well-disposed minds, there would thus be a foundation laid of a doctrine of the
                    immortality of the soul. Under the teaching of Socrates himself, this truth,
                    perhaps, would scarcely assume the form of a doctrine, so distinctly as it is
                    stated by Plato. It would be simply a practical conviction. And thus Socrates
                    himself probably scarcely propounded it in formal terms, nor without those
                    qualifying doubts which both his memorialists describe him as joining with its
                    enunciation. But Plato, following him, took up the doctrine as a formal truth,
                    and worked it up into a perfect theory, with the formal array of argument and
                    didactic exposition.</p>
                <p>There was nothing, indeed, of system in any part of the teaching of Socrates. In
                    the “Memorabilia” of Xenophon, we have probably a very complete specimen of the
                    substance of what he taught, and, in the desultory manner in which the subjects
                    of the several conversations there given are introduced, of the actual way in
                    which he would throw<pb break="no"

                    out his questions and reflections on different points, as they happened to
                    suggest themselves on each occasion. There we find the various duties of the
                    good man and the good citizen summarily sketched, without the formality of
                    statement or systematic connexion. He inquires what is just, or pious, or
                    temperate,—and he leads his hearers to consider the true definitions of the

                <p>Certainly there are grave objections to the morality which he taught. It did not
                    enjoin that perfect purity of sentiment and action, which, judging from its
                    general excellence, we might perhaps have expected. It forbade <hi rend="italic"

                    indulgence as altogether vicious, or fix its stigma on those monstrous forms of
                    vice which polluted Grecian society. Nor, again, did it give a right tone to the
                    resentful feelings. It enjoined the requiting of ill to enemies,—placing
                    retaliation as a duty on a par with the return of kindness to friends.<note

                    inculcated by Socrates, founded as it was on the indications in man’s nature of
                    a destiny beyond the present world, bears strongly the marks of the law written
                    by the finger of God, and proves that the Creator has not left Himself without
                    witness, where the light of his revelation has not shone. Supposing even that
                    those great truths, thus taught, were the broken planks from the wreck of a
                    primitive Faith, floated down on the stream of ages, we must yet believe a
                    providential disposition, in the fact of that ready acceptance which they could
                    obtain with one, brought up, as Socrates was, amidst the grossest corruptions of
                    heathenism. His was an instance, how the unsophisticated heart responds to the
                    notices of divine truth, when once they are duly presented to it; and how,
                    wherever there is a sincere pursuit of right, the moral eye will be enabled to
                    pierce the surrounding gloom, and to discern, for the most part, the true
                    outline and form of right.</p>
                <p>It is observable, however, that, whilst Socrates correctly perceived that the
                    laws of religion and morality possessed a sacred importance, independently of
                    all positive enactments of men, he yet appeals to the laws of the state for the
                    particular rules of religious and moral duty. When instructing Euthydemus on the
                    worship of the gods, he cites the Delphic oracle, which enjoined the law of the
                    state as the rule of acceptable worship.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Ibid. iv. 3, 16. Also, i. 3, 1.</p></note> When asked by the
                    sophist Hippias what is just, he answers, that it is what the laws prescribe.
                    Such reference was perfectly natural in a Greek, accustomed as Greeks were to
                    view every thing in subordination to politics, and to regard the duty of the
                    citizen as paramount to every other duty. This feeling had its influence with
                    Socrates, and induced him to regard the authority of the state as possessing in
                    itself a moral force of obligation. The respect which he throughout shewed to
                    the laws of his own state, was that of one who not only obeyed what they
                    commanded, but strictly referenced their authority.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See, in the “Crito " of Plato, a beautiful
                    address, put into the mouth of Socrates, from the personified majesty of the
                    laws.</p></note> We must not, however, suppose, that he thus intended to place
                    positive and moral laws on the same footing. The reference which he gives to the
                    written law of the state, as the directory on questions of religion and morals,
                    is the substitute in his teaching for a systematic development of the moral and
                    religious duties. The law of the state presented, to orte who had no thought of
                    systematizing the subject for himself, the best expression of those great truths
                    which he was drawing forth from the higher source of man’s eternal nature. He is
                    content to point out to his hearers, in a general way, the wisest and readiest
                    collection of rules for those cases which came under the great comprehensive
                    duties of piety and justice. Evidently he is not treating the subject with the
                    exactness of the theorist, in assigning this importance to the law of the state;
                    but he is enforcing the use of the law of the state as an authoritative
                    practical guide to right conduct. —His internal view of religion, for example,
                    was founded on observation of the signs of benevolent design throughout the
                    material and intellectual world; and he was thus led to the acknowledgment of a
                    pure Theism. But in his conduct, he knew not how to realize the obligations
                    which the perception of this truth imposed on him. With his reverence,
                    accordingly, for the laws of his country, as well as under the influence of that
                    superstition to which his piety habitually verged, he sought a direction to his
                    religious sentiments from the authority of the state, and thus in practice was a
                    polytheist.—His object was further to prevent men from trusting to the conceits
                    of their own judgment in matters of conduct, and to recommend a proper deference
                    to the wisdom and authority of their ancient laws, then so presumptuously
                    slighted by each vain pretender to superior prudence and political sagacity.</p>
                <p>In assailing, as Socrates did, the follies of his countrymen by the dexterity of
                    an acute reason, he was ever exposing their ignorance. The impression on his own
                    mind appears to have been, that men erred rather from the want of due
                    information respecting their moral condition, than from the perverseness of
                    their will,—from folly, rather than from vice. Himself an accurate observer of
                    human life, and with a disposition to follow the path of duty wherever it might
                    lead him, he had in his own case felt the importance of intellectual
                    cultivation, in order to right conduct. From his own circumstances, accordingly,
                    and a natural predilection for those exercises of the mind which were his
                    habitual pursuit, he overrated this importance; and, instead of simply regarding
                    the information of the mind as a necessary ingredient in moral improvement, he
                    made it all in all. Thus, according to him; wisdom or philosophy was Virtue, and
                    ignorance and folly, vice. He carried this view of morals so far, as to place
                    the knowledge of duty on a footing with the knowledge of arts. Nor was he even
                    startled with the paradox, that if such were the case—if the knowledge of right
                    were the whole of morality—there would be less immorality in intentional wrong
                    conduct, than in unintentional done through ignorance.<note anchored="true"

                    moral information for the performance of duty, refers to the same illustration
                    of morality from the arts, as that given by Xenophon, to βbew that there is no
                    real analogy between the two subjects. “Vis scire,” he says, “quam dissimilis
                    sit harum artium conditio et hujus? In illis excusatius est, voluntate peccare,
                    quam casu: in hac maxima culpa est, sponte delinquere. Quod dico tale est.
                    Grammaticus non crubescit solecismum, si sciens facit: crubescit, si nesciens.
                    Medicus, si deficere aegrum non intelligit, quantum ad artem, magis peccat, quam

                    est.” Ep. 95. 8. He seems to have had the argument of Socrates, as given by
                    Xenophon, (Mem. iv. 2, 80. ) in his view. So also Aristotle says: Kol &lt;v <hi

                    Thus vice was in no case, in the view of Socrates, an act of the will, but of
                    the mistaken judgment. He did not mean by this to assert, that men did not act
                    wrong wilfully in the particular instances of misconduct, so as not to deserve
                    blame for their misconduct; but that the seat of vice was in the perverse
                    understanding,—for that the will was invariably towards good. If, accordingly,
                    vice may be regarded as seated in the understanding, and not in the heart, it
                    would follow, that that man is less vicious in <hi rend="italic">principle,</hi>
                    who knows what is right and acts wrong, than one who acts wrong without knowing
                    what is right. The former alternative, however, was impossible, according to his
                    theory. For knowledge, by its intrinsic excellence, must prevail over every
                    other principle. So far was Socrates led by the working of his method, and his
                    observation of the ignorance and folly of men, to overlook facts, at least, as
                    evident on the other side,—the plain instances of men acting wrong in spite of
                    their better knowledge, and of greater blame assigned to wrong thus done in
                    spite of knowledge. His error is further to be traced to a confusion of the
                    ideas of right and happiness, in the term “good.” That the will is, by the
                    original constitution of man, invariably towards good, if we take good in the
                    sense of real interest or happiness, is quite true; but it is far from true, if
                    we include the notion of right in that of good. Men, when they take even
                    perverted views of their happiness, may be regarded as unconsciously desiring
                    the real happiness of their nature. The will, therefore, in this sense, may be
                    said to be always towards good. But in the latter sense of the term “good,”—that
                    in which it includes right,—the contrary rather is true. Men see the light, but
                    love darkness rather than light; and the seat of vice is, accordingly, not in
                    the understanding, but in the heart. But there is this justification of the
                    language of Socrates on moral subjects, that the ignorance which he attacked,
                    was, in truth, a vicious and blameable ignorance. Men did not take pains to
                    inform themselves on moral subjects. They neglected themselves, pursuing and
                    professing every other kind of knowledge but that which was most at hand for
                    their acquisition, and most concerned them. Seeing, then, the moral errors into
                    which men ran from this neglect, Socrates not unreasonably set his mark of
                    reprobation no ignorance, as the source of immorality. Immediately, indeed, and
                    ostensibly, he attacked the general ignorance of men, holding out philosophy as
                    the remedy of vice and unhappiness. But the ultimate and real object of his
                    attack all the while was, the immoral disposition, the self-neglect, and the
                    irregular habits of life, from which the incapacity and ignorance of men on
                    moral subjects commonly result. Then, further, it was the ignorance of self,
                    chiefly, that he laboured to remove. He found conceit as to themselves, the
                    prevailing lauft of the men of his age and country. And he hoped, by exposing
                    their ignorance on various subjects, to make them question their presumptions
                    relating to their own nature, and character, and duties. Thus would he, in
                    effect, be correcting moral error,—the folly of men persuading themselves and
                    others that they knew what they had never cared to examine, much less to
                    know.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Xenophon speaks of

                <p>As the peculiar aspect under which he presented the subject of morals arose, in a
                    great measure, from his manner of interrogating in conversation, so the general
                    character of his philosophy is to be sought in its intimate connexion with the
                    peculiar method which he pursued. His philosophy, being essentially colloquial,
                    laid down no positive principles in any particular science, or even any general
                    principles for the conduct of the understanding in scientific or moral
                    inquiries. But it sought to rouse the understanding to a perception of its
                    condition of weakness, and defects, and ignorance, previous to its interrogation
                    of itself,and its acquisition of knowledge, and its strengthening by exercise
                    and discipline. Like the great reformer of modern science, he found nothing duly
                    ascertained in the field of philosophy; hypotheses assumed without examination,
                    truth obscured and confounded under the plausible cover of general terms and
                    vague analogies. Yet every one was fully satisfied with the state of knowledge;
                    every one presumed that he was in possession of the truth. So, too, at this
                    period, as at the time when Bacon proposed his new method, there was a
                    dialectical science in use, available only for disputation and victory, and not
                    reaching the truth of things, or imparting any real knowledge. And, in like
                    manner, in the time of Socrates, as in that of Bacon, this imperfect dialectical
                    science was regarded as the key to every kind of knowledge; and he who could
                    discourse fluently on any given subject, was esteemed the accomplished
                    philosopher. “Of nothing,” as Bacon himself pointedly observes, “were men so
                    scrupulous as lest they should seem to doubt on any subject.”<note

                <p>This state of things formed a strong barrier against any attempt to effect a
                    moral reformation. The way to the heart had to be cleared through a mass of
                    outworks thrown out by the intellect. It only remained, then, for him who would
                    be the moral reformer of his countrymen, to work by means of that very
                    dialectical science which opposed its ramparts and its arms to his progress.</p>
                <p>But to have simply used the same method which his contemporaries employed, would
                    have been to revolve in the same perpetual circle. Socrates, indeed, might, by a
                    more skilful use of the same dialectical artifices, have confuted the sophists
                    and others with whom he reasoned. He might have gained the victory in argument,
                    by demonstrating the fallacy of their deductions, or proving the contradictory
                    of their conclusions. But no advance would have been made by such a proceeding
                    towards a detection of the source of the popular errors, the wrong principles
                    themselves, on which men argued and acted. To accomplish this object, then,—to
                    expose the fallacy of wrong principles, —he had to exalt the art of the
                    dialectician to a higher function than that of merely eliciting consequences
                    from given principles.</p>
                <p>This attempt accordingly he made. Without instituting any formal method, or
                    teaching any art of discourse,—without, it seems, having any such design in his
                    thoughts,—he yet so far gave a new direction and impulse to dialectical science,
                    as to render it in some measure at least subservient to the investigation of
                    truth. In his hands, it served, if it did nothing more, to raise <hi
                    rend="italic">doubts</hi> as to the truth of erroneous principles which before
                    had passed without question, and which the very practice of reasoning from them
                    as axioms, had tended to confirm as fixed and indisputable standards of all
                    other truths.</p>
                <p>We must not suppose, that definition and induction were unknown as parts of
                    dialectics before Socrates; or that Socrates was absolutely the first to
                    discover and propound their nature and use. The expressions of Aristotle might
                    suggest this supposition. For he says particularly, that there were two things
                    which one might ascribe to Socrates, Definition, and Inductive Reasoning.<note

                    applied them to limit the vague notions entertained about matters of practical
                    concern, and to bring opinions into harmony with ordinary experience. To the
                    dialecticians before him, Definition and Induction were the commencement of
                    their discussions. They unsuspectingly presumed on the logical processes
                    involved in these instruments of discourse, as already sufficiently
                    accomplished. They attempted, indeed, to define; but they took such definitions
                    as they found at hand,—of course the most superficial.<note anchored="true"

                    And the rest of their discourse proceeded from these crude and unscientific
                    elements. But Socrates did not profess to give definitions, or to have arrived

                    When pressed, as by the sophist Hippias, to give his own account of the

                    point, and recurs to his established way of proceeding by interrogatories.<note

                    definition of the subject under discussion. He presents it as the end to be
                    attained by the whole discussion; leading the person questioned from point to
                    point, until he brings him close to the true and exact idea of the subject. So
                    also does he employ Induction. He cites some instance,—commonly some coarse and
                    very familiar one, from the workshop of the smith or the shoemaker, or from the
                    culinary art, and the like,—as apposite to the point under debate; and thus
                    brings the principle itself, on which the dispute turns, to the test of actual
                    experience. This was so much his manner, that it was made a standing jest by
                    those against whom he so triumphantly employed it. They complained of his ever
                    repeating the same thing; ever talking of “carpenters, and smiths, and fullers,
                    and cooks, and such like nonsense.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    the point and force of his reasonings. He replied, that about the same things,
                    he must persist in saying the same things; unless it could be shewn, that a
                    person being asked, whether twice five were ten, should answer differently at
                    different times.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi

                    his well-known illustrations from common life, hackneyed as they were in his own
                    use, and low and trifling as they might seem.</p>
                <p>From this his constant practice of bringing men to the test of definition and

                    Thirty as the teacher of an “art of discourse,” and as therefore obnoxious to a
                    law which they had made (chiefly with a view to him), forbidding the teaching of
                    such an art.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Xenoph.
                    Mem. i. 2. 31. 3.—Aristid. t. ii. p. 248.</p></note> Such a restriction,
                    however, could not apply to Socrates; since, as we have seen, he professed no
                    art; he imparted no method of argument; and, to have silenced him, they must, as
                    he shewed them, have absolutely prevented his asking the most simple and
                    familiar question. Here it was the point of an apt illustration that had
                    provoked this sally of resentment from Critias and Charicles, two of the Thirty.
                    It had been reported to them that he had drawn attention to their acts of
                    violence, by asking, what would be thought of the herdsman under whose care an
                    herd should be diminished. On this occasion, Charicles, after vainly
                    remonstrating with him against the practice of his daily conversations, shewed
                    the point of the illustration, by bidding him beware lest he also should make
                    the number of the herd still less.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Xenoph. Mem. i. 2. 37.</p></note></p>
                <p>So far, indeed, was Socrates from instituting any method either of argument or of
                    investigation, that the very definitions and instances which he employed were of
                    a popular character, adapted for refutation of error rather than for conviction
                    of the truth,—such as to place difficulties in the way of a dogmatic opponent,
                    rather than didactic illustrations of any particular subject. He was engaged in
                    repelling dogmatism. And nothing is of more avail for this purpose than
                    analogies; such instances, that is, as test the truth of an assumption in one
                    case, by its application to another of the same kind. Direct instances, shewing
                    experimentally the truth or falsehood of an assumption, may be difficult to be
                    found; and, in their use, they require a particular acquaintance with the
                    subject itself, in order that their application may be seen. For example, if it
                    were desired to expose a false theory of government, some fact of history must
                    be adduced, and its bearing on the theory in question must be distinctly pointed
                    out. But an analogous instance does not require this intimate acquaintance with
                    the subject itself, in illustration of which it is brought. It shews at once
                    that a given hypothesis is either tenable, or not tenable,—that it is verified
                    or not verified in some parallel case, and therefore may be granted or not, in
                    the subject about which the argument is. Only it is necessary, for this purpose,
                    that the analogous instance should be a familiar one,—that the exhibition of the
                    principle in question should be clear and striking in the instances adduced. For
                    example, to set forth the evil of tyranny, it would be quite enough to point
                    out, as Socrates did, the case of a herdsman under whose keeping an herd should
                    be deteriorated; and the inference would be immediate, that a career of
                    confiscation and blood was no evidence of a good government. Again, whether it
                    were wise to choose magistrates by lot, would be a difficult question to be
                    decided by the direct evidence of facts bearing on the point. But when Socrates
                    referred to the absurdity of appointing a steersman by lot, it was at once
                    evident, that there were cases in which this mode of appointing important
                    officers of the state would be mischievous. Such then was the kind of evidence
                    which Socrates was constantly adducing from analogous instances to the point in
                    question ;—an evidence, not conveying any positive instruction in the theories
                    of the subjects to which it was applied; but removing false impressions
                    respecting them, and opening the mind to the reception of the truth. It was an
                    admirable method of unteaching prejudices or vain assumptions, and of silencing
                    the dogmatist,—a method, powerful at once for the refutation of error, and the
                    conviction of ordinary minds incapable of being instructed by a more direct and
                    positive evidence. Such, accordingly, was the method practised by Socrates. In
                    pursuing any argument, “he would proceed,” as Xenophon observes, “by the most
                    admitted principles; considering this to be the sound basis of discussion. And
                    therefore,” adds Xenophon, “he, far beyond all I ever knew, when he spoke,
                    carried conviction to his hearers ;” and he would say, “that Homer had ascribed
                    to Ulysses the merit of being a sound orator, on account of his ability to
                    conduct a discussion, by reasoning from such principles as men
                    acknowledged.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Ibid. iv.
                    6. 15.</p></note></p>
                <p>It was seldom, however, if ever, that Socrates avowedly<pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:chi.28490924&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=532" xml:id="kp-eb0720-0532-0466"/>
                    argued a point. Professing to know nothing himself, he constantly challenged
                    others as to what they professed to know. He put his questions to each person
                    with whom he conversed, very much as the skilful experimenter in these days does
                    to nature, so as to lead to the affirmative or negative of a particular
                    hypothesis whose truth he would investigate. Having obtained an answer, he
                    proceeds analytically, to found on that another question, studiously directed,
                    in like manner, to elicit the answer which might serve for further inquiry, and
                    so on, until he has reduced the first proposition to some simple elements,
                    clearly shewing the truth or falsehood of the original assumption. It was as
                    truly an experimental process on men’s minds, as that which the modern
                    investigator performs on the subject which he examines. Those analogical
                    instances in which he so much delighted, served the purpose of this analysis, no
                    less than direct and proper instances, such as belong to him who investigates
                    experimentally the nature of a particular subject. For analogies detect the
                    state of the mind to which they are addressed. They at once call forth and
                    illustrate its principles and habits of thought, and enable the experimenter to
                    avail himself of the existing resources in that mind for effecting the desired
                    conviction. They furnish him with a clue to the course which he should follow in
                    carrying on his analysis. This was that midwifery of the mind which Socrates
                    used sportively to describe as his peculiar occupation.</p>
                <p>In his conversation, for example, with Euthydemus, who prided himself in having
                    cultivated his mind by his own independent study of books, of which he had
                    formed a large collection,—he first drew attention to the singularity of the
                    young man’s conceit, by representing him as coming before the public, with high
                    professions of being self-taught, and putting the parallel case of a candidate
                    tor some medical office, who should announce that he had studiously avoided even
                    the appearance of having <hi rend="italic">learned</hi> the art of medicine, and
                    ask for the office on the promise of endeavouring to learn the art by his future
                    practice. Interest being excited by this illustration of the absurdity, he next
                    led his hearers to see the absurdity of entering on political affairs without
                    preparation, by referring to the fact of the severe application and discipline
                    undergone by persons who seek reputation in such accomplishments as
                    flute-playing or riding. Then, having gained over Euthydemus as a more willing
                    listener, he proceeds to question him as to the use for which he had collected
                    so many books. He throws out the presumption that they have been collected with
                    a view to enrich the mind with virtue. Supposing this to be granted, he goes on
                    to interrogate Euthydemus as to the particular excellence of which he is in
                    quest. He enumerates several particulars; and these being rejected, he comes at
                    last to excellence in the art of government, which the young man concedes to be
                    the object of his desire. This gives an opening to inquire into the
                    qualifications necessary for such excellence. He discovers, by the answers of
                    Euthydemus, that he conceives himself master of those moral virtues which he is
                    induced to admit are indispensable to the good citizen. By a series of
                    questions, however, relating to particular actions, he forces Euthydemus to
                    admit, that what is just in one case, is unjust in another, and to contradict
                    himself in his successive statements as to the comparative criminality of
                    voluntary and involuntary acts of injustice. What, then, triumphantly asks the
                    philosopher, think you of a person who is so inconsistent with himself? The
                    conclusion is inevitable; and Euthydemus is constrained to own, that “he knew
                    not what he thought he knew.” But Socrates, not yet satisfied, presses him
                    further to explain his notion of that ignorance which he had thus displayed; and
                    finds, that notwithstanding his confession of his want of right instruction, he
                    yet presumes on his pos session of self-knowledge. Another question forces him
                    to abandon this position. The young man then asks to be only put in the way of
                    self-examination. Here at once his false presumptions are exposed to the
                    searching analysis of Socrates. The inquiry turns on a knowledge of the goods
                    and evil of life. Euthydemus enumerates one thing after another as good; and
                    Socrates immediately subjoins some counter evil as attending it; until
                    Euthydemus at last gives up his confidence in his own opinion, and declares that
                    he knows not now what he ought to pray for to the gods. Again, Socrates presents
                    before him pointedly the evidence he had thus given of having been diverted from
                    consideration of the subject by the strong presumption of his knowledge of it.
                    But that he may leave no room for escape, he calls on him, in conclusion, to
                    state his opinion as to the nature of democracy, which at least, he conceived,
                    Enthydemus, as a candidate for public office in a popular state, must have
                    studied. And in like manner, he extorts from his successive answers a further
                    proof of his ignorance and incompetence to the duties for which he had designed
                    himself.</p>
                <p>The effect thus produced is what Plato compares to the numbing touch of the
                    torpedo.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Plato, Meno.,
                    80 a. t. iv. p. 348.</p></note> The mental powers of the individual thus tried
                    were for the moment paralyzed. He found that he only committed himself further
                    by renewed efforts; and “began to think,” as Euthydemus says of himself at the
                    close of the conversation to which we have just referred, “whether it were not
                    best for him to be silent, as he ran the hazard of appearing absolutely to know
                    nothing.”</p>
                <p>From the instance just given, it will appear that a current of irony pervaded
                    these experimental argumentations of Socrates. There was irony mingled with
                    earnest conviction, in that very disclaimer of all knowledge with which he set
                    out. It was a mask, behind which he could hurl his weapons of assault on the
                    boasted knowledge of others, whilst at the same time he expressed his serious
                    view of the real ignorance of man, and the necessity of coming with a simple
                    unprejudiced mind to the acquisition of truth. In the prosecution, however, of
                    his method of analysis by interrogation, irony was indispensable for the success
                    of his inquiry. For his object was to obtain the truth from the mouth of the
                    person interrogated, not to state it himself; and where he did state it
                    accordingly, it was necessary to put it in such a form as to try whether it was
                    the opinion or not of that person,—whether he really thought so, or adopted it
                    on the judgment of his questioner. An ironical statement answers this purpose.
                    It conceals the teacher, and enables him to judge, according as the hearer
                    applies it, what the state of the hearer’s mind is, and to argue the point in
                    question, not on premises laid down by himself, but the admissions of the other.
                    The hearer, too, is taken by surprise. The air of seriousness which the ironical
                    manner sets out with, and the absurdity involved, on second thought, in carrying
                    out the supposition of a serious intent, in their united effect, provoke the
                    smile of surprise, and win attention. As Socrates was engaged, too, in
                    presenting unacceptable conclusions,—bringing home to the self-conceited
                    evidences of their real ignorance,—it was necessary for him to disguise, as much
                    as possible, the conclusion to which he was tending. He had to assume,
                    therefore, the principles on which those with whom he conversed were reasoning
                    and acting, and reduce these to an absurdity, by applying them as true to some
                    evident case of ordinary experience. The skilful use made by Socrates of this
                    irony was a powerful enforcement, in itself, of the convictions which he desired
                    to leave on the minds of his hearers. He brought the aid of a delicate ridicule
                    to the support of an argument, and thus exhibited the desired conclusion under a
                    form, which, whilst it pleased the hearers, shamed them into an acknowledgment
                    of its truth.<pb break="no" facs="ht:chi.28490924&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=533"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0720-0533-0467"/> But this irony, and the analogical instances over
                    which it was thrown, were but approaches to that end which Socrates appears
                    always to have had in view in his conversations, —the ascent to accurate general
                    notions of each object of thought. He was always working his way towards an
                    exact definition of the idea on which the discussion turned. Each instance which
                    he adduced was a step in this progress, diminishing by its light some portion of
                    that obscurity and confusion of thought with which he found the subject
                    invested. He did not, indeed, reach the point which he had in view. Dialectical
                    science was in too rude a state at present for the attainment of its perfect
                    end. Socrates rather set an admirable example of the perseverance and energy
                    with which the end should be pursued, than a perfect model of the method of
                    pursuing it. His very method, indeed, confesses its own imperfection, in
                    stopping just at the point where the way seems to be opened, and leaving the
                    subject negatively, rather than positively defined.</p>
                <p>This constant pursuit of exact definition is an indication of the antisceptical
                    bent of the mind of Socrates. The foundations of morals and of all science were
                    shaken by the speculations of his sophistical predecessors. Opinion was exalted
                    to the prerogative of knowledge. Socrates accordingly put opinion to the test.
                    He explored it experimentally, as it existed in different minds; and he proved
                    it deficient from the standard to which it had been vainly exalted. He found
                    that it vanished before the light of investigation; and, in fact, that in
                    proportion as the fancies and errors of opinion were cleared away, advances were
                    made towards more stable and certain knowledge. This knowledge, accordingly, he
                    continually sought after. He had probably but an indistinct conception of the
                    realities towards which he directed his pursuit. Still he appears constantly to
                    have assumed and fully believed their existence, by steadily proceeding, as we
                    find him to have done, through the various opinions which he encounters in
                    discussion, until he arrives at some more definite form of thought. What
                    Socrates only indistinctly apprehended, Plato afterwards realized in his
                    philosophical system, and endued with existence in his celebrated theory of
                    Ideas. But in the view of his master that theory was but dimly seen in shadow.
                    Socrates shaped his course towards it, as he more and more limited the
                    extravagancies of popular opinion on the various subjects which he discussed,
                    and excluded whatever was irrelevant and foreign to the real nature of the
                    thing. He threw doubts on what was doubtful, that there might be the less doubt
                    and uncertainty about what remained when the doubtful was removed from a
                    subject.</p>
                <p>What appears to have led Socrates into this sound method of proceeding, was, as
                    Aristotle very justly intimates, the firm moral convictions which were the great
                    elements of his mind and character.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    could impugn. He not only felt their reality within himself, but he had
                    observed, that however invisible to the outward eye, they produced real effect3
                    in the world; that they were not only evidenced in the constitution of nature,
                    but also recognized in those unwritten laws which were found everywhere the
                    same, independently of positive institution, as well as in the enactments of
                    particular states.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>'

                    invariable and true, as the Divinity is invariable and true. Hence he would
                    allow no proper and adequate power of causation but moral design. Material or
                    mechanical causes were in his view but of instrumental efficacy.<note

                    intelligent of animals, because be had hands; whereas he should have stated,
                    that man bad hands because he was the most intelligent of animals; for that

                    moral sentiment only, the love and pursuit of good, that possessed real power.
                    This alone, he observed, subsisted unchanged and fixed, whilst every thing else
                    was moved by it, and derived its existence from it. It was the neglect of this
                    primary principle in the detail of the physical theory of Anaxagoras, which had
                    offended him in the system of that philosopher. And agreeably to this, Plato
                    tells us of his accounting for his remaining in his prison, from the simple
                    cause of the moral feeling by which he was actuated.</p>
                <p>Fixing his eye accordingly on these stable eternal principles, Socrates pressed
                    forward in every discussion towards their attainment. He would never rest in
                    vague general classifications, which involving also much that belonged not to
                    the subject in question, left its nature as undefined as ever. But he proceeded
                    to a further limitation of the generalities on each subject, obliging his hearer
                    to distinguish the subordinate genera included in the more general idea first
                    thrown out, and thus gradually to circumscribe the subject within its proper
                    boundaries. This was the intimate connexion of his logic and ethics. He was
                    engaged throughout in an endeavour to remove the vain presumptions of mere
                    opinion, and to substitute for these a real knowledge, as far as it was
                    attainable, of the subjects themselves. He conceived that if men went astray in
                    their conduct, acting on what they mistakenly thought right, and good, and true,
                    it was only necessary to make them <hi rend="italic">know</hi> the truth, and
                    they would then act on their <hi rend="italic">knowledge,</hi> as before they
                    acted on mere <hi rend="italic">opinion,</hi> and by thus acting attain their
                    happiness. This was but a short-sighted view of the origin of human misconduct
                    and unhappiness, as it did not go beyond the fact of the erroneous judgment of
                    men, to the moral perversion which was the primary cause of their failure in
                    action. As the practical error of men arises from this perversion, it is
                    evidently vain to think to improve their conduct, by merely substituting more
                    correct notions of truth and duty; since this remedy does not reach the source
                    of the malady. Such, however, was the view of Socrates. And hence he laboured,
                    whatever might be the subject of his conversations, to lead men to contemplate
                    the nature of the thing discussed, and to seek to define it to themselves; thus
                    blending the perception of the right and the good in the intellectual
                    apprehension of the truth. Xenophon accordingly remarks the importance
                    attributed by Socrates to the ability of distributing things into genera, on the
                    ground, that by means of this talent “men would become most virtuous, most
                    formed for command, and most able in discourse.”<note anchored="true"

                <p>Though Socrates thus endeavoured to render his hearers accomplished in the art of
                    discussion, by directing their attention to Definition, he, us might be
                    expected, in that early state of logical science, did little more than point out
                    the great importance of Definition, and mark the direction in which it should
                    proceed. Were we to take our estimate of what Socrates accomplished in this way
                    from the “Dialogues” of Plato, we must suppose Socrates to have been much more
                    methodical in his discussions, than we should infer from the specimens given by
                    Xenophon. Something perhaps should be allowed for the practical turn of
                    Xenophon’s mind, and his comparative inattention to the more abstract part of
                    the discussions of his master, whilst his fellow-pupil, on the other hand, who
                    had an eagle-eye for<pb break="no"

                    theory, however remote and dazzling, would seize every hint that dropped from
                    the lips of Socrates for the indulgence of his Speculative imagination. Still
                    Xenophon may be regarded as having presented the most natural, as well as most
                    exact, specimens of the method of Socrates. In the simplicity of his honest
                    admiration and grateful recollection of the instructor and guide of his youth,
                    he evidently records what had most impressed his own mind, both as to the
                    substance and the manner of the conversations of Socrates, without any attempt
                    either at dramatic or theoretic effect. From Xenophon we learn how Socrates
                    appeared to the young Athenian, who, without any theories of his own, approached
                    him, simply with the desire of hearing him, and applying what he might learn
                    from the philosopher to his own improvement. Plato, on the other hand, whilst he
                    also has given a faithful portrait of Socrates in the general outline, (and the
                    faithfulness is shown by its close correspondence with that given by Xenophon,)
                    studied to give effect, at the same time, to his own philosophic sketches, by
                    placing the figure of Socrates in such a light as to harmonize with his own
                    sublime and beautiful ideal of truth.</p>
                <p>Thus we see how Socrates was the founder of the moral and logical science of the
                    schools of Athens. He taught nothing positively in either branch of philosophy,
                    but he taught men to inquire, and set them on the right track of inquiry. He
                    trained men to think for themselves, to accept no opinion which should be
                    contradicted by the moral and intellectual principles of their own nature, and
                    to rest in no opinion until they had traced it up to these principles.</p>
                <p>An exact logic, and a sound ethical system, would in time naturally result from
                    such a direction of men’s minds.</p>
                <p>In giving account to themselves of their opinions, men would be led to examine
                    into the connexions and dependencies of their ideas. Observations would be made
                    on the relations of ideas, and of words as their signs and representatives. And
                    such observations methodically stated, would at length constitute a system of
                    logic, such as that which Aristotle brought to light about half a century after
                    the death of Socrates. In the mean time, however, the value of ideas in
                    themselves, apart from their expression by words, would engage attention; and a
                    metaphysical logic,—a logic having for its object the determination of the true
                    notion or idea of a thing, and for its business the discussion of the
                    probabilities or appearances of truth surrounding the matter in question,—would
                    naturally be the first to succeed. Such was the Dialectic of Plato,—a science of
                    discourse or discussion, as its name imports; not a particular science, like the
                    logic which grew out of it, but as general in its comprehension as the method
                    itself of Socrates, of which it was the formal development, and equivalent,
                    therefore, to philosophy in the highest sense of that term, as being a search
                    after the nature of things, or, according to him, a theory of Ideas.</p>
                <p>Again, in giving account to themselves of their opinions, men would be led to
                    trace the connexion of their moral sentiments and actions with an internal
                    standard of right, independent of the variations of opinion. The examination of
                    this relation would suggest, in process of time, a system of rules for bringing
                    the variable—the sentiments and actions rtf the individual moral agent—into
                    accordance with the invariable principles of his moral nature. The first ethics,
                    identical, like the first logic, with philosophy in general, would be employed
                    in carrying the views of men to those great principles themselves.—discussing
                    and removing obstructions to the pure contemplation of the nature of virtue. But
                    the more mature study of ethics, taking up the subject as a separate branch of
                    philosophy, would develop the application of the doctrine of the fixed standard,
                    by shewing throughout the field of man’s moral nature, how every moral sentiment
                    is strictly limited by its reference to such a standard. The former is the chief
                    business of Plato’s ethical philosophy; the latter, that of Aristotle’s·—the
                    first tending to a contemplative morality, to a love of the transcendent beauty
                    and excellence of virtue,—the latter, to a theory of active virtue,—to a
                    regulated state of the affections in all the offices of life;—both natural
                    consequences in their order, of that awakening of the reason of men, of which
                    Socrates had been the living instrument.</p>
                <p>Socrates, at the same time, by the method which he pursued, taught men the
                    beginning of an art of criticism. From an examination of existing opinions, the
                    transition was natural to the systems of philosophers, and the records of the
                    opinions of men of former days. And, in this respect, Socrates may be regarded
                    as the father of the history of philosophy. Even had the criticism of the
                    writings of philosophers formed no part of his conversations, still he must have
                    prompted such an inquiry by his method of interrogating, and exacting from every
                    one an account of his opinions. But he did more than this. Though not properly
                    erudite, in that sense in which Plato and Aristotle were, he had yet acquainted
                    himself with the doctrines of former philosophers. The chief part of his life
                    was spent with his eye, not on books, but on men. Still, as we are informed by
                    Xenophon, he had read, and had selected, in the course of his reading, whatever
                    he thought valuable in the writings of those before him.<note anchored="true"

                    great part of the conversation of Socrates consist of criticism of the theories
                    of philosophers. Much of this criticism evidently belongs to the richly-various
                    and elaborate learning of the disciple, rather than to the master from whose
                    lips it proceeds. But that Plato is not gratuitously ascribing this kind of
                    learning to Socrates, we see from the manner in which the less erudite disciple
                    refers to the discussions by Socrates of the doctrines of former philosophers.
                    Not only does Xenophon mention, in common with Plato, the comments of Socrates
                    on the more recent system of Anaxagoras,<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Xenoph. Mem. iv. 7. &lt;</p></note> ® but he refers also to
                    his examination of the great antagonist theories of the older schools, of
                    Parmenides, Xenophanes, Melissus, and others, on the one hand; Heraclitus,
                    Empedocles, and their followers, on the other; though without formally
                    introducing their names.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                <p>That various and discordant schools of philosophy should have arisen out of the
                    excitement produced by the energetic call of Socrates to his countrymen, was in
                    the natural course of things. Powerful minds, shaking off the yoke of sloth and
                    indifference, and now at length roused to self-exertion, would, however
                    generally docile to the guidance of a leader, be tempted to try their own
                    powers, and strike out a path for themselves. We are not to wonder, then, that
                    Aristippus, the advocate of pleasure, and Antisthenes, the austere cynic, should
                    have been among the hearers of Socrates, or that Plato should have founded a
                    contemplative mysticism on the sober homely philosophy of his master. Socrates,
                    as we have all along shewn, did not propose any precise system of doctrine to
                    his followers. His mission was accomplished in making them exert themselves. He
                    did not desire that they should think alike, but that all should think and judge
                    for themselves. It is no wonder, therefore, that some should have gone into
                    extravagancies, and that, whilst general good resulted from the excitement,
                    partial evil also should have accompanied it. An Aristippus, or an Antisthenes,
                    could not have issued from the school of Pythagoras. But how much evil generally
                    may have resulted from the abject submission to the authoritative opinions of
                    Pythagoras, in the neglect of self-examina<pb break="no"

                    tion and self-knowledge, and disregard of personal responsibility, by those who
                    implicitly received them?</p>
                <p>But whilst we ascribe to Socrates the merit of having given at once the impulse
                    and the character to Grecian philosophy, we must yet single out for special
                    commendation, his admirable services in reviving the forgotten theory of natural
                    religion among his countrymen. Of religion, indeed, as an external system of
                    positive laws enforced by the state, they had, as we have before observed, more
                    than enough. But religion, as a system of truth, was scarcely thought of. When
                    Aristophanes<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Aristoph.

                    is evidently to the real irreligion, which the most rigid and scrupulous worship
                    of the heathen but ill concealed. Resting their belief of a Divine agency in the
                    world on tradition and authority, men omitted to explore the witness of God in
                    their own nature, and in the world around them. Consequently, they were exposed
                    to every objection which the ingenuity of theory, or the folly and wickedness of
                    the world, might suggest to their uninformed credulity, against the positive
                    truth of their religions system. As infidelity in these days finds its refuge in
                    the belief of an infallible church, and is itself in its turn the miserable
                    refuge from the despotism of the very infallibility before which it crouches in
                    silence; so among the votaries of heathen superstition, the doubts and
                    misgivings of the thoughtful intellect, and the troubled heart, were left to
                    prey on themselves, shut up in abject submission to an external authority, and
                    unprepared for their own defence and support. Socrates addressed a great portion
                    of that practical information, which, in spite of his disclaimer of the office
                    of a teacher, he was ever imparting to all around him, to the remedy of this
                    distempered state of the religious feelings. He saw plainly enough that the
                    vulgar theology could not be defended on the ground of rational evidence.<note

                    laws and customs of his country, he was content to lean on the sanction of
                    positive institution. A great reverence, he justly thought, was due to the
                    wisdom embodied in ancient laws; and he would not encourage persons wantonly to
                    abandon the presumptions of truth and right naturally belonging to established
                    institutions. At least, he would not have men rashly set up their own notions
                    against the presumptions in favour of the wisdom of other men and other days,
                    recommended as these were by some experience of their stability and use, whilst
                    each man’s private opinions had no such sanction, or no equivalent sanction. But
                    he felt also, that the internal sense of religion wanted other support,—that
                    presumptions of human vanity and corruption were, and ever would be, brought to
                    bear against this; and that such assaults could only be repelled by a
                    well-informed reason prepared for the encounter. He therefore provided his
                    hearer with a solid and impregnable argument in favour of the being and
                    providence and moral government of the Deity. Tire argument was what is now
                    familiarly known as the argument from final causes, or the evidences of almighty
                    design in the fabric and course of nature. For this purpose, he gave an
                    induction of instances from the world without, and from the intellectual and
                    moral constitution of man himself, of admirable design in the adaptation of
                    means to ends. He called upon men, with such evidences of divine benevolence
                    around them, not to wait for any more palpable proof, such as judging from the
                    analogy of nature they had no ground to expect, but to believe in the existence
                    of invisible things from their effects, and from the good received to reverence
                    the Deity its author. The language, indeed, attributed to him by Xenophon, is in
                    remarkable correspondence with that of St. Paul, declaring, that “the invisible
                    things of God are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made,
                    even his eternal power and Godhead;"<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    the tenor of his argument throughout illustrates the inspired observation of the
                    apostle. More particularly we may advert to his striking inculcation of the
                    doctrine of the moral government of God. He refers to the sense of
                    responsibility as in itself an evidence of the existence of a Divine Power to

                    interposing at all, after they had passed them, without a trial, and the
                    formalities of an execution; if they were able to make the laws execute
                    themselves, or every offender to execute them upon himself; we should be just in
                    the same sense under their government then, as we are now; but in a much higher
                    degree, and more perfect manner.” P. 51.</p></note> The stock of instances has
                    been enlarged by the researches of modern science, and strength has been added
                    to them by their arrangement and combination. But Socrates, after all, has the
                    distinguished merit of having given the argument from final causes an explicit
                    statement and due importance in the proof of natural religion.</p>
                <p>When we think that truths of such high import and interest were sedulously
                    propagated for so many years in the place of concourse of the civilized world,
                    we naturally turn from the contemplation of the living philosopher, to ask, what
                    was the result—what was the amount of beneficial influence on the people to whom
                    his mission was addressed. We cannot doubt, that on the whole the influence was
                    great,—that the serious errors of many in regard to the conduct of life were
                    corrected,—their minds opened to consider the great purposes for which they had
                    been born into the world, and to look for happiness, not from transitory sensual
                    enjoyments, but from the sober and vigorous exertion of their powers of thought
                    and action. In some conspicuous instances, indeed, his endeavours strikingly
                    failed. Critias and Alcibiades were known wherever the name of Athens was heard.
                    And their wild and guilty career presented to the public eye a splendid mirror,
                    from which the most unjust censure was reflected on the philosopher himself. But
                    the many instances which must have occurred in humbler life, of his success in
                    the work of moral reformation, are passed over in silence. That there were such
                    instances Xenophon has given us to understand, when he observes, in his simple
                    manner, that Socrates dismissed those who resorted to him, improved by their
                    intercourse with him.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>’

                    decisive and permanent public improvement from the teaching of the philosopher,
                    would be to overlook the extent and the malignity of heathen corruption. The men
                    of that day, as of the present, had the voice of God distinctly speaking within
                    them, “their conscience bearing witness, and their thoughts accusing or excusing
                    them,” according to that just description of them which Scripture has set before

                    admonitions? Rather, they would feel towards him, according to that apposite
                    illustration of Plato, as persons dozing towards one that should wake them up,

                <p>And truly we may regard that energetic call which he was ever sounding in the
                    ears of his countrymen, as a providential warning to the heathen world of the
                    sin and misery of the natural man, trusting to his own imaginations,—how,
                    “changing the truth of God into a lie,” he “gives himself over unto
                    lasciviousness, to work all uncleanness with greediness.” As God sent his
                    prophets to his chosen people, to tell them of their transgressions, and bid
                    them “remember the law of Moses his servant so in his dealings with the nations
                    of the world, He appears to have raised up, from time to time, individuals from
                    among themselves, heathens still, yet gifted with a purity of moral vision
                    beyond their contemporaries, to retrace the divine outline of their fallen
                    nature, amidst its ruins, and to declare almost authoritatively the indelible
                    but forgotten law of right. Israel rejected its prophets; but through all the
                    perverseness of the people, those prophets prepared the way of the Lord. The
                    heathen world, in like manner, refused to listen to its monitors, its
                    legislators, and philosophers; but in spite of their general obduracy and
                    indifference, we cannot but believe that the call was not utterly fruitless. To
                    the original influence of Socrates especially, brought as this was to bear on
                    the great centre of heathen civilization, it may have been in great measure
                    owing, that the light of religious and moral truth was kept alive, however
                    faintly burning, for successive generations, in many a dark abode of
                    superstition; and that in a later day, the doctrine of grace and truth appealed
                    not without effect to the Areopagite of Athens, the jailor of Philippi, and the
                    Roman proconsul at Paphos. He certainly excited a spirit of eager curiosity on
                    moral subjects; as was evidenced in the rise of the schools of philosophy to
                    meet the demands of that spirit, and in the moral character of the disquisitions
                    pursued in them. But this spirit could not have exhausted itself in mere
                    literary discussion. There were doubtless the waverings of anxious minds beyond
                    the precincts of the schools, to be settled; cravings after more safe direction
                    of personal conduct than such as the world around them presented, to be
                    satisfied. Such a state of things would keep men looking for gospel-truth. Some
                    would feel, as Alcibiades is represented by Plato, after a conversation with
                    Socrates, and Euthydemus by Xenophon, at a loss how to pray. And to such the
                    answer of Socrates, as given by Plato, would very indistinctly perhaps, yet not
                    without earnest hope, suggest the high thought, that they must wait until they
                    could be informed by God himself, as to the proper disposition towards God and
                    men; or until one should come to discipline them,—to remove the darkness from
                    their eyes, and enable them to discern both good and evil.<note anchored="true"
