                <p><label type="entry">SELKIRKSHIRE</label>, a county of Scotland, situated between
                    55° 21 and 55° 42' north latitude, and between 2° 48' and 3° 20' west longitude
                    from Greenwich. It has Mid-Lothian, or the county of Edinburgh, on the north;
                    Roxburghshire on the east and south-east; Dumfriesshire on the south; and
                    Peeblesshire, or Tweeddale, on the west; the line which separates it from these
                    counties being on all sides, but especially the south, exceedingly irregular.
                    Its area has been computed very differently; but, according to the latest
                    authorities, it appears that its extreme length is thirty miles, its extreme
                    breadth twenty, and it is calculated to contain 264½ square miles, nearly equal
                    to 169,280 English acres. It includes only two entire parishes, Yarrow and
                    Ettrick; the parishes of Selkirk and Galashiels being partly in Roxburghshire.
                    These may be said to form the county, although small parts of the parishes of
                    Ashkirk, Inverleithen, Peebles, Roberten, and Stow, are also included in it.</p>
                <p>This is almost entirely a pastoral district, and in many respects bears a
                    resemblance to the higher parts of the contiguous county of Roxburgh. Like the
                    latter county, the general declivity of the mountain range is from
                    west-south-west to east-north-east, and all its streams discharge themselves
                    into the Tweed. The rocks are of the transition series, and are chiefly
                    greywacke, graywacke-slate, and clay-slate. On the borders of Peeblesshire
                    extensive layers of porphyry, alternating with thin strata of slate and granite,
                    are to be found. The hills are generally ridge-shaped, and rounded on the tops,
                    with acclivities of from 10° to 30°. The secondary valleys are small, being
                    caused by the Ettrick and Yarrow running nearly parallel, and at no very great
                    distance from each other; but where the Y arrow and Tweed diverge, the valleys
                    increase in magnitude, as they are then drained by larger streams. Several of
                    the hills are above 2300 feet in height, such as Windlestraw Law, at the
                    northern extremity of the county, on the confines of Mid-Lothian; Blackhouse
                    Heights (2370); Minchmoor (2280), on the borders of Peeblesshire; and
                    Ettrick-pen (2200), on the south-west boundary. The lower hills are for the most
                    part green, and afford good pasturage for sheep; but heath prevails on many of
                    the higher grounds, especially towards the south-west. The lowest land is 280
                    feet, and the sites of many of the houses are from 600 to 1000 feet and upwards,
                    above the level of the sea.</p>
                <p>The rivers are, the Tweed, which crosses the north side of the county in its
                    course from Peeblesshire on the west to Roxburghshire on the east; the Gala,
                    which for some distance forms the boundary with Roxburghshire on the north-east,
                    and falls into the Tweed, from the north, a little<pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:chi.28490924&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=99" xml:id="kp-eb0720-0099-0085"/>
                    below Galashiels; the Cador, a very beautiful stream, which also joins the Tweed
                    from the north; the Ettrick and Yarrow, which have their sources on the confines
                    of the county of Dumfries, and, flowing north-east almost parallel to each
                    other, join their streams above Selkirk, and afterwards, under the name of
                    Ettrick, passing to the west of that town, and for a short distance along the
                    boundary with Roxburghshire, enter the Tweed, in which their name is lost, and
                    which then becomes the boundary with that county; the Ale, which rises in the
                    north-east, and soon after passes into Roxburghshire; and also the Borthwick,
                    which washes the north-eastern boundary. Next to the Tweed, the most
                    considerable waters are the Ettrick and the Yarrow, which receive, in the first
                    instance, nearly all the other streams that traverse this district. Both have
                    been celebrated in song, and have given their names to some plaintive melodies
                    of great beauty and feeling. The scenery on the Yarrow is exceedingly romantic
                    and delightful. Soon after its rise, it passes through two lakes, the Loch of
                    the Lows, and St Mary’s Loch; the latter, which is separated from the former
                    only by a narrow neck of level ground, and is three miles long, having its banks
                    partly covered with cop-</p>
                <p>pice-wood, is the finest piece of water in the south of Scot-and. From thence the
                    Yarrow flows for eight or nine miles, through sheep-walks, without wood or
                    cultivation; but afterwards the sides of the lofty hills in its course are
                    covered with wood to a considerable height, and its valley is embellished with a
                    variety of bushes and wild flowers. Ettrick, the larger stream, has a wider and
                    more cultivated valley; and a little before it receives the Yarrow, natural wood
                    begins to appear on its banks. It afterwards flows for four miles through a rich
                    tract, sheltered by plantations on the hills, till it loses its name in the
                    Tweed. From this river the whole district has been sometimes called Ettrick
                    Forest; but the name of Forest here, as elsewhere, has long since ceased to
                    denote the existence of extensive woodlands, of which, whatever may have been
                    the case formerly, scarcely any traces now remain. Besides the two lakes we have
                    mentioned, a great many smaller ones are scattered over the east and south-east
                    quarters, of which the more considerable are Loch Alemoor, the principal source
                    of the Ale, and Loch Oakermoor, noted for the vast quantity of marl which it
                    contains.</p>
                <p>This county is deficient in coal, limestone, and sandstone, and it lies under the
                    same disadvantages as Roxburghshire, from the great distance at which it lies
                    from markets where coal and lime are to be had. It is fortunate, however, that
                    in the lakes and mosses there is a great deal of marl, which serves as excellent
                    manure for the arable land in their vicinity. The arable land lies on an
                    elevation of from 280 to 800 feet, and does not much exceed one twentieth of the
                    whole county. It is light, dry, and easily cultivated; and it produces wheat,
                    oats, barley or bear, turnips, and potatoes. Wheat is regularly grown in the
                    lower parts of the county, and even in the higher it has been raised at the
                    height of 700 feet, yielding a good return; and it may be said that agriculture
                    is as well understood and followed out in this as in any other of the Scotch
                    counties. The rotation in crops is generally on the five-shift system of
                    husbandry; although, near the towns, where land is high and manure can be easily
                    had, the four-shift is too often followed. This has increased the disease of the
                    turnip crop, called fingers-and-toes, and has proved very injurious to the red
                    clover.</p>
                <p>The average rent of land is, on the arable farms, from one pound four shillings
                    to three pounds an acre; and on the pastoral farms from two shillings and
                    sixpence to five shillings and sixpence an acre. The grazing of an ox or cow
                    throughout the year is about five pounds. In Ettrick it is from two pounds to
                    two pounds five shillings; and that of a sheep is from four shillings and
                    sixpence to six shillings and sixpence. The wages paid to farm-servants and
                    shepherds are nearly the same as in Roxburghshire. The following summary of the
                    produce and value of the parishes of Selkirk, Galashiels, Yarrow, and Ettrick,
                    as stated in the New Statistical Account of Scotland, will more fully explain
                    the value of the county.</p>

                <p>The leases of the farms on the Buccleuch estates are for nine years; but this is
                    almost no drawback, as the occupiers are rarely removed. On other estates the
                    leases run generally for nineteen years.</p>
                <p>The rest of the county is almost exclusively occupied by sheep, which are now,
                    for the most part, of the Cheviot breed, though not often pure, and scarcely in
                    any instance equal to those of Roxburghshire. The black-faced or forest breed
                    are better adapted for the greater part of the pasturage than the Cheviots; but
                    their wool is coarse, and not well adapted for manufacture. Yet it is generally
                    allowed, that if proper care were taken to cross the ewes with Cheviot rams, and
                    never allow them to recross, a stock of sheep suitable to the range of pasture,
                    and with improved wool, would soon increase, and take the place of the present
                    breed. The number of sheep usually in pasture amounts to 55,000, of which 3000
                    or 4000 are of the black-faced, 4000 Leicesters, and the remainder Cheviots. The
                    cows are mostly of the short-horned, or of the Ayrshire breeds. Small farmers
                    and feuars prefer the latter, as being more easily brought up, and affording
                    more milk. Highland stots have been introduced, within these few years, to
                    pasture among the sheep, as it has been found that from the complete draining of
                    the district, the overflow of succulent grasses is such, that without a mixture
                    of cattle with the sheep, the grass is totally lost. The greater number of
                    cattle a farmer keeps on his pasture, according to its extent, from May to the
                    middle of August, the more sheep he is able to feed during winter. The valued
                    rent of the county is L.80,307. 15s. 6d. Scotch, and the real rent of the lands
                    and houses in 1812 was L.4l,162. 10s. sterling. The annual value of real
                    property, as assessed in April 1815, was L.43,584. Two fifths of the whole
                    property are held under entail. The principal proprietors are the Duke of
                    Buccleuch, who possesses about one half of the extent, and about one third of
                    the rental; the Earl of Traquair, Lords Elibank and Napier, Johnston of Alva,
                    with fifteen other proprietors, whose lands stand valued in the cess-books from
                    L.1000 to L.2000 Scotch.</p>
                <p>Selkirk, the county town, and the town of Galashiels, contain nearly all that
                    part of the population which is not employed in agriculture. A considerable
                    portion of the wool of the county finds a ready market at Galashiels. An
                    inkle-work and some tanneries are the only other branches carried on for sale
                    out of the county; so that its exports consist chiefly of raw produce, of which
                    its sheep and wool are by far the most considerable articles.</p>
