                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">South,</hi><hi rend="italic">Robert,</hi> an eminent divine,
                    was the son of William South, a merchant of London, and was born at Hackney,
                    near that city, in 1633. He was educated at Westminster school, and afterwards
                    in ChristChurch College, Oxford. In 1654, he wrote a copy of Latin verses to
                    congratulate Cromwell upon the peace concluded with the Dutch; and the next year
                    a Latin poem, entitled <hi rend="italic">Musica Incantans.</hi> In 1660, he was
                    elected public orator of the university; and the following year became domestic
                    chaplain to Edward earl of Clarendon, lord high chancellor of England. In 1663
                    he was installed prebendary of Westminster, admitted to the degree of D. D., and
                    had a sinecure in Wales bestowed on him by his patron, the earl of Clarendon;
                    after whose retirement into France in 1667, he became chaplain to the duke of
                    York. In 1670 he was installed canon of ChristChurch; and in 1676 attended as
                    chaplain to Laurence Hyde, Esq. ambassador extra ordinary to the king of Poland.
                    In 1678 he was presented to the rectory of Islip in Oxfordshire; and in 1680
                    rebuilt the chancel of that church, as he afterwards did the rectoryhouse
                    belonging to it. After the revolution he took the oath of allegiance to King
                    William and Queen Mary, though he excused himself from accepting a great dignity
                    in the church, vacated by the personal refusal of that oath. His health began to
                    decline several years before his death, which happened in 1716. He was interred
                    in Westminster Abbey, where a monument is erected to his memory. He published,
                    1. Animadversions on Dr Sherlock’s Vindication of the Holy and ever thessed
                    Trinity; 2. A Defence of his Animadversions; 3. Ser mons, 8 vols. 8vo. And after
                    his decease were published his <hi rend="italic">Opera Posthuma Latina,</hi> and
                    his posthumous English Works. Dr South was remarkable for his wit, which abounds
                    in all his writings, and particularly in his sermons; but at the same time they
                    equally abound in ill humour,<pb break="no"

                    spleen, and satire. He was remarkable for being a time server. During the life
                    of Cromwell he was a staunch Presbyterian, and then railed against the
                    Independents; at the Restoration he exerted his pulpiteloquence against the
                    Presbyterians; and in the reign of Queen Anne was a warm advocate for

                    triangular figure, and has the Krishna river for its base, Cape Comorin the
                    apex, while the sides are formed by the coasts of Coromandel and Malabar. It is
                    600 miles in length from Cape Comorin to the Krishna, and 500 miles in breadth
                    where broadest. The great feature of this extensive region is the central
                    tableland, from 3000 to 5000 feet above the level of the sea, separated by a
                    wild, abrupt, and mountainous country, from the low plains to the east and west,
                    which form a belt of small but unequal breadth between the hills and the sea. In
                    this division of India may be seen the Hindu manners in their primitive
                    simplicity, especially in Tinnevelly and the adjacent districts. The Mahommedans
                    are few in comparison with the native Hindus, over whom twenty centuries have
                    passed without making any change in their habits. Southern India has suffered
                    grievously from the devastations of war, and fully as much from the cruel
                    extortion of its rulers. The terri tories comprehended in this division of the
                    country are, a small portion of the Bejapoor province, the Balaghaut ceded
                    districts; the Carnatic, Northern, Central, and Southern; Mysore, Canara,
                    Malabar, Barramahal, Coimbetoor, Din digul, Salem and Kistnagherry, Cochin and
                    Travancore; a detailed description of which will be found under their re

                    ever, strictly speaking, reach quite to the continent of Asia, excepting to the
                    northward of the peninsula of Malacca; for the water interposed between the
                    eastern coast of Africa and the peninsula just mentioned has the name of the <hi

                    the western coast of America, through its whole extent, from the unknown regions
                    in the north to the Straits of Magellan and Terra del Fuego, where it
                    communicates with the southern part of the Atlantic. On the other side, it is
                    bounded by the coast of Asia, from the northern pro montory of Tschukotskoi
                    Noss, to the peninsula of Ma lacca already mentioned. Thence it is bounded to
                    the southward by the northern coasts of Borneo, Celebes, Ma cassar, New Guinea,
                    New Holland, and the other islands in that quarter, which divide it from the
                    Indian Ocean. Then, washing the eastern coast of the great island of New
                    Holland, it communicates with that vast body of water en compassing the whole
                    southern part of the globe, and which has the general name of the <hi

                    semicircumference of the globe, reaching nearly from one pole to the other, and
                    about the equatorial parts extending almost 180° in 1ongi tude, or 12,500 of our
                    miles. The northern parts of the Pacific Ocean are entirely destitute of land,
                    not a single island having yet been discovered in it from the latitude of 40°
                    north and upwards, excepting such as are very near the coast either of Asia or
                    America; but in the southern part the islands are very numerous. See <hi
