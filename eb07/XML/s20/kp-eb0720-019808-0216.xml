                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra
                    space around the <gi>pb</gi> tag. Where a word is hyphenated at a <gi>pb</gi>,

                <p><label type="entry">SHENSTONE, <hi rend="smallcaps">William</hi></label>, an
                    admired English poet, the eldest son of a plain country gentleman, who farmed
                    his own estate in Shropshire, was born in November 1714. He learned to read of
                    an old dame, whom his poem of the School-Mistress has delivered to posterity;
                    and he soon received such delight from books, that he was always calling for new
                    entertainment, and expected that, when any of the family went to market, a new
                    book should be brought him, which, when it came, was in fondness carried to bed,
                    and laid beside him. It is said, that when his request had been neglected, his
                    mother wrapped up a piece of wood of the same form, and pacified him for the
                    night. As he grew older, he went for a while to the grammar-school in
                    Hales-Owen, and was placed afterwards with Mr Crumpton, an eminent schoolmaster
                    at Solihul, where he distinguished himself by the quickness of his progress.
                    When he was young (June 1724), he was deprived of his father, and soon
                    afterwards (August 1726) of his grandfather; and, with his brother, who died
                    afterwards unmarried, he was left to the care of his grandmother, who managed
                    the estate. From school he was sent, in 1732, to Pembroke College, Oxford, a
                    society which has for a long time been eminent for English poetry and elegant
                    literature. Here it appears that he found delight and advantage; for he
                    continued his name there ten years, though he took no degree. After the first
                    four years he put on the civilian’s gown, but without showing any intention to
                    engage in the profession. About the time when he went to Oxford, the death of
                    his grandmother devolved the care of his affairs on the Reverend Mr Dolman, of
                    Brome, in Staffordshire, whose attention he always mentioned with gratitude. At
                    Oxford he applied to English poetry, and in 1737 published a small Miscellany,
                    without his name. He then for a time wandered about to acquaint himself with
                    life, and was sometimes at London, sometimes at Bath, or any place of public
                    resort; but he did not forget his poetry. He published, in 1740, his Judgment of
                    Hercules, addressed to Mr Lyttleton. whose interest he supported with great
                    warmth at an election. This was two years afterwards followed by the
                    School-Mistress. Mr Dolman, to whose care he was indebted for his ease and
                    leisure, died in 1745, and the care of his fortune now fell upon himself. He
                    tried to escape it a while, and lived at his house with his tenants, who were
                    distantly related; but finding that imperfect possession inconvenient, he took
                    the whole estate into his own hands, an event which rather improved its beauty
                    than increased its produce. Now began his delight in rural pleasures, and his
                    passion for rural elegance; but in time his expenses occasioned clamours that
                    overpowered the bleat of the lamb and song of the linnet, and his groves were
                    haunted by beings very different from fauns or fairies. He spent his estate in
                    adorning it, and his death was probably hastened by his anxieties. He was a lamp
                    that spent its oil in blazing. It is said, that if he had lived a little longer,
                    he would have been assisted by a pension. Such bounty could not have been more
                    properly bestowed; but that it was ever asked is not certain, and it is too
                    certain that it never was enjoyed. He died at the Leasowes, of a putrid fever,
                    on the 11th of February 1763, and was buried by the side of his brother, in the
                    churchyard of Hales-Owen.</p>
                <p>In his private opinions, Shenstone adhered to no particular sect, and hated all
                    religious disputes. Tenderness, in every sense of the word, was his peculiar
                    characteristic; and his friends, domestics, and poor neighbours, daily
                    experienced the effects of his benevolence. This virtue he carried to an excess
                    that seemed to border upon weakness; yet if any of his friends treated him
                    ungenerously, he was not easily reconciled. On such occasions, however, he used
                    to say, “I never will be a revengeful enemy; but I cannot, it is not in my
                    nature, to be half a friend.” He was no economist; for the generosity of his
                    temper prevented his paying a proper regard to the use of money, and therefore
                    he exceeded the bounds of his paternal fortune. But if we consider the perfect
                    paradise into which he had converted his estate, the hospitality with which he
                    lived, his charities to the indigent, and all out of an estate that did not
                    exceed L.300 a year, one should rather wonder that he left any thing behind him,
                    than blame his want of economy. He yet left more than sufficient to pay all his
                    debts, and by his will appropriated his whole estate to that purpose. Though he
                    had a high opinion of many of the fair sex, he forbore to marry. A passion he
                    entertained in his youth was with difficulty surmounted. The lady was the
                    subject of that admirable pastoral, in four parts, which has been so universally
                    read and admired, and which, one would have thought, must have softened the
                    proudest and most obdurate heart. His works have been published by Mr Dodsley,
                    in three volumes 8vo. The first volume contains his poetical works, which are
                    particularly distinguished by an amiable elegance and beautiful simplicity; the
                    second volume contains his prose works; the third his letters and other
                    pieces.</p>
