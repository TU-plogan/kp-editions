                    city of Persia, the capital of the province of Fars, and, at different periods,
                    of the whole kingdom. According to Fraser, the city of Shiraz is situated in the
                    midst of a brown, barren plain, without a village, or any living thing, to
                    relieve it. There were, when he visited the place, only one or two gardens on
                    the wide expanse, which resembled black spots in the desert. He adds, that a
                    nearer view does not present any more favourable impression, the aspect of its
                    mud-walls, surrounded with ruins and broken ground, impressing the most gloomy
                    ideas. Kinneir, on the other hand, gives a different account of its<pb
                    break="no" facs="ht:chi.28490924&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=356"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0720-0356-0298"/> appearance, which, he says, is pleasing rather
                    than grand, the city being surrounded with many beautiful gardens. The season of
                    the year when Shiraz was visited by the former traveller seems, however, to have
                    been unfavourable for the display of vegetable beauty; and he accordingly
                    observes, that at this time the richer and irrigated spots were burnt up; and to
                    this circumstance maybe traced the discrepancy in the accounts of these two
                    writers. All travellers, however, agree in their account of the interior of the
                    city, which has an extremely mean appearance: the houses are small, and the
                    streets narrow and filthy.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    Persian Empire, p, 62.</p></note> Every thing within the town marks the total
                    neglect of even the attempt at improvement. The bazaars and maidans or colleges
                    are falling into ruins; the streets are choked with dirt, and with heaps of
                    ruins from decaying houses; their inmates squalid and insolent, crawling forth
                    in a state of rags and wretchedness, which, Sir R. Porter says, no pen can
                    describe. The impure state of the water brought into the city affords one among
                    many gross instances of public neglect, more especially considering the abundant
                    supply of this pure element with which the city was furnished in ancient times,
                    and the facility with which the spring at the tomb of Sadi, or the limpid rills
                    of the Rocknabad, might again be introduced and distributed for the supply of
                    the city. The town has six gates, and is divided into twelve districts or
                    parishes, in which there are fifteen considerable mosques, besides many others
                    of inferior note, eleven colleges, fourteen bazaars, thirteen caravanserais, and
                    twenty-six mummums or baths.</p>
                <p>Of the mosques, the Mesjed Ali, built in the khalifat of Abbas, is the most
                    ancient, and the Mesjed No the largest. It was converted from a palace to a
                    mosque by Attabek Shah, whose son was lying in a dangerous illness, and who,
                    consulting one of the priests, was answered, that for the recovery of his son he
                    must devote to the Almighty that which of all his worldly goods he valued most.
                    The Jumeh is likewise an ancient structure; and there are six others of an older
                    date than the time of Kerim Khan. Of the modern mosques the Mesjed Vakeel, the
                    only one built by this prince, is the most beautiful. Of the colleges, one of
                    the earliest was founded by Imaum Kouli Khan. Kerim Khan began a college which
                    he never finished; and another was founded by Haushem, father of Hajee Ibrahim,
                    the vizir of the late king. The great bazaar, or market-place, was built by
                    Kerim Khan, and forms a contrast to the mean appearance of the other parts of
                    the city. It is about a quarter of a mile in length, made of yellow burnt brick,
                    and arched at the top, with numerous sky-lights, which, with its doors and
                    windows, always admit of sufficient light and air, whilst the sun and the rain
                    are completely excluded. The bazaar is allotted to the different traders in the
                    city, all of whom have their separate quarter, in which their shops are extended
                    adjacent to each other on both sides of the building.</p>
                <p>Of the caravanserais, the one built by Imaum Kouli Khan, and now in ruins, is the
                    most ancient. There is another old structure, which was restored from a state of
                    great decay, and assumed the name of its second founder, Ali Khan. There are
                    five others; one for the dressers of sheep-skins for caps, another for dyers,
                    and one for Hindoos. Three other caravanserais were added by Kerim Khan, and two
                    others have been since erected. The ark or citadel, in which the governor of
                    Fars resides, is a fortified square of eighty yards. The royal palace within is
                    far from being an elegant structure; and some of its finest ornamental pillars
                    were removed by Aga Mahommed Khan to adorn his palace at Teheran.</p>
                <p>The environs of Shiraz, in its ancient splendour, have furnished a theme for
                    poets, and have been celebrated by Hafiz, the favourite bard of Persia, who was
                    a native of this city, and who is buried in a small garden about half a mile
                    from the town. A monument was erected to his memory by Kerim. Khan; it is placed
                    in the court of a pleasure-house which was much frequented by the poet; the
                    building has a small court before it and another behind, and in the centre is an
                    open vestibule, supported by four marble columns, opening on each side into neat
                    apartments. The tomb is placed in the back court, at the foot of one of the
                    cypress trees which he planted with his own hands. It consists of a block of
                    white marble in the form of a coffin, exquisitely carved. One of the poet’s odes
                    is inscribed on the marble, and the letters appear as if they had been
                    sculptured with the finest pen, rather than carved with a chisel. Sir R. K.
                    Porter, who visited this tomb ten years after Morier, gives a melancholy account
                    of the decay which has taken place in the interval, from neglect: the spot is no
                    longer held sacred, being covered with promiscuous graves; the trees are gone,
                    and the stone itself, already defaced, will not, unless it be secured from
                    profane hands, long remain the memorial of depasted genius. The population of
                    Shiraz has been variously estimated at from 40,000 to 10,000. M. Morier, who was
                    at some pains to make an accurate estimate, says 19,000. The commerce of the
                    city is of some extent, and has been increasing of late years. The principal
                    trade is with Bushire, through whose ports is brought into the country a supply
                    of foreign produce and manufactures, such as sugar, pepper, cinnamon, chintz,
                    glass, hardware, piece-goods, &amp;c. These articles are exported to Yezd and
                    Ispahan, and the manufactures of these cities received in return. The prosperity
                    of Shiraz decayed after the death of Kerim Khan; its commerce was diverted into
                    other channels, and its numerous manufactures perished for want of purchasers.
                    Two, however, have survived, and are prosecuted with diligence and success; one
                    is making glass for windows, bottles, and goblets, which are sold all over the
                    kingdom; the second is the formation of sword-blades and daggers, which are
                    deemed excellent for generaI use. In the hills which bound the plain of Shiraz,
                    was formerly produced a wine which is celebrated over all the east. Long. 52.
