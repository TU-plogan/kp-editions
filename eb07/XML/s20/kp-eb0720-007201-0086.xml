                    significant corrections to the OCR text, predominantly in cases of confusing "c"

                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra
                    space around the <gi>pb</gi> tag. Where a word is hyphenated at a <gi>pb</gi>,

                    rend="italic">Antiquity,</hi> solemn games held among the Romans once in an
                    age.</p>
                <p>These games lasted three days and as many nights, during which time sacrifices
                    were performed, and theatrical shows exhibited, with combats and sports in the
                    circus. The occasion of these games, according to Valerius Maximus, was to stop
                    the progress of a plague. Valerius Publicola was the first who celebrated them
                    at Rome, in the year of the city 245. The whole world was invited by a herald to
                    a feast which they had never seen before, nor ever should see again. Some days
                    before the games began, the quindecemviri, in the Capitol and in the Palatine
                    temple, distributed to the people purifying compositions of various kinds.
                    Thence the populace passed to Diana’s temple on the Aventine Mount, with wheat,
                    barley, and oats, as an offering. After this whole nights were spent in devotion
                    to the Destinies. When the time of the games was fully come, the people
                    assembled in the Campus Martius, and sacrificed to Jupiter, Juno, Apollo,
                    Latona, Diana, the Parcae, Ceres, Pluto, and Proserpine. On the first night of
                    the feast, the emperor, with the quindecemviri, caused three altars to be
                    erected on the banks of the Tiber, which were sprinkled with the blood of three
                    lambs, and then proceeded to regular sacrifice. A space was next marked out for
                    a theatre, which was illuminated with innumerable flambeaux and fires. Here they
                    sung hymns, and celebrated all kinds of sports. On the day afterwards, having
                    offered victims at the Capitol, they went to the Campus Martius, and celebrated
                    sports in honour of Apollo and Diana. These lasted until next day, when the
                    noble matrons, at the hour appointed by the oracle, went to the Capitol to sing
                    hymns to Jupiter. On the third day, which concluded the solemnity, twenty-seven
                    boys, and as many girls, sung, in the temple of Palatine Apollo, hymns and
                    verses in Greek and Latin, to recommend the city to the protection of those
                    deities whom they designed particularly to honour by their sacrifices. The
                    inimitable <hi rend="italic">carmen Seculare</hi> of Horace was composed for
                    this last day, in the Secular Games celebrated by Augustus.</p>
                <p>It has been much disputed whether these games were held every hundred or every
                    hundred and ten years. Valerius Antius, Varro, and Livy, are quoted in support
                    of the former opinion. In favour of the latter may be produced the
                    quindecemviral registers, the edicts of Augustus, and the words of Horace in the
                    secular poem, “Certus undenos decies per annos.”</p>
                <p>It was a general belief, that the girls who bore a part in the song should be
                    soonest married; and that the children who did not dance and sing at the coming
                    of Apollo should die unmarried, and at an early period of life.</p>
