                    significant corrections to the OCR text, predominantly in cases of confusing "c"
                    and "e." Isolates 90 entries that were mistakenly included at the end of prior
                    entries in v1 and v2. Normalizes ordinal numbers. Separates metadata in
                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra
                    space around the <gi>pb</gi> tag. Where a word is hyphenated at a <gi>pb</gi>,
                    the end fragment is now joined to the start fragment, making a machine-readable
                    word.</change>

                <p><label type="entry">SHOVEL, <hi rend="smallcaps">Sir Cloudesly</hi></label>, a
                    distinguished British admiral, was born about the year 1650, of parents in the
                    lower rank of life. He was first put apprentice to a shoemaker; but disliking
                    this profession, he a few years afterwards abandoned it, and went to sea. He was
                    at first a cabin-boy with Sir Christopher Mynns, but having applied to the study
                    of navigation with indefatigable industry, his skill as a seaman soon raised him
                    above that station.</p>
                <p>The corsairs of Tripoli having committed great outrages on the English in the
                    Mediterranean, Sir John Narborough was sent in 1764 to reduce them to reason. As
                    he had received orders to try the effects of negotiation before he proceeded to
                    hostilities, he sent Mr. Shovel, who was at that time a lieutenant in his fleet,
                    to demand satisfaction. The dey treated him with a great deal of disrespect, and
                    sent him back without an answer. Sir John dispatched him a second time, with
                    orders to remark particularly the situation of things on shore. The behaviour of
                    the dey was worse than ever, and upon Mr. Shovel’s return, he informed Sir John
                    that it would perhaps be possible, notwithstanding their fortifications, to burn
                    all the ships in the harbour. The boats were accordingly manned, and the command
                    of them given to Lieutenant Shovel, who seized the guard-ship, and burned four
                    others, without losing a man. This action so terrified the Tripolins, that they
                    sued for peace. Sir John Narborough gave so favourable an account of this
                    exploit, that Mr. Shovel was soon afterwards made captain of the Sapphire, a
                    fifth-rate ship.</p>
                <p>In the battle of Bantry-Bay, after the Revolution, he commanded the Edgar, and,
                    for his gallant behaviour in that action, was soon afterwards knighted by King
                    Williaru. Next year he was employed in transporting an army into Ireland; a
                    service which he performed with so much diligence and dexterity, that the king
                    raised him to the rank of rear-admiral of the blue, and delivered his commission
                    with his own hands. Soon afterwards he was made rearadmiral of the red, and
                    shared the glory of the victory at La Hogue. In 1694 he bombarded Dunkirk. In
                    1703 he commanded the grand fleet in the Mediterranean, and did every thing in
                    his power to assist the Protestants who were in arms in the Cevennes.</p>
                <p>Soon after the battle of Malaga, he was presented by Prince George to Queen Anne,
                    who received him graciously, and next year employed him as commander-in-chief.
                    In 1705 he commanded the fleet, together with the Earl of Peterborough and
                    Monmouth, which was sent into the Mediterranean; and it was owing to him chiefly
                    that Barcelona was taken. After an unsuccessful attempt upon Toulon, he sailed
                    for Gibraltar, and from thence homewards with a part of the fleet. On the 22d of
                    October, at night, his ship, with three others, was cast away on the rocks of
                    Scilly; and all on board perished. His body was found on the island of Scilly,
                    by some fishermen, who stripped it of a valuable ring, and afterwards buried it.
                    Mr. Paxton, the purser of the Arundel, hearing of this, found out the fellows,
                    and obliged them to discover where they had buried the body. He carried it on
                    board his own ship to Portsmouth, whence it was conveyed to London, and interred
                    with great solemnity in Westminster Abbey. A monument was afterwards erected to
                    his memory by the direction of the queen. He married the widow of his patron,
                    Sir John Narborough, by whom he left two daughters.</p>
