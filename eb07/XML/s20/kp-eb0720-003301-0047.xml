                    written by Professor Robison, and which are reprinted in the present
                    edition.</p></note><hi rend="smallcaps">By</hi> this word we express that noble
                    art, or, more properly, the qualifications which enable a man to exercise the
                    noble art of working a ship. A <hi rend="smallcaps">seaman,</hi> in the language
                    of the profession, is not merely a mariner or labourer on board a ship, but a
                    man who understands the structure of this wonderful machine, and every
                    subordinate part of its mechanism, so as to enable him to employ it to the best
                    advantage for pushing her forward in a particular direction, and for avoiding
                    the numberless dangers to which she is exposed by the violence of the winds and
                    waves. He also knows what courses can be held by the ship, according to the wind
                    that blows, and what cannot, and which of these is most conducive to her
                    progress in her intended voyage; and he must be able to perform every part of
                    the necessary operation with his own hands. As the seamen express it, he must be
                    able “to hand, reef, and steer.”</p>
                <p>We are justified in calling it a <hi rend="italic">noble art,</hi> not only by
                    its importance, which it is quite needless to amplify or embellish, but by its
                    immense extent and difficulty, and the prodigious number and variety of
                    principles on which it is founded, all of which must be possessed in such a
                    manner that they shall offer themselves without reflection in an instant,
                    otherwise the pretended seaman is but a lubber, and cannot be trusted on his
                    watch.</p>
                <p>The art is practised by persons without what we call <hi rend="italic"
                    >education,</hi> in the humbler walks of life, and therefore it suffers in the
                    estimation of the careless spectator. It is thought little of, because little
                    attention is paid to it. But if multiplicity, variety, and intricacy of
                    principles, and a systematic knowledge of these principles, entitle any art to
                    the appellation of <hi rend="italic">scientific</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >liberal,</hi> seamanship claims these epithets in an eminent degree. We are
                    amused with the pedantry of the seaman, which appears in his whole language.
                    Indeed it is the only pedantry that amuses. A scholar, a soldier, a lawyer, nay,
                    even the elegant courtier, would disgust us, were he to make the thousandth part
                    of the allusions to his profession that is well received from the jolly seaman;
                    and we do the seaman no more than justice. His profession <hi rend="italic"
                    >must</hi> engross his whole mind, otherwise he can never learn it. He possesses
                    a prodigious deal of knowledge; but the honest tar cannot tell what he knows, or
                    rather what he feels, for his science is really at his finger ends. We can say
                    with confidence, that if a person of education, versed in mechanics, and
                    acquainted with the structure of a ship, were to observe with attention the
                    movements which are made on board a first or second rate ship of war during a
                    shifting storm, under the direction of an intelligent officer, he would be rapt
                    in admiration.</p>
                <p>What a pity it is that an art so important, so difficult, and so intimately
                    connected with the invariable laws of mechanical nature, should be so held by
                    its possessors, that it cannot improve, but must die with each individual.
                    Having no advantages of previous education, they cannot arrange their thoughts;
                    they can hardly be said to think. They can far less express or communicate to
                    others the intuitive knowledge which they possess; and their art, acquired by
                    habit alone, is little different from an instinct. We are as little entitled to
                    expect improvement here as in the architecture of the bee or the beaver. The
                    species (pardon the the allusion, ye generous hearts of oak!) cannot improve.
                    Yet a ship is a machine. We know the forces which act on it, and we know the
                    results of its construction; all these are as fixed as the laws of motion. What
                    hinders this to be reduced to a set of practical maxims, as well founded and as
                    logically deduced as the working of a steam-engine or a cotton mill. The stoker
                    or the spinner acts only with his hands, and may “whistle as he works, for want
                    of thought;” but the mechanist, the engineer, thinks for him, improves his
                    machine, and directs him to a better practice. May not the rough seaman look for
                    the same assistance; and may not the ingenious speculist in his closet unravel
                    the intricate thread of mechanism which connects all the manual operations with
                    the unchangeable laws of nature, and both furnish the seaman with a better
                    machine, and direct him to a more dexterous use of it.</p>
                <p>We cannot help thinking that much may be done; nny, we may say that much has been
                    done. We think highly of the progressive labours of Renaud, Pitot, Bouguer, Du
                    Hamel, Groignard, Bernoulli, Euler, Romme, and others; and are both surprised
                    and sorry that Britain has contributed so little in these attempts. Gordon is
                    the only one of our countrymen who has given a professedly scientific treatise
                    on a small branch of the subject. The government of France has always been
                    strongly impressed with the notion of great improvements being attainable by
                    systematic study of this art; and we are indebted to the endeavours of that
                    ingenious nation for any thing of practical importance that has been obtained.
                    M. Bouguer was professor of hydrology at one of the marine academies of France,
                    and was enjoined, as part of his duty, to compose dissertations both on the
                    construction and the working of ships. His <hi rend="italic">Traite du
                    Navire,</hi> and his <hi rend="italic">Manoeuvre des Vaisseaux,</hi> are
                    undoubtedly very valuable performances. So are those of Euler and Bernoulli,
                    considered as mathematical dissertations, and they are wonderful works of
                    genius, considered as the productions of persons who hardly ever saw a ship, and
                    were totally unacquainted with the profession of a seaman. In this respect
                    Bouguer had great superiority, having always lived at a sea-port, and having
                    made many very long voyages. His treatises, therefore, are infinitely better
                    accommodated to the demands of the seaman, and more directly instructive; but
                    still the author is more a mathematician than an artist, and his performance is
                    intelligible only to mathematicians. It is true, the academical education of the
                    young gentlemen of the French navy is such, that a great number of them may
                    acquire the preparatory knowledge that is necessary; and we are well informed
                    that, in this respect, the officers of the British navy are greatly inferior to
                    them.</p>
                <p>But this very circumstance has furnished to many persons an argument against the
                    utility of those performances. It is said, that “notwithstanding this superior
                    mathematical education, and the possession of those boasted performances of M.
                    Bouguer, the French are greatly inferior, in point of seamanship, to our
                    countrymen, who have not a page in their language to instruct them, and who
                    could not peruse it if they had.” Nay, so little do the French themselves seem
                    sensible of the advantage of these publications, that no person among them has
                    attempted to make a familiar abridgment of them, written in a way fitted to
                    attract attention; and they still remain neglected in their original abstruse
                    and uninteresting form.</p>
                <p>We wish that we could give a satisfactory answer to this observation. It is just,
                    and it is important. These very ingenious and learned dissertations are by no
                    means so useful as we should expect. They are large books, and appear<pb
                    break="no" facs="ht:chi.28490924&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=48"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0720-0048-0034"/> to contain much; and as their plan is logical, it
                    seems to occupy the whole subject, and therefore to have done almost all that
                    can be done. But, alas! they have only opened the subject, and the study is yet
                    in its infancy. The whole science of the art must proceed on the knowledge of
                    the impulsions of the wind and water. These are the forces which act on the
                    machine; and its motions, which are the ultimatum of our research, whether as an
                    end to be obtained or as a thing to be prevented, must depend on these forces.
                    Now it is with respect to this fundamental point that we are as yet almost
                    totally in the dark. And in the performances of M. Bouguer, as also in those of
                    the other authors we have named, the theory of these forces, by which their
                    quantity and the direction of their action are ascertained, is altogether
                    erroneous; and its results deviate so enormously from what is observed in the
                    motions of a ship, that the persons who should direct the operations on
                    shipboard, in conformity to the maxims deducible from M. Bouguer’s propositions,
                    would be baffled in most of his attempts, and be in danger of losing the ship.
                    The whole proceeds on the supposed truth of that theory which states the impulse
                    of a fluid to be in the proportion of the square of the sine of the angle of
                    incidence; and that its action on any small portion, such as a square foot of
                    the sails or hull, is the same as if that portion were detached from the rest,
                    and were exposed, single and alone, to the wind or water in the same angle. But
                    we have shewn, in the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Resistance of Fluids,</hi>
                    both from theory and experience, that both of these principles are erroneous,
                    and this to a very great degree, in cases which occur most frequently in
                    practice, that is, in the small angles of inclination. When the wind falls
                    nearly perpendicular on the sails, theory is not very erroneous; but in these
                    cases, the circumstances of the ship’s situation are generally such that the
                    practice is easy, occurring almost without thought; and in this case too, even
                    considerable deviations from the very best practice are of no great moment. The
                    interesting cases, where the intended movement requires or depends upon very
                    oblique actions of the wind on the sails, and its practicability or
                    impracticability depends on a very small variation of this obliquity; a mistake
                    of the force, either as to intensity or direction, produces a mighty effect on
                    the resulting motion. This is the case in sailing to windward, the most
                    important of all the general problems of seamanship. The trim of the sails, and
                    the course of the ship, so as to gain most on the wind, are very nice things;
                    that is, they are confined within very narrow limits, and a small mistake
                    produces a very considerable effect. The same thing obtains in many of the nice
                    problems of tacking, box-hauling, wearing after lying-to in a storm, &amp;c.</p>
                <p>The error in the second assertion of the theory is still greater, and the action
                    on one part of the sail or hull is so greatly modified by its action on another
                    adjoining part, that a stay-sail is often seen hanging like a loose rag,
                    although there is nothing between it and the wind; and this merely because a
                    great sail in its neighbourhood sends off a lateral stream of wind, which
                    completely hinders the wind from getting at it. Till the theory of the action of
                    fluids be established, therefore, we cannot tell what are the forces which are
                    acting on every point of the sail and hull; therefore we cannot tell either the
                    mean intensity or direction of the whole force which acts on any particular
                    sail, nor the intensity and mean direction of the resistance to the hull;
                    circumstances absolutely necessary for enabling us to say what will be their
                    energy in producing a rotation round any particular axis. In like manner, we
                    cannot, by such a computation, find the spontaneous axis of conversion, (see <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Rotation),</hi> or the velocity of such conversion. In short,
                    we cannot pronounce with tolerable confidence <hi rend="italic">a priori</hi>
                    what will be the motions in any case, or what dispositions of the sails will
                    produce the movement we wish to per orm. The experienced seaman learns by habit
                    the general effects of every disposition of the sails; and though his knowledge
                    is far from being accurate, it seldom leads him into any very blundering
                    operation. Perhaps he seldom makes the best adjustment possible, but seldomer
                    still does he deviate very far from it; and in the most general and important
                    problems, such as working to windward, the result of much experience and many
                    corrections has settled a trim of the sails, which is certainly not far from the
                    truth, but, it must be acknowledged, deviates widely and uniformly from the
                    theories of the mathematician’s closet. The honest tar, therefore, must be
                    indulged in his joke on the useless labours of the mathematician, who can
                    neither hand, reef, nor steer.</p>
                <p>After this account of the theoretical performances in the art of seamanship, and
                    what we have said in another place on the small hopes we entertain of seeing a
                    perfect theory of the impulse of fluids, it will not be expected that we enter
                    very minutely on the subject in this place; nor is it our intention. But let it
                    be observed that the theory is defective in one point only; and although this is
                    a most important point, and the errors in it destroy the conclusions of the
                    chief propositions, the reasonings remain in full force, and the <hi
                    rend="italic">modus operandi</hi> is precisely such as is stated in the theory.
                    The <hi rend="italic">principles</hi> of the art are therefore to be found in
                    these treatises; but false inferences have been drawn, by computing from
                    erroneous quantities. The rules and the practice of the computation, however,
                    are still beyond controversy. Nay, since the process of investigation is
                    legitimate, we may make use of it in order to discover the very circumstance in
                    which we are at present mistaken; for by converting the proposition, instead of
                    finding the motions by means of the supposed forces, combined with the known
                    mechanism, we may discover the forces by means of this mechanism and the
                    observed motions.</p>
                <p>We shall therefore in this place give a very general view' of the movements of a
                    ship under sail, showing how they are produced and modified by the action of the
                    wind on her sails, the water on her rudder and on her bows. We shall not attempt
                    a precise determination of any of these movements; but we shall say enough to
                    enable the curious landsman to understand how this mighty machine is managed
                    amidst the fury of the winds and waves; and, what is more to our wish, we hope
                    to enable the uninstructed but thinking seaman, to generalise that knowledge
                    which he possesses; to class his ideas, and give them a sort of rational system;
                    and even to improve his practice, by making him sensible of the immediate
                    operation of every thing he does, and in what manner it contributes to produce
                    the movement which he has in view.</p>
                <p>A ship may be considered at present as a mass of inert matter in free space, at
                    liberty to move in every direction, according to the forces which impel or
                    resist her; and when she is in actual motion, in the direction of her course, we
                    may still consider her as at rest in absolute space,'but exposed to the impulse
                    of a current of water moving equally fast in the opposite direction; for in both
                    cases the pressure of the water on her bows is the same; and we know that it is
                    possible, and frequently happens in currents, that the impulse of the wind on
                    her sails, and that of the water on her bows, balance each other so precisely,
                    that she not only does not stir from the place, but also remains steadily in the
                    same position, with her head directed to the same point of the compass. This
                    state of things is easily conceived by any person accustomed to consider
                    mechanical subjects, and every seaman of experience has observed it. It is of
                    importance to consider it in this point of view, because it gives us the most
                    familiar notion of the manner in which these forces of the wind and water are
                    set in opposition, and made to balance or not to balance each other by the
                    intervention of the ship, in the same manner as the<pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:chi.28490924&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=49" xml:id="kp-eb0720-0049-0035"/>
                    goods and the weights balance each other in the scales by the intervention of a
                    beam or steelyard.</p>
                <p>When a ship proceeds steadily in her course, without changing her rate of
                    sailing, or varying the direction of her head, we must in the first place
                    conceive the accumulated impulses of the wind on all her sails as precisely
                    equal and directly opposite to the impulse of the water on her bows. In the next
                    place, because the ship does not change the direction of her keel, she resembles
                    the balanced steelyard, in which the energies of the two weights, which tend to
                    produce rotations in opposite directions, and thus to change the position of the
                    beam, mutually balance each other round the fulcrum; so the energies of the
                    actions of the wind on the different sails balance the energies of the water on
                    the different parts of the hull.</p>
                <p>The seaman has two principal tasks to perform. The first is to keep the ship
                    steadily in that course which will bring her farthest on in the line of her
                    intended voyage. This is frequently very different from that line, and the
                    choice of the best course is sometimes a matter of considerable difficulty. It
                    is sometimes possible to shape the course precisely along the line of the
                    voyage; and yet the intelligent seaman knows that he will arrive sooner, or with
                    greater safety, at his port, by taking a different course; because he will gain
                    more by increasing his speed than he loses by increasing the distance. Some
                    principle must direct him in the selection of this course. This we must attempt
                    to lay before the reader.</p>
                <p>Having chosen such a course as he thinks most advantageous, he must set such a
                    quantity of sail as the strength of the wind will allow him to carry with safety
                    and effect, and must trim the sails properly, or so adjust their positions to
                    the direction of the wind, that they may have the greatest possible tendency to
                    impel the ship in the line of her course, and to keep her steadily in that
                    direction.</p>
                <p>His other task is to produce any deviations which he sees proper from the present
                    course of the ship; and to produce these in the most certain, the safest, and
                    the most expeditious manner. It is chiefly in this movement that the mechanical
                    nature of a ship comes into view, and it is here that the superior address and
                    resources of an expert seaman is to be perceived.</p>
                <p>Under the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Sailing,</hi> some notice has been taken
                    of the first task of the seaman, and it was there shown how a ship, after having
                    taken up her anchor and fitted her sails, accelerates her motion, by degrees
                    which continually diminish, till the increasing resistance of the water becomes
                    precisely equal to the diminished impulse of the wind, and then the motion
                    continues uniformly the same, so long as the wind continues to blow with the
                    same force, and in the same direction.</p>
                <p>It is perfectly consonant to experience, that the impulse of fluids is in the
                    duplicate ratio of the relative velocity. Let it be supposed that when water
                    moves one foot per second, its perpendicular pressure or impulse on a square
                    foot is <hi rend="italic">m</hi> pounds. Then, if it be moving with the velocity
                    V estimated in feet per second, its perpendicular impulse on a surface S,
                    containing any number of square feet, must be <hi rend="italic">m</hi> SV <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 2</hi>.</p>
                <p>In like manner, the impulse of air on the same surface Way be represented by <hi
                    rend="italic">n</hi> SV <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi>; and the proportion of
                    the impulse of these two fluids will be that of <hi rend="italic">m</hi> to <hi
                    rend="italic">n</hi>. We may express this by the ratio of <hi rend="italic"
                    >q</hi> to 1, making <hi rend="superscript"> m</hi> / <hi rend="subscript">
                    n</hi> = <hi rend="italic">q.</hi></p>
                <p>M. Bouguer’s computations and tables are on the supposition that the impulse of
                    sea-water moving one foot per second is twenty-three ounces on a square foot,
                    and that the impulse of the wind is the same when it blows at the rate of
                    twenty-four feet per second. These measures are all French. They by no means
                    agree with the experiments of others; and what we have already said, when
                    treating of the <hi rend="smallcaps">Resisttance of Fluids</hi>, is enough to
                    show us that nothing like precise measures can be expected. It was shown, as the
                    result of a rational investigation, and confirmed by the experiments of Buat and
                    others, that the impulsions and resistances at the same surface, with the same
                    obliquity of incidence, and the same velocity of motion, are different according
                    to the form and situation of the adjoining parts. Thus the total resistance of a
                    thin board is greater than that of a long prism, having this board for its front
                    or bow, &amp;c.</p>
                <p>We are greatly at a loss what to give as absolute measures of these
                    impulsions.</p>
                <p>1. With respect to water. The experiments of the French academy on a prism two
                    feet broad and deep, and four feet long, indicate a resistance of 0∙973 pounds
                    avoirdupois to a square foot, moving with the velocity of one foot per second at
                    the surface of still water.</p>
                <p>Mr. Buat’s experiments on a square foot wholly immersed in a stream, were as
                    follow:</p>
                <p>A square foot as a thin plate l∙8l pounds</p>
                <p>Ditto as the front of a box one foot long..l∙42</p>
                <p>Ditto as the front of a box three feet long.l∙29</p>
                <p>The resistance of sea water is about <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> / <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 25</hi> greater.</p>
                <p>2. With respect to air the varieties are as great. The resistance of a square
                    foot to air moving with the velocity of one foot per second, appears from Mr.
                    Robins’s experiments on sixteen square inches to be, on a square foot 0∙001596
                    pounds.</p>
                <p>Chevalier Borda’s on sixteen inches 0·001757</p>
                <p>on eighty-one inches 0·002042</p>
                <p>Mr. Rouse’s on large surfaces 0∙002291</p>
                <p>Precise measures are not to be expected, nor are they necessary in this inquiry.
                    Here we are chiefly interested in their proportions, as they may be varied by
                    their mode of action in the different circumstances of obliquity and
                    velocity.</p>
                <p>We begin by recurring to the fundamental proposition concerning the impulse of
                    fluids, viz. that the absolute pressure is always in a direction perpendicular
                    to the impelled surface, whatever may be the direction of the stream of fluid.
                    We must therefore illustrate the doctrine, by always supposing a fiat surface of
                    sail stretched on a yard, which can be braced about in any direction, and giving
                    this sail such a position and such an extent of surface, that the impulse on it
                    may be the same, both as to direction and intensity, with that on the real
                    sails. Thus the consideration is greatly simplified. The direction of the
                    impulse is therefore perpendicular to the yard. Its intensity depends on the
                    velocity with which the wind meets the sail, and the obliquity of its stroke. We
                    shall adopt the constructions founded on the common doctrine, that the impulse
                    is as the square of the sine of the inclination, because they are simple;
                    whereas, if we w ere to introduce the values of the oblique impulses, such as
                    they have been observed in the excellent experiments of the Academy of Paris,
                    the constructions would be complicated in the extreme, and we could hardly draw
                    any consequences which would be intelligible to any but expert mathematicians.
                    The conclusions will be erroneous, not in kind but in quantity only; and we
                    shall point out the necessary corrections, so that the final results will be
                    found not very different from real observation.</p>
                <p>If a ship were a round cylindrical body like a flat tub, floating on its bottom,
                    and fitted with a mast and sail in the centre, she would always sail in a
                    direction perpendicular to the yard. This is evident. But she is an oblong body,
                    and may be compared to a chest, whose length greatly exceeds its breadth. She is
                    so shaped, that a moderate force will push her through the water with the head
                    or stern foremost; but it requires a very great force to push her sideways with
                    the same velocity. A fine sailing ship of<pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:chi.28490924&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=50" xml:id="kp-eb0720-0050-0036"/>
                    war will require about twelve times as much force to push her sideways as to
                    push her head foremost. In this respect, therefore, she will very much resemble
                    a chest whose length is twelve times its breadth; and whatever be the proportion
                    of these resistances in different ships, we may always substitute a box which
                    shall have the same resistances headways and sideways.</p>
                <p>Let EFGH (fig. 1.) be the horizontal section of such a box, and AB its middle
                    line, and C its centre. In whatever direction this box may chance to move, the
                    direction of the whole re sistance on its two sides will pass through C. For as
                    the whole stream has one inclination to the side</p>
                <p>EF, the equivalent of the equal impulses on every part will be in a line
                    perpendicular to the middle of EF. For the same reason, it will be in a line
                    perpendicular to the middle of FG. These perpendiculars must cross in C. Suppose
                    a mast erected at C, and YC,y to be a yard hoisted on it carrying a sail. Let
                    the yard be first conceived as braced right athwart at right angles to the keel,
                    as represented by Y'y'. Then, whatever be the direction of the wind abaft this
                    sail, it will impel the vessel in the direction CB. But if the sail has the
                    oblique position Yy, the impulse will be in the direction CD perpendicular to
                    CY, and will both push the vessel ahead and sideways: For the impulse CD is
                    equivalent to the two impulses CK and CI (the sides of a rectangle of which CD
                    is the diagonaD. The force CI pushes the vessel ahead, and CK pushes her
                    sideways. She must therefore take some intermediate direction <hi rend="italic"
                    >ab,</hi> such that the resistance of the water to the plane FG is to its
                    resistance to the plane EF as CI to CK.</p>
                <p>The angle <hi rend="italic">b</hi> CB between the real course and the direction
                    of the head is called the leeway; and in the course of this dissertation we
                    shall express it by the symbol <hi rend="italic">x.</hi> It evidently depends on
                    the shape of the vessel and on the position of the yard. An accurate knowledge
                    of the quantity of leeway, corresponding to different circumstances of obliquity
                    of impulse, extent of surface, &amp;c. is of the utmost importance in the
                    practice of navigation; and even an approximation is valuable. The subject is so
                    very difficult that this must content us for the present.</p>
                <p>Let V be the velocity of the ship in the direction <hi rend="italic">Cb,</hi> and
                    let the surfaces FG and FE be called A' and B'. Then the resistance to the
                    lateral motion is mV’ χ B' × sine <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi>, <hi
                    rend="italic">b</hi> CB, and that to the direct motion is mV’ × A'× sine <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 2</hi>, bCK, or mV’ × A' ×cos <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi>
                    bCB. Therefore these resistances are in the proportion of B' × sine’, <hi
                    rend="italic">x</hi> to A' × cos.’, <hi rend="italic">x</hi> (representing the
                    angle of leeway bCB by the symbol <hi rend="italic">x).</hi></p>
                <p>Therefore we have CI: CK, or CI: ID=A'∙cos. <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> x:
                    B'∙</p>
                <p>sine’*, =A': =A': B'∙ tangent <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> x.</p>
                <p>cos.*</p>
                <p>Let the angle YCB, to which the yard is braced up, be called the trim of the
                    sails, and expressed by the symbol <hi rend="italic">b.</hi> This is the
                    complement of the angle DCI. Now CI: ID=rad.: tan. DCI, =1: tan. DCI, = hcotan.
                    <hi rend="italic">b.</hi> Therefore we have finally 1: cotan. b=A': B <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ,</hi> ∙ tan. <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> x, and A'∙</p>

                    and tan. <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> x= <hi rend="superscript"> A'</hi> / <hi
                    rend="subscript"> B'</hi> cot. <hi rend="italic">b.</hi> This equation evidently
                    ascertains the mutual relation between the trim of the sails and the leeway, in
                    every case where we can tell the proportion between the resistances to the
                    direct and broadside motions of the ship, and where this proportion does not
                    change by the obliquity of the course. Thus, suppose the yard braced up to an
                    angle of 30° with the keel. Then cotan. 30° =1∙732 very nearly. Suppose also
                    that the resistance sideways is twelve times greater than the resistance
                    headways. This gives A'=l and B'=12. Therefore</p>
                <p>1·732=12 × tangent <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> x, and tangent <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 2</hi> x = <hi rend="superscript"> 1·732</hi> / <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 12</hi>, =0·14434, and tan. *=0∙3799, and *=20’ 48', very
                    nearly two points of leeway.</p>
                <p>This computation, or rather the equation which gives room for it, supposes the
                    resistances proportional to the squares of the sines of incidence. The
                    experiments of the Academy of Paris, of which an abstract is given in the
                    article <hi rend="smallcaps">Resistance of Fluids,</hi> show that this
                    supposition is not far from the truth when the angle of incidence is great. In
                    the present case the angle of incidence on the front FG is about 70°, and the
                    experiments just now mentioned, show that the real resistances exceed the
                    theoretical ones only <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> / <hi rend="subscript">
                    150</hi>. But the angle of incidence on EF is only 20° 48'. Experiment shows
                    that in this inclination the resistance is almost quadruple of the theoretical
                    resistances. Therefore the lateral resistance is assumed much too small in the
                    present instance. Therefore a much smaller leeway will suffice for producing a
                    lateral resistance which will balance the lateral impulse CK, arising from the
                    obliquity of the sail, viz. 30°. The matter of fact is, that a pretty good
                    sailing ship, with her sails braced to this angle at a medium, will not make
                    above five or six degrees leeway in smooth water and easy weather; and yet in
                    this situation the hull and rigging present a very great surface to the wind, in
                    the most improper positions, so as to have a very great effect in increasing her
                    leeway. And if we compute the resistances for this leeway of six degrees by the
                    actual experiments of the French Academy on the angle, we shall find the result
                    not far from the truth; that is, the direct and lateral resistances will be
                    nearly in the proportion of CI to ID.</p>
                <p>It results from this view of the matter, that the leeway is in general much
                    smaller than what the usual theory assigns. We also see, that according to
                    whatever law the resistances change by a change of inclination, the leeway
                    remains the same while the trim of the sails is the same. The leeway depends
                    only on the direction of the impulse of the wind; and this depends solely on the
                    position of the sails with respect to the keel, whatever may be the direction of
                    the wind. This is a very important observation, and will be frequently referred
                    to in the progress of the present investigation. Note, however, that we are here
                    considering only the action on the sails, and on the same sails. We are not
                    considering the action of the wind on the hull and rigging. This may be very
                    considerable; and it is always in a lee direction, and augments the leeway; and
                    its influence must be so much the more sensible, as it bears a greater
                    proportion to the impulse on the sails. A ship under courses, or close-reefed
                    topsails and courses, must make more leeway than when under all her canvass,
                    trimmed to the same angle. But to introduce this additional cause of deviation
                    here, would render the investigation too complicated to be of any use.</p>
                <p>This doctrine will be considerably illustrated by attending to the manner in
                    which a lighter is tracked along a canal, or swings to its anchor in a
                    stream.</p>
                <p>The track-rope is made fast to some staple or bolt E on the deck (fig. 2), and is
                    passed between two of the timber-heads of the bow D, and laid hold of at F on
                    shore. The men or cattle walk along the path FG, the rope keeps extended in the
                    direction DF, and the lighter arranges itself in an oblique position AB, and is
                    thus dragged along in the direction <hi rend="italic">ab,</hi> parallel to the
                    side of the canal. Or, if the canal has a current in the opposite direction <hi
                    rend="italic">ba,</hi> the lighter may be kept steady in its place by the rope
                    DF mode fast to a post at F. In this case, it is always observed, that the
                    lighter swings<pb break="no" facs="ht:chi.28490924&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=51"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0720-0051-0037"/> in a position AB, which is oblique to the stream
                    <hi rend="italic">ab.</hi> Now, the force which retains it in this position, and
                    which precisely balances the action of the stream, is certainly exerted in the
                    direction DF; and the lighter would be held in the same manner if the rope were
                    made fast at C amidship, without any dependence on the timberheads at D; and it
                    would be held in the same position, if, instead of the single rope CF, it were
                    riding by two ropes CG and CH, of which CH is in a direction right ahead, but
                    oblique to the stream, and the other CG is perpendicular to CH or AB. And,
                    drawing DI and DK perpendicular to AB and CG, the strain on the rope CH is to
                    that on the rope CG as CI to CK. The action of the rope in these cases is
                    precisely analogous to that of the sail y Y; and the obliquity of the keel to
                    the direction of the motion, or to the direction of the stream, is analogous to
                    the leeway. All this must be evident to any person accustomed to mechanical
                    disquisitions.</p>
                <p>A most important use may be made of this illustration. If an accurate model be
                    made of a ship, and if it be placed in a stream of water, and ridden in this
                    manner by a rope mode fast at any point D of the bow, it will arrange itself in
                    some determined position AB. There will be a certain obliquity to the stream,
                    measured by the angle B <hi rend="italic">ob,∙</hi> and there will be a
                    corresponding obliquity of the rope, measured by the angle FCB. Let <hi
                    rend="italic">yC</hi> Y be perpendicular to CF. Then CY will be the position of
                    the yard, or trim of the sails corresponding to the leeway bCB. Then, if we
                    shift the rope to a point of the bow distant from D by a small quantity, we
                    shall obtain a new position of the ship, both with respect to the stream and
                    rope; and in this way may be obtained the relation between the position of the
                    sails and the leeway, independent of all theory, and susceptible of great
                    accuracy; and this may be done with a variety of models suited to the most usual
                    forms of ships.</p>
                <p>In further thinking on this subject, we are persuaded that these experiments,
                    instead of being made on models, may with equal ease be made on a ship of any
                    size. Let the ship ride in a stream at a mooring D (fig. 3), by means of a short
                    haw ser BCD from her bow, having a spring</p>
                <p>AC on it carried out from her quarter. She will swing to her moor ings, till she
                    ranges herself in a certain position AB with respect to the direction <hi
                    rend="italic">ba</hi> of the stream; and the direction of the hawser DC will
                    point to some point E of the line of the keel. Now, it is plain to any person
                    acquainted with mechanical disquisitions, that the deviation BE6 is precisely
                    the leeway that the ship will make when the average position of the sails is
                    that of the line GEH perpendicular to ED; at least this will give the leeway
                    which is produced by the sails alone. By heaving on the spring, the knot C may
                    be brought into any other position we please; and for every new position of the
                    knot the ship will take a new position with respect to the stream and to the
                    hawser. And we persist in saying, that more information will be got by this
                    train of experiments than from any mathematical theory: for all the theories of
                    the impulses of fluids must proceed on physical postulates with respect to the
                    motions of the filaments, which are exceedingly conjectural.</p>
                <p>And it must now be farther observed, that the substitution which we have made of
                    an oblong parallelopiped for a ship, although well suited to give us clear
                    notions of the subject, is of small use in practice; for it is next to
                    impossible (even granting the theory of oblique impulsions) to make this
                    substitution. A ship is of a form which is not reducible to equations; and
                    therefore the action of the water on her bow or broadside can only be had by a
                    most laborious and intricate calculation for almost every square foot of its
                    surface.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Bezout’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Court de Mathem.</hi> vol. v. p. 72, &amp;c.</p></note> And this
                    must be different for every ship. But, which is more unlucky, when we have got a
                    parallelopiped which will have the same proportion of direct and lateral
                    resistance for a particular angle of leeway, it will not answer for another
                    leeway of the same ship; for when the leeway changes, the figure actually
                    exposed to the action of the water changes also. When the leeway is increased,
                    more of the lee-quarter is acted on by the water, and a part of the weather-bow
                    is now removed from its action. Another parallelopiped must therefore be
                    discovered, whose resistances shall suit this new position of the keel with
                    respect to the real course of the ship.</p>
                <p>We therefore beg leave to recommend this train of experiments to the notice of
                    the Association for the Improvement of Naval Architecture, as a very promising
                    method for ascertaining this important point<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>This society was instituted on the 14th of April 1791, in
                    consequence of the patriotic and energetic endeavours of Mr. J. Sewell, a
                    bookseller of Cornhill, who was proprietor of the European Magazine, the coven
                    of which periodical he had for a long time previous to this date, gratuitously
                    devoted to the reception of communications for the improvement of naval
                    architecture. The society consisted of about one hundred and fifty noblemen and
                    gentlemen, and numbered among its members some of the most distinguished men in
                    the kingdom. His late Majesty was the president. The Earls Stanhope, Leicester,
                    and Uxbridge, Lords Radnor and Mulgrave, Sir John Borlase Warren, Sir Joseph
                    Banks, and Sir Charles Middleton, were vice-presidents. Unfortunately its
                    energies were expended in the futile examination of plans, to the neglect of the
                    more sure course for the improvement of an infant science—the investigation of
                    principles. The consequence was, that dissatisfied at the absence of all useful
                    results from their labours, the members gradually ceased to take an interest in
                    them, and the society fell to pieces, without, we believe, any formal
                    dissolution. Had the members adopted the suggestions of Professor Robison, and
                    their energies and resources been directed by bis talents and experience, how
                    different might have been the result!</p></note> And we proceed, in the next
                    place, to ascertain the relation between the velocity of the ship and that of
                    the wind, modified as they may be by the trim of the sails and the obliquity of
                    the impulse.</p>
                <p>Let AB (figs. 4, 5, and 6), represent the horizontal section of a ship. In place
                    of all the drawing sails, that is, the sails which are really filled, we can
                    always substitute one sail of equal extent, trimmed to the same angle with the
                    keel. This being supposed attached to the yard DCD, let this yard be first of
                    all at right angles to the keel, as represented in fig. 4. Let the wind blow in
                    the direction WC, and let CE (in the direction WC continued) represent the
                    velocity V of the wind. Let CF be the velocity <hi rend="italic">V</hi> of the
                    ship. It must also be in the direction of the ship’s motion, because when the
                    sail is at right angles to the keel, the absolute impulse on the sail is in the
                    direction of the keel, and there is no lateral impulse, and consequently no
                    leeway. Draw EF, and complete the parallelogram CFEe, producing <hi
                    rend="italic">eC</hi> through the centre of the yard to <hi rend="italic"
                    >w.</hi> Then wC will be the relative or apparent direction of the wind, and Ce
                    or FE will be its apparent or relative velocity. For if the line Ce be carried
                    along CF, keeping always parallel to its first position, and if a particle of
                    air move uniformly along CE (a fixed line in absolute space) in the same time,
                    this particle will always be found in that point of CE, where it is intersected
                    at that instant by the moving line Ce; so that if Ce were a tube, the particle
                    of air, which<pb break="no" facs="ht:chi.28490924&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=52"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0720-0052-0038"/> really moves in the line CE, would always be
                    found in the tube <hi rend="italic">Ce.</hi> While CE is the real direction of
                    the wind, Ce will be the position of the vane at the mast head, which will
                    therefore mark the apparent direction of the wind, or its motion relative to the
                    moving ship.</p>
                <p>We may conceive this in another way. Suppose a cannon-shot fired in the direction
                    CE at the passing ship, and that it passes through the mast at C with the
                    velocity of the wind. It will not pass through the off-side of the ship at P, in
                    the line CE; for while the shot moves from C to P, the point P has gone forward,
                    and the point <hi rend="italic">p</hi> is now in the place where P was when the
                    shot passed through the mast. The shot will therefore pass through the ship’s
                    side in the point <hi rend="italic">p,</hi> and a person on board seeing it pass
                    through C and <hi rend="italic">p</hi> will say that its motion was in the line
                    <hi rend="italic">Cp.</hi></p>
                <p>Thus it happens, that when a ship is in motion the apparent direction of the wind
                    is always ahead of its real direction. The line <hi rend="italic">wC</hi> is
                    always found within the angle WCB. It is easy to see from the construction, that
                    the difference between the real and apparent directions of the wind is so much
                    the more remarkable as the velocity of the ship is greater. For the angle WCw or
                    ECe depends on the magnitude of Ee or CF, in proportion to CE. Persons not much
                    accustomed to attend to these matters are apt to think all attention to this
                    difference to be nothing but affectation of nicety. They have no notion that the
                    velocity of a ship can have any sensible proportion to that of the wind. “Swift
                    as the wind,” is a proverbial expression; yet the velocity of a ship always
                    bears a very sensible proportion to that of the wind, and even very frequently
                    exceeds it. We may form a pretty exact notion of the velocity of the wind by
                    observing the shadows of the summer clouds flying along the face of a country,
                    and it may be very well measured by this method. The motion of such clouds
                    cannot be very different from that of the air below; and when the pressure of
                    the wind on a flat surface, while blowing with a velocity measured in this way,
                    is compared with its pressure when its velocity is measured by more
                    unexceptionable methods, they are found to agree with all desirable accuracy.
                    Now observations of this kind frequently repeated, show that what we call a
                    pleasant brisk gale blows at the rate of about ten miles an hour, or about
                    fifteen feet in a second, and exerts a pressure of half a pound on a square
                    foot. Mr. Smeaton has frequently observed the sails of a windmill, driven by
                    such a wind, moving faster, nay much faster, towards their extremities, so that
                    the sail, instead of being pressed to the frames on the arms, was taken aback,
                    and fluttering on them. Nay, we know that a good ship, with all her sails set,
                    and the wind on the beam, will in such a situation sail above ten knots an hour
                    in smooth water. There is an observation made by every experienced seaman, which
                    shows this difference between the real and apparent directions of the wind very
                    distinctly. When a ship that is sailing briskly with the wind on the beam tacks
                    about, and then sails equally well on the other tack, the wind always appears to
                    have shifted and come more ahead. This is familiar to all seamen. The seaman
                    judges of the direction of the wind by the position of the ship’s vanes. Suppose
                    the ship sailing due west on the starboard tack, with the wind apparently
                    N.N.W., the vane pointing S.S.E. If the ship put about, and stands due east on
                    the larboard tack, the vane will be found no longer to point S.S∙E., but perhaps
                    S.S.W., the wind appearing N.N.E., and the ship must be nearly close-hauled in
                    order to make an east course. The wind appears to have shifted four points. If
                    the ship tacks again, the wind returns to its old quarter. We have often
                    observed a greater difference than this. The celebrated astronomer Dr. Bradley,
                    taking the amusement of sailing in a pinnace on the river Thames, observed this,
                    and was surprised at it, imagining that the change of the wind was owing to the
                    approaching to or retiring from the shore. The boatmen told him that it always
                    happened at sea, and explained it to him in the best manner they were able. The
                    explanation struck him, and set him a musing on an astronomical phenomenon which
                    he had been puzzled by for some years, and which he called the aberration of the
                    fixed stars. Every star changes its place a small matter for half a year, and
                    returns to it at the completion of the year. He compared the stream of light
                    from the star to the wind, and the telescope of the astronomer to the ship’s
                    vane, while the earth was like the ship, moving in opposite directions when in
                    the opposite point of its orbit. The telescope must always be pointed ahead of
                    the real direction of the star, in the same manner as the vane is always in a
                    direction ahead of the wind; and thus he ascertained the progressive motion of
                    light, and discovered the proportion of its velocity to the velocity of the
                    earth in its orbit, by observing the deviation which was necessarily given to
                    the telescope. Observing that the light shifted its direction about 40", he
                    concluded its velocity to be about 11,000 times greater than that of the earth;
                    just as the intelligent seaman would conclude from this apparent shifting of the
                    wind, that the velocity of the wind is about triple that of the ship. This is
                    indeed the best method for discovering the velocity of the wind. Let the
                    direction of the vane at the mast-head be very accurately noticed on both tacks,
                    and let the velocity of the ship be also accurately measured. The angle between
                    the directions of the ship’s head on these different tacks being halved, will
                    give the real direction of the wind, which must be compared with the position of
                    the vane in order to determine the angle contained between the real and apparent
                    directions of the wind or the angle ECe; or half of the observed shifting of the
                    wind will show the inclination of its true and apparent directions. This being
                    found, the proportion of EC to FC (fig. 6), is easily measured.</p>
                <p>We have been very particular on this point, because since the mutual actions of
                    bodies depend on their relative motions only, we should make prodigious mistakes
                    if we estimated the action of the wind by its real direction and velocity, when
                    they differ so much from the relative or apparent.</p>
                <p>We now resume the investigation of the velocity of the ship (hg. 4), having its
                    sails at right angles to the keel, and the wind blowing in the direction and
                    with the velocity CE, while the ship proceeds in the direction of the keel with
                    the velocity CF. Produce Ee, which is parallel to BC, till it meet the yard in
                    <hi rend="italic">g,</hi> and draw FG perpendicular to <hi rend="italic"
                    >Εg.</hi> Let <hi rend="italic">a</hi> represent the angle WCD, contained
                    between the sail and the real direction of the wand, and let <hi rend="italic"
                    >b</hi> be the angle of trim DCB. CE, the velocity of the wind, was expressed by
                    V, and CF, the velocity of the ship, by <hi rend="italic">v</hi>.</p>
                <p>The absolute impulse on the sail is (by the usual theory) proportional to the
                    square of the relative velocity, and to the square of the sine of the angle of
                    incidence; that is, to FE <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> × sin. <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 2</hi> wCD. Now the angle GFE=wCD, and EG is equal to FE×
                    sin. GFE; and EG is equal to <hi rend="italic">Εg—gG.</hi> But <hi rend="italic"
                    >Eg=EC</hi> × sin. ECg, =V × sin.a; and gG=CF, = <hi rend="italic">v</hi>.
                    Therefore EG= V × sin. a— <hi rend="italic">v,</hi> and the impulse is
                    proportional to (V X sin. a—w) <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi>. If S represent
                    the surface of the sail, the impulse, in pounds, will be nS(V <hi rend="italic"
                    >×sin.a—v)</hi><hi rend="italic superscript"> 2</hi>.</p>
                <p>Let A be the surface which, when it meets the water perpendicularly with the
                    velocity <hi rend="italic">ν,</hi> will sustain the same pressure or resistance
                    which the bows of the ship actually meet with. This impulse, in pounds, will be
                    <hi rend="italic">m</hi> Av <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi>. Therefore, because
                    we are considering the ship’s motion as in a state of uniformity, the two
                    pressures balance each other; and therefore <hi rend="italic">m</hi> Av <hi

                    not always be true, therefore, that the velocity will increase as the wind is
                    more abaft, because some sails will then becalm others. This observation is not,
                    however, of great importance; for it is very unusual to put a ship in the

                <p>stant quantities, S is proportional to —-p, or the surface of sail is
                    proportional to the square of the ship’s velocity directly, and to the square of
                    the relative velocity inversely. Thus, if a ship be sailing with one-eighth of
                    the velocity of the wind, and we would have her sail with one-fourth of it, we
                    must quadruple the sail. This is more easily seen in another way. The velocity
                    of the ship is proportional to the velocity of the wind; and therefore the
                    relative velocity is also proportional to that of the wind, and the impulse of
                    the wind is as the square of the relative velocity. Therefore, in order to
                    increase the relative velocity by an increase of sail only, we must make this
                    increase of sail in the duplicate proportion of the increase of velocity.</p>
                <p>Let us, in the next place, consider the motion of a ship whose sails stand
                    oblique to the keel.</p>
                <p>The construction for this purpose differs a little from the former, because, when
                    the sails are trimmed to any oblique position DCB, (figs. 5 and C), there must
                    be a deviation from the direction of the keel, or a leeway BC <hi rend="italic"
                    >b</hi>. Call this <hi rend="italic">x.</hi> Let CF be the velocity of the ship.
                    Draw, as before, E <hi rend="italic">g</hi> perpendicular to the yard, and FG
                    perpendicular to Ε <hi rend="italic">g</hi> also, draw FH perpendicular to the
                    yard: then, as before, EG, which is in the subduplicate ratio of the impulse on
                    the sail, is equal to E <hi rend="italic">g</hi><hi rend="italic">—Gg.</hi> Now
                    E <hi rend="italic">g</hi> is, as before, = V ×sin.a, and G <hi rend="italic"
                    >g</hi> is equal to FH, which is = CF ×sin.FCH,or=v× sin.(b+x). Therefore we
                    have the impulse =nS(V∙ sin. a <hi rend="italic">—v ∙</hi> sin. (b + x)) <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 2</hi>.</p>
                <p>This expression of the impulse is perfectly similar to that in the former case,
                    its only difference consisting in the subduc-tive part, which is here <hi
                    rend="italic">v</hi> × sin. <hi rend="italic">∣&gt;+ x</hi> instead of <hi
                    rend="italic">v.</hi> But it expresses the same thing as be fore, viz. the
                    diminu tion of the impulse. The impulse being reckon ed solely in the direc tion
                    perpendicular to the sail, it is diminished solely by the sail with drawing
                    itself <hi rend="italic">in that di</hi><hi rend="italic smallcaps">
                    rection</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">from the wind;</hi> and as <hi rend="italic"
                    >g</hi> E may be con sidered as the real impulsive motion of the wind, GE must
                    be considered as the relative and effective impulsive motion. The impulse would
                    have been the same had the ship been at rest, and had the wind met it
                    perpendicularly with the velocity GE.</p>
                <p>We must now show the connexion between this impulse and the motion of the ship.
                    The sail, and consequently the ship, is pressed by the wind in the direction CI
                    perpendicular to the sail or yard with the force which we have just now
                    determined. This (in the state of uniform motion) must be equal and opposite to
                    the action of the water. Draw IL at right angles to the keel. The impulse in the
                    direction CI (which we may measure by CI) is equivalent to the impulses CL and
                    LI. By the first the ship is impelled right forward, and by the second she is
                    driven sideways. Therefore we must have a leeway, and a lateral as well as a
                    direct resistance. We suppose the form of the ship to be known, and therefore
                    the proportion is known, or discoverable, between the direct and lateral
                    resistances corresponding to every angle <hi rend="italic">x</hi> of leeway. Let
                    A be the surface whose perpendicular resistance is equal to the direct
                    resistance of the ship corresponding to the leeway <hi rend="italic">x,</hi>
                    that is, whose resistance is equal to the resistance really felt by the ship’s
                    bows in the direction of the keel when she is sailing with this leeway; and let
                    B in like manner be the surface whose perpendicular resistance is equal to the
                    actual resistance to the ship’s motion in the direction LI, perpendicular to the
                    keel. (This is not equivalent to A' and B' adapted to the rectangular box, but
                    to A'· cos. <hi rend="italic superscript"> 2</hi><hi rend="italic">x</hi> and

                    >x</hi> is also a number, for the same reason. And since <hi rend="italic"

                    number. And because C and S are surfaces, or quantities of one kind, is also a
                    common number.</p>
                <p>This is the simplest expression that we can think of for the velocity acquired by
                    the ship, though il; must be aknow-ledged to be too complex to be of very prompt
                    use. Its complication arises from the necessity of introducing the leeway <hi
                    rend="italic">x.</hi> This affects the whole of the denominator; for the surface
                    C depends on it, because C is = √A <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> + B <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ,</hi>, and A and B are analogous to A' cos. <hi

                    rend="italic superscript"> 3</hi><hi rend="italic">x.</hi></p>
                <p>But we can deduce some important consequences from this theorem.</p>
                <p>While the surface S of the sail actually filled by the wind remains the same, and
                    the angle DCB, which in future we shall call the trim of the sails, also remains
                    the same, both the leeway <hi rend="italic">x</hi> and the substituted surface C
                    remains the same. The denominator is therefore constant; and the velocity of the
                    ship is proportional to √S ∙ V ∙ sin. <hi rend="italic">a;</hi> that is,
                    directly as the velocity of the wind, directly as the absolute inclination of
                    the wind to the yard, and directly as the square root of the surface of the
                    sails.</p>
                <p>We also learn from the construction of the figure, that FG parallel to the yard
                    cuts CE in a given ratio. For CF is in a constant ratio to <hi rend="italic"
                    >Eg,</hi> as has been just now demonstrated. And the angle DCF is constant.
                    Therefore CF∙ sin. ft, or FH or <hi rend="italic">Gg,</hi> is proportional to
                    <hi rend="italic">Eg,</hi> and OC to EC, or EC is cut in one proportion,
                    whatever may be the angle ECD, so long as the angle DCF is constant.</p>
                <p>We also see that it is very possible for the velocity of the ship on an oblique
                    course to exceed that of the wind. This will be the case when the number — <hi
                    rend="strikethrough">s</hi> uua <hi rend="subscript"> ex</hi>.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">√ q</hi> g- + sin.ft + i ceeds unity, or when sin. α is greater
                    than¼∕Ç-S- + sin. ft+ <hi rend="italic">x.</hi></p>
                <p>Ö</p>
                <p>Now this may easily be by sufficiently enlarging S and diminishing <hi
                    rend="italic">b + x</hi>. It is indeed frequently seen in fine sailers with all
                    their sails set and not hauled too near the wind.</p>
                <p>We remarked above that the angle of leeway <hi rend="italic">x</hi> affects the
                    whole denominator of the fraction which expresses the velocity. Let it be
                    observed that the angle ICI. is the complement of LCD, or of ft. Therefore, CL:
                    LI, or A: B=I tan. ICL=I: cot. <hi rend="italic">b</hi>, and B=A ∙ cotan. b. Now
                    A is equivalent to A' ∙ cos. <hi rend="italic superscript"> 3</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">x,</hi> and thus ft becomes a function of <hi rend="italic"
                    >x.</hi></p>
                <p>C is evidently so, being <hi rend="smallcaps">&lt;∖Za</hi><hi rend="superscript
                    smallcaps"> 2</hi>-(- B <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi>. Therefore before the
                    value of this fraction can be obtained, we must be able to compute, by our
                    knowledge of the form of the ship, the value of A for every angle <hi
                    rend="italic">x</hi> of leeway. This can be done only by resolving her bows into
                    a great number of elementary planes, and computing the impulses on each and
                    adding them into one sum. The computation is of immense labour, as may be seen
                    by one example given by Bouguer. When the leeway is but small, not exceeding ten
                    degrees, the substitution of the rectangular prism of one determined form is
                    abundantly exact for all leeways contained within this limit; and we shall soon
                    see reason for being contented with this approximation. We may now make use of
                    the formula expressing the velocity for solving the chief problems in this part
                    of the seaman’s task.</p>
                <p>And first let it be required to determine the best position of the sail for
                    standing on a given course <hi rend="italic">ab</hi>, when CE the direction and
                    velocity of the wind, and its angle with the course WCF, are given. This problem
                    has exercised the talents of the mathematicians ever since the days of Newton.
                    In the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Pneumatics</hi> we gave the solution of one
                    very nearly related to it, namely, to determine the position of the sail which
                    would produce the greatest impulse in the direction of the course. The solution
                    was to place the yard CD in such a position that the tangent of the angle FCD
                    may be one half of the tangent of the angle DCW. This will indeed be the best
                    position of the sail for beginning the motion; but as soon as the ship begins to
                    move in the direction CF, the effective impulse of the wind is diminished, and
                    also its inclination to the sail. The angle DC <hi rend="italic">w</hi>
                    diminishes continually as the ship accelerates; for CF is now accompanied by its
                    equal eE, and by an angle ECe, or WC <hi rend="italic">w</hi>. CF increases, and
                    the impulse on the sail diminishes, till an equilibrium obtains between the
                    resistance of the water and the impulse of the wand. The impulse is now measured
                    by CE <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> × sin. <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> eCD
                    instead of CE <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> × sin. <hi rend="superscript">
                    2</hi> ECD, that is, by EG <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> instead of Eg <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 2</hi>.</p>
                <p>This introduction of the relative motion of the wind renders the actual solution
                    of the problem extremely difficult. It is very easily expressed geometrically:
                    Divide the angle wCF in such a manner that the tangent of DCF may be half of the
                    tangent of DCιe, and the problem may be constructed geometrically as
                    follows.</p>
                <p>Let WCF (fig. 7∙) be the angle between the sail and course. Round the centre C
                    describe the circle WDFY; produce WC to Q, so that CQ=iWC, and draw QY parallel
                    to CF cutting the circle in Y; bisect the arch WY in D, and draw DC. DC is the
                    proper position of the yard.</p>
                <p>Draw the cord WY, cutting CD in V and CF in T; draw the tangent PD, cutting CF in
                    S and CY in R.</p>
                <p>It is evident that WY, PR, are both perpendicular to CD, and are bisected in V
                    and D; therefore (by reason of the parallels QY, CF) 4: 3=QW: CW,=YW: TW, RP:
                    SP. Therefore</p>
                <p>PD: PS=2: 3, and PD:DS=2:l. Q.E.D.</p>
                <p>But this division cannot be made to the best advantage till the ship has attained
                    its greatest velocity, and the angle <hi rend="italic">w</hi> CF has been
                    produced.</p>
                <p>We must consider all the three angles, <hi rend="italic">a</hi>, <hi
                    rend="italic">b</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">x,</hi> as variable in the equation
                    which expresses the value of V, and we must make the fluxion of this equation=0;
                    then, by means of the equation B=A∙ contan. <hi rend="italic">b</hi>, we must
                    obtain the value of ft and of <hi rend="italic">b</hi> in terms of <hi
                    rend="italic">x</hi> and x. With respect to <hi rend="italic">a,</hi> observe,
                    that if we make the angle WCF= <hi rend="italic">p</hi>, we have <hi
                    rend="italic">p=a+b+x∙,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">p</hi> being a constant
                    quantity, we have a+b+x=0∙ Substituting for <hi rend="italic">a,</hi> ft, a, and
                    <hi rend="italic">b</hi>, their values in terms of <hi rend="italic">x</hi> and
                    a?, in the fluxionary equation=0, we readily obtain <hi rend="italic">x,</hi>
                    and then <hi rend="italic">a</hi> and 6, which solves the problem.</p>
                <p>Let it be required, in the next place, to determine the course and the trim of
                    the sails most proper for plying to windward.</p>
                <p>In fig. 6, draw FP perpendicular to WC. CF is the motion of the ship; but it is
                    only by the motion PC that she gains to windward. Now CP is=CF × cosin. WCF, or
                    <hi rend="italic">V</hi> cosin. (a+b+x). This must be rendered a maximum, as
                    follows.</p>
                <p>By means of the equation which expresses the value of <hi rend="italic">v</hi>
                    and the equation B=A∙ cotan. <hi rend="italic">b</hi>, we exterminate the
                    quantities <hi rend="italic">v</hi> and ft; we then take the fluxion of the
                    quantity into which the expression <hi rend="italic">ν∙</hi> cos. (a+b+x) is
                    changed by this operation. Making this fluxion=0, we get the equation which must
                    solve the problem. This equation will contain the two variable quantities <hi
                    rend="italic">a</hi> and <hi rend="italic">x</hi> with their flux-<pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:chi.28490924&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=55" xml:id="kp-eb0720-0055-0041"/>
                    ions; then make the coefficient of <hi rend="italic">x</hi> equal to 0, also the
                    coefficient of <hi rend="italic">a</hi> equal to 0. This will give two
                    equations, which will determine <hi rend="italic">a</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >x,</hi> and from this we get <hi rend="italic">b=p—a—x.</hi></p>
                <p>Should it be required, in the third place, to find the best course and trim of
                    the sails for getting away from a given line of coast CM (fig. 6.), the process
                    perfectly resembles this last, which is in fact getting away from a line of
                    coast which makes a right angle with the wind. Therefore, in place of the angle
                    WCF, we must substitute the angle WCM±WCF. Call this angle <hi rend="italic"
                    >e.</hi> We must make v∙cos. (<hi rend="italic">e</hi> ± <hi rend="italic"
                    >a</hi> ± <hi rend="italic">b</hi> ± <hi rend="italic">x</hi>) a maximum. The
                    analytical process is the same as the former, only <hi rend="italic">e</hi> is
                    here a constant quantity.</p>
                <p>These are the three principal problems which can be solved by means of the
                    knowledge that we have obtained of the motion of the ship when impelled by an
                    oblique sail, and therefore making leeway; and they may be considered as an
                    abstract of this part of M. Bouguer’s work. We have only pointed out the process
                    for this solution, and have even omitted some things taken notice of by M.
                    Bezout in his very elegant compendium. Our reasons will appear as we go on. The
                    learned reader will readily see the extreme difficulty of the subject, and the
                    immense calculations which are necessary even in the simplest cases, and will
                    grant that it is out of the power of any but an expert analyst to derive any use
                    from them; but the mathematician can calculate tables for the use of the
                    practical scaman Thus he can calculate the best position of the sails for
                    advancing in a course 90° from the wind, and the velocity in that course; then
                    for 85 ’, 80°, 75°, &amp;c. M. Bouguer has given a table of this kind; but to
                    avoid the immense difficulty of the process, he has adapted it to the apparent
                    direction of the wind. We have inserted a few of his numbers, suited to such
                    cases as can be of service, namely, when all the sails draw, or none stand in
                    the way of others. Column 1st is the apparent angle of the wind and course;
                    column 2d is the corresponding angle of the sails and keel; and column 3d is the
                    apparent angle of the sails and wind.</p>

                <p>But this is really doing but little for the seaman. The apparent direction of the
                    wind is unknown to him till the ship is sailing with uniform velocity; and he is
                    still uninformed as to the leeway. It is, however, of service to him to know,
                    for instance, that when the angle of the vanes and yards is 56 degrees, the yard
                    should be braced up to 37° 30', &amp;c.</p>
                <p>But here occurs a new difficulty. By the construction of a square-rigged ship it
                    is impossible to give the yards that inclination to the keel which the
                    calculation requires.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>There are few of the modem men-of-war which cannot have their yards braced
                    up to 27°. instead of 37° 30'· We may assume that most ships will admit of their
                    yards being braced up to 30°; so that the angle of incidence would be 49° 06',
                    and the course 79° 06'.</p></note> Few ships can have their yards braced up to
                    37° 30'; and yet this is required in order to have an incidence of 56°, and to
                    hold a course 94° 25' from the apparent direction of the wind, that is, with the
                    wind apparently 4° 25' abaft the beam. A good sailing ship in this position may
                    acquire a velocity even exceeding that of the wind. Let us suppose it only one
                    half of this velocity. We shall find that the angle WC <hi rend="italic">w</hi>
                    is in this case about 29°, and the ship is nearly going 123° from the wind, with
                    the wind almost perpendicular to the sail; therefore this utmost bracing up of
                    the sails is only giving them the position suited to a wind broad on the
                    quarter. It is impossible, therefore, to comply with the demand of the
                    mathematician, and the seaman must be contented to employ a less favourable
                    disposition of his sails in all cases where his course does not lie at least
                    eleven points from the wind.</p>
                <p>Let us see whether this restriction, arising from necessity, leaves any thing in
                    our choice, and makes one course preferable to another. We see that there are a
                    prodigious number of courses, and these the most usual and the most important,
                    which we must hold with one trim of the sails; in particular, sailing with the
                    wind on the beam, and all cases of plying to windward, must be performed with
                    this unfavourable trim of the sails. We are certain that the smaller we make the
                    angle of incidence, real or apparent, the smaller will be the velocity of the
                    ship; but it may happen that we shall gain more to windward, or get sooner away
                    from a lee-coast, or any object of danger, by sailing slowly on one course than
                    by sailing quickly on another.</p>
                <p>We have seen that while the trim of the sails remains the same, the leeway and
                    the angle of the yard and course remains the same, and that the velocity of the
                    ship is as the sine of the angle of real incidence, that is, as the sine of the
                    angle of the sail and the real direction of the wind.</p>
                <p>Let the ship AB (fig. 8.) hold the course CF, with the wind blowing in the
                    direction WC, and having her yards DCD braced up to the smallest angle BCD which
                    the rigging can admit. Let CF be to CE as the velocity of the ship to the
                    velocity of the wind; join FE and draw C <hi rend="italic">w</hi> parallel to
                    EF; it is evident that FE is the relative motion of the wind, and <hi
                    rend="italic">w</hi> CD</p>
                <p>is the relative incidence on the sail.</p>
                <p>Draw’ FO parallel to the yard DC, and describe a circle through the points COF;
                    then we say that if the ship, with the same wind and; the same trim of the same
                    drawing sails, be made to sail on any other course <hi rend="italic">Cf,</hi>
                    her velocity along CF is to the velocity along <hi rend="italic">Cf</hi> as CF
                    is to <hi rend="italic">Cf;</hi> or, in other words, the ship will employ the
                    same time in going from C to any point of the circumference CFO.</p>
                <p>Join <hi rend="italic">fO.</hi> Then, because the angles CFO, <hi rend="italic"
                    >CfO</hi> are on the same cord CO, they are equal, and <hi rend="italic">fO</hi>
                    is parallel to <hi rend="italic">dCd,</hi> the new position of the yard
                    corresponding to the new position of the keel <hi rend="italic">ab,</hi> making
                    the angle dC6=DCB. Also, by the nature of the circle, the line CF is to <hi
                    rend="italic">Cf</hi> as the sine of the angle CFO to the sine of the angle COf;
                    that is (on account of the parallels CD, OF and Cd, <hi rend="italic">Of),</hi>
                    as the sine of WCD to the sine of WCd. But when the trim of the sails remains
                    the same, the velocity of the ship is as the sine of the angle of the sail with
                    the direction of the wind; therefore CF is to Cf the velocity on CF to that on
                    <hi rend="italic">Cf,</hi> and the proposition is demonstrated.</p>
                <p>Let it now be required to determine the best course for avoiding a rock R lying
                    in the direction CR, or for withdrawing as fast as possible from a line of coast
                    PQ. Draw CM through R, or parallel to PQ, and let <hi rend="italic">m</hi> be
                    the middle of the arch C <hi rend="italic">m</hi> M. It is plain that <hi
                    rend="italic">m</hi> is the most remote<pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:chi.28490924&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=56" xml:id="kp-eb0720-0056-0042"/>
                    from CM of any point of the arch C <hi rend="italic">mM</hi>, and therefore the
                    ship will recede farther from the coast PQ in any given time, by holding the
                    course Cm than by any other course.</p>
                <p>This course is easily determined; for the arch CmM =360°—(arch CO+parch OM), and
                    the arch CO is the measure of twice the angle CFO, or twice the angle DCB, or
                    twice <hi rend="italic">b+x,</hi> and the arch OM measures twice the angle
                    ECM.</p>
                <p>Thus, suppose the sharpest possible trim of the sails to be 35°, and the observed
                    angle ECM to be 70°; then CO + OM is 70° +140° or 210°. This being taken from
                    360°, leaves 150°, of which the half Mm is 75°, and the angle MCm is 37° 30'.
                    This added to ECM makes ECm 170° 30 ’, leaving WCm=72° 30 ’, and the ship must
                    hold a course making an angle of 72° 30’with the real direction of the wind, and
                    WCD will be 37° 30 ’.</p>
                <p>This supposes no leeway. But if we know that under all the sail which the ship
                    can carry with safety and advantage she makes 5 degrees of leeway, the angle DCm
                    of the sail and course, or <hi rend="italic">b</hi> + <hi rend="italic">x</hi>,
                    is 40°. Then CO + OM=22O°, which being taken from 360°, leaves 140°, of which
                    the half is 70°, =M <hi rend="italic">m</hi>, and the angle MCm=r35°, and
                    ECm=1O5°, and WCm=75°, and the ship must lie with her head 70° from the wind,
                    making 5 degrees of leeway, and the angle WCD is 35°.</p>
                <p>The general rule for the position of the ship is, <hi rend="italic">that the line
                    on shipboard which bisects the angle</hi> b+x <hi rend="italic">may also bisect
                    the angle</hi> WCM, or make the angle between the course and the line, from
                    which we wish to withdraw, equal to the angle between the sail and the real
                    direction of the wind.</p>
                <p>It is plain that this problem includes that of plying to windward. We have only
                    to suppose ECM to be 90°; then, taking our example in the same ship, with the
                    same trim and the same leeway, we have <hi rend="italic">b</hi> + x=40°. This
                    taken from 90° leaves 50°, and WCn=90—25 =65, and the ship’s head must lie 60°
                    from the wind, and the yard must be 25° from it.</p>
                <p>It must be observed here, that it is not always eligible to select the course
                    which will remove the ship fastest from the given line CM; it may be more
                    prudent to remove from it more securely though more slowly. In such cases the
                    procedure is very simple, viz., to shape the course as near the wind as is
                    possible.</p>
                <p>The reader will also easily see that the propriety of these practices is confined
                    to those courses only where the practicable trim of the sails is not
                    sufficiently sharp. Whenever the course lies so far from the wind that it is
                    possible to make the tangent of the apparent angle of the wind and sail double
                    the tangent of the sail and course, it should be done.</p>
                <p>These are the chief practical consequences which can be deduced from the theory.
                    But we should consider how far this adjustment of the sails and course can be
                    performed. And here occur difficulties so great as to make it almost
                    impracticable. We have always supposed the position of the surface of the sail
                    to be distinctly observable and measurable; but this can be hardly affirmed even
                    with respect to a sail stretched on a yard. Here we supposed the surface of the
                    sail to have the same inclination to the keel that the yard has. This is by no
                    means the case; the sail assumes a concave form, of which it is almost
                    impossible to assign the direction of the mean impulse. We believe that this is
                    always considerably to leeward of a perpendicular to the yard, lying between CI
                    and CE, (fig. 6). This is of some advantage, being equivalent to a sharper trim.
                    We cannot affirm this, however, with any confidence, because it renders the
                    impulse on the weather-leech of the sail so exceedingly feeble as hardly to have
                    any effect. In sailing close to the wind, the ship is kept so near that the
                    weather-leech of the sail is almost ready to receive the wind edgewise, and to
                    flutter or shiver. The most effective or draw ing sails with a side-wind,
                    especially when plying to windward, are the staysails. We believe that it is
                    impossible to say, with anything approaching to precision, what is the position
                    of the general surlace of a staysail, or to calculate the intensity and
                    direction of the general impulse; and we affirm with confidence that no man can
                    pronounce on these points with any exactness. If we can guess within a third or
                    a fourth part of the truth, it is all we can pretend to; and after all, it is
                    but a guess. Add to this, the sails coming in the way of each other, and either
                    becalming them or sending the wind upon them in a direction widely different
                    from that of its free motion. All these points we think beyond our power of
                    calculation, and therefore that it is in vain to give the scaman mathematical
                    rules, or even tables of adjustment ready calculated; since he can neither
                    produce that medium position of his sails that is required, nor tell what is the
                    position which he employs.</p>
                <p>This is one of the principal reasons why so little advantage has been derived
                    from the very ingenious and promising disquisitions of Bouguer and other
                    mathematicians, and has made us omit the actual solution of the chief problems,
                    contenting ourselves with pointing out the process to such readers as have a
                    relish for these analytical operations.</p>
                <p>But there is another principal reason for the small progress which has been made
                    in the theory of seamanship. This is the error of the theory itself, which
                    supposes the impulsions of a fluid to be in the duplicate ratio of the sine of
                    incidence. The most careful comparison which has been made between the results
                    of this theory and matter of fact, is to be seen in the experiments made by the
                    members of the Royal Academy of Sciences at Paris, mentioned in the article <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Resistance of Fluids.</hi> We subjoin another abstract of them
                    in the following table; where column 1st gives the angle of incidence; column2d
                    gives the impulsions really observed; column 3d the impulses, had they followed
                    the duplicate ratio of the sines; and column 4th the impulses, if they were in
                    the simple ratio of the sines.</p>

                <p>Here we see an enormous difference in the great obliquities. When the angle of
                    incidence is only six degrees, the observed impulse is forty times greater than
                    the theoretical impulse; at 12° it is ten times greater; at 18° it is more than
                    four times greater; and at 24° it is almost three times greater</p>
                <p>No wonder then that the deductions from this theory are so useless and so unlike
                    what we familiarly observe. We took notice of this when we were considering the
                    leeway of a rectangular box, and thus saw a reason for admitting an incomparably
                    smaller leeway than what would result from the laborious computations necessary
                    by the theory. This error in theory has as great an influence on the impulsions
                    of air when acting obliquely on a sail; and the experiments<pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:chi.28490924&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=57" xml:id="kp-eb0720-0057-0043"/> of
                    Mr. Robins and of the Chevalier Borda, on the oblique impulsions of air, are
                    perfectly conformable (as far as they go) to those of the academicians on water.
                    The oblique impulsions of the wind are therefore much more efficacious for
                    pressing the ship in the direction of her course than the theory allows us to
                    suppose; and the progress of a ship plying to windward is much greater, both
                    because the oblique impulses of the wind are more effective, and because the
                    leeway is much smaller, than we suppose. Were not this the case, it would be
                    impossible for a square-rigged ship to get to windward. The impulse on her
                    sails, when close hauled, would be so trifling, that she would not have a third
                    part of the velocity which we see her acquire: and this trifling velocity would
                    be wasted in leeway; for we have seen that the diminution of the oblique
                    impulses of the water is accompanied by an increase of leeway. But we see that
                    in the great obliquities the impulsions continue to be very considerable, and
                    that even an incidence of six degrees gives an impulse as great as the theory
                    allows to an incidence of 40°. We may therefore, on all occasions, keep the
                    yards more square; and the loss which we sustain by the diminution of the very
                    oblique impulse will be more than compensated by its more favourable direction
                    with respect to the ship’s keel. Let us take an example of this. Suppose the
                    wind about two points before the beam, making an angle of 68° with the keel. The
                    theory assigns 43° for the inclination of the wind to the sail, and 15° for the
                    trim of the sail. The perpendicular impulse being supposed 1000, the theoretical
                    impulse for 45° is 465. This reduced in the proportion of radius to the sine of
                    25°, gives the impulse in the direction of the course only 197.</p>
                <p>But if we ease off the lee-braces till the yard makes an angle of 50° with the
                    keel, and allows the wind an incidence of no more than 18°, we have the
                    experimented impulse 414, which, when reduced in the proportion of radius to the
                    sine of 50°, gives an effective impulse 317. In like manner, the trim 56°, with
                    the incidence 12°, gives an effective impulse 337; and the trim of 62°, with the
                    incidence only 6°, gives 353.</p>
                <p>Hence it would at first sight appear that the angle DCB of 62° and WCD of 6°
                    would be better for holding a course within six points of the wind than any more
                    oblique position of the sails; but it will only give a greater initial impulse.
                    As the ship accelerates, the wind apparently comes ahead, and we must continue
                    to brace up as a ship freshens her way. It is not unusual for her to acquire
                    half or two-thirds of the velocity of the wind; in which case the wind comes
                    apparently ahead more than two points, when the yards must be braced up to 35°,
                    and thus allows an impulse no greater than about 7°. Now, this is very
                    frequently observed in good ships, which, in a brisk gale and smooth water, will
                    go five or six knots close-hauled, the ship’s head six points from the wind, and
                    the sails no more than just full, but ready to shiver by the smallest luff. All
                    this would be impossible by the usual theory; and in this respect these
                    experiments of the French Academy give a fine illustration of the seaman’s
                    practice. They account for what we should otherwise be much puzzled to explain;
                    and the great progress which is made by a ship close-hauled being perfectly
                    agreeable to what we should expect from the law of oblique impulsions, deducible
                    from these so often-mentioned experiments, while it is totally incompatible with
                    the common theory, should make us abandon the theory without hesitation, and
                    strenuously set about the establishment of another, founded entirely on
                    experiments, hor this purpose the experiments should be made on the oblique
                    impulsions of air, on as great a scale as possible, and in as great a variety of
                    circumstances, so as to furnish a series of impulsions for all angles of
                    obliquity. We have hut four or five experiments on this subject, viz., two by
                    Mr. Robins, and two or three by the Chevalier Borda.</p>
                <p>Having thus gotten a series of impulsions, it is very practicable to raise on
                    this foundation a practical institute, and to give a table of the velocities of
                    a ship suited to every angle of inclination and of trim; for nothing is more
                    certain than the resolution of the impulse perpendicular to the sail into a
                    force in the direction of the keel, and a lateral force.</p>
                <p>We are also disposed to think that experiments might be made on a model very
                    nicely rigged with sails, and trimmed in every different degree, which would
                    point out the mean direction of the impulse on the sails, and the comparative
                    force of these impulses on different directions of the wind. The method would be
                    very similar to that tor examining the impulse of the water on the hull. If this
                    can also be ascertained experimentally, the intelligent reader will easily see
                    that the whole motion of a ship under sail may be determined for every case.
                    Tables may then be constructed by calculation, or by graphical operations, which
                    will give the velocities of a ship in every different course, and corresponding
                    to every trim of sail. And let it be here observed, that the trim of the sail is
                    not to be estimated in degrees of inclination of the yards; because, as we have
                    already remarked, we cannot observe nor adjust the lateen sails in this way.
                    But, in making the experiments for ascertaining the impulse, the exact position
                    of the tacks and sheets of the sails are to be noted; and this combination of
                    adjustments is to pass by the name of a certain trim. Thus that trim of all the
                    sails may be called 40, whose direction is experimentally found equivalent to a
                    flat surface trimmed to the obliquity 40°.</p>
                <p>Having done this, we may construct a figure for each trim similar to fig. 8,
                    where, instead of a circle, we shall have a curve COM‘F', whose chords CF', c
                    <hi rend="italic">f,</hi> &amp;c. <hi rend="italic">are</hi> proportional to the
                    velocities in these courses; and by means of this curve we can find the point
                    <hi rend="italic">m',</hi> which is most remote from any line CM from which we
                    wish to withdraw: and thus we may solve all the principal problems of the
                    art.</p>
                <p>We hope that it will not be accounted presumption in us to expect more
                    improvement from a theory founded on judicious experiments only, than from a
                    theory of the impulse of fluids, which is found so inconsistent with
                    observation, and of whose fallacy all its authors, from Newton to D’Alembert,
                    entertained strong suspicions. Again, we beg leave to recommend this view of the
                    subject to the attention of the Society for the Improvement of Naval
                    Architecture. Should these patriotic gentlemen entertain a favourable opinion of
                    the plan, and honour us with their, correspondence, we will cheerfully impart to
                    them our notions of the way in which both these trains of experiments may be
                    prosecuted with success, and results obtained in which we may confide; and we
                    content ourselves at present with offering to the public these hints, which are
                    not the speculations of a man of mere science, but of one who, with a competent
                    knowledge of the laws of mechanical nature, has the experience of several years
                    service in the royal navy, where the art of working ships was a favourite object
                    of his scientific attention.</p>
                <p>With those observations we conclude our discussion of the first part of the
                    seaman’s task, and now proceed to consider the means that are employed to
                    prevent or to produce any deviations from the uniform rectilineal course which
                    has been selected.</p>
                <p>Here the ship is be considered as a body in free space, convertible round her
                    centre of inertia. For whatever may be the point round which she turns, this
                    motion may always be considered as compounded of a rotation round an axis
                    passing through her centre of gravity or inertia. She is impelled by the wind
                    and by the water acting on many surfaces differently inclined to each other, and
                    the impulse on each is perpendicular to the surface. In order therefore that she
                    may continue steadily in one course, it is not only<pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:chi.28490924&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=58" xml:id="kp-eb0720-0058-0044"/>
                    necessary that the impelling forces, estimated in their mean direction, be equal
                    and opposite to the resisting forces estimated in their mean direction; but also
                    that these two directions may pass through one point, otherwise she will be
                    affected as a log of wood is when pushed in opposite directions by two forces,
                    which are equal indeed, but are applied to different parts of the log. A ship
                    must be considered as a lever, acted on in different parts by forces in
                    different directions, and the whole balancing each other round that point or
                    axis where the equivalent of all the resisting forces passes. This may be
                    considered as a point supported by this resisting force and as a sort of
                    fulcrum: therefore, in order that the ship may maintain her position, the
                    energies or <hi rend="italic">momenta</hi> of all the impelling forces round
                    this point must balance each other.</p>
                <p>When a ship sails right afore the wind, with her yards square, it is evident that
                    the impulses on each side of the keel are equal, as also their mechanical <hi
                    rend="italic">momenta</hi> round any axis passing perpendicularly through the
                    keel. So are the actions of the water on her bows. But when she sails on an
                    oblique course, with her yards braced on either side, she sustains a pressure in
                    the direction CI (fig. 5,) perpendicular to the sail. This, by giving her a
                    lateral pressure LI, as well as a pressure CL ahead, causes her to make leeway,
                    and to move in a line <hi rend="italic">Cb</hi> inclined to CB. By this means
                    the balance of action on the two bows is destroyed; the general impulse on the
                    lee-bow is increased; and that on the weather-bow is diminished. The combined
                    impulse is therefore no longer in the direction BC, but (in the state of uniform
                    motion) in the direction IC.</p>
                <p>Suppose that in an instant the whole sails are annihilated and the impelling
                    pressure CI, which precisely balanced the resisting pressure on her bows,
                    removed. The ship tends, by her inertia, to proceed in the direction C <hi
                    rend="italic">b.</hi> This tendency produces a continuation of the resistance in
                    the opposite direction IC, which is not directly opposed to the tendency of the
                    ship in the direction C A; therefore the ship’s head would immediately come up
                    to the wind. The experienced seaman will recollect something like this when the
                    sails are suddenly lowered when coming to anchor. It does not happen solely from
                    the obliquity of the action on the bows: It would happen to the parallelopiped
                    of fig. 2, which was sustaining a lateral impulsion B∙sin. <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 2</hi> x, and a direct impulsion A∙cos. <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 2</hi> x. These are continued for a moment after the
                    annihilation of the sail: but being no longer opposed by a force in the
                    direction C D, but by a force in the direction <hi rend="italic">Cb,</hi> the
                    force B∙sin. <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> x must prevail, and the body is not
                    only retarded in its motion, but its head turns towards the wind. But this
                    effect of the leeway is greatly increased by the curved form of the ship’s bows.
                    This occasions the centre of effort of all the impulsions of the water on the
                    leeside of the ship to be very far forward, and this so much the more remarkably
                    as she is sharper afore. It is in general not much abaft the foremast. Now the
                    centre of the ship’s tendency to continue her motion is the same with her centre
                    of gravity, and this is generally but a little before the mainmast. She is
                    therefore in the same condition nearly as if she were pushed at the mainmast, in
                    a direction parallel to <hi rend="italic">Cb,</hi> and at the foremast by a
                    force parallel to IC. The evident consequence of this is a tendency to come up
                    to the wind. This is independent of all situation of the sails, provided only
                    that they have been trimmed obliquely.</p>
                <p>This tendency of the ship’s head to windward is called griping in the seaman’s
                    language, and is greatest in ships which are sharp forward, as we have said
                    already. This circumstance is easily understood. Whatever is the direction of
                    the ship’s motion, the absolute impulse on that part of the bow immediately
                    contiguous to B is perpendicular to that very part of the surface. The more
                    acute, therefore, that the angle of the bow is, the more will the impulse on
                    that part be perpendicular to the keel, and the greater will be its energy to
                    turn the head to windward.</p>
                <p>Thus we are enabled to understand or to see the propriety of the disposition of
                    the sails of a ship. We see her crowded with sails forward, and even many sails
                    extended far before her bow, such as the spritsail, the bowsprit topsail, the
                    fore-topmast staysail, the jib, and flying jib. The sails abaft are
                    comparatively smaller. The sails on the mizenmast are much smaller than those on
                    the foremast. All the staysails hoisted on the mainmast may be considered as
                    headsails, because their centres of effort are considerably before the centre of
                    gravity of the ship: and notwithstanding this disposition, it generally requires
                    a small action of the rudder to counteract the windward tendency of the lee-bow.
                    This is considered as a good quality when moderate; because it enables the
                    seaman to throw the sails aback, and stop the ship’s way in a moment, if she be
                    in danger from any thing a-head; and the ship which does not carry a little of a
                    weather helm, is always a dull sailer.</p>
                <p>In order to judge somewhat more accurately of the action of the water and sails,
                    suppose the ship AB (fig. 9,) to have its sails on the mizen mast D, the
                    mainmast E, and the foremast F, braced up or trimmed alike, and the three lines
                    D », Ee, <hi rend="italic">Ff,</hi> perpendicular to the sails, are in the pro
                    portion of the impulses on the sails. The ship is driven a-head and to leeward,
                    and moves in the path <hi rend="italic">αCb.</hi> This path is so inclined to
                    the line of the keel, that the medium direction of the resistance of the water
                    is parallel to the direction of the impulse. A line CI may be drawn parallel to
                    the lines D <hi rend="italic">i</hi>, E <hi rend="italic">e</hi>, F <hi
                    rend="italic">f</hi> and equal to their sum: and it may be drawn from such a
                    point C, that the actions on all the parts of the hull between C and B may
                    balance the <hi rend="italic">momenta</hi> of all the actions on the hull
                    between C and A. This point may justly be called the <hi rend="italic">centre of
                    effort,</hi> or the <hi rend="italic">centre of resistance.</hi> We cannot
                    determine this point for want of a proper theory of the resistance of fluids.
                    Nay, although experiments like those of the Parisian Academy should give us the
                    most perfect knowledge of the intensity of the oblique impulses on a square
                    foot, we should hardly be bene-fitted by them: for the action of the water on a
                    square foot of the hull at <hi rend="italic">p,</hi> for instance, is so
                    modified by the intervention of the stream of water which has struck the hull
                    about B, and glided along the bow B <hi rend="italic">o p,</hi> that the
                    pressure on <hi rend="italic">ρ</hi> is totally different from what it would
                    have been were it a square foot or surface detached from the rest, and presented
                    in the same position to the water moving in the direction <hi rend="italic"
                    >b</hi> C. For it is found, that the resistances given to planes joined so as to
                    form a wedge, or to curved surfaces, are widely different from the accumulated
                    resistances, calculated for their separate parts, agreeablv to the experiments
                    of the academy on single surfaces. We therefore do not attempt to ascertain the
                    point C by theory; but it may be accurately determined by the experiments which
                    we have so strongly recommended; and we offer this as an additional inducement
                    for prosecuting them.</p>
                <p>Draw through C a line perpendicular to CI, that is, parallel to the sails; and
                    let the lines of impulse of the three sails cut in the points », <hi
                    rend="italic">h,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">m.</hi> This line <hi rend="italic"
                    >im</hi> may be considered as a lever, moveable round C, and acted on at the
                    points <hi rend="italic">i</hi>, <hi rend="italic">k,</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >m,</hi> by three forces. The rotatory momentum of the sails on the mizenmast is
                    D <hi rend="italic">i</hi> × <hi rend="italic">i</hi> C; that of the sails on
                    the mainmast is E <hi rend="italic">e</hi> × <hi rend="italic">k</hi> C; and the
                    momentum of the sails on the foremast is <hi rend="italic">F f × m</hi> C. The
                    two first tend to press forward the arm C », and then to turn the ship’s head
                    towards the wind. The action of the sails on the foremast tends to pull the arm
                    C <hi rend="italic">m</hi> forward, and produce a<pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:chi.28490924&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=59" xml:id="kp-eb0720-0059-0045"/>
                    contrary rotation. If the ship under these three sails keeps steadily in her
                    course, without the aid of the rudder, we must have D i × iC + Ee × k C = Ff ×
                    mC. This is very possible, and is often seen in a ship under her mizentopsail,
                    main-topsail, and fore-topsail, all parallel to one another, and their surfaces
                    duly proportioned by reefing. If more sails are set, we must always have a
                    similar equilibrium. A certain number of them will have their efforts directed
                    from the larboard arm of the lever <hi rend="italic">im</hi> lying to leeward of
                    CI, and a certain number will have their efforts directed from the starboard arm
                    lying to windward of CI. The sum of the products of each of the first set, by
                    their distances from C, must be equal to the sum of the similar products of the
                    other set. As this equilibrium is all that is necessary for preserving the
                    ship’s position, and the cessation of it is immediately followed by a
                    conversion; and as these states of the ship may be had by means of the three
                    square sails only, when their surfaces are properly proportioned, it is plain
                    that every movement may be executed and explained by their means. This will
                    greatly simplify our future discussions. We shall therefore suppose in future
                    that there are only the three topsails set, and that their surfaces are so
                    adjusted by reefing, that their actions exactly balance each other round that
                    point C of the middle line AB, where the actions of the water on the different
                    parts of her bottom in like manner balance each other. This point C may be
                    differently situated in the ship according to the leeway she makes, depending on
                    the trim of the sails; and therefore although a certain proportion of the three
                    surfaces may balance each other in one state of leeway, they may happen not to
                    do so in another state. But the equilibrium is evidently attainable in every
                    case, and we therefore shall always suppose it.</p>
                <p>Il must now be observed, that when this equilibrium is destroyed, as, for
                    example, by turning the edge of the mizen-topsail to the wind, which the seamen
                    call <hi rend="italic">shivering</hi> the mizen-topsail, and which may be
                    considered as equivalent to the removing the mizen-topsail entirely, it does not
                    follow that the ship will turn round the point C, this point remaining fixed.
                    The ship must be considered as a free body, still acted on by a number of
                    forces, which no longer balance each other; and she must therefore <hi
                    rend="italic">begin</hi> to turn round a spontaneous axis of conversion, which
                    must be determined in the way set forth in the article <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Rotation.</hi> It is of importance to point out in general where this axis is
                    situated. Therefore let G</p>
                <p>(fig. 10.) be the centre of gravity of the ship. Draw the line <hi rend="italic"
                    >q</hi> G <hi rend="italic">v</hi> parallel to the yards, cutting Dd in <hi
                    rend="italic">q, Ee</hi> in r, CI in <hi rend="italic">t,</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">Ef</hi> in <hi rend="italic">v</hi>.</p>
                <p>While the three sails are set, the line <hi rend="italic">q v</hi> may be
                    consider ed as a lever acted on by four forces, <hi rend="italic">viz.</hi> D
                    <hi rend="italic">d</hi> impell ing the lever forward per pendicularly in the
                    point <hi rend="italic">q;</hi></p>
                <p>Ee, impellingit forward in the point <hi rend="italic">r; Ef,</hi> impelling it
                    forward in the point <hi rend="italic">v;</hi> and CI, impelling it backward in
                    the point <hi rend="italic">r.</hi> These forces balance each other both in
                    respect of progressive motion and of rotatory energy: for CI was taken equal to
                    the sum of Dd, Ee, and <hi rend="italic">Ef;</hi> so that no acceleration or
                    retardation of the ship’s progress in her course is supposed.</p>
                <p>But by taking away the mizen-topsail, both the equilibriums are destroyed. A part
                    D <hi rend="italic">d</hi> of the accelerating force is taken away; and yet the
                    ship, by her inertia or inherent force, tends, for a moment, to proceed in the
                    direction <hi rend="italic">Cp</hi> with her former velocity; and by this
                    tendency exerts for a moment the same pressure CI on the water, and sustains the
                    same resistance IC. She must therefore be retarded in her motion by the excess
                    of the resistance IC over the re maining impelling forces Ee and <hi
                    rend="italic">Ef,</hi> that is, by a force equal and opposite to Drf. She will
                    therefore be retarded in the same manner as if the mizen-topsail were still set,
                    and a force equal and opposite to its action were applied to G, the centre of
                    gravity, and she would soon acquire a smaller velocity, which would again bring
                    all things into equilibrium; and she would stand on in the same course, without
                    changing either her leeway or the position of her head.</p>
                <p>But the equilibrium of the lever is also destroyed. It is now acted on by three
                    forces only, viz. Ee and I·’/,' impelling it forward in the points <hi
                    rend="italic">r</hi> and <hi rend="italic">v,</hi> and IC impelling it backward
                    in the point <hi rend="italic">t.</hi> Make <hi rend="italic">rv: r</hi> o=Ee +
                    <hi rend="italic">Ff: Ff,</hi> and make <hi rend="italic">op</hi> parallel to CI
                    and equal to Ee+Ff Then we know, from the common principles of mechanics, that
                    the force <hi rend="italic">op</hi> acting at <hi rend="italic">o</hi> will have
                    the same momentum or energy to turn the lever round <hi rend="italic">any</hi>
                    point whatever as the two forces Ee and <hi rend="italic">Ef</hi> applied at <hi
                    rend="italic">r</hi> and <hi rend="italic">v;</hi> and now the lever is acted on
                    by two forces, viz. IC, urging it backwards in the point <hi rend="italic"
                    >t,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">o p</hi> urging it forwards in the point <hi
                    rend="italic">o.</hi> It must therefore turn round like a floating log, which
                    gets two blows in opposite directions. If we now make IC— <hi rend="italic">op:
                    opz=to: tx,</hi> or IC— <hi rend="italic">op: IC=to: ox,</hi> and apply to the
                    point <hi rend="italic">x</hi> a force equal to IC—o <hi rend="italic">p</hi> in
                    the direction IC; we know by the common principles of mechanics, that this force
                    IC— <hi rend="italic">op</hi> will produce the same rotation round any point as
                    the two forces IC and o <hi rend="italic">p</hi> applied in their proper
                    directions at <hi rend="italic">t</hi> and <hi rend="italic">o.</hi> Let us
                    examine the situation of the point <hi rend="italic">x.</hi></p>
                <p>The force IC— <hi rend="italic">op</hi> is evidently =Dd, and <hi rend="italic"
                    >op</hi> is=Ee+ <hi rend="italic">Ef.</hi> Therefore <hi rend="italic">of:
                    t</hi> ∙x=D <hi rend="italic">d: ο p.</hi> But because, when all the sails were
                    filled, there was an equilibrium round C, and therefore round <hi rend="italic"
                    >r,</hi> and because the force <hi rend="italic">op</hi> acting at <hi
                    rend="italic">o</hi> is equivalent to E e and F <hi rend="italic">f</hi> acting
                    at <hi rend="italic">r</hi> and <hi rend="italic">v,</hi> we must still have the
                    equilibrium; and therefore we have the momentum Dd × <hi rend="italic">qt</hi> =
                    op × of. Therefore <hi rend="italic">or: r q—Dd: op,</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >tq —tx.</hi> Therefore the point <hi rend="italic">x</hi> is the same with the
                    point <hi rend="italic">q.</hi></p>
                <p>Therefore, when we shiver the mizen-topsail, the rotation of the ship is the same
                    as if the ship were at rest, and a force equal and opposite to the action of the
                    mizen-topsail were applied at <hi rend="italic">q</hi> or at D, or any point in
                    the line Dy.</p>
                <p>This might have been shown in another and shorter way. Suppose all sails filled,
                    the ship is in equilibrio. This will be disturbed by applying to D a force
                    opposite to D <hi rend="italic">d;</hi> and if the force be also equal to Dd, it
                    is evident that these two forces destroy each other, and that this application
                    of the force <hi rend="italic">dD</hi> is equivalent to the taking away of the
                    mizen-topsail. But we chose to give the whole mechanical investigation; because
                    it gave us an opportunity of pointing out to the reader, in a case of very easy
                    comprehension, the precise manner in which the ship is acted on by the different
                    sails and by the water, and what share each of them has in the motion ultimately
                    produced. We shall not repeat this manner of procedure in other cases, because a
                    little reflection on the part of the reader will now enable him to trace the <hi
                    rend="italic">modus operandi</hi> through all its steps.</p>
                <p>We now see that, in respect both of progressive motion and of conversion, the
                    ship is affected by shivering the sail D, in the same manner as if a force equal
                    and opposite to <hi rend="italic">Dd</hi> were applied at D, or at any point in
                    the line Dd. We must now have recourse to the principles established under the
                    article <hi rend="smallcaps">RotatioN.</hi></p>
                <p>Let ∕&gt; represent a particle of matter, r its radius vector, or its distance pG
                    from an axis passing through the centre of gravity G, and let M represent the

                    turn round a spontaneous vertical axis, passing through a point S of the line

                    from the centre <hi rend="italic">∕"P'1^</hi> of gravity is = &lt;— (see <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Rotation, No.</hi> 96.), and it is</p>

                <p>taken on the opposite side of G from <hi rend="italic">q,</hi> that is, S and <hi
                    rend="italic">q</hi> are on opposite sides of G.</p>
                <p>Let us express the external force by the symbol F. It is equivalent to a certain
                    number of pounds, being the pressure of the wind moving with the velocity V and
                    inclination <hi rend="italic">a</hi> on the surface of the sail D; and may
                    therefore be computed either by the theoretical or experimental law of oblique
                    impulses. Having obtained this, we can ascertain the angular velocity of the
                    rotation and the absolute velocity of any given point of the ship by means of
                    the theorems established in the article <hi rend="smallcaps">RotatioN.</hi></p>
                <p>But before we proceed to this investigation, we shall consider the action of the
                    rudder, which operates precisely in the same manner. Let the ship AB (fig. 11),
                    have her rudder in the position AD, the helm being hard a-</p>
                <p>starboard, while the ship sailing on the starboard tack, and making leeway, keeps
                    on the course <hi rend="italic">a lt.</hi></p>
                <p>The lee surface of the rud der meets the water ob liquely. The very foot of the
                    rudder meets it in the direction DE parallel to <hi rend="italic">a b.</hi> The
                    parts farther up meet it with various obliquities, and with various velocities,
                    as it glides round the bottom of the ship and falls into the wake. It is
                    absolutely impossible to calculate the accumulated impulse. We shall not be far
                    mistaken in the deflection of each contiguous filament, as it quits the bottom
                    and glides along the rudder; but we neither know the velocity of these
                    filaments, nor the deflection and velocity of the filaments gliding without
                    them. We therefore imagine that all computations on this subject are in vain.
                    But it is enough for our purpose that we know the direction of the absolute
                    pressure which they exert on its surface. It is in the direction D <hi
                    rend="italic">d</hi>, perpendicular to that surface. We also may be confident
                    that this pressure is very considerable, in proportion to the action of the
                    water on the ship’s bows, or of the wind on the sails; and we may suppose it to
                    be nearly in the proportion of the square of the velocity of the ship in her
                    course; but we cannot affirm it to be accurately in that proportion, for reasons
                    that will readily occur to one who considers the way in which the water falls in
                    behind the ship.</p>
                <p>It is observed, however, that a fine sailer always steers well, and that all
                    movements by means of the rudder are performed with great rapidity when the
                    velocity of the ship is great. We shall see by and by, that the speed with which
                    the ship performs the angular movements is in the proportion of her progressive
                    velocity: For we shall see that the squares of the times of performing the
                    evolution are as the impulses inversely, which are as the squares of the
                    velocities. There is perhaps no force which acts on a ship that can be more
                    accurately determined by experiment than this. Let the ship ride in a stream or
                    tideway whose velocity is accurately measured; and let her ride from two
                    moorings, so that her bow may be a fixed point. Let a small tow line be laid out
                    from her stern or quarter at right angles to the keel, and connected with some
                    apparatus fitted up on shore or on board another ship, by which the strain on it
                    may be accurately measured; a person conversant with mechanics will see many
                    ways in which this can be done. Perhaps the following may be as good as any; let
                    the end of the tow-line be fixed to some point as high out of the water as the
                    point of the ship from which it is given out, and let this be very high. Let a
                    block with a hook be on the rope, and a considerable weight hung on this hook.
                    Things being thus prepared, put down the helm to a certain angle, so as to cause
                    the ship to sheer off from the point to which the far end of the tow-line is
                    attached. This will stretch the rope, and raise the weight out of the water. Now
                    heave upon the rope, to bring the ship back again to her former position, with
                    her keel in the direction of the stream. When this position is attained, note
                    carefully the form of the rope, that is, the angle which its two parts make with
                    the horizon. Call this angle <hi rend="italic">a.</hi> Every person acquainted
                    with these subjects knows that the horizontal strain is equal to half the weight
                    multiplied by the cotangent of <hi rend="italic">a, or</hi> that 2 is to the
                    cotangent of <hi rend="italic">a</hi> as the weight to the horizontal strain.
                    Now it is this strain which balances and therefore measures the action of the
                    rudder, or D <hi rend="italic">e</hi> in fig. 11. Therefore, to have the
                    absolute impulse D <hi rend="italic">d</hi> we must increase De in the
                    proportion of radius to the secant of the angle <hi rend="italic">b,</hi> which
                    the rudder makes with the keel. In a great ship sailing six miles in an hour,
                    the impulse on the rudder inclined 30° to the keel is not less than 3000 pounds.
                    The surface of the rudder of such a ship contains near 80 square feet. It is
                    not, however, very necessary to know this absolute impulse <hi rend="italic"
                    >Dd</hi> because it is its parts De alone which measures the energy of the
                    rudder in producing a conversion. Such experiments, made with various positions
                    of the rudder, will give its energies corresponding to these positions, and will
                    settle that long disputed point, which is the best position for turning a ship.
                    On the hypothesis that the impulsions of fluids are in the duplicate ratio of
                    the sines of incidence, there can be no doubt that it should make an angle of
                    54° 44' with the keel. But the form of a large ship will not admit of this,
                    because a tiller of a length sufficient for managing the rudder in sailing with
                    great velocity has not room to deviate above 30° from the direction of the
                    keel;<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>In modern ships
                    the improvements in the tillers will admit of the rudder’s being put over so as
                    to make an angle of 54° 44’ with the keel—the angle of maximum advantage
                    assigned to it by theory.</p></note> and in this position of the rudder the mean
                    obliquity of the filaments of water to its surface cannot exceed 40° or 45°. A
                    greater angle would not be of much service, for it is never for want of a proper
                    obliquity that the rudder fails of producing a conversion.</p>
                <p>A ship misses stays in rough weather for want of a sufficient progressive
                    velocity, and because her bows are beat off by the waves; and there is seldom
                    any difficulty in wearing the ship, if she has any progressive motion. It is,
                    however, always desirable to give the rudder as much influence as possible. Its
                    surface should be enlarged (especially below) as much as can be done
                    consistently with its strength, and with the power of the steersman to manage
                    it; and it should be put in the most favourable situation for the water to get
                    at it with great velocity; and it should be placed as far from the axis of the
                    ship’s motion as possible. These points are obtained by making the sterb-post
                    very upright, as has always been done in the French dockyards. The British ships
                    have a much greater rake; but our builders are gradually adopting the French
                    forms, experience having taught us that their ships, when in our possession, are
                    much more obedient to the helm than our own.—In order to ascertain the motion
                    produced by the action of the rudder, draw from the centre of gravity a line <hi
                    rend="italic">Gq</hi> perpendicular to D <hi rend="italic">d</hi>, (D <hi
                    rend="italic">d</hi> being drawn through the centre of effort of the rudder).
                    Then, as in the consideration of the action of the sails, we may conceive the
                    line <hi rend="italic">q</hi> G as a lever connected with the ship, and impelled
                    by a force D <hi rend="italic">d</hi> acting perpendicularly at <hi
                    rend="italic">q.</hi> The consequence of this will be, an incipient conversion
                    of the ship about a vertical axis passing through some point S in the line <hi
                    rend="italic">q</hi> G <hi rend="italic">,</hi> lying on the other side of G
                    from <hi rend="italic">q;</hi><hi rend="italic">J∙p∙P</hi> and we have, as in
                    the former case, GS=</p>
                <p>Thus the action and effects of the sails and of the rudder are perfectly similar,
                    and are to be considered in the same manner. We see that the action of the
                    rudder, though of<pb break="no" facs="ht:chi.28490924&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=61"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0720-0061-0047"/> a small surface in comparison of the sails, must
                    be very great: For the impulse of water is many hundred times greater than that
                    of the wind; and the arm <hi rend="italic">qG</hi> of the lever, by which it
                    acts, is incomparably greater than that by which any of the impulsions on the
                    sails produces its effect; accordingly the ship yields much more rapidly to its
                    action than she does to the lateral impulse of a sail.</p>
                <p>Observe here, that if G were a fixed or supported axis, it would be the same
                    thing whether the absolute force D <hi rend="italic">d</hi> of the rudder acts
                    in the direction D <hi rend="italic">d</hi>, or its transverse parts D <hi
                    rend="italic">e</hi> acts in the direction De, both would produce the same
                    rotation; but it is not so in a free body. The force D <hi rend="italic">d</hi>
                    both tends to retard the ship’s motion and to produce a rotation: It retards it
                    as much as if the same force D <hi rend="italic">d</hi> had been immediately
                    applied to the centre. And thus the real motion of the ship is compounded of a
                    motion of the centre in a direction parallel to D <hi rend="italic">d</hi>, and
                    of a motion round the centre. These two constitute the motion round S.</p>
                <p>As the effects of the action of the rudder are both more remarkable and somewhat
                    more simple than those of the sails, we shall employ them as an example of the
                    mechanism of the motions of conversion in general; and as we must content
                    ourselves, in a work like this, with what is very general, we shall simplify the
                    investigation by attending only to the motion of conversion. We can get an
                    accurate notion of the whole motion, if wanted for any purpose, by combining the
                    progressive or retrograde motion parallel to D <hi rend="italic">d</hi> with the
                    motion of rotation which we are about to determine.</p>
                <p>In this case, then, we observe, in the first place, that the angular velocity
                    (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Rotation, No.</hi> 22.) is &gt; <hi rend="superscript"
                    > an</hi> ^&gt; as was shewn in that article, this velocity of rotation
                    increases in the proportion of the time of the forces’ uniform action, and the
                    rotation would be uniformly accelerated if the forces did really act uniformly.
                    This, however, cannot be the case, because, by the ship’s change of position and
                    change of progressive velocity, the direction and intensity of the impelling
                    force is continually changing. But if two ships are performing similar
                    evolutions, it is obvious that the changes of force are similar in similar parts
                    of the evolution. Therefore the consideration of the momentary evolution is
                    sufficient for enabling us to compare the motions of ships actuated by similar
                    forces, which is all we have in view at present. The velocity <hi rend="italic"
                    >v,</hi> generated in any time <hi rend="italic">t</hi> by the continuance of an
                    invariable momentary acceleration, (which is all that we mean by saying that it
                    is produced by the action of a constant accelerating force), is as the
                    acceleration and the time jointly. Now what we call the <hi rend="italic"
                    >angular velocity</hi> is nothing but'this momentary acceleration. Therefore the
                    velocity <hi rend="italic">v</hi> generated in the time <hi rend="italic"
                    >t</hi></p>
                <p>∕P <hi rend="superscript"> r</hi></p>
                <p>The expression of the angular velocity is also the expression of the velocity <hi
                    rend="italic">v</hi> of a point situated at the distance 1 from the axis G.</p>
                <p>Let <hi rend="italic">z</hi> be the space or arch of revolution described in the
                    time <hi rend="italic">t</hi> by this point, whose distance from G is =1.</p>

                <p>Those evolutions are equal which are measured by equal arches. Thus two motions
                    of 45 degrees each are equal.</p>

                    directly, and as the square root of the momentum of the rudder or sail
                    inversely. This will enable us to make the comparison easily. Let us suppose the
                    ships perfectly similar in form and rigging, and to differ only in length L and

                    because the particles are similarly situated, R <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi>

                <p>Therefore the times of performing similar evolutions with similar ships are
                    proportional to the lengths of the ships when both are sailing equally fast; and
                    since the evolutions are similar, and the forces vary similarly in their
                    different parts, what is here demonstrated of the smallest incipient evolutions
                    is true of the whole. They therefore not only describe equal angles of
                    revolution, but also similar curves.</p>
                <p>A small ship, therefore, works in less time and in less room than a great ship,
                    and this in the proportion of its length. This is a great advantage in all
                    cases, particularly in wearing, in order to sail on the other tack close-hauled.
                    In this case she will always be to windward and a-head of the large ship, when
                    both are got on the other tack. It would appear at first sight that the large
                    ship will have the advantage in tacking. Indeed the large ship is farther to
                    windward when again trimmed on the other tack than the small ship when she is
                    just trimmed on the other tack. But this happened before the large ship had
                    completed her evolution, and the small ship, in the mean time, has been going
                    forward on the other tack, and going to windward. She will therefore be before
                    the large ship’s beam, and perhaps as far to windward.</p>
                <p>We have seen that the velocity of rotation is proportional, <hi rend="italic"
                    >cateris paribus,</hi> to F × <hi rend="italic">Gq.</hi> F means the absolute
                    impulse on the rudder or sail, and is always perpendicular to its surface. This
                    absolute impulse on a sail depends on the obliquity of the wind to its surface.
                    The usual theory says, that it is as the square of the sine of incidence; but we
                    find this not true. We must content ourselves with expressing it by some as yet

                    which is equal to DG × cos. DGg, and DGq is equal to the angle of the yard and
                    keel; which angle we formerly called <hi rend="italic">b.</hi> Therefore its
                    energy in producing a rotation is nV <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> S × <hi

                    we would trim the sails on the foremast, so as to pay the ship off from the wand
                    right a-head with the greatest effect, and<pb break="no"

                    we take the experiments of the French academicians as proper measures of the
                    oblique impulses of the wind on the sail, we will brace up the yard to an angle
                    of 48 degrees with the keel. The impulse corresponding to 48 is 615, and the
                    cosine of 48° is 669∙ These give a product of 411 435. If we brace the sail to
                    54∙44, the angle assigned by the theory, the effective impulse is 405 274. If we
                    make the angle 45°, the impulse is 408 774. It appears then that 48° is
                    preferable to either of the others. But the difference is inconsiderable, as in
                    all cases of maximum a small deviation from the best position is not very
                    detrimental. But the difference between the theory and this experimental measure
                    will be very great when the impulses of the wind are of necessity very oblique.
                    Thus, in tacking ship, as soon as the headsails are taken aback, they serve to
                    aid the evolution, as is evident: But if we were now to adopt the maxim
                    inculcated by the theory, we should immediately round in the weather-braces, so
                    as to increase the impulse on the sail, because it is then very small; and
                    although we by this means make the yard more square, and therefore diminish the
                    rotatory momentum of this impulse, yet the impulse is more increased (by the
                    theory) than its vertical lever is diminished.—Let us examine this a little more
                    particularly, because it is reckoned one of the nicest points of seamanship to
                    aid the ship’s coming round by means of tire headsails; and experienced seamen
                    differ in their practice in this manoeuvre. Suppose the yard braced up to 40°,
                    which is as much as can be usually done, and that the sail shivers, (the
                    bowlines are usually let go when the helm is put down), the sail immediately
                    takes aback, and in a moment we may suppose an incidence of 6 degrees. The
                    impulse corresponding to this is 400, (by experiment), and the cosine of 40° is
                    766. This gives 306 400 for the effective impulse. To proceed according to the
                    theory, we should brace the yard to 70°, which would give the wind (now 34° on
                    the weather-bow) an incidence of nearly 36°, and the sail an inclination of 20°
                    to the intended motion, which is perpendicular to the keel. For the tangent of
                    20° is about ½ of the tangent of 36°. Let us now see what effective impulse the
                    experimental law of oblique impulsions will give for this adjustment of the
                    sails. The experimental impulse for 36° is 480; the cosine of 70° is 342; the
                    product is 164 160, not much exceeding the half of the former. Nay, the impulse
                    for 36°, calculated by the theory, would have been only 346, and the effective
                    impulse only 118 332. And it must be farther observed, that this theoretical
                    adjustment would tend greatly to check the evolution, and in most cases would
                    entirely mar it, by checking the ship’s motion a-head, and consequently the
                    action of the rudder, which is the most powerful agent in the evolution; for
                    here would be a great impulse directed almost astern.</p>
                <p>We were justifiable, therefore, in saying, in the beginning of this article, that
                    a seaman would frequently find himself baffled if he were to work a ship
                    according to the rules deduced from M. Bouguer’s work; and we see by this
                    instance of what importance it is to have the oblique impulsions of fluids
                    ascertained experimentally. The practice of the most experienced seamen is
                    directly the opposite to this theoretical maxim, and its success greatly
                    confirms the usefulness of these experiments of the academicians so often
                    praised by us.</p>
                <p>We return again to the general consideration of the rotatory motion. We found the
                    velocity v= — i It is</p>
                <p>Jl* ’ therefore proportional, <hi rend="italic">caeteris paribus,</hi> to <hi
                    rend="italic">q</hi> G. We have seen in what manner <hi rend="italic">qG</hi>
                    depends on the position and situation of the sail or rudder when the point G is
                    fixed. But it also depends on the position of G. With respect to the action of
                    the rudder, it is evident that it is so much the more powerful, as it is more
                    remote from G. The distance from G may be increased either by moving the rudder
                    farther aft or G farther forward. And as it is of the utmost importance that a
                    ship answer her helm with the greatest promptitude, those circumstances have
                    been attended to which distinguished fine steering ships from such as had not
                    this quality; and it is in a great measure to be ascribed to this, that, in the
                    gradual improvement of naval architecture, the centre of gravity has been placed
                    far forward. Perhaps the notion of a centre of gravity did not come into the
                    thoughts of the rude builders in early times; but they observed that those boats
                    and ships steered best which had their extreme breadth before the middle point,
                    and consequently the bows not so acute as the stem. This is so contrary to what
                    one would expect, that it attracted attention more forcibly; and, being somewhat
                    mysterious, it might prompt to attempts of improvement, by exceeding in this
                    singular maxim. We believe that it has been carried as far as is compatible with
                    other essential requisites in a ship.</p>
                <p>We believe that this is the chief circumstance in what is called the trim of a
                    ship; and it were greatly to be wished that the best place for the centre of
                    gravity could be accurately ascertained. A practice prevails, which is the
                    opposite of what we are now advancing. It is usual to load a ship so that her
                    keel is not horizontal, but lower abaft. This is found to improve her steerage.
                    The reason of this is obvious. It increases the acting surface of the rudder,
                    and allows the water to come at it with much greater freedom and regularity; and
                    it generally diminishes the griping of the ship forward, by removing a part of
                    the bows out of the water. It has not always this effect; for the form of the
                    harping aloft is frequently such, that the tendency to gripe is diminished by
                    immersing more of the bow in the water.</p>
                <p>But waving these circumstances, and attending only to the rotatory energy of the
                    rudder, we see that it is of advantage to carry the centre of gravity forward.
                    The same advantage is gained to the action of the after sails. But, on the other
                    hand, the action of the headsails is diminished by it; and we may call every
                    sail a headsail whose centre of gravity is before the centre of gravity of the
                    ship; that is, all the sails hoisted on the bowsprit and foremast, and the
                    staysails hoisted on the mainmast; for the centre of gravity is seldom far
                    before the mainmast.</p>
                <p>Suppose that when the rudder is put into the position AD, (fig. 11), the centre
                    of gravity could be shifted to <hi rend="italic">g,</hi> so as to increase <hi
                    rend="italic">qG,</hi> and that this is done widout increasing the sum of the
                    products <hi rend="italic">pr</hi><hi rend="italic superscript"> 2</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">.</hi> It is obvious that the velocity of conversion will be
                    increased in the proportion of <hi rend="italic">qG</hi> to <hi rend="italic"
                    >qg.</hi> This is very possible, by bringing to that side of the ship parts of
                    her loading which were situated at a distance from G on the other side. Nay, we
                    can make this change in such a manner that <hi rend="italic">∫pr</hi><hi
                    rend="italic superscript"> 2</hi> shall even be less than it was before, by
                    taking care that every thing which we shift shall be nearer to <hi rend="italic"
                    >g</hi> than it was formerly to G. Suppose it all placed in one spot <hi
                    rend="italic">m,</hi> and that <hi rend="italic">m</hi> is the quantity of
                    matter so shifted, while M is the quantity of matter in the whole ship. It is
                    only necessary that <hi rend="italic">m∙ gG</hi><hi rend="italic superscript">
                    2</hi> shall be less dian the sum of the products <hi rend="italic">pr</hi><hi
                    rend="italic superscript"> 2</hi><hi rend="italic">,</hi> corresponding to the
                    matter which has been shifted. Now, although the matter which is easily moveable
                    is generally very small in comparison to the whole matter of the ship, and
                    therefore can make but a small change in the place of the centre of gravity, it
                    may frequently be brought from places so remote that it may occasion a very
                    sensible diminution of the quantity <hi rend="italic">∫pr</hi><hi rend="italic

                    of inertia.</p>
                <p>This explains a practice of the seamen in small wherries or skiffs, who, in
                    putting about, are accustomed to place themselves to leeward of the mast. They
                    even find that they can aid the quick motions of these light boats by the way in
                    which they rest on their two feet, sometimes leaning all on one foot, and
                    sometimes on the other. And we have<pb break="no"

                    often seen this evolution very sensibly accelerated in a ship of war, by the
                    crew running suddenly, as the helm is put down, to the lee-bow. And we heave
                    heard it asserted by very expert seamen, that after all attempts to wear ship
                    (after lying-to in a storm) have failed, they have succeeded by the crew
                    collecting themselves near the weather foreshrouds the moment the helm was put
                    down. It must be agreeable to the reflecting seaman to see this practice
                    supported by undoubted mechanical principles.</p>
                <p>It will appear paradoxical to say that the evolution may be accelerated even by
                    an addition of matter to the ship; and though it is only a piece of curiosity,

                    rend="italic">ce-j-nz</hi> dered as the variable quantity, for a maximum. In
                    what we have been saying on this subject, we have considered the rotation only
                    in as much as it is performed round the centre of gravity, although in every
                    moment it is really performed round a spontaneous axis lying beyond that centre.
                    This was done because it afforded an easy investigation, and any angular motion
                    round the centre of gravity is equal to the angular motion round any other
                    point. Therefore the extent and the time of the evolution are accurately
                    defined. From observing that the energy of the force F is proportional to <hi
                    rend="italic">qG,</hi> an inattentive reader will be apt to conceive the centre
                    of gravity as the centre of motion, and the rotation as taking place, because
                    the momenta of the suits and rudder, on the opposite sides of the centre of
                    gravity, do not balance each other. But we must always keep in mind that this is
                    not the cause of the rotation. The cause is the want of equilibrium round the
                    point C, (fig. 10), where the actions of the water balance each other. During
                    the evolution, which consists of a rotation combined with a progressive motion,
                    this point C is continually shifting, and the unbalanced momenta which continue
                    the rotation always respect the momentary situation of the point C. It is
                    nevertheless always true, that the energy of a force F is proportional, <hi
                    rend="italic">caeteris paribus,</hi> to <hi rend="italic">qG,</hi> and the
                    rotation is always made in the same direction as if the point G were really the
                    centre of conversion. Therefore the mainsail acts always (when oblique) by
                    pushing the stern away from the wind, although it should sometimes act on a
                    point of the vertical lever through C, which is a-head of C.</p>
                <p>These observations on the effects of the sails and rudder in producing a
                    conversion, are sufficient for enabling us to explain any case of their action
                    which may occur. We have not considered the effects which they tend to produce
                    by inclining the ship round a horizontal axis, viz. the motions of rolling and
                    pitching. (See <hi rend="smallcaps">Rolling</hi> and <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Pitchino.)</hi> To treat this subject properly would lead us into the whole
                    doctrine of the equilibrium of floating bodies, and it would rather lead to
                    maxims of construction than to maxims of manoeuvre. M. Bouguer’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Traité du Navire</hi> and Euler’s <hi rend="italic">Scientia
                    Navalis</hi> are excellent performances on this subject, and we are not here
                    obliged to have recourse to any erroneous theory.</p>
                <p>It is easy to see that the lateral pressure both of the wind on the sails and of
                    the water on the rudder tends to incline the ship to one side. The sails also
                    tend to press the ship’s bows into the water, and, if she were kept from
                    advancing, would press them down considerably. But by the ship’s motion, and the
                    prominent form of her bows, the resistance of the water to the fore part of the
                    ship produces a force which is directed upwards. The sails also have a small
                    tendency to raise the ship, for they constitute a surface which in general
                    separates from the plumb-line below. This is remarkably the case in the
                    staysails, particularly the jib and fore-topmast staysail. And this helps
                    greatly to soften the ship’s bows into the head seas. The upward pressure also
                    of the water on her lκ&gt;ws, which we just now mentioned, has a great effect in
                    opposing the immersion of the bows which the sails produce by acting on the long
                    levers furnished by the masts. M. Bouguer gives the name of <hi rend="italic"
                    >point velique</hi> to the point V (fig 12.)</p>
                <p>of the mast, where it is cut by the line CV, which marks the mean place and
                    direction of the whole impulse of the water on the bows. And he observes, that
                    if the mean direction of all the actions of the wind on the sails be made to
                    pass also through this<pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:chi.28490924&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=64" xml:id="kp-eb0720-0064-0050"/>
                    point, there, will be a perfect equilibrium, and the ship will have no tendency
                    to plunge into the water or to rise out of it; for the whole of the water on the
                    bows, in the direction CV, is equivalent to, and may be resolved into the action
                    CE, by which the progressive motion is resisted, and the vertical action CD, by
                    which the ship is raised above the water. The force CE must be opposed by an
                    equal force VD, exerted by the wind on the sails, and the force CD is opposed by
                    the weight of the ship. If the mean effort of the sails passes above the point
                    V, the ship’s bow will be pressed into the water; and if it pass below V, her
                    stern will be pressed down. But, by the union of these forces, she will rise and
                    fall with the sea, keeping always in a parallel position. We apprehend that it
                    is of very little moment to attend to the situation of this point. Except when
                    the ship is right afore the wind, it is a thousand chances to one that the line
                    CV of mean resistance does not pass through any mast; and the fact is, that the
                    ship cannot be in a state of uniform motion on any other condition but the
                    perfect union of the line of mean action of the sails, and the line of mean
                    action of the resistance. But its place shifts by every change of leeway or of
                    trim; and it is impossible to keep these lines in one constant point of
                    intersection for a moment, on account of the incessant changes of the surface of
                    the water on which she floats. M. Bouguer’s observations on this point are,
                    however, very ingenious and original.</p>
                <p>We conclude this dissertation by describing some of the chief movements or
                    evolutions. What we have said hitherto is intended for the instruction of the
                    artist, by making him sensible of the mechanical procedure. The description is
                    rather meant for the amusement of the landsman, enabling him to understand
                    operations that are familiar to the seaman. The latter will perhaps smile at the
                    awkward account given of his business by one who cannot hand, reef, or
                    steer.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">To tack Ship.</hi></p>
                <p>The ship must first be kept full, that is, with a very sensible angle of
                    incidence on the sails, and by no means hugging the wind. For as the evolution
                    is chiefly performed by the rudder, it is necessary to give the ship a good
                    velocity. When the ship is observed to luff up of herself, that moment is to be
                    catched for beginning the evolution, because she will by her inherent force
                    continue this motion. The helm is then put down. When the officer calls out
                    helm’s a-lee, the fore-sheet, fore-top bowline, jib, and stay-sail sheets
                    forward are let go. The jib is frequently hauled down. Thus the obstacles to the
                    ship’s head coming up to the wind by the action of the rudder are removed. If
                    the mainsail is set, it is not unusual to clue up the weather side, which may be
                    considered as a headsail, because it is before the centre of gravity. The mizen
                    must be hauled out, and even the sail braced to windward. Its power in paying
                    off the stern from the wind conspires with the action of the rudder. It is
                    really an aerial rudder. The sails are immediately taken aback. In this state
                    the effect of the mizen-topsail would be to obstruct the movement, by pressing
                    the stern the contrary way to what it did before. It is therefore either
                    immediately braced about sharp on the other tack, or lowered. Bracing it about
                    evidently tends to pay round the stern from the wind, and thus assist in
                    bringing the head up to the wind. But in this position it checks the progressive
                    motion of the ship, on which the evolution chiefly depends. For a rapid
                    evolution, therefore, it is as well to lower the mizen-topsail. Meantime, the
                    headsails are all aback, and the action of the wind on them tends greatly to pay
                    the ship round. To increase this effect, it is not unusual to haul the fore-top
                    bowline again. The sails on the mainmast are now almost becalmed; and therefore
                    when the wind is right a-head, or a little before, the main sail is hauled round
                    and braced up sharp on the other tack with all expedition. The staysail sheets
                    are now shifted over to their places for the other tack. The ship is now
                    entirely under the power of the headsails and of the rudder, and their actions
                    conspire to promote the conversion. The ship has acquired an angular motion, and
                    will preserve it, so that now the evolution is secured, and she falls off apace
                    from the wind on the other tack. The farther action of the rudder is therefore
                    unnecessary, and would even be prejudicial, by causing the ship to fall off too
                    much from the wind before the sails can be shifted and trimmed for sailing on
                    the other tack. It is therefore proper to right the helm when the wind is right
                    a-head, that is, to bring the rudder into the direction of the keel. The ship
                    continues her conversion by her inherent force and the action of the
                    headsails.</p>
                <p>When the ship has fallen off about four points from the wind, the headsails are
                    hauled round, and trimmed sharp on the other tack with all expedition; and
                    although this operation was begun with the wind four points on the bow, it will
                    be six before the sails are braced up, and therefore the headsails will
                    immediately fill. The after sails have filled already, while the head sails were
                    inactive, therefore immediately check the farther falling off from the wind. All
                    sails now draw, for the staysail sheets have been shifted over while they were
                    becalmed or shaking in the wind. The ship now gathers way, and will obey the
                    smallest motion of the helm to bring her close to the wind.</p>
                <p>We have here supposed, that during all this operation the ship preserves her
                    progressive motion. She must therefore have described a curve line, advancing
                    all the way to windward. Fig. 13 is a representation of this evolution when it
                    is per formed in the completest manner. The ship stand ing on the course E <hi
                    rend="italic">a</hi>, with the wind blowing in the direction WF, has her helm
                    put hard a-lee when she is in the position A.</p>
                <p>She immediately deviates from her course, and de scribing a curve, comes to the
                    position B, with the wind blowing in the direction WF of the yards, and the
                    square-sails now shiver. The mizen topsail is here represented braced sharp on
                    the other tack, by which its tendency to aid the angular motion</p>
                <p>(while it checks the progressive motion) is distinctly seen.</p>
                <p>he main and foresails are now shivering, and immediately after are taken aback.
                    The effect of this on the headsails is distinctly seen to be favourable to the
                    conversion, by pushing the point F in the direction F <hi rend="italic">is</hi>
                    but for the same reason it continues to retard the progressive motion. When the
                    ship has attained to the position C, the mainsail is hauled round and trimmed
                    for the other tack. The impulse in the direction F <hi rend="italic">i</hi>
                    still aids the conversion and retards the progressive motion. When the ship has
                    attained a position between C and D, such that the main and mizen topsail yards
                    are in the direction of the wind, there is nothing to counteract the force of
                    the headsails to pay the ship’s head off from the wind. Nay, during the progress
                    of the ship to this intermediate position, if any wind gets at the main or mizen
                    topsails, it acts on their anterior surfaces, and impels the after parts of the
                    ship away from the curve <hi rend="italic">a b c d,</hi> and thus aids the
                    revolution. We have therefore said, that when once the sails are taken fully
                    aback, and particularly when the wind is brought right ahead, it is scarce
                    possible for the evolution to fail; as soon therefore as the main topsail
                    (trimmed for the other tack) shivers, we are certain that<pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:chi.28490924&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=65" xml:id="kp-eb0720-0065-0051"/>
                    the headsails will be filled by the time they are hauled round and trimmed. The
                    staysails are filled before this, because their sheets have been shifted, and
                    they stand much sharper than the square-sails;<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The use of stav-sails has been almost
                    entirely discontinued in the navy fur some years. They are still supplied,
                    however, and the fashion of using them will probably return after a
                    time.</p></note> and thus every thing tends to check the falling off from the
                    wind on the other tack, and this no sooner than it should be done. The ship
                    immediately gathers way, and holds on in her new course <hi rend="italic"
                    >dG.</hi></p>
                <p>But it frequently happens, that in this conversion the ship loses her whole
                    progressive motion. This sometimes happens while the sails are shivering before
                    they are taken fully aback. It is evident, that in this case there is little
                    hope of success, for the ship now lies like a log, and neither sails nor rudder
                    have any action. The ship drives to leeward like a log, and the water acting on
                    the lee-side of the rudder checks a little the driving of the stern. The head
                    therefore falls off again, and by and by the sails fill, and the ship continues
                    on her former tack. This is called missing stays, and it is generally owing to
                    the ship’s having too little velocity at the beginning of the evolution. Hence
                    the propriety of keeping the sails well filled for some little time before.
                    Rough weather, too, by raising a wave which beats violently on the weather-bow,
                    frequently checks the first luffing of the ship, and beats her off again.</p>
                <p>If the ship lose all her motion after the headsails have been fully taken aback,
                    and before we have brought the wind right ahead, the evolution becomes
                    uncertain, but by no means desperate; for the action of the wind on the
                    headsails will presently give her stern-way. Suppose this to happen when the
                    ship is in the position C. Bring the helm over hard to windward, so that the
                    rudder shall have the position represented by the small dotted line <hi
                    rend="italic">of.</hi> It is evident, that the resistance of the water to the
                    stern-way of the rudder acts in a favourable direction, pushing the stern
                    outward. In the mean time, the action of the wind on the headsails pushes the
                    head in the opposite direction. These actions conspire therefore in promoting
                    the evolution; and if the wind is right ahead, it cannot fail, but may even be
                    completed speedily, because the ship gathers stem-way, and the action of the
                    rudder becomes very powerful; and as soon as the wind comes on the formerly
                    lee-bow, the action of the water on the now lee-quarter will greatly accelerate
                    the conversion. When the wind therefore has once been brought nearly right
                    ahead, there is no risk of being baffled.</p>
                <p>But should the ship have lost all her headway considerably before this, the
                    evolution is very uncertain; for the action of the water on the rudder may not
                    be nearly equal to its contrary action on the lee-quarter; in which case, the
                    action of the wind on the headsails may not be sufficient to make up the
                    difference. When this is observed, when the ship goes astern without changing
                    her position, we must immediately throw the headsails completely aback, and put
                    the helm down again, which will pay off the ship’s head from the wind enough to
                    enable us to fill the sails again on the same tack, to try our fortune again; or
                    we must box-haul the ship in the manner to be described by and by.</p>
                <p>Such is the ordinary process of tacking ship; a process in which all the
                    different modes of action of the rudder and sails are employed. To execute this
                    evolution in the most expeditious manner, and so as to gain as much on the wind
                    as possible, is considered as the test of an expert seaman. We have described
                    the process which is best calculated for <hi rend="italic">ensuring</hi> the
                    movement. But if the ship be sailing very briskly in smooth water, so that there
                    is no danger of missing stays, we may gain more to windward considerably by
                    keeping fast the fore-top bowline and the jib and stay-sail sheets till the
                    square sails are all shivering. For these sails, continuing to draw with
                    considerable force, and balancing each other tolerably fore and aft, keep up the
                    ship’s velocity very much, and thus maintain the power of the rudder. If we now
                    let all fly when the square sails are shivering, the ship may be considered as
                    without sails, but exposed to the action of the water on the lee-bow; from which
                    arises a strong pressure of the bow to windward, which conspires with the action
                    of the rudder to aid the conversion. It evidently leaves all that tendency of
                    the bow to windward which arises from leeway, and even what was counteracted by
                    the formerly unbalanced action of these head-staysails. This method lengthens
                    the whole time of the evolution, but it advances the ship to windward. Observe,
                    too, that keeping fast the foretop bowline till the sail shivers, and then
                    letting it go, insures the taking aback of that sail, and thus instantly
                    produces an action that is favourable to the evolution.</p>
                <p>The most expert seamen, however, differ among themselves with respect to these
                    two methods, and the first is the most generally practised in the British navy,
                    because the least liable to fail. The forces which oppose the conversion are
                    sooner removed, and the production of a favourable action by the backing of the
                    foretop-sail is also sooner obtained, by letting go the foretop bowline at the
                    first.</p>
                <p>Having entered so minutely into the description and rationale of this evolution,
                    we have sufficiently turned the reader’s attention to the different actions
                    which co-operate in producing the motions of conversion. We shall therefore be
                    very brief in our description of the other evolutions.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">To wear Ship.</hi></p>
                <p>When the seaman sees that his ship will not go about head to wind, but will miss
                    stays, he must change his tack the other way; that is, by turning her head away
                    from the wind, going a little way before the wind, and then hauling the wind on
                    the other tack. This is called <hi rend="italic">wearing</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">veering</hi> ship. It is most necessary in stormy weather with
                    little sail, or in very faint breezes, or in a disabled ship.</p>
                <p>The process is exceedingly simple; and the mere narration of the procedure is
                    sufficient for showing the propriety of every part of it.</p>
                <p>Watch for the moment of the ship’s falling off, and then haul up the mainsail and
                    mizen, and shiver the mizen topsail, and put the helm a-weather. When the ship
                    falls off sensibly (and not before), let go the bowlines. Ease away the
                    fore-sheet, raise the fore tack, and gather aft the weather fore-sheet, as the
                    lee-sheet is eased away. Round in the weather-braces of the fore and main-masts,
                    and keep the yards nearly bisecting the angle of the wind and keel, so that when
                    the ship is before the wind the yards may be square. It may even be of advantage
                    to round in the weather-braces of the main-topsail more than those of the
                    headsails; for the mainmast is abaft the centre of gravity. All this while the
                    mizen-top sail must be kept shivering, by rounding in the weather-braces as the
                    ship pays off from the wind. Then the main-topsail will be braced up for the
                    other tack by the time that we have brought the wind on the weather-quarter.
                    After this it will be full, and will aid the evolution. When the wind is right
                    aft, shift the jib and stay-sail sheets. The evolution now goes on with great
                    rapidity; therefore briskly haul on board the fore and main tacks, and haul out
                    the mizen, and set the mizen-staysail as they will take the wind the right way.
                    We must now check the great rapidity with which the ship comes to the wind on
                    the other tack, by righting the helm before we bring the wind on the beam; and
                    all must be trimmed fore and aft by this time, that the headsails may take and
                    check the coming-to. All being trimmed, stand on close by the wind.</p>
                <p>We cannot help losing much ground in this movement. Therefore, though it be very
                    simple, it requires much attention and rapid execution to do it with as little
                    loss of ground as possible. One is apt to imagine at first that it would be
                    better to keep the headsails braced up on the former tack, or at least not to
                    round in the weather-braces so much as is here directed. When the ship is right
                    afore the wind, we should expect assistance from the obliquity of the
                    head-sails; but the rudder being the principal agent in<pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:chi.28490924&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=66" xml:id="kp-eb0720-0066-0052"/>
                    the evolution, it is found that more is gained by increasing the ship’s
                    velocity, than by a smaller impulse in the head-sails more favourably directed.
                    Experienced seamen differ, however, in their practice in respect of this
                    particular.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">To box-haul a Ship.</hi></p>
                <p>This is a process performed only in critical situations, as when a rock, a ship,
                    or some danger, is suddenly seen right a-head, or when a ship misses stays. It
                    requires the most rapid execution.</p>
                <p>The ship being close-hauled on a wind, haul up the mainsail and mizen, and shiver
                    the top-sails, and put the helm hard a-lee altogether. Raise the fore-tack, let
                    go the head bowlines, and brace about the headsails sharp on the other tack. The
                    ship will quickly lose her way, get stem-way, and then fall off, by the joint
                    action of the headsails and of the inverted rudder. When she has fallen off
                    eight points, brace the aftersails square, which have hitherto been kept
                    shivering. This will at first increase the power of the rudder, by increasing
                    the stern-way; and at the same time it makes no opposition to the conversion
                    which is going on. The continuation of her circular motion will presently cause
                    them to take the wind on their after surfaces. This will check the stem-way,
                    stop it, and give the ship a little headway. Now shift the helm, so that the
                    rudder may again act, in conjunction with the headsails, in paying her off from
                    the wind. This is the critical part of the evolution, because the ship has
                    little or no way through the water, and will frequently remain long in this
                    position. But as there are no counteracting forces the ship continues to fall
                    off. Then the weather-braces of the after sails may be gently rounded in, so
                    that the wind acting on their hinder surfaces may both push the ship a little
                    a-head and her stern laterally in conjunction with the rudder. Thus the wind is
                    brought upon the quarter, and the headsails shiver. By this time the ship has
                    acquired some headway. A continuation of the rotation would now fill the
                    headsails, and their action would be contrary to the intended evolution. They
                    are therefore immediately braced the other way, nearly square, and the evolution
                    is now completed in the same manner with wearing ship.</p>
                <p>Some seamen brace all the sails aback the moment that the helm is put hard a-lee,
                    but the after-sails no more aback than just to square the yards. This quickly
                    gives the ship stern-way, and brings the rudder into action in its inverted
                    direction; and they think that the evolution is accelerated by this method.</p>
                <p>There is another problem of seamanship deserving of our attention, which cannot
                    properly be called an evolution. This is lying-to. This is done in general by
                    laying some sails aback, so as to stop the head-way produced by others. But
                    there is a considerable address necessary for doing this in such a way that the
                    ship shall lie easily, and under command, ready to proceed in her course, and
                    easily brought under weigh.</p>
                <p>To bring-to with the fore or main topsail to the mast, brace that sail sharp
                    aback, haul out the mizen, and clap the helm hard a-lee.</p>
                <p>Suppose the fore topsail to be aback; the other sails shoot the ship a-head, and
                    the lee-helm makes the ship come up to the wind, which makes it come more
                    perpendicularly on the sail which is aback. Then its impulse soon exceeds those
                    on the other sails which are now shivering, or almost shivering. The ship stands
                    still awhile, and then falls off, so as to fill the after sails, which again
                    shoot her a-head, and the process is thus repeated. A ship lying-to in this way
                    goes a good deal a-head and also to leeward. If the main topsail be aback, the
                    ship shoots a-head, and comes up till the diminished impulse of the drawing
                    sails in the direction of the keel is balanced by the increased impulse on the
                    main-topsail. She lies a long while in this position, driving slowly to leeward;
                    and she at last falls off by the beating of the water on her weather-bow. She
                    falls off but little, and soon comes up again.</p>
                <p>Thus a ship lying-to is not like a mere log, but has a certain motion which keeps
                    her under command. To get under weigh again, we must watch the time of falling
                    off; and when this is just about to finish, brace about briskly, and fill the
                    sail which was aback. To aid this operation, the jib and fore-topmast stay-sail
                    may be hoisted, and the mizen brailed up; or, when the intended course is before
                    the wind or large, back the fore-topsail sharp, shiver the main and mizen
                    topsail, brail up the mizen, and hoist the jib and foretopmast staysails
                    altogether.</p>
                <p>In a storm with a contrary wind, or on a lee shore, a ship is obliged to lie-to
                    under a very low sail. Some sail is absolutely necessary, in order to keep the
                    ship steadily down, otherwise she would kick about like a cork, and roll so deep
                    as to strain and work herself to pieces. Different ships behave best under
                    different sails. In a very violent gale, the three lower stay-sails are in
                    general well adapted for keeping her steady, and distributing the strain. This
                    mode seems also well adapted for wearing, which may be done by hauling down the
                    mizen-staysail. Under whatever sail the ship is brought-to in a storm, it is
                    always with a filled sail, and never with one laid aback. The helm is lashed
                    down hard a-lee; and therefore the ship shoots a-head, and comes up till the sea
                    on her weather-bow beats her off again. Getting under weigh is generally
                    difficult; because the ship and rigging are lofty abaft, and hinder her from
                    falling off readily when the helm is put hard a-weather. We must watch the
                    falling off, and assist the ship by some small headsail. Sometimes the crew get
                    up on the weather fore-shrouds in a crowd, and thus present a surface to the
                    wind.</p>
                <p>These examples of the three chief evolutions will enable those who are not seamen
                    to understand the propriety of the different steps, and also to understand the
                    other evolutions as they are described by practical authors. We are not
                    acquainted with any performance in our language, where the whole are considered
                    in a connected and systematic manner. There is a book on this subject in French,
                    called <hi rend="italic">Le Manoeuvrier,</hi> by M. Bourdé de Ville-Huet, which
                    is in great reputation in France.</p>
                <p>We offer this account of the subject with all proper respect and diffidence. We
                    do no profess to teach; but by pointing out the defects of the celebrated work
                    of M. Bouguer, and the course which may be taken to remove them, while we
                    preserve much valuable knowledge which they contain, we may perhaps excite some
                    persons to apply to this subject, who, by a combination of what is just in M.
                    Bouguer’s theory, with an experimental doctrine of the impulses of fluids, may
                    produce a treatise of seamanship which will not be confined to the libraries of
                    mathematicians, but become a manual for seamen by profession.<note

                    treatises on seamanship in English; but we think the whole topic bas become of

                    received; and we are persuaded that a well-digested, and well written marine
                    dictionary, scientific, practical, and popular, if sufficiently copious, and

                    celebrated Professor John Robison, it has been thought proper to reprint it
                    exactly as it left his hands, with the addition of one or two notes explanatory
                    of circumstances which the lapse of time has rendered obscure. This course has
                    been adopted chiefly out of deference to the high authority of the author, which
                    must render it a measure of questionable propriety to retouch, or otherwise
                    alter, or try to improve, an essay which, at the time it was written, must have
                    been considered as complete. But the interests of the readers of this
                    Encyclopaedia have also, it is believed, been considered in this matter, since
                    any additions or interpolations made in an article composed with the care which
                    marks every thing from the pen of Professor Robison, might so materially have
                    altered the texture of the fabric, as to divest it of much of its beauty as well
                    as utility. We have, indeed, the means of knowing that the article, as it
                    stands, has been of extensive practical utility; and every admirer of simple,
                    and at the same time vigorous writing, clear and straight to the purpose, must
                    be well pleased to know that no attempt has been made to improve a style which
                    is matchless.</p>
                <p>At the same time it is manifest, upon a moment’s reflection, that even the most
                    general view of such an art as Seamanship, written more than forty years ago,
                    cannot possibly include many things which it is material should be adverted to.
                    This science, as it may now fairly be called, has greatly advanced within that
                    period. With the improvements which have been mode in most other departments of
                    industry and knowledge, the public are more or less familiar, and great pains
                    have been taken throughout this work to extend that familiarity by such popular
                    explanations as shall not only be intelligible to general readers, but be useful
                    to those whom pleasure or business inclines to go deeper. But the art or science
                    of Seamanship, call it which we please, has certainly been too much kept out of
                    sight of late years; and it is the purpose of this Appendix to supply, in a
                    brief space, the deficiency complained of by many persons, whose habits entirely
                    unfit them for gaining the knowledge for themselves, and yet, who are perfectly
                    competent to understand, as well as to appreciate, the value of such
                    information, when stated in clear language.</p>
                <p>Most other sciences may be studied with effect in the closet. An amateur
                    astronomer, for example, or a chemist, furnished with good instruments, and
                    having confidence in the skill and good faith of the leaders in the particular
                    walk of knowledge to which his taste inclines him, may, by adopting their
                    results, pursue the same paths with almost equal profit, and perhaps with more
                    pleasure than those who take all the labour, and incur all the responsibility.
                    But there is no royal road of this sort, by which an amateur sailor can
                    investigate the results of seamanship, the mysteries of which, to be fully
                    understood, must be studied afloat, at sea, in all weathers, and in every
                    climate.</p>
                <p>All the world, however, knows that the results of nautical skill and exertion are
                    not the same as they used to be. A voyage to India and back, in former times,
                    occupied a couple of years, or more; it is now currently done in nine months,
                    even by ordinary merchant vessels, including the time taken to unload and reload
                    their cargoes. In former days, the scurvy struck down half the crew of every
                    ship which made a long voyage, and was even fearfully prevalent in the navy; now
                    the disease is almost unknown. The numbers of all kinds of ships afloat have
                    enormously increased, and the war of the elements by which they were formerly
                    assailed is no less violent than it was; but assuredly a far smaller proportion
                    of vessels are now driven on shore than were formerly wrecked. The comforts,
                    too, of travelling by sea, in the articles of provisions and water, are all
                    essentially improved; and, finally, the security, as well as the happiness of
                    all persons on board, whether passengers or crew, has been marvellously
                    augmented by the general establishment of a better system of discipline than was
                    known in bygone days; whilst many old manipulations of seamanship are so
                    modified by new contrivances, that if old Benbow, or even Kempenfelt, were to
                    arise from the dead, he would scarcely know how to handle his ship.</p>
                <p>It may not be without use, and it certainly must be interesting, to those who
                    have not studied such things personally, to see by an example how scientific
                    seamanship is made to triumph over that groping and blundering method of
                    navigating ships which is technically known by the name of the “rule of thumb.”
                    If we take a globe, and trace on it the shortest route, by sea, to India, and
                    then fancy that such must be the best course to follow, we shall be very much
                    mistaken. And yet this is very much what our ancestors actually did, till time,
                    and repeated trials, and multitudinous failures, gradually taught them where to
                    seek for winds, and how to profit by them when found. According to the “rule of
                    thumb” sailing, a ship had only to steer from England to Madeira, pass the
                    Canaries and Cape de Verds, and then to make a direct course to the Cape, and
                    thence to India. On trial, however, this experiment always failed; for on
                    getting near the equator, a series of calms and squalls put a slop to this
                    straight-line scheme, and the mariners of old were then forced to toil along the
                    coast of Africa, or were driven towards that of the Brazils, and very often they
                    came back in utter hopelessness. Now-a-days, the exact spot where the north-east
                    trade wind, which prevails in the northern Atlantic, ought to be parted with; in
                    what district the calms and variables are most easily managed; over what degree
                    of longitude on the equator the ship should pass; and, finally, in what place
                    the south-east trade wind of the southern Atlantic is to be found, and how it is
                    to be made most use of when found; are all matters of such familiarity to the
                    really qualified navigator, that they scarcely occupy his thoughts, but are
                    acted upon as matters of coursc, and, unless some unforeseen accident occurs,
                    absolutely ensure the success of his voyage. The line he follows, however, is by
                    no means the straight one which an ill-informed person would naturally have
                    chalked out for him to follow, ignorant of the impossibility of pursuing it.</p>
                <p>The modern navigator, by not seeking to husband the south-east trade wind too
                    much, but by freely “flanking” through it, sweeps past the coast of Brazil, and
                    by boldly dashing down into pretty high south latitudes, is certain, or almost
                    certain, of finding there such a vein of westerly wind, as amply compensates for
                    the apparent roundabout he has made in his course. In like manner, after passing
                    the Cape, which to the old navigators was truly a “Cabo de tor-mentos,” instead
                    of vainly trying to reach India, by steering straight through the Mozambique
                    channel, the scientific navigator, disregarding the increase of distance,
                    maintains his position in a high latitude, and sails resolutely along a parallel
                    of latitude, with the wind in his poop, till he has obtained such a degree of
                    easting, that, on hauling up to the northward, and making for the south-east
                    trade wind, he enters that mysterious aerial current on such terms as ensure his
                    making it serve his purpose. If, however, he be timid or impatient by nature,
                    and not duly instructed by experience, he will be very apt to haul up too soon
                    to the northward, from not liking to run, as it appears, so far past his port.
                    The consequence will be, that when he encounters the south-east trade-wind, he
                    will find, that instead of its being fair, it is blowing in his teeth, and he
                    will have to run back again to the southward to borrow a little more easting
                    from the westerly breezes which prevail there.</p>
                <p>Be it observed, however, that the above instructions would lead a seaman into
                    great error, were he to make the rule absolute; for, at certain seasons of the
                    year, that is, when the sun is far to the north of the line, and the south-west
                    monsoon blowing in the Indian ocean, his course from the<pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:chi.28490924&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=68" xml:id="kp-eb0720-0068-0054"/>
                    Cape to India would lead him between Madagascar and the main land of Africa; and
                    so he would sail across the equator, and enter the Bay of Bengal with a flowing
                    sheet. At other seasons, so far from having a flowing sheet on reaching India,
                    he may have to beat up the bay, “hank for hank,” unless he has knowledge enough
                    to know at which side to enter it, and skill enough,—for it requires a good
                    deal,—to know how to profit by the land and sea breezes of the coasts
                    respectively of Coromandel and of Pegu.</p>
                <p>In short, not to swell this example too far, the truly scientific navigator,
                    possessed of the requisite nautical instruments, (the most important of which we
                    propose to speak of by and by), by which means he may at all times be certain of
                    his place, may almost command a fair wind at every stage of his voyage, and thus
                    secure his passage within a certain number of days; though, in his way, he will
                    have had to vary his course a hundred times from that which, at first sight,
                    might have been thought the best, merely because, on the map, it seemed the
                    shortest. The old proverb, indeed, which warns us that the longest way about is
                    often the shortest way home, has perhaps its amplest illustration in the
                    practice of modem seamanship; but, let it be always borne in mind, that this is
                    true only when all the varying circumstances of time and place are duly taken
                    into account, and so appropriated as to give to the ship those advantages of
                    fair wind and moderate weather, without which no voyage can be securely, or
                    speedily made. This branch of seamanship, therefore, more than any other,
                    requires for its successful exercise a singular combination of the widest
                    generalizations in theory, with the most minute and specific disintegrations of
                    scientific research in practice. In the Indian seas especially, the whole
                    history of the winds, examined without some theoretical clue, is a mass of
                    confusion; and yet the profoundest meteorological science would inevitably prove
                    not only useless, but absolutely dangerous to the navigator who should trust to
                    it alone, without the aid of local information, and of the improvements of modem
                    art.</p>
                <p>These remarkable improvements are due to the spread of knowledge over the sea, as
                    well as over the land; and it is proposed here, to examine a few of the causes
                    which have led to such valuable results in the practice of seamanship, as they
                    will all be found to fall readily under that great head For detailed practical
                    information, of a kind which might be useful to a sailor in the actual working
                    of a ship, we must of course refer to the precise heads which treat professedly
                    of these things, such as <hi rend="smallcaps">Anchors, Astronomy, Cables,
                    Capstan, Navigation, Rope, Ship-building, Steam-Vessels,</hi> and so forth, the
                    purpose of this Appendix to the article Seamanship being merely to point out, in
                    a very general, but by no means superficial manner, the most important
                    improvements which have been introduced afloat since the preceding article was
                    written.</p>
                <p>It will not be expected that much should be said here of the mighty revolution in
                    nautical affairs brought about by the introduction of steam; for that subject
                    demands, and has received the fullest attention in its proper place. We shall
                    merely observe, that steam does net essentially interfere with seamanship
                    proper, almost all the manipulations of which remain as before; whilst steam
                    navigation, in spite of its boasted contempt of wind and tide, is still obliged
                    to borrow so much from seamanship to complete its success, that without its aid
                    it would often be useless, and even dangerous in the highest degree. We shall
                    take occasion as we go along, to point out some of the most remarkable occasions
                    in which the old system of seamanship proper is essential to the method by
                    steam; merely remarking at present, that nearly all that branch of our subject
                    which relates to navigation, that is, to the method by which a ship’s place is
                    determined at sea, the proper course shaped, and the different ports of the
                    world recognised and made use of, remains the same. Latitudes and longitudes,
                    and the va riation of the compass, are evidently just as important to a steam
                    vessel as to a sailing one; and though winds and currents are not quite so
                    essential, every one who has made a steam voyage of any length, is aware how
                    materially its celerity depends upon a knowledge of and due attention to these
                    particulars. It is one of the chief points of a seaman’s duty to know where to
                    find a fair wind, and where to fall in with a favourable current; but the
                    obligation, if not equally binding on a steam navigator, is almost so, when his
                    voyage is a long one. The most remarkable occasions on which steam has the
                    advantage over sails are, in a calm, and when the wind is directly ahead. In a
                    calm, a sailing ship is utterly helpless, and must stand stock still; with a
                    wind in her teeth, if it blow hard, she can do nothing, or does worse than
                    nothing, drifts away from her point. There is another important occasion on
                    which a steam vessel, if properly handled, has a wonderful advantage over an
                    ordinary ship, and we advert to it, first, because we do not remember to have
                    seen it mentioned before; and, secondly, because it involves some considerations
                    of true seamanship, which it is the business of this Appendix to dwell on.</p>
                <p>We allude to the formidable danger of a lee shore, in a gale of wind, when we
                    shall suppose the weather to be such that a ship and a steam vessel are both
                    obliged to anchor, and that from the anchor not holding, or the insufficient
                    strength of the cables, there is risk of their being forced on the shore. In
                    this predicament, we have heard of a steam vessel, by the mere agency of her
                    steam, not exerted to any great extent, either keeping her cable slack, or very
                    materially relieving it from the strain produced by the wind. But even supposing
                    her stock of fuel expended, or that her machinery had got out of order, she may
                    still be looked upon as a ship with her masts cut away, which, we may explain to
                    unprofessional readers, is the most favourable condition for a ship to be in,
                    under such dangerous circumstances. It may be asked, and with great reason, why,
                    if this be so, should not the ship when in danger of driving on the rocks, also
                    get rid of her masts, by cutting them away, and so place herself in as
                    favourable a position as the steamer, on the lee shore? To this we answer, that
                    the operation of cutting away the masts is always a very serious one, and, like
                    the amputation of a limb to a labouring man, is not to be resorted to till the
                    last extremity. Besides, it is often a matter of doubt, which is the last moment
                    of safety, and the first of extreme danger; and as the commander of the ship may
                    not have had experience of such critical cases, he may, and too often does,
                    hesitate to dismember his vessel, till the anchor comes so rapidly home, that
                    cutting away the masts will not stop her headlong way amongst the breakers; and
                    then it is too late. The steam vessel, however, is <hi rend="italic"
                    >already,</hi> and at all times, in the best condition for anchoring on a lee
                    shore. We ought here to mention to our un-nautical readers, in what consists the
                    advantage of cutting away the masts, when a ship is in this situation, and is in
                    danger, from the violence of the wind, of being drifted on the rocks. It is well
                    known that the mere hull of a ship, placed with the bow to the wind, offers but
                    a small resistance to the wind, compared to what is presented by the masts,
                    yards, ropes, and sails; for though the sails be furled, they are generally, on
                    such occasions, but clumsily handed, and hold much wind. The form of a ship’s
                    bow is equally adapted, or nearly so, to passing through the air as through the
                    water, and the area offered by it to the wind is very small, compared to that
                    which the “top hamper,” as it is called, presents. Let any one in a gale of wind
                    on board ship take hold of the smallest rope, the signal haulyards, for example,
                    and he will find it requires a considerable exertion of his strength to prevent
                    its being blown out of his grasp, and in proportion as the rope is large, so is
                    the violence of the wind upon it. And when the immense number, and great length
                    of the whole ropes of a ship are taken<pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:chi.28490924&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=69" xml:id="kp-eb0720-0069-0055"/>
                    into account, to say nothing of the resistance of the lower masts and top-masts,
                    and the yards, however sharply braced to the wind, we shall be satisfied that
                    the resistance aloft is many fold greater than that which the hull alone offers
                    to the wind. Accordingly, the prodigious additional security which is imparted
                    to a ship on a lee shore by cutting away the masts, is well known to practical
                    seamen. This conviction, resting on the ever energetic mind of Nelson, though
                    within a few minutes of his last breath, was the true source of the last order
                    he ever gave, “Hardy, anchor the fleet.”</p>
                <p>Whilst speaking of the comparative merits of steam vessels and ordinary ships
                    under a stress of weather, it may be mentioned, that as steamers are furnished
                    with very reduced masts and yards, they are in the most favourable position for
                    making sail in a gale of wind, should sailing then he possible. In other words,
                    a sea-going steamer, though comparatively much undermasted, is enabled, in a
                    storm, to spread quite as much canvas as could be carried with advantage, in a
                    sailing ship of her size, at that particular moment. It must be remembered, that
                    the sailing vessel, in order to be able to make way in fine weather, is obliged
                    at all times to carry with her, and to expose permanently aloft, an extent of
                    masts and yards which is very detrimental to her progress in bad weather;
                    whilst, on the other hand, the steamer stows away her fine weather power under
                    hatches in her coal boxes, till the time returns when it can be used with
                    advantage.</p>
                <p>To return to the improvements introduced into the art of seamanship by the skill
                    and science of late years, we may begin by adverting to the remarkable
                    advantages which have been gained by the extensive use of iron on board
                    ship.</p>
                <p>In the year 1808, Captain Brown of the navy proposed the use of iron cables and
                    rigging; but it was not till 1811 that the cables were fairly tried. They have
                    since been used universally, and no greater boon was ever bestowed upon the sea
                    service. The original cost of a chain cable is not much more than that of a
                    hempen one, whilst its durability is greater, in a ratio which cannot be stated
                    in figures. The security afforded by it is vastly greater; for it is exposed to
                    none of the deteriorating causes which render a hempen cable, after much use,
                    comparatively so little trust-worthy. The alternate wetting and drying, which
                    saps the strength of a hempen cable, has no effect on one of iron. The friction
                    against rocks, especially against coral, is often fatal to a hemp cable in a few
                    minutes; but the same friction, after weeks of hard use,only slightly polishes a
                    few links of the chain. Intro-pical countries, therefore, the introduction of
                    chain cables has increased the security of ships at anchor tenfold; but in every
                    climate their advantage is immense. Nor does this advantage consist solely in
                    their strength and durability, for they are managed with much more facility,
                    occupy far less space, and are coiled away with little, or it may be said, no
                    trouble at all; for as they are hove in, they fall quietly into, and adjust
                    themselves, in a box or case near the hatchway, from which they are drawn up
                    when wanted with comparatively small labour. To those who remember the toil and
                    trouble of “forming a bend” in the cable tier, the wet and the dirt, and the
                    noise made by the numbers of men required to coil it away, these advantages will
                    not be considered as small ones.</p>
                <p>Several adaptations have been found necessary in consequence of the use of chain
                    cables. The hawse holes require to be filled with strong cases, or tubes of
                    iron; and a most ingenious and powerful stopper has been contrived by the late
                    great and good Sir Thomas Hardy, (the ablest seaman we probably ever had in this
                    country of seamen), by which the cable can at any time be prevented from running
                    out, whatever be the strain upon it. This stopper consists of a large
                    swan-necked bar of tough iron, which embraces the cable as it comes up the
                    hatchway, having one of the ends of the curve fixed to the beams of the lower
                    deck, by means of a powerful bolt, whilst to the other end is attached a tackle,
                    also worked on the lower deck, by which this curved stopper can be drawn tight,
                    and the chain pressed so firmly in its embrace, against the angle of the
                    hatchway, that however quickly it may have been running out, or whatever strain
                    may be brought on it, the cable is arrested almost immediately.</p>
                <p>Iron cables require a peculiar but easily-learned description of management. They
                    cannot, for example, be used in deep water, without some modification; for their
                    weight, added to that of the anchor, is so great, that the labour of heaving up
                    becomes prodigious. To remedy this evil, and yet to profit by the security which
                    belongs to rendering invulnerable that part of the cable most exposed to
                    friction by rocks, a device was suggested by admiral the Honourable George
                    Elliot, which having been found to answer the purpose, is now generally adopted.
                    An eye, with a thimble in it, is formed at the end of a hempen cable, and to
                    this is shackled, in the usual way, one of the lengths of the chain. The outer
                    end of this length of chain being then shackled to the anchor, the cable may be
                    used in any depth of water, with nearly as much security as if it were made of
                    iron from end to end, and with only the inconvenience arising from the
                    additional weight of one length of chain. Another device has lately been
                    introduced, which many seamen prefer. This consists of three-tapered tails of
                    small chain, shackled to the main one, by which it can be spliced with ease and
                    security to the hempen cable, with the strands of which it is “married” in the
                    usual way. One advantage of chain cables is, that a ship may often lie at single
                    anchor, without risk of fouling the anchor. If the scope of chain be too short,
                    the tides strong, and the ground either of sand or of smooth and hard materials,
                    there will be nearly the same risk of fouling the anchor as with a hempen cable;
                    but if the scope be long, the tides not very impetuous, and, above all, if the
                    ground consist of mud, there is scarcely any chance of this troublesome and
                    dangerous accident happening. It may be proper to explain, that “fouling the
                    anchor” means the entanglement of the cable with its flukes, or other parts, by
                    which its power of holding the ground is destroyed, or so materially lessened,
                    that when a strain is brought on it, the anchor slides along the bottom, and
                    consequently the ship is no longer held firmly.</p>
                <p>Any one who looks at an anchor will perceive that it consists of three principal
                    parts, lying at right angles to one another. 1st, The arms or <hi rend="italic"
                    >flukes,</hi> which form a sort of halfmoon, from the <hi rend="italic"
                    >crown</hi> or middle point of which springs; 2d, the <hi rend="italic"
                    >shank,</hi> a long, straight, and very strong bar of iron, firmly welded to the
                    crown at one end; whilst the other is passed through, and is firmly, grasped by
                    the 3d part, viz., a stout beam of wood, called the <hi rend="italic"
                    >stock.</hi> The end of the shank, which projects several inches beyond the
                    stock, is fitted with a strong shackle, (formerly with a ring, when hemp only
                    was used), to which the chain is attached. As long as the cable pulls the anchor
                    by means of this shackle at the end of the shank, the anchor does its duty, and
                    resists the effort to move it along the ground; and if the bottom be soft, the
                    strain of the cable has even the effect of making the bill, or point of the
                    lower fluke bury itself more and more deeply. The purpose of the stock, or long
                    wooden beam which crosses the shank, is to force the anchor to assume its proper
                    position, or that best adapted to its digging one of its flukes into the ground.
                    This important purpose is effected by the tendency which the stock has to lie
                    flat, that is, horizontally on the ground; a position, it will be observed,
                    necessarily implying that one of the flukes is up, and the other buried beneath
                    the surface of the bottom; so that if, by accident, the anchor, when first let
                    go from the ship’s bows, should rest on the ground with one end of the stock
                    sticking up, and the other down, which would bring the flukes flat, or
                    horizontally on the bottom, a position in which they would have no hold
                    whatever, a slight strain on the cable puts all to rights, by tumbling the<pb
                    break="no" facs="ht:chi.28490924&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=70"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0720-0070-0056"/> anchor over, so as to bring the stock into its
                    true position, namely, flat on the ground, and of course the flukes upright.
                    This tendency is the obvious consequence of the stock being so much longer
                    across than the flukes are, which naturally causes the anchor to tumble over
                    into its right position, whenever the stock is not lying flat, as it ought
                    always to do.</p>
                <p>For many years after the introduction of chain cables, hempen messengers were
                    used to heave them in; now chains are almost universally used, and a great
                    expense saved. The messenger is the endless rope which passes round the capstan,
                    and being attached to the cable by what are well called nippers, draws in the
                    cable along with it as the capstan is hove round. Iron nippers, too, must soon
                    become universal. Chain slings for the lower yards have long been in use, and of
                    late years chain topsail sheets, and chain ties, have been introduced, as well
                    as chain gammoning for the bowsprit, and chain bobstays, which are great
                    improvements.</p>
                <p>Attempts are now making, and we feel convinced that they will ere long succeed,
                    to introduce iron <hi rend="italic">wire</hi> rigging, which we consider as
                    stronger and better than chain, because less dependent on the accidental
                    quality, and careless manufacture of a single part. And here we cannot help
                    remarking, how strange it is that the plan of making iron bridges of wire, so
                    successfully adopted in Switzerland, France, and elsewhere abroad, should not
                    yet have found such favour in England as to be fairly tried. The noble bridge of
                    Freyburg in Switzerland, is several hundred feet wider than the Menai bridge,
                    and though it consists of but one span, it is equally strong, if not stronger,
                    and has cost not a fifth part of the money. We do not think wire will answer for
                    running rope; but for standing rigging it may, we conceive, be most usefully
                    substituted for hemp.</p>
                <p>The use of iron ballast, instead of dirty shingle, is also a recent, but valuable
                    improvement, and though the first cost is greater, it very soon overpays itself.
                    Iron ballast was first officially established in the navy about the year
                    1796.</p>
                <p>The next most important use of iron is in a department of seamanship which is by
                    no means to be lightly treated of, we mean the watering and provisioning of
                    ships. The introduction of iron tanks into the navy and merchant service has in
                    many ships doubled, and in all very greatly increased, the quantity of water
                    which can be carried to sea; whilst the quality has been improved in a manner,
                    of the extent and blessing of which no one can form an idea, unless he carries
                    in his recollection the filthy stuft’ which it was so often the lot of seamen to
                    drink in bygone days. The following statement shews, in a rough way, the gain of
                    stowage.</p>
                <p>The cask called a butt occupies about 35 cubic feet of space in a ship’s hold,
                    and this space, if it were entirely filled with water, would contain 217
                    gallons. A butt, however, actually holds only 108 gallons, so that one half of
                    the space is lost by the thickness, and by the form of the cask, which is the
                    worst possible for stowage, so far as room is concerned. An iron tank, of the
                    largest kind at present made for ships of war, is called a four-feet cube,
                    though it measures about an inch more in its external dimensions, and occupies
                    68 cubic feet of space. This area, if entirely filled with water, would contain
                    424 gallons, but it actually holds 400, which is only 24 gallons less than the
                    space could possibly contain. In other words, by using casks, you lose
                    eight-seventeenths, or nearly a half, of the stowage room, whilst by using tanks
                    you lose only one-seventeenth.</p>
                <p>A farther increase in the stowage of water is gained by having iron tanks made
                    either of a wedge, or of a flat form, to suit the curve of the ship’s hold, or
                    to enter spaces too low to receive cubical tanks.</p>
                <p>A single example of the change which took place in a line-of-battle ship, will
                    shew the gain effected by employing iron tanks instead of casks. The Melville,
                    of 74 guns, when fitted with casks, stowed, of water, 47,624 gallons, or 212½
                    tons. But when iron tanks were substituted, she stowed</p>
                <p>88,232 gallons, or 394 tons, or about four-fifths more water. Thus, if the
                    Melville, with a crew say of 600 men, at <hi rend="italic">a</hi> gallon of
                    water each per day, could keep the sea for only 80 days, or not quite <hi
                    rend="italic">three</hi> months, if it were kept in casks, she might carry, at
                    full allowance, 147 days water, or very nearly <hi rend="italic">Jive</hi>
                    months, if it were stowed in iron tanks.</p>
                <p>We have recently heard of some ships in which the bread, and other dry
                    provisions, were stowed in iron tanks, with great advantage, not only in respect
                    to stowage, but in preserving the provisions from decay. In hot and damp
                    climates this becomes a primary consideration; and we know of a ship of war
                    which, during the long and arduous campaign against the Burmese, by keeping her
                    dry provisions in tanks, effectually excluded from the air, preserved the whole
                    of her bread, flour, pease, cocoa, and rice, in the most perfect condition;
                    whilst in most of the other vessels a large proportion of all the dry provisions
                    were either decayed and rendered useless, or were eaten up by weavels and
                    cockroaches, in spite of every care, greatly to the inconvenience of the public
                    service.</p>
                <p>This recalls to our recollection the preserved meats, soups, and vegetables, in
                    cylindrical tin cases, first devised, we believe, by M. Appert, a Frenchman, and
                    now in general use at sea. These meats are expensive, no doubt, but in the long
                    run they often prove not so costly as live stock, because they eat and drink
                    nothing. In all her Majesty’s ships, these preserved meats have long been
                    supplied to the sick; and we are of opinion it would be sound economy to serve
                    them out once or twice a-week to the ship’s companies generally.</p>
                <p>The next most material change for the better, to which it is our duty to advert,
                    in speaking of seamanship in the most extensive sense of that word, relates to
                    the manner in which all ships are now navigated from port to port, and to and
                    from the most distant parts of the globe, not only with far greater celerity,
                    but with much greater safety than formerly. This truly wonderful improvement
                    which has of late years been introduced into the art of seamanship, in
                    shortening voyages, and adding to their security, as well as certainty, is due,
                    mainly, first, to the superior knowledge of the persons in charge of ships;
                    secondly, to the improved quality, lower cost, and greatly increased number of
                    scientific instruments and astronomical tables, now in the hands of every
                    seamanlike officer; thirdly, to the numbers, accuracy, and cheapness of the
                    charts of almost all the navigable regions of the globe; and, lastly, to the
                    more extensive and correct knowledge of the phenomena of the winds, weather,
                    currents, and tides of the ocean. To these vast helps, which every sailor may
                    now avail himself of, almost mechanically, there may be added others which those
                    only can profit by, who, to long experience, add a taste for science, which not
                    only sharpens the observation, but enables an expert navigator to appropriate to
                    the purposes of his voyage, the thousand and one variations to which the
                    elements are subject, but which no books, no rules, nor even talents, can
                    effectually teach the mere seaman how to apply. Nothing, indeed, is more
                    difficult in the practice of this branch of seamanship, than removing from the
                    mind of an old sailor erroneous impressions as to fact, even when substantial
                    means of correction are lying on his table. The truth is, the navigable world is
                    so wide, the phenomena of nature so grand and varied, that until we are schooled
                    by actual experience, we have not the means of grasping a sufficient number of
                    observations at once, to enable us to generalise them into a practical shape, in
                    the complicated art of seamanship.</p>
                <p>In the first rank of modern instruments used at sea, stands the Sextant, not the
                    old wooden quadrant of our grandfathers, and even some of our fathers in the
                    art, but the brass sextant of Troughton, Dollond, or Cary, divided to ten
                    seconds, and capable of taking lunar distances with precision. With such an
                    instrument in his hands, and with such a nau-<pb break="no"

                    tical almanac as ours now is, there is no magician in fairy tale, who could cope
                    with a well-practised seaman in the performance of miracles. What human feat, we
                    will ask, can exceed in wonder the exact determination of a ship’s place in the
                    midst of a boundless ocean, a thousand miles from land? This marvellous quality
                    of exactness, or rather, we should say, of infallibility, within certain
                    appre-ciablc limits, distinguishes the Sextant from all other nautical
                    instruments. Its operations are connected with those of the sun, moon, and
                    stars, and, by the nature of its construction, partake of their certainty;
                    whereas the Chronometer, which stands the next in order of importance, is
                    essentially a fallible instrument, and, though eminently useful in the
                    navigation branch of seamanship, and much more nice in its determinations, can
                    never be depended on as the Sextant can. These two instruments are admirable
                    allies, but neither is sufficient, if used without the other, to meet the wants
                    of modem navigation. A Chronometer may, and often does, change its rate, and
                    thus it may deceive, instead of instructing, the mariner, without his having any
                    suspicion of its misleading him, and though the chances of its doing so without
                    detection are much lessened, by adding two or three more chronometers, still
                    there never can be any certainty in the results. On the other hand, the errors
                    of a Sextant lie all within the reach of detection and appreciation. They
                    cannot, it is true, theoretically speaking, be fully corrected, yet they may be
                    sufficiently compensated for in practice, which is all the seaman need care
                    about. A single illustration will make this plain, even to those who have not
                    attended to such subjects.</p>
                <p>The longitude is found by measuring with a Sextant the angular distance between
                    the moon and a star; and if the instrument used were perfectly correct in all
                    its adjustments, true in its centering and its graduations, and the distance
                    were properly observed, the result would be quite correct. But experience proves
                    that every instrument, even after all the adjustments have been made as
                    carefully as possible, does, in fact, measure the angle either too great or too
                    small; and, consequently, the longitude which results from it will inevitably be
                    too far east or too far west. The manner in which this evil is got rid of, is as
                    follows. If the ship be in west longitude, and star observed lie to the <hi
                    rend="italic">eastward</hi> of the moon, and the sextant measures the angular
                    distance <hi rend="italic">greater</hi> than the truth, the resulting longitude
                    will be less than the truth. If another star be now observed, lying to the <hi
                    rend="italic">westward</hi> of the moon, and the same instrument is used, the
                    distance will, as before, be measured <hi rend="italic">greater</hi> than the
                    truth, but the resulting longitude will in this case be just as much <hi
                    rend="italic">greater</hi> than the truth, as the first result was <hi
                    rend="italic">less;</hi> but the mean of the two will of course be near the true
                    longitude. By using a Sextant in this manner, and by taking a sufficient number
                    of observations on both sides of the moon, when the distances are nearly the
                    same, so close an approximation may be made to the true longitude, that not only
                    may the ship’s place be found near enough to steer by, but the errors in the
                    rates of the Chronometers on board may be ascertained, and a fresh departure be
                    taken, with nearly as much confidence as if a well-known headland had been seen.
                    For all short voyages, such as those between port and port in the same country,
                    Chronometers may be pretty confidently reckoned on, since the chances of their
                    varying from their previously ascertained rates, in the course of a few days,
                    are proportionally small. In like manner, the intermediate short runs made by
                    the agency of the Chronometers, between lunar and lunar taken at sea, may be
                    relied upon in practice.</p>
                <p>Our neighbours the French, who are excellent navigators, use the reflecting and
                    repeating circle much more than we do; but we have no hesitation in recommending
                    the Sextant as much the superior instrument of the two for real work.
                    Theoretically, no doubt, the circle is more perfect; but it has disadvantages
                    which, after very long experience, we confidently affirm, render it less useful
                    to a seaman than the sextant. In the first place, its weight, and above all, the
                    surface it offers to the wind, render it more fatiguing to use, especially in
                    bad weather. In the next place, its radius being much shorter than that of a
                    sextant, the divisions on the limb are far less easily read off; a serious
                    objection to the use of a circle at night, when every practised seaman knows
                    that the best work in lunars is always done. If Troughton’s circle with three
                    verniers be used, which implies six readings for every complete observation, the
                    labour is highly irksome; but even if the repeating circle be used, the risk of
                    error, by the nicety of the manipulations, and the uncertainty of the
                    adjustments, are, we have always found, an overmatch for the simplicity of the
                    single reading off at the end. In short, we are sure that under the troublesome
                    variety of circumstances which are to be encountered at sea, a well practised
                    navigator, with a sextant in his hand, will do twice as much good work in a
                    given time, as he could do with any description of circle which we have had the
                    good fortune to use. On shore, indeed, the circle may often be used with greater
                    effect; but our present purpose is to treat of seamanship.</p>
                <p>The next in order of importance in the list of nautical instruments, after the
                    Sextant, is the Chronometer; an instrument to which modern seamanship is
                    indebted for very great service. We are old enough to remember when Chronometers
                    were not only not in general use, but were rarely employed except on voyages
                    expressly scientific. It is difficult to describe the degree of mortification,
                    we may almost call it grief and indignation, with which practical men, skilled
                    in the use of such instruments as we have been describing, and fully aware of
                    their importance in adding to the security of ships, and shortening voyages,
                    witnessed the contempt, or at least the neglect with which they were treated by
                    those most interested in their general adoption. They saw vessels fitted up with
                    every other description of costly equipments, with accommodations of the most
                    showy description, and stores of all kinds in profusion, while neither a Sextant
                    nor a solitary Chronometer ever formed, except accidentally, a part of their
                    provision. If the captain <hi rend="italic">happened</hi> to know any thing
                    about such matters (for he was not required to do so), and knowing how
                    advantageous they were to the success of his voyage, asked to be supplied with
                    them, he was told “that he might provide himself with these instruments if he
                    liked it;” and if the poor man could not afford to purchase them, the ship,
                    however valuable, was actually al-owed to sail away without the most important
                    part of her nautical equipment. Can any absurdity, or, we might almost add, any
                    crime, equal this? We could relate several instances, some of which have fallen
                    under our own knowledge, and others we know to be well authenticated, of ships,
                    and all their crews, passengers, and cargo, being lost, demonstrably so, merely
                    from the want of a Chronometer, which, by costing the owners forty or fifty
                    pounds, might have saved them as many thousands. Some owners are influenced by a
                    petty spirit of economy, ill understood; but by far the greater number are
                    misguided by their ignorance. Happy should we feel could we persuade the owners
                    of ships, and those who insure them, to see that their best interest lies in
                    providing the vessels, in the safety of which they are so deeply interested,
                    with proper scientific instruments, and, as a necessary concomitant, securing
                    the services of commanders really competent to use these instruments in a
                    seamanlike manner. The importance of all such enlarged considerations has of
                    late years been gradually making its way, to the great improvement of
                    seamanship; for the owners of ships have begun to find out, less from any
                    scientific knowledge of the matter, than from the mere instinct of gain, that an
                    attention to this branch of a ship’s outfit contributes<pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:chi.28490924&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=72" xml:id="kp-eb0720-0072-0058"/> to
                    their pecuniary profit, and that if it is really worth while to provide Sextants
                    and Chronometers, it is not less so to place them in hands trained to their use.
                    Thus the standard of the characters of commanders of vessels is raised in
                    proportion as their scientific acquirements are advanced, and, in the end, the
                    whole community is benefited, by the increased security, expedition, and profits
                    of commercial enterprise.</p>
                <p>When enumerating the scientific instruments which have been introduced into the
                    art of seamanship, we must not forget the Marine Barometer; an instrument, the
                    principle of which, so long well known on shore, has: only very lately been
                    adapted to sea uses. This adaptation is accomplished in the simplest way
                    imaginable, by merely contracting the throat of the tube which holds the
                    mercury, at some convenient point of its length, in such a degree, that the
                    oscillations of the fluid which the motions of the vessel would otherwise cause,
                    are sq much checked, that the height of the column can be observed, if not quite
                    as accurately as on land, at least with sufficient precision to give the seaman
                    indications of changes in the winds and weather.</p>
                <p>We must repeat once more that it is not our purpose to write a complete treatise
                    on seamanship, but merely to give a sketch of the most material advances which
                    have been made since the Encyclopedia was first published, in this thoroughly
                    practical science. It will be enough, therefore, to mention that the use of the
                    barometer at sea consists in giving the seaman information, before hand, of the
                    changes likely to take place in the direction as well as force of the wind; or,
                    which is often fully as useful, to let him know that, in spite of appearances to
                    the contrary, there will be no change. Cases intelligible to unprofessional
                    persons may easily be furnished by any seaman’s memory. We remember once,
                    rounding the Cape of Good Hope, on a voyage from China, in a crazy bark,
                    short-handed and ill-found, but with a fair wind, and the weather so moderate
                    that every sail could be carried with advantage. To all appearance, squally, and
                    perhaps stormy, weather was coming on; so that, had we not possessed a
                    barometer, ordinary nautical prudence would have induced us to shorten sail
                    before night, and thus we should have lost the charming fair wind which was
                    co-operating with the current to sweep us rapidly across the bank of Lagulhas.
                    But as the mercury indicated a continuance of fine weather, we carried on, sent
                    the people to bed, rounded the Cape in safety, and reached the trade winds in
                    time to accomplish a successful voyage to St. Helena and home. Nearly in the
                    same region, and under circumstances very similar, we were once grievously
                    tempted to trust rather to appearances than to the more substantial assurances
                    of the barometer, and on the approach of night to make more sail instead of
                    taking it in. As the darkness began, however, the confidence and pride of
                    personal experience gave way to the warnings of the instrument. The sails were
                    reefed, and every thing made snug for a breeze, greatly to the surprise of the
                    sailors, who saw no cause for these precautions. Towards midnight a gale came
                    on, which, had it not been anticipated, would speedily have taken in our sails
                    for us, by blowing them from the yards; and the success of the voyage in this
                    case also was chiefly due to the barometer.</p>
                <p>Without dwelling further on this tempting branch of the subject of seamanship, we
                    may venture to give one practical recommendation, which may possibly prove
                    useful both to the owners and commanders of ships. It is, that as much
                    responsibility as possible should always be made to rest on those instrumental
                    parts of the equipment which science, and an adequate experience of its
                    application, show to be really useful. Thus, we would have the owner of a ship,
                    free, and even generous, in his supply of sextants, chronometers, barometers,
                    and charts, to his captain, sure that, if he be chosen for his capacity, the
                    paltry cost of such sup ply will, in the end, be repaid fifty fold. On the other
                    hand, a commander so confided in, should study to use such means of instruction,
                    as not abusing them. The captain should be possessed of a certain knowledge of
                    their principles, in order to have that degree of faith in their application to
                    practice, without which they may well prove worse than none at all. We have
                    known some ships totally lost, and many voyages doubled in duration, merely by
                    the ignorant misapplication of a figure, or of an algebraic sign. But if the
                    captain knows the proper use of his instruments, he should trust to them, as he
                    is himself trusted by his employers; and by resting upon them that
                    responsibility which they are far more able to bear than he can be, however
                    extensive his experience, he will make out his voyage in safety, and learn, by
                    degrees, not only to feel, but to act on the belief of the uniformity of the
                    laws of nature, in the midst of the wildest apparent confusion.</p>
                <p>We had almost forgotten to mention, amongst the modern improvements in
                    seamanship, the immense advantage of correct charts. To any one accustomed to
                    use such charts as are now on board even the worst found ships, the sight of an
                    old “sea map” is enough to make his hair stand on end. In the first place, on
                    looking at the dangers which really exist, but which are omitted in the old
                    charts, he wonders how ships in those times ever escaped destruction; and in the
                    next, he finds the sea so thickly covered with rocks, and shoals, and those
                    vague “vigias,” now known to have no existence, that his admiration is great of
                    the boldness of those mariners who could sail on at all during the night.</p>
                <p>The government of most civilized countries having taken up this matter in
                    earnest, and sent their surveyors abroad, like geographical missionaries, the
                    world has been put in possession of charts of all those harbours, coasts, and
                    seas which are most frequented, and so accurate is the construction of their
                    maps, that ships duly provided with nautical instruments need scarcely ever
                    incur the danger of running ashore, except by stress of weather, or experience
                    any difficulty in finding safe passages amongst the most complicated sand banks,
                    coral reefs, or any other description of submarine dangers, the terror and bane
                    of old navigation.</p>
                <p>It would lead us beyond our limits were we to go into further detail, in order to
                    point out the various minor improvements which have been introduced into the
                    practice of navigation; though we feel strongly tempted to describe the
                    scientific remedies, for example, which have been applied to the steering
                    compass by Professor Barlow, to correct the local attraction caused by the great
                    additional quantity of iron that has lately been put on board all ships. For a
                    similar reason, want of room, we must omit all mention of the improved methods
                    of constructing ships, stowing their holds, making their masts, and, generally,
                    the improved mode of rigging, fitting out, and working ships. These details
                    being all parts of the same course of improvement, would enter naturally into an
                    express treatise on seamanship, but are much too voluminous for this place.</p>
                <p>There are two topics, however, on which we must be allowed to touch for a moment,
                    before bringing this Appendix to a close. One is, the improved discipline of the
                    British navy, and the consequent amelioration in the character of all the seamen
                    of the country. The other is, the change in the armament of the ships of war,
                    and the improvement in the training of our seamen to the duties required by this
                    change. Both of these points have so material an influence on the prosperity of
                    the country, and have become so completely part and parcel of the seamanship
                    upon which its glory as a nation depends, that on this occasion we cannot pass
                    them over in silence.</p>
                <p>There can be no good seamanship without discipline, for it is as essential to the
                    correct working of a ship that there should be a well-understood subordination
                    established on board, as it is to the correct going of a clock that all its<pb
                    break="no" facs="ht:chi.28490924&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=73"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0720-0073-0059"/> wheels and pinions should be made to fit, and be
                    so placed as to work properly into one another. To carry on this illustration,
                    it may be said, that whilst the mainspring of naval discipline is a sense of
                    duty, even this strong motive would not be enough to produce the desired
                    results, without the intermediate agency of an organised system of discipline,
                    the object of which is, to assign to each person on board a specific set of
                    duties, all which shall contribute to the main purpose; and, thus, as far as may
                    be possible, to arrange and condense the energies of the whole into one course
                    of uniform action, subject to the will of a supreme directing authority, who is
                    responsible to the country at large.</p>
                <p>in strictness, this well defined system of discipline belongs only to the naval
                    department of seamanship, but in a great measure it also applies, by
                    transmission, to the merchant service, where it works by the joint agency of
                    custom, example, and the several interests of the parties concerned. So large a
                    mass of the seamen of the country are employed in the navy, and so many naval
                    officers are employed in the merchant service in peace; and as seamen, by the
                    very nature of their lives, are perpetually changing from one service to
                    another, a kind of amalgamation insensibly takes place, and thus the discipline
                    established on board our ships of war, under the sanction of official authority
                    and long established usage, pervades, more or less, the whole profession of the
                    sea. In this view of the matter, the improved discipline of the navy has an
                    important bearing on the well-being of the country, in all those relations
                    connected with our insular situation; just as it might, by no strained analogy,
                    be said, that the education, discipline, and fixed doctrines of the Established
                    Church, have a salutary influence on the religious interests of the country,
                    into whatever number of sects the population may be nominally divided.</p>
                <p>The details of this branch of our subject might, we think, easily be made very
                    interesting, but neither our space, nor the purpose of this Appendix, will admit
                    of its being done here. We must content ourselves then, with saying that of late
                    years great pains have been taken to raise the moral character of seamen by
                    education, and by teaching them the advantages of sober and orderly habits, to
                    beget a feeling of self-respect, which is at the root of all good discipline.
                    Religious instruction, gently applied, and without any of that high-pressure
                    cant, of which the sailor, of all mortals, has most abhorrence, has been most
                    beneficially introduced. Light general reading has become general afloat, as
                    well as elementary instruction; and there cannot be a doubt that the seamen are
                    in consequence more correct in their moral conduct. The whole system of
                    punishments, too, has been much modified; for in place of the lash which, at one
                    time, regulated everything, a desire to prevent crime, and to lead the sailors
                    to act from principle, have been substituted with great effect. In fact, when
                    such a spirit as we have just alluded to, however engendered, pervades the
                    captain, officers, and petty officers, the sailors, forming the mass of the
                    crew, readily fall into the same current of duty, and all goes on cheerfully.
                    The power of using corporal punishment exists still, and that it ever must exist
                    in the navy, is the opinion of every person well-informed on the subject, and
                    who knows the character of seamen and the duties which are required of them on
                    board a man-of-war. There are no persons more fully convinced of this necessity
                    than the sailors themselves, or who are more sensible that, under the wise and
                    benevolent modifications now officially established in the navy, it is by far
                    the most effective, and at the same time the most gentle, method of preserving
                    order amongst those refractory subjects who unfortunately are to be found in
                    every ship. Without the power of occasional corporal punishment, we
                    conscientiously believe, it would be quite impossible to restrain such persons
                    within any bounds of decency, or to prevent them from becoming a curse to those
                    about them, whilst their lawless habits would unsettle the arrangements of the
                    best regulated ship in the fleet, and, in the end, render her, instead of a
                    bulwark to defend the country, a source of national weakness and dishonour.</p>
                <p>Since the peace of 1815, all the maritime nations of the world have been
                    gradually increasing the size of their ships of war, and adding to their weight
                    of metal. Recently, too, the use of shells has been introduced afloat; a measure
                    of questionable policy on the part of that nation which commenced it, but which
                    we, and others, are of course obliged to adopt. The shells are not, as
                    heretofore, fired from mortars only, but are thrown from the long guns used in
                    ordinary warfare in projecting solid shot. How far this new weapon may modify
                    the seamanship of naval engagements we are not prepared to say. In the mean
                    time, great pains have been taken to train a large body of seamen gunners,
                    including of course a proportion of highly-educated officers of all ranks;
                    whilst guns of the most approved calibre for shell practice, have been placed on
                    board every ship in the navy. The establishment of this new system of exercise,
                    through the agency of an express gunnery department of instruction, and the
                    manner in which it has been enforced in all our ships, have produced a marked
                    effect on the habits and character of the seamen throughout the fleet.</p>
                <p>Before closing it may be expected that we should say something of the probable
                    influence of steam navigation on naval warfare; and we do not shrink from
                    committing ourselves by an opinion on this point, though it be one much disputed
                    amongst professional men. Our notion is, that the introduction of steam will
                    make no difference whatever in the result of any contest in which we shall be
                    engaged, however the means may be modified thereby. The battle must still be
                    fought, as it always has been, and ever must be fought, by large bodies of
                    disciplined men, properly led, and properly armed; and the victory, as formerly,
                    will be decided in favour of those who have the best national spirit to urge
                    them on, or who, being equal in this respect, bring the greatest number into the
                    field. Line-of-battle ships, in this view of the subject, are merely convenient
                    vehicles in which warriors are brought, hand to hand, to settle their
                    differences by hard fighting. Steam will enable them either to come together
                    more quickly, or to avoid coming together at all, as the case may be; but
                    neither steam, nor any other mechanical agency, will ever dispense with the
                    moral agency of trained men, by whose conduct and courage alone the issue of all
                    wars must be determined. We have heard it suggested, and we think with not less
                    probability than ingenuity, that steamers in war will take the same place in
                    fleets that cavalry have long done in armies. It is a very important place, no
                    doubt, but it is not one which decides the eventual fate of the war; <hi
                    rend="italic">Chat</hi> is always the work of the infantry. The cavalry protect
                    the flunks, and otherwise help the infantry to get into action with that of the
                    enemy opposed to them, and when these are broken, they cut in upon them and do
                    much execution. In like manner, armed steamers will guard the edges of fleets,
                    tow three-deckers into action, and, when the enemy is discomfitted, will come in
                    with desperate effect to reap the iron harvest. Still we contend, that the great
                    battle which decides the fate of empires, must ever be fought by men, that is,
                    by numerous bodies of disciplined men acting together, duly led, and fighting
                    under the influence of national sentiment. It is impossible to impart this
                    sentiment to machinery; and though we do not deny that, occasionally, a steamer,
                    armed with guns of enormous calibre, may grievously annoy a line-of-battle ship
                    in a calm, or under some other untoward circumstances, we are fully satisfied
                    that by proper arrangements, every sailing ship may be so armed and worked, that
                    the moral and physical agents on board of her will prove an overmatch for that
                    power which relies, for its superiority, on its mechanical machinery alone. We
                    have no doubt, too, that ere long steam engines will<pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:chi.28490924&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=74" xml:id="kp-eb0720-0074-0060"/>
                    find a place on board all large ships of war (high-pressure engines of course);
                    for the absurd and totally unsubstantial prejudice against this modification of
                    steam power will, in the event of a war, if not long before, give way to the
                    prodigious convenience in the way of stowage, and other advantages, which point
                    out the expediency of its use in all sea-going vessels without exception. To
                    what extent ships of war may require to be fitted with steam power, is a
                    question which must depend on circumstances that cannot be foreseen; but that,
                    eventually, they must have, within themselves, some such means of locomotion,
                    besides what they may borrow from tug boats, we hold to be quite certain. (<hi
