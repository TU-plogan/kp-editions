                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra
                    space around the <gi>pb</gi> tag. Where a word is hyphenated at a <gi>pb</gi>,

                <p><label type="entry">SERVETUS, <hi rend="smallcaps">MicHael</hi></label>, a
                    learned Spanish physician, was born at Villanueva in Aragon, in 1509. He was
                    sent to the university of Toulouse to study the civil law. The Reformation,
                    which had awakened the most polished nations of Europe, directed the attention
                    of thinking men to the errors of the Romish church, and to the study of the
                    Scriptures. Among the rest Servetus applied to this study. From the love of
                    novelty, or the love of truth, he carried his inquiries far beyond the other
                    reformers, and not only renounced the false opinions of the Roman Catholics, but
                    went so far as to question the doctrine of the Trinity. Accordingly, after
                    spending two or three years at Toulouse, he determined to go into Germany to
                    propagate his new opinions, where he could do it with most safety. At Basel he
                    had some conferences with Oecolampadius. He went next to Strasburg to visit
                    Bucer and Capito, two eminent reformers of that town. From Strasburg he went to
                    Hagenau, where, in 1531, he printed a book entitled <hi rend="italic">De
                    Trinitatis Erroribus.</hi> The ensuing year he published other two treatises on
                    the same subject. In an advertisement to this work he informs the reader that it
                    was not his intention to retract any of his former sentiments, but only to state
                    them in a more distinct and accurate manner. To these two publications he had
                    the courage to put his name, not suspecting that, in an age when liberty of
                    opinion was asserted, the exercise of that liberty would be attended with
                    danger. After publishing these books he left Germany, probably finding his
                    doctrines not so cordially received as he expected. He went first to Basel, and
                    thence to Lyons, where he lived two or three years. He then removed to Paris,
                    where he studied medicine under Sylvius, Fermelius, and other professors, and
                    took the degrees of master of arts and doctor of medicine. His love of
                    controversy involved him in a serious dispute with the physicians of Paris; and
                    he wrote an Apology, which was suppressed by an edict of the parliament. The
                    misunderstanding which this dispute produced with his colleagues, and the
                    chagrin which so unfavourable a termination occasioned, made him leave Paris in
                    disgust. He settled two or three years in Lyons, and engaged with the Frellons,
                    eminent printers of that age, as a corrector of the press. At Lyons he met with
                    Pierre Palmier, the archbishop of Vienne, with whom he had been acquainted at
                    Paris. That prelate, who was a great encourager of learned men, pressed him to
                    accompany him to Vienne, offering him at the same time an apartment in his
                    palace. Servetus accepted the offer, and might have lived a tranquil and happy
                    life at Vienne, if he could have confined his attention to medicine and
                    literature. But the love of controversy, and an eagerness to establish his
                    opinions, always possessed him. At this time Calvin was at the head of the
                    reformed church of Geneva. With Servetus he had been acquainted at Paris, and
                    had there opposed his opinions. For sixteen years Calvin kept up a
                    correspondence with him, endeavouring to reclaim him from his errors. Servetus
                    had read the works of Calvin, but did not think that they merited the high
                    eulogies of the reformers, nor were they sufficient to convince him of his
                    errors. He continued, however, to consult him; and for this purpose sent from
                    Lyons to Geneva three questions, which respected the divinity of Jesus Christ,
                    regeneration, and the necessity of baptism. To these Calvin returned a civil
                    answer. Servetus treated the answer with contempt, and Calvin replied with
                    warmth. From reasoning he had recourse to abusive language; and this produced a
                    polemical hatred, the most implacable disposition in the world. Calvin having
                    obtained some of Servetus’s papers, by means, it is said, not very honourable,
                    sent them to Vienne along with the private letters which he had received in the
                    course of their correspondence. The consequence was, that Servetus was arrested;
                    but having escaped from prison, he resolved to retire to Naples, where he hoped
                    to practise medicine with the same reputation which he had so long enjoyed at
                    Vienne. He imprudently took his route through Geneva, though he could not but
                    know that Calvin was his mortal enemy. Calvin informed the magistrates of his
                    arrival; Servetus was apprehended, and appointed to stand trial for heresy and
                    blasphemy. It was a law at Geneva that every accuser should surrender himself a
                    prisoner, that if the charge should be found false, the accuser should suffer
                    the punishment in which he meant to involve the accused. Calvin not choosing to
                    go to prison himself, sent one of his domestics to present the impeachment
                    against Servetus. The articles brought against him were collected from his
                    writings with great care, an employment which took up three days. One of these
                    articles was, “that Servetus had denied that Judaea was a beautiful, rich, and
                    fertile country; and affirmed, on the authority of travellers, that it was poor,
                    barren, and disagreeable.” He was also charged with “corrupting the Latin Bible
                    which he was employed to correct at Lyons, by introducing impertinent, trifling,
                    whimsical, and impious notes of his own through every page.” But the main
                    article, which was certainly fatal to him, was, “that in the person of Mr
                    Calvin, minister of the word of God in the church of Geneva, he had defamed the
                    doctrine that is preached, uttering all imaginable injurious and blasphemous
                    words against it.”</p>
                <p>Calvin visited Servetus in prison, and had frequent conferences with him; but
                    finding that, in opposition to all the arguments he could employ, the prisoner
                    remained inflexible in his opinions, he left him to his fate. Before sentence
                    was passed, the magistrates of Geneva consulted the<pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:chi.28490924&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=176" xml:id="kp-eb0720-0176-0158"/>
                    ministers of Basel, of Berne, and Zurich, and, as another account informs us,
                    the magistrates of the Protestant cantons of Switzerland. And to enable them to
                    form a judgment of the criminality of Servetus, they transmitted the writings of
                    Calvin, with his answers. The general opinion was, that Servetus ought to be
                    condemned to death for blasphemy. He was accordingly sentenced to be burned
                    alive on the 27th of October 1553. As he continued alive in the midst of the
                    flames more than two hours, it is said, finding his torment thus protracted, he
                    exclaimed, “Unhappy wretch that I am, will the flames be insufficient to
                    terminate my misery? What, then, will the hundred pieces of gold, and the rich
                    collar, which they took from me, not purchase wood enough to consume me more
                    quickly ?” Though the sentence of death was passed against Servetus by the
                    magistrates of Geneva, with the approbation of a great number of the magistrates
                    and ministers of Switzerland, yet it is the opinion of many historians that this
                    dreadful sentence was pronounced at the instigation of Calvin. This act of
                    severity for holding a speculative opinion, however erroneous and absurd, has
                    left a stain on the character of the illustrious reformer, which will attend the
                    name of Calvin as long as history shall preserve it from oblivion. The address
                    which he used in apprehending Servetus, as well as his harshness towards him
                    during his trial, proves that he was as much influenced by personal hatred as by
                    a desire to support the interest of religion, though, no doubt, he believed he
                    was performing a very praiseworthy action. In what practical school were the
                    principles of toleration to be then studied? This intolerant spirit of Calvin
                    and the magistrates of Geneva gave the Papists a favourable opportunity to
                    accuse the Protestants of inconsistency in their principles, which they did not
                    fail to embrace. “How could the magistrates,” says the author of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Dictionnaire des Heresies,</hi> “who acknowledged no infallible
                    interpretation of the Scriptures, condemn Servetus to death because he explained
                    them differently from Calvin; since every man has the privilege to expound the
                    Scripture according to his own judgment, without having recourse to the church?
                    It is a great injustice to condemn a man because he will not submit to the
                    judgment of an enthusiast, who may be wrong as well as himself.”</p>
                <p>Servetus was a man of great acuteness and learning, and well versed in the arts
                    and sciences. In his own profession his genius exerted itself with success. In
                    his tract entitled <hi rend="italic">Christianismi Restitutio,</hi> published in
                    1553, he remarks, that the whole mass of blood passes through the lungs by the
                    pulmonary artery and vein, in opposition to the opinion which was then
                    universally entertained, that the blood passes through the partition which
                    divides the two ventricles. This was an important step towards the discovery of
                    the circulation of the blood.</p>
                <p>His works consist of controversial writings concerning the Trinity; an edition of
                    Pagninus’s version of the Bible, with a preface and notes; an Apology to the
                    Physicians of Paris; and a book entitled <hi rend="italic">Ratio Syruporum.</hi>
                    Mosheim has written in Latin an elaborate history of the heresy and misfortunes
                    of Servetus, which was published at Helmstadt in 1728, 4to.</p>
