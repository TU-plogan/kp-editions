                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">It</hi> is a singular peculiarity in the history of the
                        steam engine, that, ever since the period which exhibits the earliest traces
                        of its embryo, it has continued slowly and gradually to advance with the
                        flow of time towards its present state of high maturity, though not yet,
                        perhaps, of ultimate perfection. Other arts and inventions, once well known
                        and successfully used, after having attained a certain measure of
                        perfection, have again been lost sight of amid the ruins of empires and the
                        revolutions of nations, never more to be rescued from oblivion. While some
                        of these, on the one hand, have sprung suddenly up into maturity, arrayed in
                        the panoply of immediate power, being sent as it were directly by divine
                        mission, to perform some important part in the destinies of the world,
                        perfect from their birth, there exists another class of inventions and of
                        sciences that have themselves undergone so many revolutions as, in the later
                        part of their history, to present nothing more than the name in common with
                        the maturer knowledge of the present day. But our knowledge of the
                        properties and powers of steam, and its agency by a steam-engine, differs in
                        every way from the progression of other arts and other knowledge. Known in
                        the earlier ages of Egyptian science, it appears to have played its part in
                        adding to the imposing effect of those stupendous monuments of absolute
                        power which the storms of thousands of years have failed to obliterate. In
                        the more refined ages of Greece, steam appears to have ministered
                        alternately to the elegance of Attic luxury and the delusions of heathen
                        idolatry; and to have become extensively known until the destruction of the
                        Alexandrian schools of science dispersed those seeds of mechanical science
                        which the flames of its library have spared to Western Europe; and there,
                        imbedded in the ruins of learning during the dark ages of second barbarism,
                        they lay preserved, but unfructifying, among the other remains of the
                        learning of the middle ages; and when at length the light of knowledge once
                        more dawned on Europe, the science of the Greek philosophers was exhumed
                        from the rubbish which had concealed it, and revealed to the dawning light
                        by the mighty lever of the press. The work of Hero on <hi rend="italic"
                        >Pneumatics and Steam Machinery</hi> was one of the finest and earliest
                        specimens of the art of printing. Since that time the science of steam, and
                        the art of constructing the steam-engine, have made slow, regular, and
                        progressive advancement, until this mighty work of many hands has at last
                        attained a prominent importance in the interests of humanity, and become a
                        mighty element in the future destinies of the world. In this remarkable
                        course there has been no retrogradation. Centuries have added their
                        contributions to the elucidation of its principles and the perfection of its
                        mechanism; but no great revolution has ever thrown back, nor any single
                        effort reproduced the mighty machine.</p>
                    <p>It is this peculiarity which has induced us to present to our readers the
                        history of the steam-engine as the most apt and useful introduction to the
                        perfect comprehension of its principles and structuro. In many other
                        subjects the history of the science or art is little more than an
                        interesting and curious antiquarian research, fascinating to the virtuoso,
                        and even instructive to the historian or philosopher, but by no means
                        necessary, or even conducive, in any degree, to the acquisition or
                        comprehension of the modern condition of our knowledge. What, for instance,
                        have the astronomical systems of the Chal dees or the Greeks to do with the
                        Copernican system of modern astronomy? In what degree would a learner be
                        assisted in comprehending the sublime doctrines of the celestial mechanics
                        of Newton, by having made himself thoroughly acquainted with the cycles of
                        Hipparchus and Ptolemy, the crystal spheres of Frascatorius, or the
                        multitudinous epicycles of Purbach? But with our know ledge of the phenomena
                        and the powers of steam, the case has been widely different. The progress of
                        the steam engine has been coordinate with the progress of the human mind in
                        physical truth. The history of the past improvements of the steam-engine is
                        therefore the history of the human mind; and the same phases which have been
                        seve rally presented, at widely separated epochs, by successive inventors,
                        are the very phases of gradually growing knowledge by which a single
                        individuaI mind does most naturally and most profitably proceed, step by
                        step, to the<pb break="no" facs="ht:chi.28490924&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=719"

                        subject by the illumination of modern science. Of so large a sub ject, one
                        part only can be studied at a time, and that succession of parts by which
                        they enter into the mind in easiest transition is the very succession in
                        which history presents them to us.</p>

                        <p>The knowledge which some of the ancients possessed of the constitution of
                            steam is remarkably in accordance with the most recent modern
                            conclusions on this species of matter. Steam is now known to be only one
                            of the common airs or gases whose particles at one degree of heat and of
                            pressure assume a liquid form, and at another temperature and pressure
                            become solid ice.</p>
                        <p>The modern doctrine concerning matter may be thus stated; that matter is
                            known to exist in four conditions— solid, liquid, aerial, and etherial.
                            Earth and stone are exemplars of solid matter; water and mercury of
                            liquid matter; the atmosphere, and smoke, and steam, of aerial
                            substances; caloric, light, and electricity, of etherial matter. It is
                            further the doctrine of modern physics that no kind of matter
                            exclusively possesses one of these conditions as its distinguishing
                            property, hut that all may, in certain circumstances assume different
                            conditions. Stone is not essentially solid, for, by the action of heat,
                            it may be melted under pressure; and iron or lead, though usually solid,
                            may be presented in the liquid form; and the earths have likewise
                            assumed the form of liquids when the contrivance of the chemist has
                            succeeded in placing them in appropriate circumstances. Neither is water
                            essentially a liquid, for, when frozen, it becomes a solid, with which
                            we may construct houses, bridges, utensils, and even floating structures
                            capable of navigating the ocean; and, on the other hand, it is sometimes
                            reduced into the vaporous or aerial form, as when the wa ter of a
                            vessel, acted on by heat, is wholly dissipated and dispersed in an
                            invisible form in air.</p>
                        <p>lt is also to be observed, that the condition of a body may be changed by
                            the agency of heat. Solid ice, solid mercury, or solid lead, by the
                            addition of heat, are converted into liquids, or are melted; and form
                            liquid ice, (called wa ter,) liquid mercury, (called quicksilver,) and
                            liquid lead, (which has no separate name.) If to the liquid thus
                            produced from the solid we add a certain other portion of heat, that
                            will separate its particles still further from each other, and the
                            matter thus diffused over more ex tended space becomes reduced to the
                            aerial condition of steam, of mercurial or lithargical gas, or
                            transparent va pour. But still the matter has undergone no
                            constitutional change. It is only necessary to remove the heat, and the
                            particles will again come together and resume their primitive form. By
                            cooling down the aerial gas into which the matters had been dissipated,
                            or even by corn pressing them, so as to contract them into their
                            original bulk and bring them together into their original prox imity,
                            the particles will once more resume their pristine form, the vapour will
                            respectively appear as drops of li quid water, mercury, or lead, and
                            those liquids being more condensed, will congeal into the original solid
                            masses of solid ice, solid mercury, and solid lead. The most refractory
                            gases have actually been found to obey this law, and we have no doubt
                            that every substance in nature might successively be presented to the
                            senses in every one of these forms.</p>
                        <p>The following passages, taken from the <hi rend="italic">Timaeus</hi> of
                            <hi rend="smallcaps">Plato,</hi> present a remarkable accordance with
                            these enlarged views of the constitution of steam and other gases :—“Let
                            us therefore speculate concerning the nature and properties of fire and
                            water, air and earth. This is the more arduous, because it is necessary
                            to call into question, concerning each and all of them, whether they
                            should be denominated liquid rather than etherial, or aerial rather than
                            solid; or why any th ng should have one of these appellations rather
                            than all. For, in the first place, that which we now call ‘ water,’
                            being congealed, becomes (hard) as a stone or earth, but being melted
                            and diffused becomes gas or air, and this inflamed becomes fire, and
                            fire extinct becomes again congregated into air, and air collected and
                            condensed forms mist and cloud, and these again, more compressed, form
                            water, and from the water earth and stone are reproduced. And thus they,
                            in an endless circuit, produce each other. Since, then, these now appear
                            to be the same, who will assert that one of them is of the one kind
                            rather than the other? It is most safe, therefore, to speak thus; that
                            the thing we see is not absolute liquid, but something in the liquid
                            state. That air is not necessarily a gas, but something in the gaseous
                            slate; not as being a particular thing of this or that specific nature,
                            but that it is in such and such a condition.”</p>
                        <p>“Let us then distribute the four modifications of matter into fire,
                            earth, water, and air; and to earth let us assign an entical form, for
                            it is the most immovable of all these kinds—to water that which is less
                            movable than the other three—to fire the most easily movable form— and
                            to air that which is intermediate.”</p>
                        <p>It appears to us highly probable that the ancients knew more of the
                            phenomena of steam than has been generally admitted. One evident cause
                            of this mistake is the circumstance that no specific term equivalent to
                            the word steam was generally used by them; and water, when heated, was
                            said to be converted into an air. It is now almost perfectly established
                            by the progress of modern science, that steam is an air, (or gas,)
                            invisible and perfectly transparent, differing in none of its mechanical
                            properties from common air or gas, and in no respect differing in its
                            constitution from carbonic and other gases or airs which, at certain
                            temperatures and pressures, do, like steam, leave the elastic aerial
                            form and become condensed into steam. Many of the phenomena, therefore,
                            for which the ancients use the word air, are effects of steam, or of
                            steam mixed with air; and although they have not always carefully
                            distinguished these sepa rate effects, yet they have frequently made
                            judicious use of them. While, therefore, it would be wrong to draw any
                            parallel between the want of individualization manifested in their
                            writings, and the high generalization of modern science, it would be
                            equally wide of truth to deprive them, as has sometimes been attempted,
                            of the merit of having discovered and used some of the proper ties of
                            water in the aerial state, simply because they supposed it rarefied into
                            an air, and confounded its pheno meιιa with those of other gases, which,
                            mixing with it, also contributed to the effect—as when we find that air
                            rarefied by heat, and water rarefied into air, are men tioned.</p>

                            passages of which are identical with portions of modern treatises on
                            pneumatics: and many portions of his apparatus may be found transformed
                            into modern experimental models in cabinets of the physical schools.
                            Now,<pb break="no" facs="ht:chi.28490924&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=720"
                            xml:id="kp-eb0720-0720-0612"/> in the introductory portion of his work,
                            we have such statements as these:— <hi rend="italic">Water is
                            transformed into air by the action of fire. Far the vapours of boiling
                            caldrons are nothing else than attenuated moisture expanding into
                            air.</hi> Indeed, by the four elements the ancients appear to have meant
                            the same things which we now designate by different terms. We comprehend
                            all the mate rial agents with which we are acquainted under the four
                            great designations, solid<hi rend="superscript">2</hi>, liquids, air,
                            and ether. So exactly had the ancients their πυϑ and αηϑ, υδωϑ and γϑ,
                            to which they assigned different regions according to their weight;
                            first, the solids or earth, then the liquids above, next the aerial
                            covering, and finally the region of ether extending indefinitely beyond.
                            The moderns have shown that all bodies are probably capable of assuming
                            any of the three states and becoming solid, liquid, or fluid, according
                            to the circumstances in which they are placed; and we have every reason
                            to believe that Timaeus, of whom Plato speaks with so much reve rence,
                            entertained the same idea, and believed that even the air might assume
                            the state of a crystalline solid. It is not a little curious to find a
                            mathematician of the present day giving it as a result of his calculus,
                            that the air at a great distance from the earth is actually frozen into
                            a crystalline solid by the extreme depression of temperature. He was
                            probably not aware that his notion had been anticipated more than 2000
                            years. In this same work of Hero, we have descriptions and explanations
                            of apparatus, in which the power of fire acting on moisture and air is
                            made to produce phenomena of motion. He does not arrogate to himself the
                            merit of these inven tions, but has given them as principally a
                            collection from the works of those ancients who had long preceded him—
                            <hi rend="italic">the ancient philosophers and mechanics.</hi></p>
                        <p>His <hi rend="italic">Pneumatics</hi> commence with a lucid and excellent
                            dissertation on the properties of air as a medium for the communication
                            of pressure and motion, and especially upon the nature and effects of a
                            vacuum, subjects to be thoroughly understood by all who would master the
                            theory of the steam-engine. It is, indeed, as the means of producing a
                            vacuum, that steam obtains much of its value as a mechanical power. The
                            mode of raising water by a vacuum is thus described by him :—“When they
                            wish to fill with water the round medical glasses which have slender
                            long necks, they suck out the air which is contained in them, and,
                            closing the orifice with the finger, they invert them in the water, and
                            on removing the finger the water is drawn up into the vacuous space, in
                            contradiction to the usual law of fluids.” He then proceeds to state
                            that, “in like manner, air may be rarefied by heat even as other
                            substances are; for water is changed by fire into air, the vapours from
                            boiling caldrons being nothing else than expanded water taking the form
                            of air, and that mists and clouds are nothing else than water raised in
                            the air by heat, which are partly afterwards converted into air, while
                            portions again descend in rain.” He also attributes the origin of winds
                            to the “expansion and contraction of air and moisture by the alternate
                            heating and cooling produced by the sun’s rays and illustrates the
                            conversion of liquids into air or gas by the common observation, that,
                            after a lamp has gone out. the vapour continues to rise up by the heat
                            still left in it by the flame. Thus also, says he, a phial being filled
                            with heated air and inserted in water, this air contracting will draw up
                            water into the phial. Hence, he argues, that all airs consist of
                            inconceivably small particles of matter, between which there are left
                            wide vacuous spaces, so that, while the matter itself is incompressible,
                            the volume occupied by the aggregate may be increased and diminished,
                            and the air rarefied and condensed either by external force or the
                            action of heat.</p>
                        <p>The following description of the manner in which the force of steam,
                            issuing from a boiler, may be applied to supporting a weight, is given
                            in the <hi rend="italic">Pneumatics.</hi> “A boiler, perforated on the
                            top, is placed on the fire. From the perforation there proceeds a tube,
                            on whose extremity is fixed a hollow hemisphere perforated in like
                            manner.</p>
                        <p>If then we place a light hall in the hemispherical cup, it will follow
                            that the vapour rising up from the boiler through the tube will sup port
                            the sphere, and it will appear to dance.”</p>
                        <p>There is another apparatus in the <hi rend="italic">Pneumatics</hi> for
                            the purpose of producing a revolving motion by the action of steam—“by a
                            caldron placed on a fire to give motion to a sphere around its axis. Let
                            a boiler be set on the fire, and nearly filled with water, and let its
                            mouth be closed in by a cover, and let it be pierced with an opening
                            through the bent tube, whose extremity exactly fits into the hollow
                            sphere. But at the opposite extremity of the diameter let there be an
                            iron axis supported from the top of the cover; and let the sphere have
                            two bent pipes at the ends of a diameter perforated along with it, and
                            bent round in opposite directions; and let the hendings make right
                            angles and he in the plane perpendicular to the axis. Then it will
                            follow that, on the boiler being heated, the vapour rushing through the
                            tubes into the sphere will rush out through the reversed pipes of the
                            ball, and whirl it round on its axis.”</p>
                        <p>The same apparatus, on similar principles, is next applied by Hero to the
                            construction of a machine still more curious. The agent mentioned in
                            this case is rarefied air, although the action is of precisely the same
                            nature. Here the science of the philosopher appears to have been
                            degraded to the base use of assisting an idolatrous priesthood in
                            deceiving the populace by the resemblance of miraculous interference. “A
                            fire having been kindled upon an altar, living figures will appear to<pb
                            break="no" facs="ht:chi.28490924&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=721"
                            xml:id="kp-eb0720-0721-0613"/> lead a choral dance, even although the
                            altar itself be of transparent glass or horn. Through the epipyrus a
                            pipe is to be let down to the base of the altar, where it is to revolve
                            on an iron pin, the other end being passed through a tubular fitting
                            attached to the epipyrus. And this pipe is to have other little bent
                            pipes attached to it, and perforated so as to communicate with it, which
                            are to radiate opposite to one another around it, and turned alternately
                            in opposite directions. There shall likewise be a drum attached to it,
                            upon which the figures of the dance are to he set. Then, by the action
                            of the kindled fire, the air, being warmed, will proceed into the pipe,
                            and, from it being driven out through the bent tubes into the base of
                            the altar, will turn round the pipe and its drum."</p>
                        <p>The following is probably the most excellent of all Hero’s apparatus,
                            inasmuch as in it the action of steam produced by fire from water is
                            employed for the pur pose of elevating a fluid above its level, and
                            transferring it from one place to another. The design of the apparatus
                            is still, unhappily, to serve the purposes of superstitious worship.
                            “The fire of an altar having been lighted, two figures of living things
                            are to assist at the sacrifices, and the figure of a dragon is to
                            sybillate,” (or give forth sounds to be interpreted as oracles.)</p>
                        <p>“There is to be a hollow basis or pedestal <hi rend="italic smallcaps">
                            λ</hi><hi rend="italic">β,</hi> (fig. 7.) upon which is set the altar y,
                            having a tube δ ε descending to the middle of the basis, and is there
                            separated into three branches; the tube ε ζ passing to the mouth of the
                            dragon, the tube being carried to the vessel « λ containing wine, and
                            placed at the top of the figure <hi rend="italic">,</hi> and accurately
                            joined into its cover; and into the third tube a » ς, which, in like
                            manner, ascends into <hi rend="italic">ξ,</hi> another vase holding
                            wine, and is also accurately united to the top of the vase. Both ends of
                            the two vases are to be carefully closed. There are to he in both the
                            wine vessels bent syphons, of which the one extremity is in the wine,
                            and the other extremities, proceeding by an opening rendered perfectly
                            close through the covers of the vases, are conducted to the hands of the
                            figures officiating at the sacrifice. When, therefore, you are about to
                            sacrifice, you must pour into the tubes a few drops lest they should be
                            injured by heat, and attend to every joint lest it leak; and so the heat
                            of the fire, mingling with the water, will pass in an aerial state
                            through these tubes to (he vases, and, pressing on the wine, make it
                            pass through the bent syphons, until, as it flows from the hands of the
                            living creatures, they will appear to sacrifice as the altar continues
                            to burn, and the other tube being carried to the mouth of the dragon,
                            will make it give forth sybilline sounds.”</p>
                        <p>There appears to be considerable reason to suppose that, to their
                            knowledge of the mechanical powers and the elements of machinery, the
                            Egyptians added some acquaintance with the power of steam, applied,
                            however, only to the degraded service of superstition. The statue of
                            Memnon is said to have emitted sounds which Pausanias compares to those
                            produced by the snapping of the strings of a harp. Strabo expressly
                            states that he heard them; and Philostratus states, that when the sun
                            shone strongly on the statue, sounds proceeded from its mouth similar to
                            those of a stringed instrument. Hero of Alexandria in his <hi
                            rend="italic">Pneumatics,</hi> Salomon de Caus in his <hi rend="italic"

                            different ways the mechanical arrangements by means of which effects of
                            this kind might have been produced from the steam raised by the heat of
                            the sun in close vessels contained in the statue, and having
                            communication with organ pipes of different kinds.</p>
                        <p>The Romans appear to have done little for the mechanical arts, and
                            nothing for the improvement of steam apparatus. It was not until the
                            dawn of knowledge succeeded the darkness of the middle ages, that the
                            light reflected from the works of Hero, and the older mechanicians,
                            rekindled the flame of mechanical invention. The works of Archimedes and
                            of Hero were read with great avidity, and formed some of the most
                            popular productions of the young art of printing. The flame seems first
                            to have been lighted in Italy, for we have editions and translations of
                            Hero’s <hi rend="italic">Pneumatics</hi> rapidly succeeding each other;
                            the Bologna edition of 1547, translated by Giov. Baptista Aleotti, was
                            reprinted at Ferrara in 1589; Commandine’s translation was published in
                            1575, Alessandro Giorgi’s in 1592. There were other editions of less
                            note; and thus in a single century eight or nine editions were issued.
                            It was not to be expected that the seeds of mechanical knowledge, so
                            widely sown, should not falI on some rich spots of soil, where they
                            should bring forth fruit with increase.</p>

                            principles of pneumatics. A work which he published on this subject
                            contains the following passage:—“Make a box of glass or tin, having at
                            the bottom an aperture, through which is inserted the neck of a
                            distilling flask, containing one or two ounces of water, and let its
                            neck be cemented into the bottom of the box, that there be no escape.
                            About the bottom of the box there rises up a pipe at such a distance
                            from the bottom as to permit the water to escape, which pipe passing
                            through the cover shall rise a little way above its surface. The box is
                            to be filled with water by an aperture which is to be well closed, so
                            that no air may pass. Finally, place the said bottle on the fire, and
                            heating it slowly, the water being gradually dis solved into air, will
                            press upon the water in the case, and pressing with great force upon the
                            water which issues through the pipe,(the steam) will not make its
                            escape. And if we continue the application of heat, the whole of the
                            water (in the flask) will be at last exhausted; and while the water is
                            evaporating, the air (vapour or gas) will constantly press on the water
                            in the vessel, and the water will continually issue out. The exhalation
                            being finished, if you will measure how much water is out of the box;
                            that which is in the place of the water gone out, will give the measure
                            of the remaining water. Thus you find, from the quantity of water used,
                            how much water was dissolved into so much air. And, in like manner,
                            also, you can measure into how much of more rarefied air, air of the
                            ordinary density can be dissolved.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                        <p>Here we perceive that the knowledge of the conversion of water into air
                            or gas, taught by Hero’s <hi rend="italic">Pneumatics,</hi> was
                            extending itself in that country, and leading to further contrivances;
                            and we have also a beautiful and simple experiment, designed for the
                            purpose of determining the philosophical question, which formed an
                            interesting subject of research at a very recent period of physical
                            enquiry, “how much aqueous gas is formed by a given quantity of water.”
                            The method is not perfect, for a considerable part of the vapour would
                            be reconverted into water in the progress of the experiment; yet it
                            shows an acquaintance with the fact, that water heated by fire is
                            converted into aqueous air with sufficient force to raise water above
                            its level, and form a running streum, although, in this case, of no very
                            considerable height.</p>
                        <p>The spirit of invention, aroused by the first translation of Hero’s
                            works, did not confine itself to the country in which these works were
                            first disseminated, but spreading gradually northwards, displayed itself
                            in the works of an architect and engineer, Salomon de Caus, who had come
                            to England in 1612, and was employed by the Prince of Wales, afterwards
                            Charles I., to design grottoes, fountains, and other hydraulic
                            ornaments, for the embellishment of the prince’s palace at Richmond, and
                            for the gratification of his Royal Highness’s “gentille curiosité.”
                            These, with other machines, were published by him in a work entitled
                            “Les Raisons des Forces Mouvantes, avec diverses machines tant utiles
                            que plaisantes; auxquelles sont adjointes plusieurs desseins de grottes
                            et fontaines, augmentées de plusieurs figures.” Frankfort, 1615,
                            fol.</p>
                        <p>The work of De Caus is prefaced by an exposition of the principles of
                            hydrostatics and pneumatics, evidently derived from the writings of
                            Archimedes and of Hero. Among other things, he states that the violence
                            with which water is dissolved into air by means of fire is very great,
                            and that it is quite certain that a ball of copper containing water, if
                            placed on a fire, would be infallibly burst. “La violence est grande
                            quand l’eau s'exhale en air par le moyen du feu il est certain que si
                            l’on met la dite balle sur un grand feu, en sorte quelle devienne fort
                            chaude, il se fera une compression si violente, que la balle crevera en
                            pièces."</p>
                        <p>He afterwards proceeds to show how a jet of water may be made to rise
                            above its level, and play in the air by means of fire. A copper ball A,
                            (fig. 9,) has a tube D, furnished with a stopcock, by which water is
                            forced in and it is then closed. Another tube, B C, is closely fitted to
                            the same ball, but passes down to the bottom, where it opens amongst the
                            water; a stopcock regulates its opening, and immediately above the cock
                            the pipe terminates in the orifice of a small jet d’eau. In fact, the
                            apparatus is precisely that which Hero uses for raising a jet d’eau, but
                            without using the action of heat, when he forces air above the water,
                            and condensing it, raises a jet of water by its pressure, (as exhibited
                            in fig. 10.) Of course, the heat of the fire produces the same elastic
                            force in De Cause machine, by which the jet is made to play in
                            Hero’s.</p>
                        <p>There seems no reason to doubt that Salomon de Cans was a Frenchman by
                            birth, and he is said to have been a native of Normandy.<note

                            monarch an edition of his work, he describes himself as one of his
                            Majesty’s subjects. After leaving England, he settled in Germany, where
                            the Elector Palatine intrusted him with the superintendence of his
                            buildings and of his gardens. He finally returned to France, and died
                            there about the year 1630. He has sometimes been confounded with Isaac
                            de Caus, a native of Dieppe, and a descendant of the same family. The
                            latter published a work, entitled, “Nouvelle Invention de lever l’Eau
                            plus haut que sa source, avec quelques machines mouvantes par le moyen
                            de l’eau, et un discours de la conduit d’icele.” Lond. 1644. fol. This
                            work contains many machines identical with those described by Salomon de
                            Caus; and the similarity of subject, treatment, and title of the two,
                            has led those into much confusion who may not have examined both. Even
                            the painstaking and industrious Stuart seems to have been deceived, and
                            calls Isaac’s book a later edition of Salomon’s.</p>
                        <p>The direct emission of steam from an orifice of the boiler, which had
                            been used by Hero to sustain the ball in the air, was applied by Branca,
                            an Italian architect and engineer, to impress a revolving motion on the
                            vanes of a wheel like a common millwheel, and this communicating with a
                            series of toothed wheels to a series of pestles in mortars, was employed
                            to give them motion. This, and many other machines of which he does not
                            claim the original invention, but which he states he collected from the
                            inventions of others, were published in a quarto volume, entitled <hi

                        <p>Edward Somerset, Earl of Glamorgan and Marquis of Worcester, invented and
                            constructed the first steamen gine. His title to this honour has been
                            the subject of dis pute, some historians attributing to him a greater
                            share of merit than there was sufficient evidence to warrant, while
                            others deprive him of even that honour to which he possesses an
                            indefeasible claim. His life is one of the most romantic chapters of
                            English history. Enterprising, generous, disinterested, and confiding,
                            he was at once beloved and betrayed by his king, loaded with honours and
                            reduced to poverty; at one time exercising almost without control the
                            functions of the sovereign, conferring dignities from the rank of
                            marquis down to baronet, and at another thrown into prison, and begging
                            from a creditor the paltry loan of five pounds. Possessing inventive
                            genius of the highest order, he was considered a mad enthusiast because
                            his speculations were advanced so far before the age in which he lived,
                            and has been set down a quack and impostor by men incapable of
                            comprehending the nature or appreciating the value of his creations. The
                            slow march of knowledge and of time has at last revealed the worth, and
                            established the character, of an illustrious and unfortunate man of
                            genius, who only lived to complete his mighty design and carry it
                            happily into effect, and having done his work, went to take his rest in
                            death.</p>
                        <p>That the Marquis of Worcester was acquainted with the nature and force of
                            steam, no one has ever disputed; but it has been matter of serious doubt
                            whether the machine which he has described had ever any real existence.
                            Hitherto we have had nothing more than circumstantial presumptive
                            evidence of the actual construction of the marquis’s steam-engine. It is
                            only a few years since the industry of the indefatigable antiquary
                            Robert Stuart has presented us with an historical document of undoubted
                            authenticity, affording undeniable proof of the existence and efficiency
                            of one of the engines of the Marquis of Worcester, of more than two
                            horse power, employed for raising water on the Vauxhall side of the
                            river Thames. As the Marquis’s title to the invention has not yet been
                            established in any of the numerous treatises on the steam-engine that
                            have hitherto appeared, and as the proof we are now able to adduce must
                            for ever set at rest the querulous cavillings of those otherwise
                            respectable writers who have attempted to controvert the great truth
                            that the steam-engine is a machine wholly of British invention, we shall
                            give a short account of what the marquis undoubtedly accomplished.</p>
                        <p>We are principally indebted for our acquaintance with the mechanical
                            inventions of the Marquis of Worcester to a work in which he published a
                            list of one hundred of his mechanical. inventions, under the title of “A
                            Century of the Names and Scantlings of such Inventions as at present I
                            can call to mind to have tried and perfected, which (my former notes
                            being lost) I have, at the instance of a powerful friend, endeavoured
                            now, in the year 1655, to set these down in such a way as may
                            sufficiently instruct me to put any of them into practice.” Lond. 1663,
                            12ιno. Of this remark able work there are several other editions. The
                            following are the passages which have immediate reference to the
                            high-pressure steam-engine which he had invented and made. It may he
                            proper to premise, for the purpose of preventing the supposition from
                            being entertained that it was impossible to get devices of so complex a
                            nature carried into effect at a period when the mechanical arts of
                            construction had made so little progress, that he had employed
                            constantly in his service, during a period of five and-thirty years, one
                            of the most eminent artificers of the time, one Caspar Kal toff, and
                            that he had provided him with suitable work shops, tools, and machinery,
                            at an expense of more than ten thousand pounds. It thus appears that the
                            marquis was no mere schemer, but that he submitted his devices to the
                            test of experiment; and it is merely not passing the bounds of
                            credibility to suppose, that, with fertile resources, an active and
                            inventive mind, the best tools, an “unparalleled” artificer, and the
                            expenditure of great sums of money, he had in five-and-thirty years
                            constructed machines of such perfection as no other artist of his age
                            had accomplished, and few of the hangers on of a royal court could
                            understand or appreciate. No one who is acquainted with the modern
                            high-pressure steam-engine can fail to recognise it in the following
                            specification, which, be it observed, was given by the marquis rather
                            for the purpose of exciting curiosity than gratifying it—for stating the
                            capabilities of his engine than explaining its principle, which he
                            wished to keep secret for the purpose of obtaining a patent.</p>

                            so successively.”</p>
                        <p>The internal evidence of the truth of this description is too strong to
                            be resisted. We cannot say what ideas it may have suggested to such a
                            man ns Lord Orford, who was probably as ignorant of mechanical
                            principles as he was devoid of candour and charity to a man of
                            principles and religion different from his own; but to anyone conversant
                            with the mechanical contrivances and treatises even of that time, it was
                            scarcely possible to read the sentence without forming a distinct
                            conception of a similar apparatus to that here described by the marquis.
                            We shall see that the description was so perfect as to enable a
                            subsequent mechanician to reconstruct the machine of the marquis, with
                            some additions, and produce an effective machine for draining mines. We
                            see, too, how philosophical was the process by which he<pb break="no"

                            xml:id="kp-eb0720-0724-0616"/> advanced to the construction of his
                            machine. He made experiments of a conclusive nature on the boundless
                            force of steam. He found that the only impediment to its use was the
                            want of sufficiently strong boilers; and his having found a way to make
                            his vessels so as to be strengthened by the force within them, merely
                            shows that he overcame the difficulty of making steam-tight joints by
                            using internal flanges, which should become tightened by the pressure of
                            steam within them. There is also internal evidence of the genuineness of
                            his description in the statement of the quantity of water converted into
                            steam for the effect of raising the water,—“one vessel rarefied by fire
                            driveth up forty of cold water,” is a mea sure of the power of steam far
                            within the compass of its capability. Even under most unfavourable
                            circumstances, an unprincipled exaggerator would not have contented
                            himself with this moderate statement of its actual power.</p>
                        <p>But we have not yet concluded the marquis’s description of the nature of
                            his stupendous prime-mover; for his mind, in dwelling upon its
                            principles, applications, and powers, gradually became assured that his
                            engine was to become the most important and powerful agent in the whole
                            world, and appears, even at that remote era, to have obtained a glimpse
                            of the multifarious avocations and powers of the modern steam-engine. He
                            proceeds to describe “an engine so contrived, that working the <hi
                            rend="italic">primum mobile</hi> forward and backward, upward or
                            downward, circularly or cornerwise, to and fro, straight upright or
                            downright, yet the intended operation continueth and advanceth, none of
                            the motions above mentioned hindering, much less stopping the other, but
                            unanimously and with harmony agreeing, they all augment and contribute
                            strength unto the intended work and operation; and therefore I call this
                            a semi-omnipotent engine, and do intend that a model thereof he buried
                            with me.”</p>

                        <p>“Upon so potent a help as these two last mentioned inventions, a
                            water-work is, by many years’ experience and labour, so advantageously
                            by me contrived, that a child’s force bringeth up, an hundred foot high,
                            an incredible quantity of water, even two foot diameter, so naturally,
                            that the work will not be heard into the next room; and with so great
                            ease and geometrical symmetry, though it work day and night from one end
                            of the year to the other, it will not require forty shillings'
                            reparation to the whole engine, nor hinder one day’s work; and I may
                            boldly call it the most stupendous work in the whole world; and not only
                            with little charge to drain all sorts of mines, and furnish cities with
                            water, though never so high seated, as well as to keep them sweet,
                            running through several streets, and so performing the work of
                            scavengers, as well as furnishing the inhabitants with sufficient water
                            for their private occasions, but like wise supply rivers with sufficient
                            to maintaine and make them portable from towne to towne, and for the

                            yet greater effects of profits, admiration, and consequence; so that,
                            deservedly, I deem this invention to crown my labours, to reward my
                            expenses, and make my thoughts acquiesce in the way of further
                            inventions.”</p>
                        <p>To any one who is familiar with the advantages which such cities as
                            London derive at this moment from having the water raised up by fire and
                            distributed through the highest houses for private use; who has
                            witnessed the in credible quantity of water brought up by a Cornwall, or
                            Newcastle, or Staffordshire steam-engine from enormous depths, by the

                            raises through an equal height; who has observed the elastic force of

                            in any and every position its multifarious duties, and that a child’s

                            stupendous power, it must be most obvious that we have only carried to
                            perfection that engine which the Marquis of Worcester first conceived
                            and made.</p>
                        <p>Some points in the statement of the marquis, which had not formerly been
                            noticed, have received considerable elucidation, by a manuscript account
                            of his inventions, discovered a few years ago by Mr Robert Stuart, and
                            by another document, of no small importance in this question, which was
                            brought to light by the zeal and in dιιstry of the same writer, viz. a
                            Diary of Cosmo de’ Me dici, Grand Duke of Tuscany, who visited England
                            about the year 1656, in which he gives an account of the engine invented
                            by the Marquis of Worcester, which he had an opportunity of witnessing
                            in operation at Vauxhall.</p>

                                Savary.</hi></head>
                            <p>About thirty years after the marquis’s death, which happened in 1667,
                                the condensing steam-engine was in vented by an Englishman, Captain
                                Thomas Savary, and was by him introduced for draining mines, raising
                                water for buildings and gardens, and generating a revolving
                                mechanical power. He exhibited a model of it to the Royal Society of
                                London in 1699. <hi rend="italic">(Phil. Trans,</hi> vol. xxi. p.
                                228 ) We have seen that the marquis’s model appears to have been
                                placed on or below the level of the water to be raised, and that his
                                vessels being filled, their contents were raised by the elastic
                                force only of the steam. Mr Savary, on the other hand, erected his
                                engine at a height of nearly thirty feet above the level of the
                                water. A large close vessel was filled with steam; this steam was
                                recon verted, by cooling the outside of the vessel, into water,
                                leaving the large space it had formerly occupied vacuous; into this
                                vacuum water was raised, as into the vacuum of a common sucking
                                pump, by atmospheric pressure, and so within the limit of
                                atmospheric pressure, raised twenty eight or thirty feet. After this
                                was accomplished, the water was further raised through any remaining
                                height by the elastic force of the steam, just as in the engine of
                                the Marquis of Worcester. But the improvement was great. The same
                                force of steam, strength of vessels, and consumption of fuel which
                                was sufficient on the marquis’s plan to raise water thirty feet
                                high, would be capable first of drawing up the water thirty feet,
                                and then raising it thirty feet more; or doing double the work, or
                                sixty feet of height on Savary’s plan. This was certainly a notable
                                improvement.</p>
                            <p>There has been considerable discussion among the historians of
                                mechanics regarding the merits of Worcester and of Savary. Those who
                                have thought proper to praise the inventive talent of the one, have
                                thought it essential to their purpose to depreciate the merit of the
                                other. We think their claims rest on independent grounds. The
                                Marquis of Worcester expressly disclaims the use of a vacuum, which,
                                on the other hand, is the distinguishing feature of Captain
                                Savary’s, when he says, “not by drawing or sucking it upward, for
                                that must be as the philosopher calleth it, <hi rend="italic">infra
                                sphaeram activitatis,</hi> which is hut at such a distance; but this
                                way (by high-pressure) hath no bounder, if the vessels be strong
                                enough.” It appears, therefore, to us, that the inventions were
                                quite independent and different; and we have no hesitation in
                                admitting it as exceedingly probable, that when Captain Savary added
                                the principle of high-pressure to his own principle of a vacuum from
                                condensation, he was not unacquainted with the marquis’s works, and
                                even with his engine for raising water by fire, for which he had
                                obtained a pa<pb break="no"

                                Vauxhall. While we have thus expressed our own opinion of the
                                independence of their claims, we must not omit the opinions of
                                others who lived nearer to the epoch of these rival candidates.</p>
                            <p>Dr Desaguliers, an eminent mechanist, and an experimental philosopher
                                of considerable reputation, has given, in his <hi rend="italic"
                                >Course of Experimental Philosophy,</hi> vol. ii., an account of the
                                “fireengine,” and after adverting to the claims of the Marquis of
                                Worcester, makes the following statement in regard to Savary
                                :—“Captain S.wary having read the Marquis of Worcester’s book, was
                                the first who put in practice the raising water by fire, which he
                                pro posed for the draining of mines. His engine is described in
                                Harris’s <hi rend="italic">Lexico,</hi> (see the word <hi
                                rend="smallcaps">Εngine,)</hi> which, being compared with the
                                Marquis of Worcester’s description, will easily appear to have been
                                taken from him; though Captain Savary denied it, and the better to
                                conceal the matter, bought up all the Marquis of Worcester’s books
                                that he could procure in Paternoster Row and elsewhere, and burn’d
                                'em in the presence of the gentleman, his friend, who told me this.
                                He said that he found out the power of steam by chance, and invented
                                the following story to persuade people to believe it, viz., that
                                having drunk a flask of Florence at a tavern, and thrown the empty
                                flask upon the fire, he called for a bason of water to wash his
                                hands; and perceiving that the little wine left in the flask had
                                filled up the flask with steam, he took the flask by the neck and
                                plunged the mouth of it under the surface of the water in the bason,
                                and the water of the bason was immediately driven up into the flask
                                by the pressure of the air. Now, he never made such an experiment
                                then, nor designedly afterwards, which I thus prove: I made the
                                experiment purposely with about half a glassof wine left in a flask,
                                which I laid upon the fire till it boiled into steam; then putting
                                on a thick glove to keep the neck of the flask from burning me, I
                                plunged the mouth of the flask under the water that filled a bason;
                                but the pressure of the atmosphere was so strong, that it beat the
                                flask out of my hand with violence, and threw it up to the ceiling.
                                As this must also have happened to Captain Savary, if ever he had
                                made the experi ment, he would not have failed to have told such a
                                remark able incident, which would have embellish’d his story.”</p>
                            <p>We have performed the doctor’s experiment frequently, with various
                                results. If the mouth of the flask happens to be large and its neck
                                short, the water very cold, and the flask very perfectly filled with
                                steam, the effect is exactly what Desaguliers describes; for the
                                vacuum being suddenly and completely formed, the flask is first
                                pressed down towards the basin, which the hand resists by sustaining
                                the flask in the opposite direction, and just then the water rushes
                                with great velocity up'into the vacuum, and striking on the bottom
                                of the flask, now turned up wards, is apt to knock it suddenly out
                                of the hand, especially when held merely by a soft glove. But if, on
                                the other hand, the flask has a narrow mouth and long neck, and if,
                                when inverted, its neck be allowed to rest on the bottom of the
                                vessel, and if the water in the basin be not very cold, it will rise
                                slowly and gently, and the flask will be completely filled.</p>
                            <p>The doctor’s inference is not, therefore, perfectly just to Savary,
                                and allowing that Savary had read Worcester’s book, he would not
                                find in it any principle of this nature, hut an express exception
                                from it, as we have already stated.</p>
                            <p>Stephen Switzer, author of a <hi rend="italic">System of Hydrostatics
                                and Hydraulics</hi> published at London in 1729, takes a different
                                view of the matter. In the chapter “On the Engine for raising Water
                                by Fire,” he gives the following account of it :—“Amongst the
                                several engines which have been contrived for the raising of water
                                for the sup ply of houses and gardens, none has been more justly
                                surprising than that for the raising of water by fire; the
                                particular contrivance and sole invention of a gentleman with whom I
                                had the honour, long since, to he well acquanted—I mean the
                                ingenious Captain Savary, some time since deceased, but then a most
                                noted engineer, and one of the Commissioners of the sick and
                                wounded.</p>
                            <p>“This gentleman’s thoughts (as appears by a preface of his to a
                                little book entitled <hi rend="italic">The Miner’s Friend)</hi> were
                                always employed in hydrostatics or hydraulics, or in the improvement
                                of waterworks; and the first hint from which it is said he took this
                                engine, was from a tobacco pipe, which he immersed to wash or cool
                                it, as is some times done. He discovered that the water was made to
                                spring through the tube of the pipe in a wonderful and surprising
                                manner; though others say that the learned Marquis of Worcester, in
                                his <hi rend="italic">Century of Inventions,</hi> (which book I have
                                not seen,) gave the first hint for this raising water by fire.</p>
                            <p>“It was a considerable time before this curious person, who has been
                                so great an honour to his country, could bring this, his design, to
                                perfection, on account of the awkwardness of the workmen who were
                                necessarily to be employed in the affair; but at last he conquered
                                all difficulties, and procured a recommendation of it from the Royal
                                Society, (<hi rend="italic">Phil</hi>. <hi rend="italic"
                                >Trans.,</hi> 252,) and soon after a patent from the Crown, for the
                                sole making this engine; and I have heard him say myself, that the
                                very first time he play’d, it was in a potter’s house at Lambeth,
                                where, though it was a small engine, yet it (the water) forced its
                                way through the roof, and struck up the tiles in a manner that
                                surprised all the spectators.”</p>
                            <p>“About the year 1699, he wrote a small pamphlet or treatise
                                concerning this engine which I have just now mentioned, wherein he
                                has exhibited a draught of it; but as that consisted of a double
                                receiver, and a great many particulars not so easy for a learner at
                                first sight to understand, I have, first of all, inserted that
                                draught of it, and the account thereof, which Mr Bradley, in his new
                                improvements of planting and gardening, has given us of that at
                                Cambden House, it being an engine of Mr Savary’s own invention, and
                                which is the plainest and best proportioned of any that I have
                                seen.</p>
                            <p>“A the fire; B the boiler, a copper vessel of a spherical figure in
                                which the water is boiled and evaporated into steam, which passes
                                through the regulator C, which opens to let it into D the steam
                                pipe, of copper, through which it descends into E the receiver,
                                which is a vessel of copper also, that at first setting to work is
                                full of air, which the steam discharges through F the engine tree,
                                and up the clack valve at K, and so the air ascends in L the force
                                pipe.</p>
                            <p>“After E is void of air, which is found by its being hot (with steam)
                                all over, then stop the steam at C, and throw a little cold water on
                                the outside of the hot receiver E, so as to cool down the steam in
                                the inside, and so make it resume the condition of water, leaving E
                                a vacuum, into which the pressure of the atmosphere will raise a
                                column<pb break="no" facs="ht:chi.28490924&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=726"
                                xml:id="kp-eb0720-0726-0618"/> of water through the sucking pipe G
                                from H, the pond, well, or river.</p>
                            <p>“This being done, and the receiver now being filled with water, first
                                turn C, and let the steam pass into the receiver E, and it will
                                force the water therein through F by K up to L, which water cannot
                                descend because of the clack valve I. When E is thus emptied, which
                                may be easily perceived by its being hot, as before, turn C, and
                                confine your steam in B, then open the cock M, which will let a
                                little cold water into E and that, by condensing the steam in E,
                                will cause the water to ascend immediately from H and replenish E.
                                Then turn C to let the steam into E, and it will force the water out
                                of it up L, into a cistern at O, placed at the top to receive it.
                                Then confine your steam at C as before, and turn M for the space of
                                a second or two of time, and E will be refilled, and may again be
                                discharged up L as before; so that this work may be continued as
                                long as you please. The valves placed in the pipes at I and K are
                                shown on a larger scale at the side, and will enable the read er to
                                see how they permit the water to ascend, but prevent its return by
                                the weight of the water pressing down the clack.</p>
                            <p>“It must be noted that this engine is but a small one in comparison
                                of many others of this kind that are made for coal-works; but this
                                is sufficient for any reasonable family, and other uses required for
                                it in watering all middling gardens. Its dimensions are as follows
                                :—the pipe from the surface of the water to F is 16 feet, and from F
                                to the upper cistern 42 feet high; the diameter of both pipes 3
                                inches, and of the steam-pipe D, an inch. The receiver E holds 13
                                gallons of water, and the boiler three times that quantity.</p>
                            <p>“This engine will throw up four of the receivers full in one
                                minute=52 gallons, which is 3110 gallons an hour, =52 hogsheads an
                                hour, or 1248 hogsheads in 24 hours. The prime cost of such, an
                                engine is about L.50, as I myself have had it from the ingenious
                                author’s own mouth, and the quantity of coals required to work it
                                about one bushel in twenty-four hours. The expense is not
                                considerable to what horse-work is, which must be shifted twice or
                                thrice aday, especially in all wood or coal countries.”</p>
                            <p>It seems to us very probable, from the form of Savary’s engine, that
                                it was taken directly from that of a common drawing and forcing
                                pump, with the substitution of the force of steam only for that of
                                the pump piston. In Fig. 14, A B C D E F represent a common forcing
                                pump, as given in the hydraulic works of that epoch. A' B' C' D' E'
                                F' arc the parts of one of Savary’s steam-pumps. In the case of the
                                common pump, the solid piston or plug at C, exactly fitted to the
                                cylindrical chamber at C, is forced down by the lever E upon the
                                water in the chamber C, which is pressed out through the pipe at the
                                bottom, and being prevented from passing down to A by the closing
                                valve B, is carried up through the open valve D, and raised towards
                                the top of the reservoir F. When the chamber C is thus emptied, the
                                piston is again raised, and as it is perfectly tight, so that no air
                                can enter, the water is carried up through the valve B, which only
                                opens upwards, and thus the vacuum at C is filled from below, by
                                atmospheric pressure, with water, which is again to be forced back
                                by the descent of the piston; but as the valve B closes by the
                                pressure above it, and the valve D opens upwards, the water is
                                carried upwards and delivered at F, the top of the reservoir. For
                                the solid piston of the pump we have only to substitute the agency
                                of steam, and we have Savary’s machine. The close chamber C' being
                                conceived full of water, steam from the boiler is admitted by S',
                                and, by its elastic force, presses downwards on the surface of the
                                water at C', so as to force it out of the receiver; and finding no
                                exit by the closed valve B', it is forced through the rising valve
                                D' towards the receiver F'; in these circumstauces, the little jet
                                brought from the pipe E' is allowed to throw cold water for a second
                                or two on the close chamber C, now filled with steam, which is
                                immediately condensed into the small quantity of water from which it
                                was originally formed, and leaves the remaining space vacuous—into
                                which vacuum, as in the former case, water is carried up by the
                                force of the atmosphere, so as again to replenish the chamber C', as
                                at first, with water, which is in its turn to be acted on by the
                                elastic force of steam admitted through S', and carried up through
                                D' F' to be delivered at F'.</p>
                            <p>The reader who has followed this examination of Savary’s steam-engine
                                in its earlier form, is now prepared to understand the more complex
                                but more efficient form in which the engine was more generally used.
                                This form is that of the double receiver. The form hitherto examined
                                does not produce a uniform stream, because the receiver, after
                                having emptied its contents, requires a considerable interval to
                                fill again. The double machine renders the stream nearly constant,
                                for there are two receivers placed in communication with the boiller
                                and the<pb break="no"

                                when the one is being filled the other is being emptied, and when
                                the latter is again being charged with water from below, the other
                                is discharging its contents in the receiver above.</p>
                            <p>In this double form a model of the engine was exhibited to the Royal
                                Society in June 1699, and approved of. The following figure and
                                description are those given in the <hi rend="italic">Philosophical

                                B the boiler, CC two cocks which convey the steam alternately to the
                                vessels DD, which receive the water from the bottom in order to
                                discharge it again at the top. EE EE, valves opening only upwards;

                                action of this double engine is mani fest. One of the vessels (D) is
                                first filled with water from below, by the effect of the vacuum
                                formed in it, and is then discharged into the reservoir above. The
                                steam is then shut off, and the vacuum again begins to form, and
                                this first receiver to refill with water; in the mean time the steam
                                would be unemployed, and therefore it is now admitted into the
                                second receiver D 2, where it forms a vacuum, or if the receiver be
                                filled with water, forces it up to the top, and having emptied it,
                                is again shut off and forms a vacuum to refill this second receiver
                                with water. But in the mean time, this second receiver being now
                                vacuous, and in the process of being refilled with water from below,
                                the steam being unemployed upon it may be admitted to the first
                                receiver D, which has in the interval been charged with water from
                                below, and the steam acting upon it will continue the stream into
                                the reservoir at the top, until the other receiver, D 2, being again
                                filled, is again ready to be discharged in the same direction, and
                                so on as long as the cocks are turned.</p>
                            <p>But this working model of the Royal Society was by no means a perfect
                                machine for performing work on a large scale. We have, therefore,
                                extracted the following description of the machine of Savary, in the
                                form which he gave it when introduced for the purpose of draining
                                mines. The description and figure are taken from an old work in the
                                Advocates’ Library, entitled, “The Miner’s Friend; or, a Description
                                of an Engine for Raising Water by Fire, with an Answer to the
                                Objections against it. By Thomas Savary, Gent.” London, 1702.</p>
                            <p>Fig. 16 represents the engine of Savory as applied to the purpose of
                                drawing water from the bottom of deep mines. The furnaces, boilers,
                                and receivers are placed under ground, on a platform raised sixteen
                                or twenty feet above the level of the water at the bottom of the
                                mine. From this platform the chimney ascends to the surface along
                                the shaft of the mine, and a pipe through which water is forced to
                                the surface accompanies it.</p>

                            <p>“The manner of working this engine is first: there is a good double
                                furnace so contrived that the flame of the fire may circulate round
                                and encompass the two boilers to the best advantage, as you do
                                coppers for brewing. Before you make any fire, unscrew G and N,
                                being the two small gauge-pipes and cocks belonging to the two
                                boilers, and at the holes fill L, the great boiler, two thirds full
                                of water, and D, the small boiler, quite full;<pb break="no"
                                facs="ht:chi.28490924&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=728"
                                xml:id="kp-eb0720-0728-0620"/> then screw in the said pipes again,
                                as fast and tight as possible; then light the fire at B. No. 1; when
                                the water in L boils, the handle of the regulator, marked Z, must be
                                thrust off from you as far as it will go, which makes all the steam
                                rising from the water in L press with ir resistible force through O
                                No. I, into P No. 1, making a noise as it goes; and when all is gone
                                out, the bottom of the vessel P No. 1 will be very hot. Then pull
                                the handle of the regulator towards you, by which means you stop O
                                No. 1, and force your steam through O No. 2 Into P No. 2, until that
                                vessel has discharged its air through the clack R No. 2 up the force
                                pipe. In the mean time, by the steam’s condensing in the vessel P
                                No. 1, a vacuum of emptiness is created, so that the water must and
                                will necessarily rise up through T, the sucking pipe, lifting up the
                                clack It No. 3, and filling the vessel P No. 1.</p>
                            <p>“In the mean time, the vessel P No. 2 being emptied of its air, turn
                                the handle of the regulator from you again, and the force is upon
                                the surface of the water in P No l; which surface being only heated
                                by the steam, it does not condense it, but the steam gravitates or
                                presses with an elastic quality like air, still increasing its
                                elasticity or spring, till it counterpoises or rather exceeds the
                                weight of the water ascending in S, the forcing pipe, out of which
                                the water in P No. 1 will he immediately dis charged, when once
                                gotten to the top; which takes up some time to recover that power,
                                which having once got, and being in work, it is easy for any one
                                that never saw the engine, after half an hour’s experience, to keep
                                a constant stream running out the full bore of the pipe S. For on
                                the outside of the vessel P No. 1 you may see how the water goes
                                out, as well as if the vessel was transparent; for as the steam
                                continues within the vessel, so far is the vessel dry without, and
                                so hot, as one is scarce able to endure the least touch with one’s
                                hand; but ns far as the water is, the said vessel will be cold and
                                wet, where any water has fallen on it; which cold and moisture
                                vanish as fast as the steam in its descent takes place of the water.
                                But if you force all the water out, the steam, or a small part
                                thereof, going through R No. 1, will rattle the clack, so as to give
                                sufficient notice to pull the handle of the regulator to you, which
                                at the same time begins to force out the water from P No. 2, without
                                the least alteration of the stream; only some times the stream of
                                water will be somewhat stronger than before, if you pull the handle
                                of the regulator before any considerable quantity of steam be gone
                                up the clack R No. 1; but it is much better to let none of the steam
                                go off, (for that is but losing so much strength,) and is easily
                                prevented by pulling the regulator some little time before the
                                vessel forcing is quite emptied. This being done, immediately turn
                                the cock or pipe of the cistern X on P No. 1, so that the water
                                proceeding from X, through L Y, (which is never open but when turned
                                on P No. 1 or P No. 2, but when between them is tight and stanch ;)
                                I say, the water falling on P No. 1 causes by its coolness the steam
                                (which had such great force just before, by its elastic power) to
                                condense—to become, in the language of our author, ‘a vacuum or
                                empty space.' So that the vessel P No. 1 is, by the external
                                pressure of the atmos phere, or what is vulgarly called suction,
                                immediately refilled while P No. 2 is emptying; which being done,
                                you push the handle of the regulator from you, and throw the force
                                on P No. 2, causing the steam in that vessel to condense, so that it
                                fills while the other empties. The labour of turning these two parts
                                of that engine, viz. the regulator and water cock, and tending the
                                fire, being no more than what a boy’s strength can perform for a day
                                together.</p>
                            <p>“The ingenious reader will probably here object, that the steam being
                                the cause of this motion and force, and that steam is but water
                                rarefied, the boiler L must be in some certain time emptied, so as
                                the work of the engine must stop to replenish the boiler, or
                                en∣langer the burning out or melting the bottom of the boiler.</p>
                            <p>“To answer which, be pleased to observe the use of the small boiler
                                D, when it is thought fit, by the person tending the engine, to
                                replenish the great boiler, (which requires an hour and a half, or
                                two hours' time to the sinking one foot of water.) Then I say, by
                                turning the cock of the small boiler E, you cut off all
                                communication between S the great force pipe and D the small boiler,
                                by which means D grows immediately hot; by throwing a little fire
                                into B No. 2, the water of which boils, and in a very little time it
                                gains more strength than the great boiler; for the force of the
                                great boiler being perpetually spending and going out, and the other
                                winding up and increasing, it is not long before the force in D
                                exceeds that in L; so that the water in D being depressed in D by
                                its own steam or vapour, must necessarily rise through the pipe K
                                into L, running till the surface of the water in D is equal to the
                                bottom of the pipe H.</p>
                            <p>“Then the steam and water going together, will, by a noise in the
                                clack I, give sufficient assurance that D has discharged and emptied
                                itself into L, to within eight inches of the bottom. And inasmuch as
                                from the top of D to the bottom of its pipe II is contained about as
                                much water as will replenish one foot; so you may be certain it is
                                replenished one foot—of course then you open the cock I, and refill
                                D immediately.</p>
                            <p>“By which you will see that there is a constant motion, without fear
                                or danger of disorder or decay; and if you would at any time know if
                                the great boiler L be more than half exhausted, turn the small cock
                                N, whose pipe will deliver water, if the water be above the level of
                                its bottom, which is half way down the boiler; if not, it will
                                deliver steam.</p>
                            <p>“So likewise will G show you if you have more or less than eight
                                inches of water in D; by which means nothing but a stupid neglect or
                                mischievous design carried on some hours, can any ways hurt the
                                engine. And if a master is suspicious of the design of a servant to
                                do mis chief, it is easily discovered by those gauge-pipes. For if
                                he comes when the engine is at work, and finds the surface C of the
                                water in L below the bottom of the gauge-pipe N; or the water in D
                                below the bottom of G, such a servant deserves correction, though
                                three hours after that the working on could not damage or exhaust
                                the boiler. So that, in a word, the clacks being in all waterworks
                                always found the better the longer they are used; so here the same
                                effect is found, and all the moving parts of the engine being of
                                like nature, the furnace being made of <hi rend="italic"
                                >Sturbridge</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Windsor</hi> brick or
                                firestone, I don't see it possible for the engine to decay in many
                                years.</p>
                            <p>“For besides, the clacks, boxes, and water-pipes, regulator and
                                cocks, are all of brass, and the vessels are made of the best
                                hammered copper, of sufficient thick ness to sustain the force of
                                the working engine. In short, the engine is so naturally adapted to
                                perform what is required, that even those of the most ordinary and
                                meanest capacity may work it for some years without injury, if not
                                hired or employed by some base person on purpose to destroy it. For
                                after the engine is once fixed and at work, I may modestly affirm
                                that the adventurer or supervisor of the work will be freed from
                                that perpetual charge, expense, and trouble of repairs which many
                                engines are generally liable to.”</p>
                            <p>One of the first uses of Savary’s engine, proposed by himself, was to
                                raise water into a reservoir, from which it should he allowed to
                                fall on a millwheel, turning round the machinery in the same way as
                                a common fall of water; and alter reaching the bottom, it was again
                                to be raised by the steam-engine to the upper reservoir, for the

                                wheel. We are not, however, aware that any machine was applied in
                                this manner during Savary’s life; but after his death several of
                                them were erected by a Mr Joshua Rigley, at Man chester, and
                                throughout Lancashire, to impel the machinery of some of the
                                earliest cotton-mills and manufactories of the district. One of
                                these, of which we have here given the figure, was erected at St
                                Pancras, London, at the manufactory of a Mr Kier, where it long
                                continued to turn lathes, &amp;c. We have taken the following
                                description of it from Nicholson’s Journal.</p>
                            <p>“The figure is the section of this engine taken through the centre. B
                                represents a boiler shaped like a waggon, seven feet long, five feet
                                wide, and five deep; it was considered as being of dimensions
                                sufficient to work a larger engine; a circumstance which must, in a
                                certain degree, diminish the effects of the present one. The boiler
                                feeds itself with water, from a cistern, elevated by a pipe which
                                descends into the boiler and has a valve in it at the upper end,
                                which shuts downwards, and is connected by a wire with a float on
                                the surface of the water within the boiler, so as to open the valve
                                whenever the water subsides below its intended level; for the float
                                which swims on the water then sinks, and by its weight draws the
                                valve up to allow the water from the cistern to run down the pipe,
                                and supply the deficiency; but as the water in the boiler rises the
                                float closes the valve. The boiler, therefore, remains constantly,
                                or nearly, at the same degree of fulness.</p>
                            <p>“The steam is conveyed by a pipe C to a box D, through which, by the
                                opening and shutting of a valve, it can be admitted to the
                                cylindrical receiver A. The axis K serves as a key to open and shut
                                the valve, which is a circular plate formed conical on the edge, and
                                fits in a corresponding aperture in the bottom of the box D; H is a
                                cistern from which the engine draws its water, through a vertical
                                suction-pipe, in which a valve G is placed, to prevent the return of
                                the water; F is another cistern, into which the water is delivered
                                from the receiver A, through the spout F, which is provided with a
                                valve opening outwards; WW represents an overshot water wheel. 18
                                feet in diameter, of which the axis S communicates motion to the
                                lathes and other machines used in the manufactory.</p>
                            <p>“The engine raises the water from the lower cistern H, by suction,
                                into the receiver A, from which it runs into the upper cistern F,
                                and thence flows through a sluice into the buckets of the waterwheel
                                W, to give it motion. The water as it is discharged from the buckets
                                of the wheel falls again into the lower cistern H. As the same water
                                circulates continually in both the cisterns, it becomes warmer than
                                the hand, after working a short time; for which reason the
                                injection-water is forced up by a small forcing pump from a well.
                                This injection pump is worked by the waterwheel by means of a loaded
                                lever or pump handle, which is raised up by the motion of the wheel,
                                and then left to descend suddenly by its weight and force up the
                                water into the receiver. A leaden pipe passes from this forcing pump
                                to the upper or conical part of the receiver A, for the purpose of
                                injecting cold water at the proper time. Neither of these could be
                                represented with convenience in the present section.</p>
                            <p>“The manner in which the steam and cold water are alternately
                                admitted into the receiver A, remains to be ex plained. Upon the
                                extremity of the axis S of the water wheel a solid wooden wheel T is
                                fixed; it is about four feet in diameter, and turns round with the
                                water wheel. It is represented separately, as seen in the front. <hi
                                rend="italic">a b c d</hi> are four cleats, all or any number of
                                which may be fixed on the wheel at a time Each cleat has its
                                correspondent block, <hi rend="italic">e f g h</hi> on the opposite
                                surface of the wheel. The use of these is to work the engine. Thus,
                                suppose the waterwheel and this wheel T, with all the revolving
                                apparatus, are turning round, one of the cleats, <hi rend="italic"
                                >a</hi>. meets in its rotation with a lever, which it lifts up, and
                                this opens the steam-valve D by a rod of communication reaching to
                                the handle of the axis K. The steam consequently passes into the
                                receiver A, and the steam-valve shuts again as soon as the cleat <hi
                                rend="italic">a</hi> of the wheel T has passed away from the lever
                                by the motion of the wheel. All this time the correspondent block
                                <hi rend="italic">e</hi> on the other side of the wheel T had been
                                operating to raise up the loaded lever which forms the handle of the
                                forcing pump. And at the same instant that the steam-valve D is
                                shut, as above mentioned, the block <hi rend="italic">e</hi> quits
                                the loaded lever, after having raised it up, and leaves it to
                                descend suddenly by its own weight. This depresses the forcer of the
                                pump, and thereby throws a jet of cold water up into the receiver A,
                                and it falls in a shower of drops through the steam which fills the
                                receiver, so as to cool and condense the steam, and make a vacuum
                                therein. The pressure of the atmosphere upon the surface of the
                                water in the cistern H then causes the water to mount up the
                                perpendicular suction-pipe, through the valve G, towards the
                                exhausted receiver.</p>
                            <p>“When the engine is first set to work, the waterwheel being
                                motionless, the steam-valve and injection-pump are moved by hand;
                                and if the engine has been long out of work, two or three strokes
                                may be necessary to raise the water to the top of the receiver A, so
                                as to fill it full of water. As soon as this is the case, and the
                                steam valve is opened to admit steam into the receiver, the whole
                                contents of water above the spout and valve F then flows out of the
                                receiver A, by its own gravity, into the upper cistern R.</p>
                            <p>“The water which is thus raised is suffered to flow from the cistern
                                upon the overshot waterwheel W, through a sluice, and by that means
                                keeps the wheel in motion, and replenishes the lower cistern. There
                                is no reservoir for the injection-water, but the requisite quantity
                                is driven<pb break="no"

                                xml:id="kp-eb0720-0730-0622"/> up at each stroke; and as this is
                                done by the sudden descent of the loaded lever of the pump, the
                                water is injected very suddenly into the receiver.”</p>

                            <p>The title of this steam-engine correctly indicates the principle of
                                its action. The effect which it produces is not by the direct and
                                immediate agency of steam, but of the atmosphere. All that the steam
                                does in this machine is merely to make way for the atmosphere, and
                                give effect to its pressure. It is therefore necessary to retrace
                                our steps, and give some consideration to the mode of operation of
                                atmospheric pressure as an introduction to this description. A full

                                clearly made known, that the use of steam as the instrument for

                            <p>The reader of this very clear and accurate exposition may easily
                                perceive that when it has once been discovered that water, after
                                having been rarefied by heat into steam, so as to fill a large
                                space, is afterwards condensed by cold, so as to leave a portion of
                                that space vacuous, nothing remains to be done except to make the
                                vacuum of the flask ι by steam instead of an air-pump, and the
                                machine of Savary is obtained. In fact, the flask <hi rend="italic"
                                >i</hi> of Otto Guericke cor responds accurately to the receiver of
                                Thomas Savary. The reader has only to understand the former, in
                                order to perceive at a glance the action of the latter.</p>
                            <p>This first experiment of Otto Guericke, therefore, represents with
                                fidelity the principle of Savary’s engine for raising water by the
                                formation of a vacuum. Not less beautifully does another experiment
                                of the same philosopher exemplify the principle of the species of
                                engine known as the atmospheric engine, or Newcomen’s steam engine.
                                And its construction is peculiarly important at this stage of our
                                progress, as the reader has only to take the trouble of following
                                the details of the experiment of Guericke, in order to comprehend
                                correctly the machine of Newcomen. In fact, all his experiments on
                                the power of the atmosphere are admirable illustrations of the
                                principle of the atmospheric steam-engine; so that the reader will
                                do well to remember that the only use of the steam in the
                                atmospheric steam-engine is to form a vacuum.</p>

                                cylindrical, and having its sides perfectly even and parallel, and
                                about twenty inches high and eight inches wide, was fixed firmly in
                                a vertical position by the strong ring S. In the next place, a
                                piston, PQR, was made to fit exactly the inside of the aforesaid
                                cylinder, P being of iron and Q wood, and the rounded head R, formed
                                of the hardest oak, being hollowed out on the edge like the pulley
                                of a common well, in which groove flax or hemp is to be rolled round
                                so as to fill it up, and the whole is then to be placed in the

                                through between the piston and cylinder. Thirdly, the cylinder <hi

                                Fig. 20, by an iron bracket, through the ring aforesaid S, and the
                                piston PQR is to he let into the cylinder <hi rend="italic">a,</hi>
                                and the iron handle PQ of the piston is to be passed through the
                                ring of a second iron arm O, in such a manner that it can play
                                freely up and down through the whole height of the cylinder, and at
                                the same time be steadily preserved in the straight line, hut not

                                PQ, and the other end of the rope has other ropes attached to it, to
                                be grasped by the men, as in the figure.</p>
                            <p>"Now, if the stopcock X be closed, the piston being nearly at the
                                bottom, the joint efforts of fifty or more men will not be able to
                                raise it more than about half way up the cylinder.</p>
                            <p>“If, now, in the <hi rend="italic">fifth</hi> place, the large glass
                                receiver, formerly mentioned, which has been previously made
                                perfectly vacuous, (by an air-pump,) be applied to the stopcock X,
                                and then when the men are exerting their utmost force, the stopcocks
                                at X of the vacuous receiver and the cylinder be opened, so as to
                                make a free communication from the one into the other; the piston
                                PQR. will be suddenly forced down to the bottom of the cylinders in
                                spite of the greatest efforts of the men to keep it up.</p>
                            <p>“The whole cause of this matter is to be attributed to the gravity of
                                the air, which, when the vacuum is formed below, instantly presses
                                down the piston into it with a force which, according to our former
                                calculation, amounts in that size of cylinder to 2686 pounds'
                                weight.”</p>
                            <p>The next of the Magdeburg experiments still more closely resembles
                                the atmospheric steam-engine in its mode of application, and still
                                further illustrates it.</p>
                            <p>“By the above-mentioned invention, a child of twelve or fifteen years
                                old can raise an enormous weight. Every thing being left as
                                formerly, only the piston being nearly at the top of the cylinder
                                <hi rend="italic">a</hi>, you are to pass the rope round a second
                                pulley, hung from a staple; and by a hook to suspend from the rope
                                the scale of a large balance, which you are to load with a weight of
                                2686 pounds. If a small syringe be applied by a little boy to the
                                stopcock X to pump out the air. it will follow that, as the air is
                                pumped out from below the piston, the atmosphere above will press it
                                down and raise the weight.”</p>
                            <p>The transition from this to the engine of Newcomen is immediate. To
                                the last-described apparatus of Guericke let there be added a small
                                copper globe or boiler, Z, Fig. 22, to be placed over a fire till
                                the water which it contains boils into steam. This steam, entering
                                below the piston, will occupy the whole space of the cylinder; but
                                if now the stop cock X be suddenly closed, and especially if cold
                                water be sprinkled on the outside of it to cool it, the steam will
                                be condensed back into its original bulk of water, and leave the
                                space it formerly occupied in the cylinder a vacuum, into which the
                                atmosphere will press down the piston PQ R, just as in the former
                                instance, raising up the weights at the other end of the rope. This
                                is just the atmospheric engine of Newcomen.</p>
                            <p>It is the atmosphere which does the work; the steam acts indirectly
                                as the medium through which a vacuum is effected; and it is only the
                                efficient agency of the atmosphere which is thus rendered useful in
                                giving motion to a weight.</p>
                            <p>We hope that nothing which we have here said concerning the
                                discoveries of Guericke will be misunderstood, as intended in any
                                way to depreciate the value set upon the inventions of Mr Savary or
                                Mr Newcomen; they are only introduced as illustrations by which we
                                are most easily conducted to a thorough comprehension of the
                                principles on which they act, and of the state of knowledge of
                                atmospheric pressure which existed at that date. The experimental
                                apparatus of Guericke was in no respect a steam-engine; and although
                                his speculations were divulged before the inventions of Savary and
                                Newcomen, the agency of steam still remained to be introduced,
                                before a machine useful to the arts and industry of man was pro

                                >pump-valves, clacks, and buckets;</hi> whereas they had but an im
                                perfect notion of them before. One thing is very re markable. At
                                first working, they were surprised to see the engine <hi
                                rend="italic">go</hi> several strokes and very quick together, when,
                                after a search, they found a hole in the piston which <hi
                                rend="italic">let the cold water in to condense the steam in the
                                inside of the cylinder,</hi> whereas, before, they had always done
                                it on the outside. They used before to work with a buoy in the
                                cylinder inclosed in a pipe, which buoy rose when the steam was
                                strong, and opened the injection pipe and made a stroke, whereby
                                they were capable of only giving six, eight, or ten strokes in a
                                minute, till a boy named Humphrey Potter, who attended the engine,
                                added what he called <hi rend="italic">scoggan, by which the beam of
                                the engine always opened and shut its own valves,</hi> and then it
                                would go (entirely without the attendance of a man) fifteen or
                                sixteen strokes in a minute. But this being perplexed with catches
                                and strings, Mr Henry Beighton, in an engine he had built at
                                Newcastleon-Tyne in 1718, took them all away, <hi rend="italic">the
                                beam itself supplying all much better.</hi> The way of leathering
                                the piston was found by accident about 1713. Having screwed a large
                                broad piece of leather to the piston, which turned up the sides of
                                the cylinder two or three inches: in working it wore through, and
                                cut that piece from the other, which, falling flat on the piston,
                                wrought with its edge to the cylinder, and having been in a long
                                time, was worn very narrow, which being taken out, they had the
                                happy discovery whereby <hi rend="italic">they found that a bridle
                                rein or even</hi> a <hi rend="italic">soft thick piece of rope Or
                                match going round, would make the piston air and water

                            <p>This short note of Dr Desaguliers, who, with Switzer, is our
                                authority for the historical facts of this date, contains the
                                leading points of the history of the steam engine as generally used
                                for raising water during the eighteenth century. Newcomen gave to
                                the engine a <hi rend="italic">cylinder</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                                >piston:</hi> he formed <hi rend="italic">a vacuum in the cylinder
                                below the piston,</hi> by first admitting steam from the boiler so
                                as to expel air and balance the pressure of the atmosphere, nn∣l
                                afterwards <hi rend="italic">condensing the steam</hi> so as to
                                reduce it hack to its primitive hulk of water, and thus, by leaving
                                the space below the piston empty, allow <hi rend="italic">the
                                pressure of the atmosphere upon the whole surface of the piston</hi>
                                to carry it with a force somewhat less than fonr teen pounds on each
                                inch of that surface downwards to the bottom of the cylinder, so
                                that by suspending the piston with a chain from the end of a <hi
                                rend="italic">rocking beam</hi> to the opposite extremity of which
                                the <hi rend="italic">rod and buckets of a large draining-pump</hi>
                                were attached, a considerable volume of water was raised at each
                                alternate ascent and descent of the piston, which was raised up
                                again by the weight of the pumps and water, at the other end,
                                whenever the steam was readmitted below the piston to balance the
                                atmo sphere—he gave to the <hi rend="italic">valves, clacks,
                                buckets,</hi> &amp;c., that <hi rend="italic">improved mechanical
                                construction</hi> which rendered them suitable to the precision of
                                the action of steam. He first constructed a <hi rend="italic">piston
                                with an elastic packing</hi> of hemp, by which it is kept steam and
                                airtight as it moves along the cylinder; and, above all, availed
                                himself of the experience of an unlucky accident to add the
                                important process in the steam-engine of <hi rend="italic"

                                amongst it. All these inventions of Newcomen give to the
                                steam-engine of the present day its most important features; and if
                                we add to these the <hi rend="italic">scoggan</hi> or <hi

                                xml:id="kp-eb0720-0733-0625"/> The following is Dr Robison’s
                                description and explanation of Newcomen’s engine :—</p>
                            <p>Let A (fig. 23) represent a great boiler properly built in a furnace.
                                At a small height above it is a cylinder CBBC of metal, bored very
                                truly and smoothly. The boiler communicates with this cylinder by
                                means of the throat or steam-pipe N. The lower aperture of this pipe
                                is shut by the plate N, which is ground very flat, so as to apply
                                very accurately to the whole circumference of the orifice. The plate
                                is called the regulator or steam cock, and it turns horizontally
                                round an axis <hi rend="italic">b a</hi> which passes through the
                                top of the boiler, and is nicely fitted to the socket, like the key
                                of a cock, by grinding. The upper end of this axis is furnished with
                                a handle <hi rend="italic">b</hi> T</p>
                            <p>A piston P is suspended in this cylinder, and made airtight by a
                                packing of leather or soft rope, well filled with tallow; and, for
                                greater security, a small quantity of water is kept above the
                                piston. The piston-rod PD is suspended by a chain, which is fixed to
                                the upper extremity F of the arched head FD of the great lever or
                                working beam FK, which turns on the gudgeon O. There is a similar
                                arched head EG at the other end of the beam. To its upper extremity
                                E is fixed a chain carrying the pump-rod KL, which raises the water
                                from the mine. The load on this end of the beam is made to exceed
                                considerably the weight of the piston P at the other extremity.</p>
                            <p>At some small height above the top of the cylinder is a cistern W
                                called the injection cistern. From this descends the injection-pipe
                                ZSR, which enters the cylinder through its bottom, and terminates in
                                a small hole R, or sometimes in a nozzle pierced with many smaller
                                holes diverging from a centre in all directions. This pipe has at S
                                a cock called the injection-cock, fitted with a handle V.</p>
                            <p>At the opposite side of the cylinder, a little above its bottom,
                                there is a lateral pipe, turning upwards at the extremity, and there
                                covered by a clack-valve <hi rend="italic">f</hi> called the
                                snifting valve, which has a little dish round it to hold water for
                                keeping it airtight.</p>
                            <p>There proceeds also from the bottom of the cylinder a pipe <hi
                                rend="italic">p eg h,</hi> (passing behind the boiler,) of which the
                                lower end is turned upwards, and is covered with a valve <hi
                                rend="italic">h</hi>. This part is immersed in a cistern of water Y,
                                called the hot well, and the pipe itself is called the
                                eduction-pipe. Lastly, the boiler is furnished with a safety-valve
                                called the puppet-clack, (which, for want of room, is not
                                represented in this sketch,) in the same manner as Savory’s engine.
                                This valve is generally loaded with one or two pounds on a square
                                inch; so that it allows the steam to escape when its elasticity is
                                one-tenth greater than that of common air. Thus all risk of bursting
                                the boiler is avoided, and the pressure outwards is very moderate;
                                so also is the heat. For, by inspecting the table of vaporous elas
                                ticity, we see that the heat corresponding to 32 inches of
                                elasticity is only about 216° of Fahrenheit’s thermometer.</p>
                            <p>These are all the essential parts of the engine, and are here drawn
                                in the most simple form, till our knowledge of their particular
                                offices shall show the propriety of the peculiar forms which are
                                given to them. Let us now see how the machine is put in motion, and
                                what is the nature of its work.</p>
                            <p>The water in the boiler being supposed to be in a state of strong
                                ebullition, and the steam issuing by the safety valve, let us
                                consider the machine in a state of rest, having both the steam-cock
                                and injection-cock shot. The resting position or attitude of the
                                machine must be such as appears in the sketch, the pump-rods
                                preponderating, and the great piston being drawn up to the top of
                                the cylinder. Now open the steam-cock by turning the handle T of the
                                regulator. The steam from the boiler will immediately rush in, and
                                flying all over the cylinder, will mix with the air. Much of it will
                                be condensed by the cold surface of the cylinder and piston, and the
                                water produced from it will trickle down the sides, and run off by
                                the eduction-pipe. This condensation and waste of steam will
                                continue till the whole cylinder and piston are made as hot as
                                boiling water. When this happens, the steam will begin to open the
                                snifting-valve <hi rend="italic">f,</hi> and issue through the pipe;
                                slowly at first, and very cloudy, being mixed with much air. The
                                blast at <hi rend="italic">f</hi> will grow stronger by degrees, and
                                more transparent, having already carried off the greatest part of
                                the common air which filled the cylinder. We supposed that the water
                                was boiling briskly, so that the steam was issuing by the
                                safety-valve which is in the top of the boiler, and through every
                                crevice. The opening of the steam-cock puts an end to this at once,
                                and it has sometimes happened that the cold cylinder abstracts the
                                steam from the boiler with such astonishing rapidity, that the
                                pressure of the atmo sphere has burst up the bottom of the boiler.
                                We may here mention an accident of which we were witnesses, which
                                also shows the immense rapidity of the condensation. The boiler was
                                in a frail shed at the side of the enginehouse; a shoot of snow from
                                the top of the house fell down and broke through the roof of the
                                shed, and was scattered over the head of the boiler, which was of an
                                oblong or oval shape. In an instant the sides of it were squeezed
                                together by the pressure of the atmosphere.</p>
                            <p>When the manager of the engine perceives that not only the blast at
                                the snifting-valve is strong and steady, but that the boiler is now
                                fully supplied with steam of a proper strength, appearing by the
                                renewal of the dis charge at the safety-valve, he shuts the steam
                                cock, and opens the injection-cock S by turning its handle V. The
                                pressure of the column of water in the injection-pipe ZS,
                                immediately forces some water through the spout R. This coming in
                                contact with the pure vapour which now fills the cylinder, condenses
                                it, and thus makes a partial void, into which the more distant steam
                                immediately expands, and by expanding collapses, (as has been
                                already observed.) What remains in the cylinder no longer balances
                                the atmospherical pressure on the surface of the water in the
                                injection-cistern, and therefore the water spouts rapidly through
                                the hole R, by the joint action of the column ZS, and the unbalanced
                                pressure of the atmosphere; at the same time the snifting-valve <hi
                                rend="italic">f</hi> and the eduction-valve <hi rend="italic"
                                >h,</hi> are shut by the unbalanced pressure of the atmosphere. The
                                velocity of the injection water must therefore rapidly increase, and
                                the jet will dash (if single,) against the bottom of the piston, and
                                be scattered through the whole capacity of the cylinder. In a very
                                short space of time, therefore, the condensation of the steam
                                becomes universal, and the elasticity of what remains is almost
                                nothing. The whole pressure of the atmosphere is exerted on the
                                upper surface of the piston, while there is hardly any on its under
                                side. Therefore, if the load on the outer end E of the working-beam
                                be inferior to this pressure, it must yield to it. The piston P must
                                descend, and the pump-piston L, must ascend, bringing along with it
                                the water of the mine, and the motion must continue till the great
                                piston reaches the bottom of the cylinder; for it is not like the
                                motion which would take place in a cylinder of air rarefied to the
                                same degree. In this last case, the impelling force would be
                                continually diminished, because the capacity of the cylinder is
                                diminished by the descent of the piston, and the air in it is
                                continually becoming more dense and elastic. The piston would stop
                                at a certain height, where the elasticity of the included air,
                                together with the load at E, would balance the atmospherical
                                pressure on the piston. But when the contents of the cylinder are
                                pure vapour, and the continued stream of injected cold water keeps
                                down its temperature to the same pitch as at the beginning, the
                                elasticity of the remaining steam can never increase by<pb
                                break="no" facs="ht:chi.28490924&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=734"
                                xml:id="kp-eb0720-0734-0626"/> the descent of the piston, nor exceed
                                what corresponds to this temperature. The impelling or accelerating
                                force therefore remains the same, and the descent of the piston will
                                be uniformly accelerated, if there be not an increase of resistance
                                arising from the nature of the work performed by the other end of
                                the beam. This circumstance will come under consideration
                                afterwards, and we need not attend to it at present. It is enough
                                for our present purpose to see, that if the cylinder have been
                                completely purged of common air before the steam-cock was shut, and
                                if none have entered since, the piston will descend to the very
                                bottom of the cylinder. And this may be frequently observed in a
                                good steam-engine, where every part is airtight. It sometimes
                                happens, by the pit-pump drawing air, or some part of the
                                communication between the two strains giving way, that the piston
                                comes down with such violence as to knock out the bottom of the
                                cylinder with the blow.</p>
                            <p>The only observation which remains to be made on the motion of the
                                piston in descending is, that it does not begin at the instant the
                                injection is made. The piston was kept at the top by the
                                preponderancy of the outer end of the working-beam, and it must
                                remain there till the difference between the elasticity of the steam
                                below it and the pressure of the atmosphere exceed this
                                preponderancy. There must, therefore, be a small space of time
                                between the beginning of the condensation and the beginning of the
                                motion. This is very small, not exceeding the third or the fourth
                                part of a second; but it may be very distinctly observed by an
                                attentive spectator. He will see, that the instant the
                                injection-cock is opened, the cylinder will sensibly rise upwards a
                                little by the pressure of the air on its bottom. Its whole weight is
                                net nearly equal to this pressure; and instead of its being
                                necessary to <hi rend="italic">support</hi> it by a strong floor, we
                                must <hi rend="italic">keep it down</hi> by strong joists loaded by
                                heavy walls. It is usual to frame these joints into the posts which
                                carry the axis of the working-beam, and are therefore loaded with
                                the whole strain of the machine. This rising of the cylinder shows
                                the instantaneous commencement of the condensation; and it is not
                                till <hi rend="italic">after</hi> this has been distinctly observed,
                                that the piston is seen to start, and begin to descend.</p>
                            <p>When the manager sees the piston as low as he thinks proper, he shuts
                                the injection-cock, and opens the steam cock. The steam has been
                                accumulating above the water in the boiler during the whole time of
                                the piston’s descent, and is now rushing violently through the
                                puppet clack. The moment, therefore, that the steam-cock is opened,
                                it rushes violently into the cylinder, haring an elasticity greater
                                than that of the air. It therefore immediately blows open the
                                snifting valve, and allows (at least) the water which had come in by
                                the former injection, and what arose from the condensed steam, to
                                descend by its own weight through the eduction-pipe <hi
                                rend="italic">d c g h,</hi> to open the valve <hi rend="italic"
                                >h,</hi> and to run out into the hot well. And we must easily see
                                that this water is boiling hot; for while lying in the bottom of the
                                cylinder, it will condense steam till it acquire this temperature,
                                and therefore cannot run down till it condenses no more. There is
                                still a waste of steam at its first admission, in order to heat the
                                inside of the cylinder and the injected water to the boiling
                                temperature; but the space being small, and the whole being already
                                very warm, this is very soon done; and when things are properly
                                constructed, little more steam is wasted than what will warm the
                                cylinder; for the eduution-pipe receives the injection water even
                                during the descent of the piston, and it is therefore removed pretty
                                much out of the way of the steam.</p>
                            <p>This first puff of the entering steam is of great service: it drives
                                out of the cylinder the vapour which it finds there. This is seldom
                                pure watery vapour: all water contains a quantity of air in a state
                                of chemical union. The union is but feeble, and a boiling heat is
                                sufficient for disengaging the greatest part of it by increasing its
                                elasticity. It may also be disengaged by simply removing the
                                external pressure of the atmosphere. This is clearly seen when we
                                expose a glass of water in an exhausted receiver. Therefore the
                                small space below the piston contains watery vapour mixed with all
                                the air which had been disengaged from the water in the boiler by
                                ebullition, and all that was separated from the injection water by
                                the diminution of external pressure. All this is blown out of the
                                cylinder by the first puff of steam. We may observe in this place,
                                that waters differ exceedingly in the quantity of air which they
                                hold in a state of solution. All springwater contains much of it:
                                and water newly brought up from deep mines contains a great deal
                                more, because the solution was aided in these situations by great
                                pressures. Such waters sparkle when poured into a glass. It is
                                therefore of great consequence to the good performance of a
                                steam-engine to use water containing little air, both in the boiler
                                and in the injection cistern. The water of running brooks is
                                preferable to all others, and the freer it is from any saline
                                impregnation it generally contains the less air. Such engines as are
                                so unfortunately situated that they are obliged to employ the very
                                water which they have brought up from great depths, are found
                                greatly inferior in their performance to others. The air collected
                                below the piston greatly diminishes the accelerating force, and the
                                expulsion of such a quantity requires a longcontinued blast of the
                                best steam at the beginning of every stroke, lt is advisable to keep
                                such water in a large shallow pond for a long while before using
                                it.</p>
                            <p>Let us now consider the state of the piston. It is evident that it
                                will start, or begin to rise, the moment the steam-cock is opened;
                                for at that instant the excess of atmospherical pressure, by which
                                it was kept down in opposition to the preponderancy of the outer end
                                of the beam, is diminished. The piston is therefore <hi
                                rend="italic">dragged</hi> upwards, and it will rise even although
                                the steam which is admitted be not so elastic as common air. Suppose
                                the mercury in the barometer to stand at 30 inches, and that the
                                preponderancy at the outer end of the beam is<hi rend="superscript"
                                >1</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"> 9</hi> th of the pressure of the air
                                on the piston, the piston will not rise if the elasticity of the
                                steam be not equal to 30— <hi rend="superscript"> 50</hi> / <hi
                                rend="subscript"> 9</hi>, that is, 26.7 inches nearly; but if it be
                                just this quantity, the piston will rise as fast as this steam can
                                be supplied through the steam-pipe, and the velocity of its ascent
                                depends entirely on the velocity of this supply. This observation is
                                of great importance; and it does not seem to have occurred to the
                                mathematicians, who have paid most attention to the mechanism of the
                                motion of this engine. In the mean time, we may clearly see that the
                                entry of the steam depends chiefly on the counter weight at E: for
                                suppose there was none, steam no stronger than air would not enter
                                the cylinder at all; and if the steam be stronger, it will enter
                                only by the excess of its strength. Writers on the steam-engine (and
                                even some of great reputation) familiarly speak of the steam giving
                                the piston a push; but this is scarcely possible. During the rise of
                                the piston the snifting valve is never observed to blow; and we have
                                not heard any well-attested accounts of the piston-chains ever being
                                slackened by the upward pressure of the steam, even at the very
                                beginning of the stroke. During the rising of the piston the steam
                                is, (according to the common conception and manner of speaking,) <hi
                                rend="italic">sucked in,</hi> in the same way that air is sucked
                                into a common syringe or pump when we draw up the piston; for in the
                                steam-engine the piston is really drawn up by the counterweight. But
                                it is still more sucked in, and requires a more copious supply, for
                                another reason. As the piston descended only in consequence of the
                                inside<pb break="no" facs="ht:chi.28490924&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=735"
                                xml:id="kp-eb0720-0735-0627"/> of the cylinder’s being sufficiently
                                cooled to condense the steam, this cooled surface must again be
                                presented to the steam during the rise of the piston, and must con
                                dense the steam a second lime. The piston cannot rise another inch
                                till the part of the cylinder which the piston hag already quitted
                                has hern wanned up to the boiling point, and steam must be expended
                                in this warming. The inner surface of the cylinder is not only of
                                the heat of boiling water while the piston rises, but is also
                                perfectly dry; fur the film of water left on it by the ascending
                                piston must be completely evaporated, otherwise it will be
                                condensing steam. That the quantity thus wasted is considerable,
                                appears by the experiments of Mr Beighton. He found that five pints
                                of water were boiled off in a minute, and produced 16 strokes of an
                                engine whose cylinder contained 113 gallons of 282 inches each; and
                                he thence concluded that steam was 2886 times rarer than water. But
                                in no experiment made with scrupulous care on the expansion of
                                boiling water does it appear that the density of steam exceeds<hi
                                rend="superscript">1</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"> 10000</hi> th of
                                the density of water. Desaguliers says that it is above 14,000 times
                                rarer than water. We have frequently attempted to measure the weight
                                of steam which filled a very light vessel which held 12,600 grains
                                of water, and found it always less than one grain; so that we have
                                no doubt of its being much more than 10,000 times rarer than water.
                                This being the case, we may safely suppose that the number of
                                gallons of steam, instead of being 16 times 113, were nearly five
                                .times as much; and that only<hi rend="superscript">1</hi> / <hi

                                But no distinct experiment shows so great an expansion of water when
                                converted into steam at 212°. Mr Watt never found it, under the
                                pressure of the air, more than 1800 times rarer than water.</p>
                            <p>The moving force during the ascent of the piston must be considered
                                as resulting chiefly, if not solely, from the preponderating weight
                                of the pit piston-rods. The office of this is to return the
                                steam-piston to the top of the cylinder, where it may again be
                                pressed down by the air, and make another working stroke by raising
                                the pump-rods. But the counterweight at E has another service to
                                perform in this use of the engine; namely, to return the pump
                                pistons into their places at the bottom of their respective working
                                barrels, in order that they also may make a working stroke. This
                                requires force independent of the friction and inertia of the moving
                                parts; for each piston must be pushed down through the water in the
                                barrel, which must rise through the piston with a velocity whose
                                proportion to the velocity of the piston is the same with that of
                                the bulk of the piston to the bulk of the perforation through which
                                the water rises through the piston. It is enough at present to
                                mention this in general terms; we shall consider it more
                                particularly afterwards, when we come to calculate the performance
                                of the engine, and to deduce from our acquired knowledge, maxims of
                                construction and improvement.</p>
                            <p>From this general consideration of the ascent of the piston, we may
                                see that that motion differs greatly from the descent. It can hardly
                                be supposed to accelerate, even if the steam in the cylinder were in
                                a moment annihilated. For the resistance to the descent of the
                                piston is the same with the weight of the column of water, which
                                would cause it to flow through the box of the pump piston with the
                                velocity with which it really rises through it, and must therefore
                                increase as the square of that velocity increases; that is, as the
                                square of the velocity of the piston increases. Independent of
                                friction, therefore, the velocity of descent through the water must
                                soon become a maximum, and the motion become uniform. We shall see
                                by and by, that in such a pump ns is generally used, this will
                                happen in less than the 10th part of a second. The friction of the
                                pump will diminish this velocity a little, and retard the time of
                                its attaining uniformity. But, on the other hand, the supply of
                                steam which is necessary for this motion, being susceptible of no
                                acceleration from its previous motion, and depending entirely on the
                                briskness of the ebullition, an almost instantaneous stop is put to
                                acceleration.</p>
                            <p>Accordingly, any person who observes with attention the working of a
                                steam-engine, will see that the rise of the piston and descent of
                                the piston-rods is extremely uniform, whereas the working stroke is
                                very sensibly accelerated. Before quitting this part of the subject,
                                and lest it should afterwards escape our recollection, we may
                                observe, that the counter-weight is different during the two motions
                                of the pump-rods. While the machine is making a working stroke, it
                                is lifting not only the column of water in the pump, but the
                                absolute weight of the pistons and piston-rods also; but while the
                                pump rods are descending, there is a diminution of the counter
                                weight by the whole weight lost by the immersion of the rod in
                                water. The wooden rods which are generally used, soaked in water,
                                and joined by iron straps, are heavier, and but a little heavier,
                                than water, and they are generally about one-third of the bulk of
                                the water in the pumps.</p>
                            <p>These two motions complete the period of the operation; and the whole
                                may be repeated by shutting the steam-cock and opening the
                                injection-cock whenever the piston has attained the proper height.
                                We have been very minute in our attention to the different circum
                                stances, that the reader may have a distinct notion of the state of
                                the moving forces in every period of the operation. It is by no
                                means sufficient that we know in general that the injection of cold
                                water makes a void which allows the air to press down the piston,
                                and that the readmission of the steam allows the piston to rise
                                again. This lumping and slovenly way of viewing it has long
                                prevented even the philosopher from seeing the defects of the
                                construction, and the methods of removing them.</p>
                            <p>It was in 1718, as already mentioned, that Mr Henry Beighton improved
                                the steam-engine of Newcomen, by a simple and effective arrangement
                                of minor details, which left so little to be desired for the
                                practical use of the engine in pumping water, that for more than
                                half a century it remained in general use, without any change of
                                form or arrangement. The following excellent dia grams and quaint
                                descriptions are from the pen of Des aguliers, who had made himself
                                very well acquainted with the subject as it existed in his time.</p>

                                the steam will hold it the closer when shut.) There is also, in the
                                plate RR, a short pipe or conic hole T, smallest downwards, to
                                receive the piece V W X, which being ground into it can move round
                                without letting air or steam pass by. There is a square shank ZZ,
                                which is put through this last piece when it is Jet down into its
                                hole, and pinned tight to it at the upper Z Then the spanner of the
                                regulator being put on, and made fast at V and W, as may be plainly
                                seen in fig. 25, where the whole regulator is put together. This
                                regulator opens very quick, and ten times easier than a cock of the
                                same bore: and to help the whole, the weight F of the Y, when it has
                                passed the perpendicular, falls with a good force, which makes the
                                shank under it give a smart stroke, either within the fork or
                                without, to drive the fork, and draw the handle of the regulator
                                contrary to the way that the weight is falling; the weight causing
                                the regulator to be shut when it tumbles towards it, and be open
                                when it tumbles from it.</p>
                            <p>“When the regulator is shut, the next thing is to open the
                                injection-cock to make the vacuum, and immediately to shut it when
                                the piston begins to come down, (for the vacuum is made in a second

                                figure, is as follows. The regulator is open, as appears by its

                                S, that goes into the cylinder. The piston is now up about the place
                                CM, at top of the cylinder in figure 24; consequently<pb break="no"

                                H 5, that the weight or head of the Y is brought so far from under

                                drawing the fork O N horizontally towards the working beam, will
                                draw the end 10 of the handle of the regulator toward <hi

                                under the pipe S. The engine in figure 25 is in this very condition;
                                but in figure 24 the blow is already struck, and the communication
                                cut off; as may be known by observing that the weight at the head of
                                the Y is got as far as the strap will let it go.</p>
                            <p>“The moment after the regulator is shut, the beam not immediately

                                injection of cold water is again opened,”</p>
                            <p>Newcomen, Potter, and Beighton, had thus rendered the atmospheric
                                steam-engine an independent selfacting mechanical power of so great
                                perfection in its principle of action, and its minor details, as to
                                be very generally introduced as a substitute for the power of
                                animals in draining mines and collieries, and to confer very great
                                advantages in those important and primary sources of national
                                industry and wealth. The saving of money resulting from this change
                                was so great as to be continually opening up new avenues of mining
                                enterprise; and, by the rapid progress of that enterprise, the
                                capahilities of the engine were soon put to the severest trial. The
                                cylinders, which had been originally of twelve and sixteen inches
                                diameter, were increased to twenty, thirty, and forty inches, and at
                                last even fifty and sixty inches in diameter. Along with this
                                dimension, the other parts required to he increased in a still
                                higher proportion; and at last the structures became so gigantic as
                                to demand an amount of science and practical skill which in that
                                period of engineering science was rarely to be found. The man suited
                                to the emergency at last arose in the father of civil engineering,
                                the justly celebrated Smeaton, who brought to bear on this subject
                                endowments and accomplishments seldom united; fertile ingenuity,
                                accurate philosophic conceptions, and sound practical sagacity. He
                                conferred upon the atmospheric steam-engine all the extent and
                                variety of application of which it was capable, and all the
                                perfection of proportion and execution which the state of the
                                mechanical arts would permit.</p>
                            <p>The manner in which Smeaton proceeded to the improvement of the
                                atmospheric engine was one which is worthy of all praise and
                                imitation. Unlike too many of the engineering experiments of the
                                present day, as well as of past times, his were made at his own
                                expense, not at the expense of his employers, and on a scale
                                sufficiently large to ensure sound results, without being on that
                                scale which should entail unwarrantable expense. Having encountered
                                some anomalous results in the earlier parts of his experience with
                                atmospheric engines, he resolved, as he says, “if possible to make
                                himself master of the subject, and immediately began to build a
                                small fire-engine, which could easily be converted into different
                                shapes for experiments.” This experimental engine was set to work at
                                Austhorpe in 1769. With it he made a very great number of valuable
                                experiments, so as to ascer tain the length and velocity of stroke
                                and return, the quantity and manner of injection, the proportion of
                                load, the dimensions of cylinder, and the materials of construction,
                                which were required to produce the maximum of useful effect from a
                                given amount of fuel. Mr Farey has given us the dimensions of this
                                model, and the results of the experiments of Smeaton as they are
                                here set down. The cylinder was 9.9 inches in diameter, and had a
                                working-stroke of 3 feet. The piston made 17½ strokes per minute
                                passing over 105 feet per minute in going and returning, or over
                                52.5 effective feet per minute; its load per square inch was 7.89
                                lbs., its total load 607 lbs. The quantity of coals consumed was 55
                                lbs. per hour. The work done was equivalent to 31,867 lbs. raised 1
                                foot high per minute = 0.966 horse power. The work of one bushel or
                                84 lhs. of coal was equal to 2,919,017 lbs. raised 1 foot high. The
                                weight of water evaporated by 1 lb. of coal was 6.14 lbs., and the
                                quantity of cold water injected was 10.66 the evaporated water.</p>
                            <p>When the engine made its stroke the mercury was raised to 23.2
                                inches.</p>
                            <p>Mr Smeaton found that this engine produced its maxi mum effect both
                                as regards quantity and economy when carrying a load of 7.81 lbs. on
                                the inch. When the load was reduced to 6.6 lbs. the power of the
                                engine was lessened in the proportion of 100. to 94. When the load
                                was reduced to 5.5 lbs. the power of the engine was still further
                                lessened in the proportion of 94 to 82. In these two cases the work
                                produced by 1 lb. of coals was reduced in the proportion of 100 to
                                94, and 94 to 80.</p>
                            <p>When, on the other hand, the load was increased from 7.8 lbs. to 8.8
                                lbs. per inch, the work done was only in creased from 100 to 107.
                                When the load was still further increased to 9.1 lbs. the work was
                                diminished from 100 to 96. But in both these the economy of fuel was
                                diminished in a higher proportion, the work produced by each lb. of
                                coals being reduced in the proportions 100 to 97, and 97 to 93.</p>
                            <p>Mr Smeaton also found, from the same engine, the best kinds and modes
                                of burning the fuel. Round coals were found superior to small coal
                                in the proportion of 100 to 80 nearly. Coke produced<hi
                                rend="superscript">5</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"> 6</hi> of the
                                effect of an equal weight of the same coal from which the coke was
                                made, and 66 lbs. of coke were obtained from 100 lbs. of coal.
                                Ash-wood used as fuel was found inferior to common Yorkshire coals
                                in the proportion of 42 to 100. The performance of the kind of
                                Newcastle coals called Team Top, was found superior to the common
                                Yorkshire or Halton coal, in the ratio of 120 to 100. Cannel coal,
                                from Wakefield in Yorkshire, was superior to Halton in the ratio 133
                                to 100. Middleton-wood coals, and Welsh coals, were superior to
                                Halton, as 110 to 100; and Ber wick-moor coals were inferior to
                                Halton, in the ratio 86 to 100.</p>
                            <p>In consequence of this admirable method of procedure, Mr Smeaton
                                improved the proportions and structure of the atmospheric engine,
                                and very soon produced machines which excelled in their dimensions
                                and efficiency every thing which had preceded them. In 1772 he
                                erected an engine at Long Benton colliery, near New castle, which he
                                ever afterwards considered as his stand ard. The following are its
                                principal dimensions and performance: Diameter of the cylinder, 52
                                inches—7 feet stroke, 12 strokes per minute, being 84 feet useful
                                motion per minute, and 168 feet total motion per minute. Load of
                                water = 7.1 tons. Load per square inch = 7½ lbs. Consumption of
                                coals, 17.63 lbs. per horse power per hour. Work of one bushel or 84
                                lbs. of coals = 9.45 millions of lbs. one foot high. The total power
                                of engine was about 40½ horsepower, and for every horse power the
                                boiler had 52 cubic feet of total space, 27.75<pb break="no"

                                of flue surface, and .867 square foot of fire grate. The total steam
                                produced per minute was about 62.95 feet per horse power; of this
                                30.58 feet were used in moving the piston, 8.92 feet wasted to fill
                                the extra space in the cylinder, and 23.45 condensed on the surface
                                of the cylinder.</p>
                            <p>Mr Farey has given an excellent description and investigation of this
                                engine, with two plates taken with his wonted fidelity and beauty,
                                from the original drawings.</p>
                            <p>Mr Smeaton also constructed a portable fire-engine, for the purpose
                                of being used to draw water from termporary excavations, shafts,
                                quarries, &amp;c., so framed as to require no erection of a
                                building, and to be easily removed from place to place. The fire is
                                wholly within the boiler. The framing of the engine is constructed
                                of timber, trussed and arranged in such a manner as to contain
                                within it every kind of strain whatever which the force of the
                                machine and the resistance may produce. The details of this engine
                                are given in his reports, from which we extract the following
                                drawings and descriptions:</p>

                                fixed into a cross beam S, framed into the piece T, and the whole
                                firmly bolted together, as shown in the design. N is the
                                injection-pipe, <hi rend="italic">n</hi> the injection-cock, and <hi

                                upon its bottom and bolted down. The whole is kept from springing or
                                flying off by an iron strap.</p>
                            <p>The waste water pipes are omitted to prevent confu sion. Fig. 31
                                shows a section of the boiler, cylinder, and pipes, with the
                                working-gear, to a larger scale, the whole being divested of the
                                framing in order to render every thing more distinct.</p>
                            <p>The boiler is supposed to he turned one quarter round from its true
                                position, in order that the most material parts may be brought into
                                one view. It is also to be noted, that every vessel or pipe is
                                supposed to be cut right through the middle, in order to show the
                                contents, and that the section is not confined to any particular
                                plane; but, for the more perfect explaining of the principal figure,
                                it will be best to begin with the little plan at the righthand
                                corner of the figure. A B C D is a plan of the cylinder bottom,
                                bolted down upon the two main beams AB and CD; the dotted circle EF
                                shows the extremity of the bottom flanch of the cylinder, and the
                                circle GH, the diameter of the cylinder within; the hole I answers
                                the steam-pipe and regulator, and the hole K the eduction or
                                sinking-pipe, and the circle LM its flanch; the circle NO shows the
                                size and position of the regulator-plate, and the dotted circle PQ
                                the size of the receiver in which the sliding-valve of the regulator
                                R works, and in this position is open; ST is the lever by which it
                                is worked, and when that is brought forward into the position SV,
                                then the valve covers the aperture of the regula tor. In the
                                principal figure A is the boiler, and B the fire place which is of
                                cast iron, and of a spherical form, and placed in the interior of
                                the boiler. The coals are introduced by the large pipe C, and the
                                smoke is conducted by the curved pipe D into the funnel or chimney
                                E. The ashes fall through the grate S and the wide pipe F, into the
                                ash-holes below. The other appendages of the boiler, are a cock for

                                sufficient weight, and having a string attached to it, so that the
                                attendant on the engine can raise it when necessary to allow the
                                steam to escape. The boiler has also a man hole, which is better
                                seen at Z in fig. 30. The curved smoke-pipe D is surrounded by a
                                copper casing, into which the water for feeding the boiler flows
                                from the hot well, so as to be highly heated before being admit ted
                                into the boiler. The other parts of the engine shown in the figure

                            <p>But the most magnificent of Smeaton’s works in this department of his
                                profession is his great Chasewater engine, of which the details are
                                given in his Reports. This engine was of 150 horses' power, turning
                                out 880 hogsheads of water per hour, by the heat of 16½ bushels of
                                coal. We have given a cut of this engine, Fig. 32; and we recommend
                                the engineer to consult the original in Smeaton’s Reports, as it is
                                full of ingenious contrivance and judicious arrangement. The
                                cylinder AB is 72 inches in diameter, the stroke 10 feet 6 inches.
                                The great beam of the engine, DD, consists of twenty large balks of
                                timber, the four nearest the centre being each a foot square, and
                                the whole firmly joggled together with heart of oak, and bolted with
                                iron, forming a very elegant but ponderous beam. The cylinder beams
                                FF, upon which the cylinder rests, and which are kept in their place
                                by being entered into the side walls of the house, are joggled and
                                framed together in a similar manner to the great lever. G is the
                                boiler, H the furnace, I B the steam pipe, J the injection-pipe, K
                                the cistern for the injection water, fed by a pump L, which is
                                wrought by the great lever of the engine, M the waste-pipe for the
                                condensed steam, N the spear or pump-rod of the great draining-pump
                                wrought by the engine, P P the plug-tree suspended from the main
                                beam carrying plugs, which in its upward and downward progress act
                                on the levers which open and shut the regulator and injection-cocks.
                                The date of this engine is 1775. The working gear of the engine is
                                very simple and good. It is represented on a larger scale in the
                                accompanying cut, fig. 38.</p>
                            <p>A is the lower corner of the cylinder, A’ A ’ A' the injection-pipe,
                                B the injection-cock, B F its handle or spanner passing between the
                                forks of the bent lever E Z F Fζ called the F lever, by which the
                                cock is opened and shut. The tail Z 12 of this F lever is, by the
                                downward motion of the plug-tree P, forced from the position shown
                                by the dotted line Z 18, into the position in which it is seen in
                                the drawing, and it is there retained by the catch <hi rend="italic"
                                >I I I.</hi> While the lever is in this position the injection-cock
                                is shut, the steam from the boiler is flowing into the cylinder, and
                                the piston is rising. When the piston has nearly reached the top of
                                its course, an apparatus attached to the plug-frame P, draws up the
                                catch <hi rend="italic">III,</hi> and releases the F lever, which is
                                forced into the position 18 Z, by the bob or weight 16, carried by
                                its end F ’, and the consequent movement of its fork F opens the
                                injection-cock; T <hi rend="italic">x</hi> 11, 9, is the Y lever or

                                attached to the spanner of the regulator, as in Beighton’s gear,

                                motion on each side of the perpendicular is regulated by its
                                check-cord T I, which is passed round a roller I, furnished with a
                                paul and ratchet, so that its length may be ad justed. The tumbler
                                is moved by pins in the plug-frame P, acting upon its bent arms <hi

                            <p>In the lefthand comer at the bottom of the figure is seen a

                                was found to be defective, and Mr Smeaton, in the engines which he
                                afterwards constructed, fixed a toothed sector on the end of the
                                lever, which was made to act upon a toothed wheel, carried by the
                                axis of the injection-cock, somewhat in the manner of the parts of
                                Beighten’s gear represented in figs. 25, 29.</p>

                            Watt, the steam or atmospheric engine was a more costly power than
                            horses, except where fuel was extremely cheap. At the mouth of a coalpit
                            almost any sort of steam-engine or fire engine is better than horses,
                            because it consumes the produce, and often the refuse of the pit, and is
                            valuable for the purpose of volatilising the mass of small coals which
                            would otherwise lumber the mouth of the pit. The worst sort of engine
                            would raise more coal in twelve minutes than it would consume in twelve
                            hours. In such circumstances, almost any fire-engine is cheaper than the
                            labour of horses, and the more voracious of fuel the more economical of
                            labour. We find that the rudest, most antiquated, worst made and worst
                            tended engines in the world, are the engines of Durham coalfields and
                            around Newcastle, where there are more bad engines than in all the rest
                            of the world. The reason is obvious; the only constant expense attending
                            the use of these engines is the labour of shovelling in coals. The
                            atmospheric engine, even after it had received all the improvements of
                            three quarters of a cen tury, and attained in the hands of Smeaton all
                            the perfection of which it was capable, still continued an extravagant
                            consumer of coals. Watt was the man who turned the scale of expense so
                            as to give a great preponderance in favour of the fire-engine. In his
                            hands it ceased to be an <hi rend="italic">atmospheric engine,</hi> and
                            became wholly a <hi rend="italic">steam-engine,</hi> capable of being
                            employed in an immense variety of applications, on a much larger scale,
                            and at much less expense than the power of horses, wherever the prices
                            of fuel and of fodder were not in greater dis parity than in this
                            country.</p>
                        <p>We have seen that hitherto the fire-engine, even in Smeaton’s hands, was
                            an engine that wasted a large quantity of fuel and of steam in doing
                            what was useless, namely, heating the cylinder, which was cooled
                            alternately in each stroke by the cold water injected into it. In Long
                            Benton colliery engine, out of sixty-three cubic feet of steam
                            thirty-two feet were thus wasted, and the remaining thirty-one feet
                            alone performed useful work. There remained, therefore, one-half of the
                            power of the steam and expense of the fuel to be saved by future
                            improvements, provided the useless heating and cooling of the cylinder
                            could be superseded. The vacuum formed below the cylinder was also far
                            from being perfect. Watt found the atmospheric fire-engine in the hands
                            of Smeaton, produced from it the pure steam-engine, and left it to us in
                            its present state of high improvement. This portion of the history of
                            the steam-engine has been contributed as a commentary upon the original
                            article of this Encyclopaedia by the person of all others best qualified
                            to do it justice, Watt himself. For the purpose of further illustration,
                            we have added some figures, as well as some remarks.</p>
                        <p>“My attention was first directed in the year 1759 to the subject of
                            steam-engines by the late Dr. Robison, himself then a student in the
                            University of Glasgow, and nearly of my own age. He at that time threw
                            out an idea of applying the power of the steam-engine to the moving of
                            wheel carriages, and to other purposes, but the scheme was not matured,
                            and was soon abandoned on his going abroad.</p>
                        <p>“About the year 1761 or 1762, I tried some experiments on the force of
                            steam, in a Papin’s digester, and form ed a species of steam-engine by
                            fixing upon it a syringe one-third of an inch in diameter, with a solid
                            piston, and furnished also with a cock to admit the steam from the
                            digester, or shut it off at pleasure, as well as to open a communivation
                            from the inside of the syringe to the open air, by which the steam
                            contained in the syringe might escape. When the communication between
                            the digester and syringe was opened, the steam entered the syringe, and
                            by its action upon the piston raised a considerable weight (fifteen
                            lbs.) with which it was loaded. When this was raised as high as was
                            thought proper, the communication with the digester was shut, and that
                            with the atmosphere opened; the steam then made its escape, and the
                            weight descended. The operations were re peated, and though in this
                            experiment the cock was turned by hand, it was easy to see how it could
                            be done by the machine itself, and to make it work with perfect
                            regularity. But I soon relinquished the idea of constructing an engine
                            upon this principle, from being sensible it would be liable to some of
                            the objections against Savary’s engine, viz. the danger of bursting the
                            boiler, and the difficulty of making the joints tight, and also that a
                            great part of the power of the steam would be lost, be cause no vacuum
                            was formed to assist the descent of the piston,</p>
                        <p>“The attention necessary to the avocations of business prevented me from
                            then prosecuting the subject further; but in the winter of 1763·4,
                            having occasion to repair a model of Newcomen’s engine belonging to the
                            Natural Philosophy Class of the University of Glasgow, my mind was again
                            directed to it. At that period, my knowledge was derived principally
                            from Desaguliers, and partly from Belidor. 1 set about repairing it as a
                            mere mechanician, and when that was done and it was set to work, I was
                            surprised to find that its boiler could not supply it with steam, though
                            apparently quite large enough; (the cylinder of the model being two
                            inches in diameter, and six inches stroke, and the boiler about nine
                            inches diameter.) By blowing the fire it was made to take a few strokes;
                            but required an enormous quantity of injection water, though it was very
                            lightly loaded by the column of water in the pump. It soon occurred to
                            me, that this was caused by the little cylinder exposing a greater
                            surface to condense the steam, than the cylinders of larger engines did,
                            in proportion to their respective contents. It was found that by
                            shortening the column of water in the pump, the boiler could supply the
                            cylinder with steam, and that the engine would work regularly with a
                            moderate quantity of injection. It now appeared that the cylinder of the
                            model, being of brass, would conduct heat much better than the cast-iron
                            cylinders of larger engines, (generally covered on the inside with a
                            stony crust.) and that considerable advantage could be gained by making
                            the cylinders of some substance that would receive and give out heat
                            slowly. Of these, wood seemed to be the most likely, provided it should
                            prove sufficiently durable. A small engine was therefore constructed,
                            with a cylinder six inches diameter and twelve inches stroke, made of
                            wood, soaked in linseed oil, and baked to dry ness. With this engine
                            many experiments were made; but it was soon found that the wooden
                            cylinder was not likely to prove durable, and that the steam condensed
                            in filling it still exceeded the proportion of that required for large
                            engines according to the statements of Desagu<pb break="no"
                            facs="ht:chi.28490924&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=741"
                            xml:id="kp-eb0720-0741-0633"/> liers. It was also found, that all
                            attempts to produce a better exhaustion by throwing in more injection,
                            caused a disproportionate waste of steam. On reflection, the cause of
                            this seemed to be the boiling of water in vacuo at low heats, a
                            discovery lately made by Dr Cullen and some other philosophers, (below
                            100, as I was then in formed,) and consequently, at greater heats, the
                            water in the cylinder would produce a steam which would, in part, resist
                            the pressure of the atmosphere.</p>
                        <p>“By experiments which I then tried upon the heats at which water boils
                            under several pressures greater than that of the atmosphere, it appeared
                            that when the heats proceeded in an arithmetical, the elasticities
                            proceeded in some geometrical ratio; and by laying down a curve from my
                            data, I ascertained the particular one near enough for my purpose. It
                            also appeared that any approach to a vacuum could only be obtained by
                            throwing in large quantities of injection, which would cool the cylinder
                            so much as to require quantities of steam to heat it again, out of
                            proportion to the power gained by the more perfect vacuum; and that the
                            old engineers had acted wisely in contenting themselves with loading the
                            engine with only six or seven pounds on each square inch of the area of
                            the piston. It being evident that there was a great error in Dr
                            Desaguliers’ calculations of Mr Beighton’s experiments on the bulk of
                            steam, a Florence flask, capable of containing about a pound of water,
                            had about one ounce of distilled water put into it; a glass tube was
                            fitted into its mouth, and the joining made tight by lapping that part
                            of the tube with packthread covered with glaziers’ putty. When the flask
                            was set upright, the tube reached down near to the surface of the water,
                            and in that position the whole was placed in a tin reflecting oven
                            before a fire, until the water was wholly evaporated, which happened in
                            about an hour, and might have been done sooner, had I not wished the
                            heat not much to exceed that of boiling water. As the air in the flask
                            was heavier than the steam, the latter ascended to the top, and expelled
                            the air through the tube. When the water was all evaporated, the own and
                            flask were removed from the fire, and a blast of cold air was directed
                            against one side of the flask, to collect the condensed steam in one
                            place. When all was cold, the tube was removed, the flask and its
                            contents were weighed with care; and the flask being made hot, it was
                            dried by blowing into it by bellows, and when weighed again, was found
                            to have lost rather more than four grains, estimated at four and a third
                            grains. When the flask was filled with water, it was found to contain
                            about seventeen and one-eighth ounces avoirdupois of that fluid, which
                            gave about one thousand eight hundred for the expansion of water
                            converted into steam of the heat of boiling water.</p>
                        <p>“This experiment was repeated with nearly the same result; and in order
                            to ascertain whether the flask had been wholly filled with steam, a
                            similar quantity of water was, for the third time, evaporated; and,
                            while the flask was still cold, it was placed inverted, with its mouth
                            (contracted by the tube) immersed in a vessel of water, which it sucked
                            in as it cooled, until in the temperature of the atmosphere it was
                            filled to within half an ounce measure of water.</p>
                        <p>“In repetitions of this experiment at a later date, I simplified the
                            apparatus by omitting the tube, and laying the flask upon its side in
                            the oven, partly closing its mouth by a cork, having a notch on one
                            side, and otherwise proceeding as has been mentioned.</p>
                        <p>“I do not consider these experiments as extremely ac curate; the only
                            scale-beam of a proper size which 1 had then at my command not being
                            very sensible, and the bulk of the steam being liable to be influenced
                            by the heat to which it was exposed, which, in the way described, is not
                            easily regulated or ascertained; but, from my experience in actual
                            practice, I esteem the expansion to be rather more than I have
                            computed.</p>
                        <p>“A boiler was constructed, which showed by inspection the quantity of
                            water evaporated in any given time, and thereby ascertained the quantity
                            of steam used in every stroke by the engine, which I found to be several
                            times the full of the cylinder. Astonished at the quantity of water
                            required for the injection, and the great beat it had acquired from the
                            small quantity of water in the form of steam which had been used in
                            filling the cylinder, and thinking I had made some mistake, the
                            following experiment was tried :—A glass tube was bent at right angles,
                            one end was inserted horizontally into the spout of a teakettle, and the
                            other part was immersed perpendicularly in well water contained in a
                            cylindric glass vessel, and steam was made to pass through it until it
                            ceased to be condensed, and the water in the glass vessel was become
                            nearly boiling hot. The water in the glass vessel was then found to have
                            gained an addition of about one-sixth part from the condensed steam.
                            Consequently, water converted into steam can heat about six times its
                            own weight of wellwater to 212°, or till it can condense no more steam.
                            Being struck with this re markable fact, and not understanding the
                            reason of it, I mentioned it to my friend Dr Black, who then explained
                            to me his doctrine of latent heat, which he had taught for some time
                            before this period, (summer 1764;) but having myself been occupied with
                            the pursuits of business, if I had heard of it, I had not attended to
                            it, when I thus stumbled upon one of the material facts by which that
                            beautiful theory is supported.</p>
                        <p>“On reflecting further, I perceived that, in order to make the best use
                            of steam, it was necessary, first, that the cylinder should be
                            maintained always as hot as the steam which entered it; and, secondly,
                            that when the steam was condensed, the water of which it was composed,
                            and the injection itself, should be cooled down to 100°, or lower, where
                            that was possible. The means of accomplishing these points did not
                            immediately present them selves; but <hi rend="italic">early in</hi>
                            1765 <hi rend="italic">it occurred to me, that if a communication were
                            opened between a cylinder containing steam, and another vessel which was
                            exhausted of air and other fluids, the steam, as an elastic fluid, would
                            immediately rush into the empty vessel, and continue so to do until it
                            had established an equilibrium;</hi> and if that vessel were kept very
                            cool by an injection, or otherwise, more steam would continue to enter,
                            until the whole was condensed. But both the vessels being exhausted, or
                            nearly so, how was the injection-water, the air which would enter with
                            it, and the condensed steam, to be got out? This I proposed, in my own
                            mind, to perform in two ways. One was by adapting to the second vessel a
                            pipe reaching downwards more than thirty-four feet, by which the water
                            would descend, (a column of that length overbalancing the atmosphere,)
                            and by <hi rend="italic">extracting the air by means of a pump.</hi></p>
                        <p>“The second method was <hi rend="italic">by employing a pump, or pumps,
                            to extract both the air and the water,</hi> which would be applicable in
                            all places, and essential in those cases where there was no well or
                            pit.</p>
                        <p>“This latter method was the one I then preferred, and is the only one I
                            afterwards continued to use.</p>
                        <p>“In Newcomen’s engine, the piston is kept tight by water, which could not
                            be applicable in this new method, as, if any of it entered into a
                            partially exhausted and hot cylinder, it would boil and prevent the
                            production of a vacuum, and would also cool the cylinder by its
                            evapora<pb break="no" facs="ht:chi.28490924&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=742"
                            xml:id="kp-eb0720-0742-0634"/> tion during the descent of the piston. I
                            proposed to remedy this defect by <hi rend="italic">employing wax,
                            tallow, or other grease, to lubricate and keep the piston tight.</hi> It
                            next occurred to me that the mouth of the cylinder being open, the air
                            which entered to act on the piston would cool the cylinder, and condense
                            some steam on again filling it; I therefore proposed <hi rend="italic"
                            >to put an airtight cover upon the cylinder, with a hole and stuffingbox
                            for the piston-rod to slide through,</hi> and to admit steam above the
                            piston to act upon it instead of the atmosphere. There still remained
                            another source of the destruction of steam, the cooling of the cylinder
                            by the external air, which would produce an internal condensation
                            whenever steam entered it, and which would be repeated every stroke;
                            this I proposed to remedy by an <hi rend="italic">external cylinder
                            containing steam, surrounded by another of wood, Or of some Other
                            substance which would conduct heat slowly.</hi></p>
                        <p>“When once the idea of the <hi rend="italic">separate condensation</hi>
                            was started, all those improvements followed as corullaries in quick
                            succession, so that in the course of one or two days, the invention was
                            thus far complete in my mind, and I immediately set about an experiment
                            to verify it practically. I took a large brass syringe A, one and
                            three-fourth inches diameter, and ten inches long, made a cover and
                            bottom to it of tinplate, with a pipe S to convey steam to both ends of
                            the cylinder from the boiler; another pipe E to convey steam from the
                            upper end to the condenser (for, to save apparatus, I inverted the
                            cylinder.) I drilled a hole longitudinally through the axis of the stem
                            of P the piston, and fixed a valve at its lower end, to permit the water
                            which was produced by the condensed steam, on first filling the
                            cylinder, to issue. The condenser used upon this occasion consisted of
                            two pipes <hi rend="italic">a b, c d</hi> of thin tinplate, ten or
                            twelve inches long, and about one-sixth inch diameter, standing
                            perpendicular, and communicating at top with a short horizontal pipe <hi
                            rend="italic">h</hi> of large diameter, having an aperture on its upper
                            side which was shut by a valve opening upwards. These pipes were joined
                            at bottom to another perpendicular pipe <hi rend="italic">ρ</hi> of
                            about an inch dia meter, which served for the air and water pump; and
                            both the condensing pipes and the air-pump were placed in a small
                            cistern C filled with cold water.</p>
                        <p>“The steam-pipe was adjusted to a small boiler B. When steam was
                            produced, it was admitted into the cylinder, and goon issued through the
                            perforation of the rod, and at the valve of the condenser. When it was
                            judged that the air was expelled, the steam-cock was shut, and the
                            air-pump piston-rod was drawn up, which leaving the small pipes of the
                            condenser in a state of vacuum, the steam entered them and was
                            condensed. The piston of the cylinder immediately rose and lifted a
                            weight of about eighteen pounds, which was hung to the lower end of the
                            piston-rod. The exhaustion-cock was shut, the steam was re admitted into
                            the cylinder, and the operation was repeated; the quantity of steam
                            consumed, and the weights it could raise were observed; and, excepting
                            the non-application of the steam-case and external covering, the
                            invention was complete, in so far as regarded the savings of steam and
                            fuel. A large model, with an outer cylinder and wooden case, was
                            immediately constructed, and the experiments made with it served to
                            verify the expectations I had formed, and to place the advantage of the
                            invention beyond the reach of doubt. It was found convenient afterwards
                            to change the pipe-condenser for an empty vessel, generally of a
                            cylindrical form, into which an injection played, as in fig. 36, and in
                            consequence of there being more water and air to extract, to enlarge the
                            air pump.</p>
                        <p>"The change was made, because, in order to procure a surface sufficiently
                            extensive to condense the steam of a large engine, the pipe-condenser
                            would require to be very voluminous, and because the bad water with
                            which engines me frequently supplied, would crust over the thin plates,
                            and prevent their conveying the heat sufficiently quick. The cylinders
                            were also placed with their mouths upwards, and furnished with a
                            working-beam, and other apparatus, as was usual in the ancient engines;
                            the inversion of the cylinder or rather of the piston-rod, in the model,
                            being only an expedient to try more easily the new invention, and being
                            subject to many objections in large engines.</p>
                        <p>“In 1768 I applied for letters patent for my 'Methods of Lessening the
                            consumption of Steam, and consequently of Fuel, in fire-engines,' which
                            passed the Seals in Janu ary 1769; and my specification was enrolled in
                            Chancery in April following, and was as follows :—</p>
                        <p>“My method of lessening the consumption of steam, and consequently fuel,
                            in fire-engines, consists of the fol lowing principles :—</p>
                        <p>“First, That vessel in which the powers of steam are to be employed to
                            work the engine, which is called the cylinder in common fire-engines,
                            and which I call the steam-vessel, must, during the whole time the
                            engine is at work, be kept as hot as the steam that enters it; first, by
                            enclosing it in a case of wood, or any other materials that transmit
                            heat slowly; secondly, by sur rounding it with steam or other heated
                            bodies; and, thirdly, by suffering neither water or any other substance
                            colder than the steam, to enter or touch it during that time.</p>
                        <p>“Secondly, In engines that are to be worked wholly or partially by
                            condensation of steam, the steam is to be condensed in vessels distinct
                            from the steam-vessels or cylinders, although occasionally communicating
                            with them; these vessels I call condensers; and, whilst the engines are
                            working, these condensers ought at least to be kept as cold as the air
                            in the neighbourhood of the engines, by application of water, or other
                            cold bodies.</p>
                        <p>“Thirdly, Whatever air or other elastic vapour is not condensed by the
                            cold of the condenser, and may impede the working of the engine, is to
                            be drawn out of the steam-vessels or condensers by means of pumps,
                            wrought by the engines themselves, or otherwise.</p>
                        <p>“Fourthly, I intend, in many cases, to employ the expansive force of
                            steam to press on the pistons, or what ever may be used instead of them,
                            in the same manner as the pressure of the atmosphere is now employed in
                            common fire-engines. In cases where cold water cannot be had in plenty,
                            the engines may he wrought by this force of steam only, by discharging
                            the steam into the open air after it has done its office.<pb break="no"
                            facs="ht:chi.28490924&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=743"
                            xml:id="kp-eb0720-0743-0635"/> “Lastly, Instead of using water to render
                            the piston or other parts of the engines air and steam tight, I employ
                            oils, wax, resinous bodies, fat of animals, quicksilver, and other
                            metals, in their fluid state.</p>
                        <p>“And the said James Watt, by a memorandum added to the said
                            specification, declared, that he did not intend that any thing in the
                            fourth article should be understood to extend to any engine where the
                            water to be raised enters the steam-vessel itself, or any vessel having
                            an open communication with it.”</p>
                        <p>Such is Mr Watt’s simple account of his beautiful invention—the condenser
                            or refrigerator, which is the characteristic member of the modern
                            steam-engine. The fire-engine of Newcomen possessed only two principal
                            members, to which all the other parts may be considered as mere
                            appendages. The modern steam-engine of Watt consists of three principal
                            members. The two members of Newcomen’s engine are the generating
                            apparatus, by which the steam is produced from the water and conveyed to
                            the second member, or the apparatus of application, where the elastic
                            force of the steam is brought in contact with the piston in the
                            cylinder, so as to produce the motion required for the mechanical effect
                            of the machine, and thus directly applied to the work to be done. The
                            third member, added by Watt, is a refrigerator or condensing apparatus,
                            perfectly separate from and independent of the other two, for
                            reconverting the steam, after it has done its duty in filling the
                            cylinder, into the liquid from which it had Seen originally formed. We
                            have, then, the boiler or generator with its appen dages, the cylinder
                            or applicator with its appendages, and the refrigerator or condenser
                            with its appendages, —the function to be discharged by the first of
                            these being altogether the reverse of the last; the first producing
                            steam by heat from water, the last producing water from steam by
                            cooling.</p>
                        <p>The progress of improvement in the steam-engine may be very well
                            illustrated by comparison with an early project of Dr Papin, who,
                            although he contributed no part towards the production of the modern
                            steam-engine, nevertheless exercised his ingenuity curiously, though
                            fruitlessly, upon the project of deriving mechanical power from the
                            motion of a piston in a cylinder, first of all by gunpowder, and
                            afterwards by steam. In Papin’s project, fig. 37, he takes a cylinder, A
                            B C D, containing a piston P, below which he places a fire, so as to
                            generate steam from a little water in the bottom of the cylinder. This
                            steam raises the piston, and it is evident that on the fire being
                            removed, steam will be condensed, and the piston will again be carried
                            to the bottom. Comparing this rude project, in which the steam is
                            alternately produced and recondensed in the cylinder itself, which is
                            alternately warmed and chilled, with the engine of Newcomen, fig. 38, we
                            observe the following important change. The calefavtion of the water and
                            generation of steam are carried on in a boiler, W now removed to a
                            considerable distance from and totally unconnected with the cylinder,
                            except by a pipe of communication opened and shut alternately. Still,
                            how ever, we have the process of cooling and condensation wholly carried
                            on in the cylinder itself, by means of a jet of cold water playing
                            therein. But let us now make a third step, and we arrive at the model of
                            a machine acting on the principle of Mr Watt’s, fig. 39. As we have
                            already, in the machine of Newcomen, a separate heating apparatus, W,
                            conducting the steam in a highly rarefied state to the cylinder, so now
                            let us have a vessel, C. placed on the other side, and let this vessel
                            have first been rendered empty or perfectly vacuous by expelling and
                            pumping out the air; and let us also, <hi rend="italic">for</hi> the
                            sake of experiment, put a few lumps of ice and salt in the inside and on
                            the outside of this vessel, surrounding it on every side; and we shall
                            have a refrigerator as a counterpart to the boiler, and a type of the
                            improvement of Watt.</p>
                        <p>If we now open the stopcock S. the steam generated in the boiler will
                            rush into the cylinder, pressing the piston upwards; and if the stopcock
                            E be next opened, the stopcock S having been previously shut, the steam
                            in E will instantly escape into the vacuum in the refrigerator, and
                            being condensed into less than a thousandth part of its bulk, will leave
                            the cylinder vacuous. Thus the motion of the piston upwards and
                            downwards is effected by the inventions of Newcomen and Watt, without
                            either applying the fire or the cold directly to the cylinder in which
                            the power is given out. Thus the loss of more than fifty per cent is
                            remedied by the separate condenser of Watt. Papin’s scheme was possible
                            but not practicable; Newcomen’s was practicable but wasteful. Watt’s
                            engine is practical, economical, and complete, both in theory and in
                            practice, as it renders available all the power of heat which the steam
                            contains, with the exception only of the very small part consumed in
                            giving motion to the machine itself.</p>
                        <p>The following figure (40) approaches very closely to the form of Mr
                            Watt’s first engines. Their details are as follows. In the diagram, A
                            represents the cylinder of his earlier engine, B the boiler, and C the
                            condenser, each with its various appendages. The appendages of the
                            boiler B, are of course, <hi rend="italic">f,</hi> the furnace in which

                            cylinder. The appendages of the cylinder are, <hi rend="italic">p</hi>
                            the piston, fitting accurately the in side of the cylinder, surrounded
                            with hemp packing, soaked with tallow and oil, so as to be steam-tight;
                            the casing, <hi rend="italic">cccc,</hi> which excludes the cold air of
                            the atmosphere from entering into the cylinder to cool it down at the
                            expense of afterwards heating it by the steam; and, instead of allowing
                            it to enter at the top of the cylinder at A, and press down the piston,
                            as in Newcomen’s engine, the hot steam is substituted, which, being of
                            an elasticity equal to the atmosphere, presses it, with a force equal to
                            the atmosphere, towards the bottom of the cylinder. After reaching the
                            bottom of the cylin der, the handle of the valve <hi rend="italic"
                            >v</hi><hi rend="italic superscript"> 1</hi> is raised so as to make an
                            opening for the steam to enter below as well as above the piston; which
                            equilibrium of upward and down ward pressure allows the piston once more
                            to rise, in consequence of a counterbalancing weight connected to the
                            top of the piston-rod <hi rend="italic">r</hi>; and this opening of what
                            is called the steam-valve r' continues until the piston once more
                            reaches the top of the cylinder, when it is closed. The eduction valve
                            <hi rend="italic">v</hi><hi rend="italic superscript"> 2</hi><hi
                            rend="italic">,</hi> which is nt that moment opened, permits the steam
                            to escape suddenly into the condenser, when it becomes water, and leaves
                            the space be low the cylinder vacuous, so as to give free space for the
                            piston to be carried down into the cylinder by the pressure of the steam
                            resting always on the top of the piston. These, the casing, piston,
                            piston-rod, steam valve, eduction-valve, and communicating passages, are
                            appendages of the second great member of the machine, the cylinder, by
                            which the power of the steam is applied to give the required motion to
                            whatever solid machinery may be placed in connexion with the piston-rod.
                            The appendages of the condenser C of Mr Watt are as follows. First of
                            <hi rend="smallcaps">βΙΙ,</hi> a large cistern, <hi rend="italic"
                            >wwww,</hi> of cold water is pro vided, and furnished continually with
                            fresh supplies of cold water either from a running stream or by means of
                            a pump <hi rend="italic">m n,</hi> wrought by the engine itself. In this
                            is placed the condensing chamber <hi rend="italic">C x x,</hi> wholly
                            surrounded by the cold water, but perfectly empty, excepting that a
                            small jet of cold water from the exterior is admitted through a
                            regulated aperture to play in the inside, by which injection it has
                            always been observed that the condensation of the steam is more
                            efficient than when a casing of metal intervenes between the cold water
                            and the stenm. The eduction-pipe <hi rend="italic">e ee,</hi> conducts
                            the steam out of the cylinder by the valve v <hi rend="superscript">
                            2</hi> into the condenser <hi rend="italic">x x,</hi> where it is
                            reduced hack into the water from which it had been originally generated.
                            Now, it must be obvious on a little consideration, that the water which
                            is injected into the condenser must rapidly accumulate there, becoming
                            at the same time warmed by contact with the steam, so as to impede the
                            process of condensation, and ultimately tilling up the interior of the
                            condensing chamber, which should be kept vacuous; and further, that the
                            steam itself, becoming reconverted into water, would in a short period
                            of time accumulate in the condenser and choke it up. Hence a principal
                            and essential appendage of the con denser is a large pump called the
                            condenser-pump, which is essential to its longcontinued efficient
                            action, and which withdraws a portion of the accumulated warmed water
                            from the interior of the condenser, and keeps it vacuous; and because
                            there is generally air in combination with the water, and because also
                            air is very apt to insinuate itself by many chinks or crevices into the
                            con denser, this clearing-pump must be capable of pumping out air as
                            well as water. This appendage of the conden ser, represented in the
                            preceding figure by <hi rend="italic">y y,</hi> is generally termed the
                            “air-pump ;" a name which imperfectly expresses the functions of the
                            said condenser-pump.</p>
                        <p>Fire being placed under the boiler, its heat, communicated to the water,
                            rapidly expands that water, and rarefies it into steam, by the addition
                            of six times more than its usual supply of heat. This combination of
                            heat and water, forming the steam, rushes along the steam-pipe into the
                            cylinder casing, and is admitted into the interior of the machine,
                            filling all its chambers and pipes with steam; hut that portion of the
                            steam which is in communication with the condenser being instantly
                            chilled by the jet of cold water and the cold sides of the vessels in
                            the cold well, is condensed, and then the valve <hi rend="italic"
                            >v</hi><hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> being closed so as to admit no
                            more steam into the condenser, and the valve <hi rend="italic">v</hi><hi
                            rend="italic superscript"> 1</hi> closed so as to admit no more steam
                            into the lower part of the cylinder below the piston, there remains the
                            elastic force of the steam above, pressing it to wards the bottom of the
                            cylinder with a force proportioned to the pressure of the steam and the
                            extent of the cylinder. Thus a moving power is generated in the cylinder
                            by the steam, which may be conveyed through the piston-rod <hi
                            rend="italic">r,</hi> and applied through various mechanism of
                            application to the performance of the required work. The steam which has
                            thus pressed down the piston is now admitted below to neutralize the
                            force of that which remains; and having thus done its duty, is once more
                            annihilated by the opening of the communication into the condenser, into
                            which it rushes, and being almost instantly deprived of the caloric
                            which gave it power and magnitude, there remains nothing except the few
                            spoonfuls of water from which all that volume of steam had arisen, now
                            lying inert at the bottom of the cylinder. This dead water is not yet
                            cold. It is evident that in the primary generation of steam in the
                            boiler, the supply of water must be rapidly diminished by this boiling
                            off, and that this water must somehow be supplied. Now here lies an
                            improvement: this waste, instead of being supplied by cold water, may be
                            better replenished with the water of the condenser, which is highly
                            heated in condensing the steam from the cylinder.</p>
                        <p>Mr Watt’s Engine was first used as a substitute for the engine, of
                            Newcomen in pumping up water or draining mines: in 1788 it had attained
                            the form which we have given in the following figure. The engine is
                            represented in fig 41 as contained within the walls of a building, the
                            anterior portion of which is removed to show the machine. The boiler
                            stands on the left of the figure, on the outside of the building; and on
                            the right of the figure, also on the outside of the house, are the large
                            pumps, by which the water is raised, and the work of the engine
                            performed. Nearly in the centre of the building stands the cylinder with
                            its appendages, and below these are the cold well and condensing
                            apparatus.</p>
                        <p>Beginning with the apparatus for generating steam; on the left of the
                            figure, H is the boiler, of what is called the waggon shape, set in a
                            furnace of brickwork immediately over the fire, which rests on the
                            firebars at <hi rend="italic">ρ,</hi> leaving a very deep ashpit below;
                            the flame passes away under the concave bottom of the boiler to the
                            further end, and there, instead of proceeding at once up the chimney,
                            returns by o on the left side of the boiler, through the brick channel
                            or flue, giving out additional heat to the water, and after passing
                            across the front of the boiler, proceeds along the righthand flue <hi
                            rend="italic">o</hi> to the chimney. The draught of the chimney is
                            regulated by means of the damper r, which descends into die flue or is
                            raised out of it in any degree by the attendant, and so permits the air
                            to rush with greater or less ease up the chimney. A tube <hi
                            rend="italic">t,</hi> regulated by a stopcock, comes from a small pump U
                            on the righthand side of the figure, which raises the warm water
                            discharged by the air-pump, and sends it into the boiler so as to
                            replenish its waste; this pipe and pump<pb break="no"
                            facs="ht:chi.28490924&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=745"
                            xml:id="kp-eb0720-0745-0637"/> being generally named the feedpipe and
                            tube. The two little tubes proceeding from the water in the boiler, are
                            slender pipes open at both ends, and have external stopcocks, which are
                            always shut except when the attendant wishes to ascertain the height of
                            the water in the boiler, when he opens these gaugecocks and observing
                            whether water or steam issues from them, forms his judgment accordingly.
                            F is the steam-pipe, which carries the steam away from the boiler to be
                            applied to its useful effect in the second great member of the
                            engine.</p>
                        <p>The second great member of the machine is placed in the enginehouse. A is
                            the working cylinder, in which is contained the moving piston B, which
                            communicates the force impressed on it by the steam, through the
                            piston-rod c, and the chain <hi rend="italic">f</hi> to the end of the
                            great lever or workingbeam, <hi rend="italic">fa e,</hi> which is forced
                            up and down nround the fixed centre or iron gudgeon 6, and so raises or
                            depresses the other end of the lever on the righthand side of the
                            figure, and thus gives the required motion to <hi rend="italic">h,
                            j,</hi> the piston and rods in the barrel of the great pump, in which
                            the work of raising water to a height or from a mine is the useful
                            labour or duty to be performed by the engine. Returning to the cylinder
                            at A, we have now to examine the mechanism by means of which the steam
                            is admitted alternately above and below the piston, through the openings
                            or ports which may be observed on the right hand side of the cylinder at
                            top and bottom. F is the steam pipe which brings steam from the boiler
                            to the top of the valve passages, and the pipe I conducts it down to the
                            bottom valves and port at K, and the pipe J forming the eduction pipe,
                            conducts the steam into the refrigerating apparatus, where it is finally
                            condensed. In commencing to work the machine, the duty of the attendant
                            is to allow the steam to pass freely into all the pipes, passages, and
                            ports, F G I J, &amp;c. filling the cylinder A, the condenser M, and
                            passing out at an aperture O,closed by a valve called the blowoff valve;
                            by means of which operation, the whole of the parts being filled with
                            steam, are rendered vacuous from air, and this preparatory process is
                            called blowing through. At G it is to be observed that there is a
                            steam-nozzle and valve or regulator, which allows the steam to enter the
                            cylinder at the upper part whenever it is opened, by raising the
                            metallic cover or valve from the open ing of the nozzle immediately
                            below, which it exactly fits. At K is a similar nozzle and valve called
                            the equilibrium-valve and nozzle, which admits steam through the pipe I
                            into the bottom part of the cylinder; and the third or exhaustion-valve
                            and nozzle or aperture, allows the final egress of the steam into the
                            condenser. After the engine has been wholly filled with steam, the
                            piston B, being at the top of the cylinder, the injection-cock N is
                            suddenly opened, and the cold <hi rend="italic">jet d’eau</hi> playing
                            amongst the steam condenses it instantaneously, forming a vacuum into
                            which the steam from the cylinder instantly rushes, and is in like
                            manner annihilated, leaving the cylinder below the piston equally
                            vacuous; and of course the steam from the boiler, on being admitted by
                            the valve G to the upper side of the piston, instantly presses it down
                            into the vacuum below with a force proportional to the perfection of
                            that vacuum and to the pressure of the steam. Thus the engine makes its
                            first stroke and raises the water of the great pump on the right of the
                            figure, and the weight of the chain, rod, and bucket, and also a
                            counterpoise <hi rend="italic">h,</hi> added for the purpose of
                            restoring the beam to its former position, which it does in the
                            following manner. The equilibrium-valve K is opened, and the steam
                            getting admission below the piston, as well as above it, ceases to urge
                            it in either direction, and being thus in equilibrio, the piston would
                            remain passively in its place at the bottom of the cylinder, but the
                            action of the counterpoise A, and the weight of the water and pump-rods
                            in the large pump on the outside, draw down the outer end of the great
                            lever or working-beam <hi rend="italic">f a e,</hi> and so raise the
                            interior end f, and the piston B to the top of the cylinder. The
                            equilibrium valve is then closed at K, and the eduction-valve L is
                            opened, so as to allow the steam below the piston to rush down into the
                            condenser and leave a vacuum under the piston, into which it is
                            immediately forced down by the pressure of the steam above A as at
                            first, and raising water at the other end of the beam through a second
                            stroke; and, thus by the continual opening and shutting of the valves by
                            the attendant, the engine performs its work. But we have still to
                            consider the mechanism by which the valves are shut and opened, and the
                            machine is made to shut and open its own valves.</p>
                        <p>For this purpose we have given a separate and enlarged drawing of one of
                            the valves and its working gear :— <hi rend="italic">l i l</hi> is a
                            part of the air pump rod, formed of wood, called the plug-frame or
                            plug-tree, on which are two projecting plugs of wood to work the upper
                            and lower valves; one of these plugs is seen at <hi rend="italic"
                            >i</hi>. As the plug-tree moves up and down, the plugs strike the
                            handles or working gear of the valves, and open or shut them at the
                            proper instant. The valves D E are called conical valves, because the
                            small cover I) which closes the opening of each nozzle under the valve
                            is slightly tapered down wards so as the more readily to fit its seat,
                            and each is lifted from its seat by a small toothed rack and pinion <hi
                            rend="italic">c</hi> moved by a spindle from without, communicating by
                            rods with the valve gear at r, or at Z and Y in figure 41. When the
                            plug-frame <hi rend="italic">l i I</hi> descends, the valve <hi
                            rend="italic">d</hi> is closed by the plug », and the valve K is shut,
                            and the valve L in figure 41 opened by the plug Y.</p>
                        <p>Returning to figure 41, it will he seen that the condensing apparatus and
                            its appendages are placed almost immediately under the cylinder, and to
                            the right of it. The eduction-pipe J conducts the steam into the
                            condensing chamber M. This chamber is placed in the middle of the cold
                            well, so us to be wholly surrounded<pb break="no"

                            xml:id="kp-eb0720-0746-0638"/> by cold water; and through the regulated
                            aperture N a jet of cold water is allowed to play in the inside of it
                            amongst the steam. P the air-pump is also placed in the cold well
                            surrounded by water; Q the piston or bucket of the air-pump is worked up
                            and down by the piston-rod Q Y Z <hi rend="italic">g</hi> from the great
                            lever. The valve It closes when the piston descends, and opens on its
                            ascent, allowing water and air to pass into the air-pump, but preventing
                            its return; and the upper valve of the air-pump S allows the escape of
                            water and air outwards, but prevents its return; this valve S leads to
                            the hot well T, from which the feedpump U draws off a supply of water
                            for the boiler.</p>
                        <p>“The great advantage of Mr Watt’s form is the almost total annihilation
                            of the waste of steam by condensation in the cylinder. The cylinder is
                            always hot, and therefore perfectly dry. This must be evident to any
                            person who onderstands the subject. By the time that Mr Watt had
                            completed these improvements, his experiments on the production of steam
                            had given him a pretty accurate knowledge of its density: and he found
                            himself authorized to say, that the quantity of steam employed did not
                            much exceed what would fill the cylinder, so that very little was
                            unavoidably wasted. But before he could bring the engine to this degree
                            of perfection, he had many difficulties to overcome. He in closed the
                            cylinder in another containing steam, and that in a wooden case at a
                            small distance from it, which effectually prevents all condensation in
                            the inner cylinder from external influence; and the condensation by the
                            outer cylinder itself, which was very small, had no other bad
                            consequence than the loss of so much steam as formed the condensed
                            water.</p>
                        <p>“The greatest difficulty was to make the great piston tight. The old and
                            effectual method, by water lying on it, was inadmissible. He was
                            therefore obliged to have his cylinders most nicely bored, perfectly
                            cylindrical, and finely polished; and he made numberless trials of
                            differ ent soft substances for packing his piston, which should be tight
                            without enormous friction, and which should long remain so, in a
                            situation perfectly dry and very hot.</p>
                        <p>“After all that Mr Watt has done in this respect, he thinks that the
                            greatest part of the waste of steam which he still perceives in his
                            engines, arises from the unavoidable escape by the sides of the piston
                            during its descent.</p>
                        <p>“But the fact is, that an engine of this construction, of the same
                            dimensions with a common engine, making the same number of strokes of
                            the same extent, does not consume above one-fourth <hi rend="italic">or
                            one-third</hi> part of the fuel that is consumed by the best engines of
                            the common form. It is also a very fortunate circumstance, that the
                            performance of the engine is not immediately destroyed, nor in deed
                            sensibly diminished, by a small want of tightness in the piston. In the
                            common engine, if air get in in this way, it immediately puts a stop to
                            the work; but although even a considerable quantity of steam get past
                            the piston during its descent, the rapidity of condensation is such,
                            that hardly any diminution of pressure can be observed.</p>
                        <p>“When Newcomen’s engines are working under loads inferior to their whole
                            power, they are regulated to pre vent shocks which would be prejudicial,
                            by lessening the quantity of injection, or by shutting the
                            injection-cock sooner. These new engines may, in some degree, be
                            regulated in the same manner; but it is done more effectually and
                            economically, first, by limiting the opening of the regulating-valve
                            which admits the steam above the piston, and letting it continue so far
                            open during the whole length of the stroke; secondly, by letting it open
                            fully at first, and shutting it completely when the piston has proceeded
                            downwards only part of its stroke; or, lastly, by the use of a
                            throttle-valve, which, acting in the same manner as the floodgate of a
                            mill, admits no more steam than gives the desired power.</p>
                        <p>“The second of these methods of regulating the power of the engine, forms
                            the basis of what is called the <hi rend="italic">Expansive Engine,</hi>
                            which renders available the greater part of the power with which the
                            steam would rush into empty space, were the piston acted upon by the
                            whole force of the steam, from the bottom to the top of the stroke,
                            through the whole length of the cylinder—a principle which had first
                            occurred to Mr Watt in 1769, and was adopted in an engine at Soho
                            manufactory, and some others, about 1776, and in 1778 at Shadwell water
                            works, and afterwards particularly described in his specification of a
                            patent for several new improvements upon steam-engines, in 1782.</p>
                        <p>“The construction of this engine is as has been described. The
                            steam-valve is always allowed to open fully; the pins of the plug-frame
                            are regulated so, that that valve shall shut the moment that the piston
                            has descended a certain portion, suppose one-fourth, one third, or
                            one-half, of the length of the cylinder. So far the cylinder was
                            occupied by steam as elastic as common air. In pressing the piston
                            farther down, it behoved the steam to expand, and its elasticity to
                            diminish. It is plain that this can be done in any degree we please, and
                            that the adjustment can be varied in a minute, according to the exigency
                            of the case, by moving the plug pins.</p>
                        <p>“In the mean time, it must be observed, that the pressure on the piston
                            is continually changing, and consequently the accelerating force. The
                            motion, therefore, will no longer be uniformly accelerated. It will
                            approach much faster to uniformity; nay, it may be retarded, be cause
                            although the pressure on the piston at the beginning of the stroke may
                            exceed the resistance of the load, yet when the piston is near the
                            bottom, the resistance may exceed the pressure. Whatever may be the law
                            by which the pressure on the piston varies, an ingenious mechanic may
                            contrive the connecting machinery in such a way that the chains or rods
                            at the outer end of the beam shall continually exert the same pressure,
                            or shall vary their pressure according to any law he finds most
                            convenient. It is in this manner that the watchmaker, by the form of the
                            fuzee, produces an equal pressure on the wheel-work by means of a very
                            unequal action of the mainspring. In like manner, by making the outer
                            arch, heads portions of a proper spiral instead of a circle, we can
                            regulate the force of the beam at pleasure.</p>
                        <p>« Thus we see how much more manageable an engine is in this form than
                            Newcomen’s was, and also more easily investigated in respect of its
                            power in its various positions. The knowledge of this last circumstance
                            was of mighty consequence, and without it no notion could be formed of
                            what it could perform, which may be called a discovery of great
                            importance in the theory of the engine. We shall give here Mr. Watt’s
                            theory of the expansive engine which we have just described.</p>
                        <p>“Let ABCD (Fig. 43.) represent a section of the cylinder of a
                            steam-engine, and EF the surface of its piston. Let us suppose that the
                            steam was admitted while EF was in contact with AB, and that as soon as
                            it had pressed it down to the situation EF, the steam-cock is shut. The
                            steam will continue to press it down, and as the steam expands, its
                            pressure diminishes. We may express its pressure (exerted all the while
                            the piston moves from the situation AB to the situation EF) by the line
                            EF. If we suppose the elasticity of the steam<pb break="no"

                            l, or simply 6333 pounds. Therefore the steam while it expands into the
                            whole cylinder adds a pressure of 8781 pounds.</p>
                        <p>“Suppose that the steam had got free admission during the whole descent
                            of the piston, the accumulated pressure would have been 6333 × 4, or
                            25332 pounds.</p>
                        <p>“Here Mr Watt observed a remarkable result. The steam expended in this
                            case would have been four times greater than when it was stopped at one
                            fourth, and yet the accumulated pressure is not twice as great, being
                            nearly five-thirds. one-fourth of the steam performs nearly three-fifths
                            of the work, and an equal quantity performs more than twice as much work
                            when thus admitted during one-fourth of the motion.</p>

                            is sooner stopped; but the increase is not great after the steam is
                            rarefied four times. The curve approaches near to the axis, and small
                            additions are made to the area. The expense of such great cylinders is
                            considerable, and may sometimes compensate this advantage.<note

                            always been matter of regret that one-half of the motion was
                            unaccompanied by any work. It was a very obvious thing to Mr Watt, that
                            as the steam admitted above the piston pressed it down, so steam
                            admitted below the piston would press it up with the same force,
                            provided that a vacuum were made on its upper side. This was easily
                            done, by connecting the lower end of the cylinder with the boiler and
                            the upper end with the condenser.”</p>
                        <p>Hitherto we have considered the condensing steam engine of Watt in its
                            application to the purpose of working the large pumps used to draw water
                            from mines or to supply reservoirs from a lower Ievel. This, indeed, was
                            the most obvious and immediate application of the steam-engine, which
                            was at first introduced as a substitute for the atmospheric pumping
                            engine of Watt.</p>
                        <p>The steam-engine of revolution of Mr Watt was an invention subsequent to
                            the mining steam-engine or “water-commanding machine." Previous to the
                            time of Watt, indeed, there had been a few attempts made to produce a
                            revolving motion by means of steam, such as the case where the engines
                            of Savary and Newcomen drew up water, which, falling upon the buckets of
                            a wheel, produced its revolution. There had also been many attempts to
                            apply the atmospheric pumping-engine directly to this purpose—Jonathan
                            Hall, Kean, Fitzgerald, Mr Oxley, John Stewart, and Matthew Wasbrough,
                            had all contrived some means of producing a revolving motion from the
                            reciprocation of the great beam of the pumping-engine; hut Watt’s engine
                            alone had the power of being rendered an efficient and economical motive
                            power.</p>
                        <p>We shall take the present opportunity of describing Mr Watt’s method of
                            communicating the force of the steam-engine to any machine of the
                            rotatory kind.</p>
                        <p>“VV, fig. 44, represents the rim and arms of a very large and heavy
                            metalline fly. On its axis is the concentric-toothed wheel U. There is
                            attached to the end of the great beam a strong and stiff rod T, to the
                            lower end of which a toothed wheel W is firmly fixed by two bolts, so
                            that it can not turn round. This wheel is of the same size and in the
                            same vertical plane with the wheel U; and an iron link or strap (which
                            cannot be seen here, because it is on the other side of the two wheels)
                            connects the centres of the two wheels, so that the one cannot quit the
                            other. The engine being in the position represented in the figure,
                            suppose the fly to be turned once round by any external force in the
                            direction of the darts. It is plain, that since the toothed wheels
                            cannot quit each other, being kept together by the link, the inner half
                            (that is, the half next the cylinder) of the wheel U will work on the
                            outer half of the wheel W, so that at the end of the revolution of the
                            fly the wheel W must have got to the top of the wheel U, and the outer
                            end of the beam must be raised to its highest position. The next
                            revolution of the fly will bring the wheel W and the beam connected with
                            it to their first positions; and thus every two revolu<pb break="no"

                            period of the beam’s reciprocating movements. Now, instead of supposing
                            the fly to drive the beam, let the beam drive the fly. The motions must
                            be perfectly the same, and the ascent or descent of the piston will
                            produce one revolution of the fly.</p>
                        <p>“It is proper here to give the history of this invention I had very early
                            turned my mind to the producing continued motions round an axis, and it
                            will be seen by reference to my first specification in 1769, that I
                            there described a steam-wheel, moved by the force of steam acting in a
                            circular channel against a valve on one side, and against a column of
                            mercury or some other fluid metal on the other side. This was executed
                            upon a scale of about six feet diameter at Soho, and worked repeatedly,
                            but was given up, as several practical objections were found to operate
                            against it. Similar objections lay against other rotative engines which
                            had been contrived by myself and others, as well as to the engines
                            producing rotatory motions by means of ratchet-wheels. Having made my
                            reciprocating engines very regular in their movements, I considered how
                            to produce rotative motions from them in the best manner; and amongst
                            various schemes which were subjected to trial, or which passed through
                            my mind, none appeared so likely to answer the purpose as the
                            application of the crank in the manner of the common turning lathe, (an
                            invention of great merit, of which the humble inventor, and even its
                            era, are unknown.) But, as the rotative motion is produced in that
                            machine by the impulse given to the crank in the descent of the foot
                            only, and behoves to be continued in its ascent by the momentum of the
                            wheel, which acts as a fly, and being unwilling to load my engine with a
                            fly heavy enough to continue the motion during the ascent of the piston,
                            (and even were a counterweight employed to act during that ascent of a
                            fly heavy enough to equalize the motion,) I proposed to employ two
                            engines acting upon two cranks fixed on the same axis at an angle of one
                            hundred and twenty degrees to one another, and a weight placed upon the
                            circumference of the fly at the same angle to each of the cranks, by
                            which means the motion might be rendered nearly equal, and a very light
                            fly only would be requisite. This had occurred to me very early, but my
                            attention being fully employed in making and erecting engines for
                            raising water, it remained <hi rend="italic">in petto</hi> until about
                            the year 1778 or 9, when Mr Washbrough erected one of his ratchet-wheel
                            engines at Birmingham, the frequent breakages and irregularities of
                            which recalled the subject to my mind, and I proceeded to make a model
                            of my method, which answered my expectations; but having neglected to
                            take out a patent, the invention was communicated by a workman employed
                            to make the model to some of the people about Mr Wasbrough’s engine, and
                            a patent was taken out by them for the application of the crank to
                            steam-engines. This fact the said workman confessed, and the engineer
                            who directed the works acknowledged it, but said, nevertheless, the same
                            idea had occurred to him prior to his hearing of mine, and that he had
                            even made a model of it before that time, which might be a fact, as the
                            application to a single crank was sufficiently obvious. In these
                            circumstances I thought it better to endeavour to accomplish the same
                            end by other means, than to enter into litigation, and, if successful,
                            by demolishing the patent, to lay the matter open to every body.
                            Accordingly, in 1781, I in vented and took out a patent for several
                            methods of producing rotative motions from reciprocating ones, amongst
                            which was the method of the sun and planet wheels described in the
                            text.</p>
                        <p>“This contrivance was applied to many engines, and possesses the great
                            advantage of giving a double velocity to the fly; hut is perhaps more
                            subject to wear, and to be broken under great strains, than the crank,
                            which is now more commonly used, although it requires a flywheel of four
                            times the weight, if fixed upon the first axis. My application of the
                            double engine to these rotative ma chines rendered unnecessary the
                            counterweight, and produced a more regular motion; <hi rend="italic">so
                            that, in most of our great manufactories, these engines now supply the
                            place of water, wind, and horse mills; and instead of carrying the work
                            to the power, the prime agent is placed wherever it is most convenient
                            to the manufacturer."</hi></p>
                        <p>“Let us now trace the operation of this machine through all its steps.
                            Let us suppose that the lower part of the cylinder BB, fig. 44, is
                            exhausted of all elastic fluids; that the upper steam-valve D and the
                            lower eduction valve F are open, and that the lower steam-valve E and
                            upper eduction-valve N are shut. It is evident that the piston must be
                            pressed toward the bottom of the cylinder, and must pull down the end of
                            the working beam by means of the toothed rack OO and sector QQ, causing
                            the other end of the beam to urge forward the machinery with which it is
                            connected. When the piston arrives at the bottom of the cylinder, the
                            valves D and F are shut by the plug-frame, and E and N are opened. By
                            this last passage the steam gets into the eduction-pipe, where it meets
                            with the injection water, and is rapidly condensed. The steam from the
                            boiler enters at the same time by E, and pressing on the Iower side of
                            the piston, forces it upwards, and by means of the toothed rack 00 and
                            toothed sector QQ forces up that end of the workingbeam, and causes the
                            other end to urge forward the machinery with which it is connected; and
                            in this manner the operation of the engine may be continued for
                            ever.</p>
                        <p>“The injection water is continually running into the eductionpipe,
                            because condensation is continually going on, and therefore there is a
                            continual atmospheric pressure to produce a jet. The air which is
                            disengaged from the water, or enters by leaks, is evacuated only during
                            the rise of the piston of the air-pump K.</p>
                        <pb break="no" facs="ht:chi.28490924&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=749"
                            xml:id="kp-eb0720-0749-0641"/>
                        <p>“It is evident that this form of the engine, by maintaining an almost
                            constant and uninterrupted impulsion, is much fitter for driving any
                            machinery of continued motion than any of the former engines, which were
                            inactive during half of their motion. It does not, however, seem to have
                            this superiority when employed to draw water; but it is also fitted for
                            this task. Let the engine be loaded with twice as much as would be
                            proper for it if a single stroke engine, and let a fly be connected with
                            it. Then it is plain that the power of the engine during the rise of the
                            steam-piston will be accumulated in the fly; and this, in conjunction
                            with the power of the engine during the descent of the steam-piston,
                            will be equal to the whole load of water.</p>
                        <p>“The engraving here referred to is copied from the drawing of the double
                            engine in the above patent of 1782, and is that of an experimental
                            engine, no others having ever been made exactly similar. I have now
                            added engravings of one of the Albion mill engines, fig. 45, 4G, being
                            one of the earliest double engines erected for sale. I do not exactly
                            recollect the date of the invention of the double engine, but a drawing
                            of it is still in my possession, which was produced in the House of
                            Commons when I was soliciting the act of Parliament for the prolongation
                            of my patent in 1774—5. Having encountered much difficulty in teaching
                            others the construction and use of the single engine, and in overcoming
                            prejudices, I proceeded no farther in it at that time, nor until,
                            finding myself beset with a host of plagiaries and pirates in 1782, I
                            thought it proper to insert it, and some other things, in the patent
                            above-mentioned.</p>

                            upon the working beam through the piston-rod, &amp;c., it pulls down the
                            cylinder-end of the beam, and raises up the outer-end and the connecting

                            it is fixed, are made to revolve in the desired direction, and give
                            motion to the millwork.</p>
                        <p>“As the piston descends, the plug-tree Z also descends, and a clamp, or
                            slider <hi rend="italic">q,</hi> fixed upon the side of the plug tree,
                            presses upon the handle 1 of the upper Y-shaft, or axis, and thereby
                            shuts the valves G and L; and the same operation, by disengaging a
                            detent, permits a weight suspended to the arm of the lower Y-shaft to
                            turn the shaft upon its axis, and thereby to open the valves K and II.
                            The moment previous to the opening these valves, the piston had reached
                            the lowest part of its stroke, and the cylinder <hi rend="italic"
                            >above</hi> the piston was filled with steam; but as soon as II is

                            exhausted. The steam from the boiler entering by I and K, acts upon the

                            top of the cylinder. When the piston is very near the upper termination
                            of its stroke, another slider <hi rend="italic">a</hi> raises the handle
                            2, and in so doing disengages the catch, which permits the upper Y-shaft
                            to revolve upon its own axis and open the valves G and L, and the
                            downward stroke recommences as has been related.</p>
                        <p>When the piston descends, the buckets R, T of the air-pump P and
                            hot-water pump T also descend. The water which is contained in these
                            pumps passes through the valves of their buckets, and is drawn up and
                            dis charged by them through the lander or trough <hi rend="italic"
                            >t</hi>, by the next descending stroke of the piston. Part of this water
                            is raised up by the pump V, for the supply of the boiler, and the rest
                            runs to waste.</p>

                            Watt, will find them in the descriptive portion of this treatise.</p>
                        <p>The history of the steam-engine ends with the history of Mr Watt’s
                            labours. There are, it is true, many parts of the steam-engine that have
                            been altered, simplified, or adapted to peculiar uses and circumstances
                            since his time; but these are matters of minor importance, with out
                            which, the engine would not have been materially cur tailed of its
                            present efficiency. It is a remarkable fact that the steam-engine has
                            scarcely received any very valuable improvement since his time. He, in
                            fact, rendered it a machine nearly perfect. The testimony of Mr Farey
                            upon this subject is explicit, and must be conclusive on the subject
                            with every one who has the means of ascertaining the very high
                            estimation to which the knowledge and practical skill of that excellent
                            writer on the steam-engine most justly entitle him. “It is a
                            circumstance,” says Mr Farey, (<hi rend="italic">steam-engine, p.</hi>
                            473,) “highly creditable to Mr Watt’s character, both as an original
                            inventor and as a practical engineer, that his first double-revolving
                            engine, which he made in 1787 at the Albion Mills, performed quite as
                            well as any engine which has since been constructed to employ steam οn
                            the same principles. Some important improvements have been made in the
                            construction of modern engines by substituting cast-iron and stonework
                            in the place of wood, and by putting the parts together in more
                            substantial modes; but all those essential forms and proportions which
                            affect the performance of the machine, were so ascertained by the first
                            inventor, that no improvement has been since made in them, and every
                            departure from those forms and pro portions has impaired the performance
                            in a greater or less degree.”</p>
                        <p>Thus have we taken a rapid survey of the history of the steam-engine. We
                            have omitted the names of many individuals who have distinguished
                            themselves by ingenuity directed to this subject. We have omitted the
                            labours of Gebert, Alberti, Cardan, Decaus, Branca, Mor land, Papin,
                            Amonton, Leopold, Meyer, Bosfrand, Ges sanne, and a hundred others who
                            have, all in different degrees, expended ingenuity upon the application
                            of steam to the production of mechanical power; and these we have
                            omitted not because we consider their labours either undeserving of
                            notice or uninteresting to the general reader, but because they have not
                            contributed towards the production of the modern steam-engine, and
                            because an account of their works would rattier serve to illustrate the
                            possible varieties of the machine and the fertility of the human mind in
                            mechanical devices, than either to conduct the reader along the stream
                            of historical succession, or render him better acquainted with the
                            nature and mechanical peculiarities of the steam-engine itself.</p>

                        low-pressure engines. The former is simple, light, and of few parts,
                        generally used for locomotive engines, steam-carriages, steam-vessels of a
                        light and rapid construction, and such other purposes as require portability
                        or cheapness. The latter is more com plex, but more effective; more
                        expensive in original construction, but more durable and more economical in
                        con sumption of fuel. The first is more commonly in use in America, the
                        latter in this country. The high-pressure engine is sometimes also called
                        the non-condensing steam engine, to distinguish it from the low-pressure
                        engine, which is also called the condensing steam-engine; but there is
                        sometimes a combination effected of some of the parts and principles of both
                        these species, in what is called a high-pressure condensing engine, by
                        which, for certain purposes, the peculiar merits of both species are
                        combined in the same machine.</p>
                    <p>Of these two sorts of steam-engine it is remarkable that the more elementary
                        and simple—that which is the more easily conceived and understood—was not
                        invented and brought into practical use until long after the other kind had
                        been very extensively used and made known by its inventor, James Watt. It
                        appears to us, that we are to consider Oliver Evans of Philadelphia as the
                        inventor of the modern high-pressure engine. Before 1786 he had contrived
                        and made experiments upon a high-pressure engine, which seems to have been
                        in all essential respects similar to our own. lndeed, it appears that the
                        Ameri cans have taken the form and arrangements of their engines from Evans,
                        as implicitly as in this country we have adopted those of Watt. The history
                        of Evans consists almost entirely of the romance of real life. Sanguine and
                        energetic, he continually encountered difficulties only to overcome them,
                        and to encounter renewed disaster and disappointment, till he at length died
                        of a broken heart. To him we attribute the rapid advancement of America, at
                        the commencement of the present century, in all that relates to the
                        introduction of the steam-engine in its multifarious applications, and
                        especially in steam navigation. He had awakened in that nation a lively
                        sense of the advantages which they were likely to derive from the
                        introduction of the power of steam, and placed in their hands an instrument
                        well fitted for their use, and which they were not slow to adopt and
                        apply.</p>
                    <p>The high-pressure or non-condensing engine consists of <hi rend="italic"
                        >two</hi> principal members, <hi rend="italic">generator</hi> or <hi
                        rend="italic">boiler</hi> and working <hi rend="italic">cylinder,</hi> each
                        with sundry appendages. The low pressure or condensing steam-engine consists
                        of <hi rend="italic">three</hi> principal members, <hi rend="italic"
                        >generator, cylinder,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">refrigerator or
                        condenser,</hi> each with sundry appendages.</p>
                    <p>The generator and working cylinder, with their append ages, are neatly the
                        same in both kinds of steam-engine, the presence of a condenser or
                        refrigerator forming the principal and almost only distinction of the second
                        species. By this second species the steam is returned into its first state
                        of water, thereby effecting a saving of heat and of mechanical power;
                        whereas, in the first form of engine, the steam, after performing a certain
                        portion of its labour, is discharged into the open air as useless; a process
                        which can only be advisable in circumstances where the labour and apparatus
                        for condensing would cost more money, and cause more inconvenience than
                        would countervail the loss of fuel and heat and power.</p>
                    <p>As, therefore, the high-pressure non-condensing steam engine is simpler in
                        its action and construction than the low-pressure condensing engine, it is
                        convenient to con<pb break="no"

                        afterwards, how far it may require to he modified in order to acquire the
                        advantage of condensation.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic">The high-pressure non-condensing steam-engine.</hi></p>
                    <p>The elastic force of steam is a phenomenon with which we become acquainted
                        very early in life. We see that when water boils furiously in a kettle or
                        caldron which is closely fitted by a lid or cover, it has a tendency to
                        raise it up or drive it off with considerable force; and that the steam,
                        collecting in the upper part of the vessel, rushes with considerable
                        velocity out of any crevice or pipe which communicates with the open
                        air.</p>
                    <p>The force of the steam which is thus issuing from the spout of a kettle or
                        crevice in the cover of a caldron is comparatively slight; and the steam
                        which thus rises from boiling water is called low-pressure steam. But if we
                        stop up the spout and close the cover with accuracy, so as to confine the
                        steam within the kettle or boiler, the water will become hotter and hotter,
                        and the steam stronger and stronger, until it will either force up the cover
                        with violence, or altogether burst asunder the sides of the boiler. In this
                        confined and heated state the steam acquires, from its properties, the
                        descriptive appellation of high-pressure steam.</p>
                    <p>Engineers are in the habit of reckoning the force of high-pressure steam by a
                        very simple expedient. They place a weight such as W (Fig. 47,) upon a hole
                        on the top of the boiler. This hole being square, and an inch in length and
                        breadth, and the weight being equal to one pound, when the steam is strong
                        enough just to blow the weight off the hole, they call that <hi
                        rend="italic">steam of an elastic force equal to one pound on the square
                        inch.</hi> They then place a weight of two pounds upon this hole of a square
                        inch, and continue the heat until the steam just blows it off, and that is
                        called <hi rend="italic">steam of the pressure of two pounds On the square
                        inch.</hi> And, in like manner, when steam is confined and heated until it
                        acquire force enough to blow weights of three, four, five, fifteen, or fifty
                        pounds off an aperture of not more than a square inch in extent, that is
                        technically called <hi rend="italic">steam of the elastic pressure of three,
                        four, five, fifteen, and fifty pounds on the square inch.</hi> It is
                        difficult to say whether there be any limit to the elastic force which steam
                        may acquire from continued heat and confinement: it is known to he even ns
                        powerfully elastic as gunpowder, and pressures of one thousand pounds an
                        inch have been produced.</p>
                    <p>The pressures generally adopted for high-pressure engines are from fifteen to
                        one hundred and twenty pounds on the inch. Of course, when there is a given
                        pressure on any one inch of the surface of a boiler, there will be the same
                        on every other inch of surface; and if the aperture under the weight be any
                        number of times greater than one inch, it will just require so much the more
                        weight to keep it closed. The standard by which the pressure is reckoned and
                        calculated is, however, always the square whose side is one inch.</p>
                    <p>By placing a movable weight upon an aperture of given size in this manner,
                        the engineer not only ascertains the amount of the elastic force of the
                        steam tending to burst the boiler, but he also constructs a <hi
                        rend="italic">safety-valve</hi> by which to avert the danger of an explosion
                        of the boiler.</p>
                    <p>Dr Desaguliers relates a circumstance which happened very early in the
                        history of the steam-engine, when, for want of proper precautions of this
                        nature, “the steam burst the boiler with a great explosion, and killed the
                        poor man who stood near, with the pieces that flew asunder, there being
                        otherwise no danger, by reason of the safety-valve being made to lift up and
                        open upon occasion.” Now, a given weight of lead or iron laid on a hole in
                        the top of a boiler so as to close it, is a sufficient and common form of
                        safety valve; for when ever the pressure of the steam becomes sufficient to
                        raise the weight, it escapes through the opening into the air without doing
                        any mischief. A largo weight of lead, simply placed on the opening, is a
                        very common and simple mode of providing for the safety of the
                        apparatus.</p>
                    <p>But this plan becomes inconvenient when the pressure is high and the weight
                        great, because it then becomes so high as to be unsteady; and, in order to
                        remedy the in convenience, what is called a <hi rend="italic">valve</hi> is
                        used, separate from, and in addition to, the weight, as shown in the
                        accompanying diagram, fig. 48. A valve-seat <hi rend="italic">a b,</hi>
                        formed of cast brass, is fixed in the aperture, and is accurately fitted by
                        the valve itself c <hi rend="italic">d,</hi> the edges of which, at c and
                        <hi rend="italic">d,</hi> are carefully turned and tapered, so as to fit the
                        neck of <hi rend="italic">a b,</hi> and ground in its place with emery
                        powder, which makes it perfectly steam-tight. A spindle protrudes downwards
                        from the valve through a guide which keeps it in a straight line, and pre
                        vents it from falling on one side of the valve after having been raised.
                        This same spindle, rising upwards, carries upon a crossbar a series of large
                        cylindrical weights which may be increased or diminished in number as the
                        case may require.</p>
                    <p>It is a practical fault of this valve that the tall erect spindle may easily
                        become bent or injured by accident, and also that the weight upon it may too
                        easily be handled, so as wantonly to be increased; hence, a safety valve,
                        with an internal weight, has been contrived in the following shape. A
                        conical valve is placed in its seat in every respect as formerly, only the
                        spindle does not rise up but hangs down among the steam, terminating in a
                        chain and weight.</p>
                    <p>In all of these modifications the weight on the safety-valve becomes large
                        and cumbrous when the pressure is high; and a contrivance was devised very
                        early in the history of steam to obviate the inconvenience of this plan,
                        under the name of the lever safety-valve. Instead of placing a great series
                        of weights on the valve itself, a single weight is hung on the end of the
                        longer arm of a lever so as to produce an effect proportional to its
                        distance, and this lever being graduated, shows the amount of the effect
                        which is thus produced. In the figure, the valve, valve-rod, and spindle are
                        all arranged as formerly; but a lever <hi rend="italic">g k</hi> rests on
                        the top of a small hemispherical button on the valve; and the one end <hi
                        rend="italic">g</hi> being a fulcrum, the weight W is suspended by a ring
                        from any point of the lever. When, at the point 4, as in the figure, its
                        effect on the valve is four times as great as if directly upon it. The
                        effect of the lever’s own weight will, in this case, be<pb break="no"
                        facs="ht:chi.28490924&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=752" xml:id="kp-eb0720-0752-0644"
                        /> also equivalent to a certain number of pounds on the valve, which, being
                        properly estimated, the lever safety valve may be used to indicate with
                        accuracy the pressure of the steam.</p>
                    <p>Another form of valve has been proposed, as indicating still more correctly
                        the point at which the pressure of the steam is equal to the pressure on the
                        valve. It is a cylinder or flat valve, acted on by a lever and weight; and
                        there are weights on opposite sides of the lever, which has also equal arms.
                        These weights rest on light rollers so as to run down from their places and
                        release the steam entirely, whenever its pressure reaches the pre scribed
                        limit. This is the valve of the French Academy and Franklin Institute.</p>
                    <p>Another form of valve, also cylindrical, was used by Mr Southern for his deli
                        cate experiments on high-pressure steam. (See Art. <hi rend="smallcaps"
                        >Steam.)</hi> The cylinder of the valve-seat used in the former figures is
                        prolonged upwards, so as to form a vertical cylinder or tube, in which a
                        plug of metal is exactly fitted. This plug is ground with great care, so as
                        to move freely but steam tight in the cylinder; and a rod from the cylinder
                        passes up through a hole in the top, and is kept down by a lever and weight.
                        A hole in the cylinder allows the steam to escape whenever the pressure on
                        the valve upwards exceeds the pressure of the lever and weights in the
                        opposite direction. The indications of this instrument are found to be very
                        precise.</p>
                    <p>Another species of safety-valve has of late years come into use, called the
                        spring-valve. It is of two kinds, with a lever and with out it. The form
                        without the lever is represented in the first of these dia grams, fig. 54. A
                        series of bent springs, sp <hi rend="italic">sp sp sp,</hi> &amp;c., are
                        placed alternately in opposite directions, in the square frame <hi
                        rend="italic">g h k l,</hi> and are forced down upon the valve at <hi
                        rend="italic">n</hi> by means of a crossbar <hi rend="italic">k h</hi>
                        acting at <hi rend="italic">m—</hi> a small screw at <hi rend="italic"
                        >m</hi> adjusting the pressure by compressing or releasing the spring.</p>
                    <p>The other form of spring safety-valve interposes a lever between the
                        safety-valve and the spring. S T, fig. 55, is ( what is commonly called a
                        Salter’s spring balance, the box <hi rend="italic">X y,</hi> containing a
                        spiral-spring, which is compressed in the box, when the end S is drawn away
                        from, or raised above the point S. The finger-screw S, adjusts the degree of
                        tension on the end of the lever. The two last species of safety valve are
                        used in locomotive steam-engines.</p>
                    <p>A totally different method of indicating the pressure of steam in a boiler,
                        is by means of what is called a <hi rend="italic">mercurial gauge,</hi>
                        communicating with the boiler. Mercury is poured into a bent tube, one end
                        of which springs from the boiler, and the other end is exposed to the air,
                        so that the steam by its pressure raises the mercury in the straight limb of
                        the tube to a height above the level pro portioned to that pressure. In the
                        figure <hi rend="italic">a c d e,</hi> is the bent tube, communicating with
                        the boiler at <hi rend="italic">a</hi>, and open at the end <hi
                        rend="italic">e,</hi> the steam presses on the end c of the mercury, and
                        raises the other extremity of the fluid to the height C. From calculating
                        the weight of mercury, it is reckoned, that for every pound of pressure of
                        the steam in the boiler, there is an inch of mercury raised in the tube; so
                        that, if the space <hi rend="italic">d c</hi> be nine inches, a pressure of
                        nine lbs. on the square inch in the boiler is indicated. Sometimes also a
                        small float of iron is placed on the mercury, which, carrying a slender rod
                        with an index, points the elevation of the mercury on a scale above the
                        gauge. It is evident that this instrument also acts as a safety-valve,
                        inasmuch as the steam, when too strong, must force the mercury entirely over
                        the top of the tube, and make its escape. A double pipe, on a larger scale,
                        with water in it instead of mercury, would answer the same purpose equally
                        well; only the water would rise one foot and an inch for every pound of
                        pressure of steam in the leg of the double tube, and twice that quantity if
                        the tube were single; which would give a scale of 16½ feet in a double tube,
                        or 33 feet in a single tube, as the column of water raised above the level
                        by a pressure of 15 lbs. on the square inch.</p>
                    <p>It is convenient to reckon the pressure of steam in larger numbers than
                        pounds, and the quantity that has been fixed is a weight of 15 lbs., or a
                        stone weight, per square inch; and to this weight the name of an atmosphere
                        of pressure has been given, simply because the common atmosphere of air
                        presses on all bodies with a weight of 15 lbs. on the square inch, (see Art.
                        <hi rend="smallcaps">Pneumatics.)</hi> Thus steam having a pressure of 15
                        lbs. on the square inch, is called high-pressure steam of the elastic force
                        or strength of one atmosphere. high-pressure steam having a pressure of 30
                        lbs., is said to have an elastic force of two atmos pheres, 45 lbs. of three
                        atmospheres, &amp;c. Sometimes, how ever, a nomenclature rather different is
                        adopted, and the common steam of boiling water, which exerts no further
                        pressure than merely to balance the atmosphere, is called steam of one
                        atmosphere; and in this case the elastic steam which has been called one
                        atmosphere would be considered as two atmospheres. This nomenclature will be
                        rendered evident by the consideration of the following table :—</p>

                    <p>Owing to this degree of ambiguity in these technical measures of pressure, it
                        is always necessary to observe and to specify whether the pressure spoken of
                        is pressure total, or excess above the atmosphere of air. If, for example,
                        four atmospheres be specified, it must be considered whether four
                        atmospheres above the pressure of the atmosphere be meant, as in the first
                        column of the table, or four atmospheres including the atmospheric air
                        pressure, in which case the number in the second column is meant; for, in
                        the former case, high-pressure steam of 60 lbs. on the square inch is meant,
                        and in the latter high-pressure steam of only 45 lbs. above the
                        atmosphere.</p>
                    <p>Such are some of the various methods by which the elastic force of
                        high-pressure steam in a boiler may he estimated and shown. We have next to
                        consider the manner in which that force may be applied to the useful purpose
                        of forming a high-pressure steam-engine.</p>
                    <p>We have already seen how the force of steam, confined in a close boiler and
                        heated until it acquires great elastic force or high pressure, acts upon
                        every point of the surface in which it is enclosed, tending to press it
                        asunder; and how, by sufficiently confining and heating it, weights of five,
                        fifteen, or fifty pounds, resting on only a single square inch of surface,
                        may be supported and upraised. To apply this force to the raising of great
                        weights, is the object of the high-pressure steam-engine; and it has been
                        calculated that 6 lbs. of coal, applied in heating 6 gallons of water into
                        steam, has sufficient force to perform the most arduous labour of a man, for
                        a whole day.</p>
                    <p>One of the simplest and earliest applications of the force of high-pressure
                        steam to raising weights, is given by Jacob Leupold, in his <hi
                        rend="italic">Theatrum Machinarum Hydraulicarum,</hi> Leipzig, 1725. This we
                        have copied from his work in the accompanying figures. We have already seen
                        that the boiler C, fig. 58, being placed on a fire, the elastic force of the
                        steam will raise a weight resting on an aperture. Now, if we conduct the
                        steam in a pipe into any other vessel, such as the cylindrical tube F, in
                        which there is a piston or movable plug D, on the top of which rests the
                        weight E, by a metallic rod E B, connected with the piston, and passing
                        freely through a hole in the top of the cylinder, it is manifest that when
                        the steam becomes strong enough to overcome the pressure of the weight, it
                        will raise up the piston to any required height. If the weight be 15 lbs ,
                        and the size of the surface of the piston one square inch, and if the
                        pressure of the steam be equal to any thing more than one atmosphere of
                        elastic force, it will overcome the weight and raise it. If the surface of
                        the piston were double the size, or two square inches in extent, then each
                        inch would be acted on by a force of 15 lbs., and the same elastic force
                        acting on two inches would raise double the weight, or 30 lbs., and so on
                        for any number of square inches; so that, if the piston were a circle of
                        four inches in diameter, which would have a surface of about 12 square
                        inches, on each and all of which a pressure of 15 lbs. was sustained, there
                        might be a total weight of 12 times 16 lbs., or 180 lbs., sustained and
                        raised to the top of the cylinder. The boiler being removed from the fire
                        and allowed to cool down again, the piston might again descend, and this
                        operation be repeated as often as necessary.</p>
                    <p>But a more convenient form of this apparatus is that which Leupold gives in
                        the next figure,— in which it is un necessary to remove the fire. The boiler
                        G H, fig. 59, having a constant fire placed under it, the communication with
                        the cylinder ABC takes place through a passage capable of regulation by a
                        stopcock S, which is shown at S as shut by turning the handle T. This
                        stopcock is similar to that commonly used for regulating the flow of liquors
                        in vessels of any kind; a small conical plug S' stops up the passage
                        entirely, but being perforated in one direction, allows the communication to
                        take place whenever that perforation is turned round into such a position as
                        to form a continuation of the channel. By this means it is provided that
                        this stopcock shall remain in the position, S' being closed, until the steam
                        has collected in the boiler a sufficient elastic force, after which it is
                        allowed to pass up into the cylinder, by turning the stopcock into the
                        position S when the steam entering the cylinder pushes up the piston and the
                        piston-rod by which the great weight E is raised as before. The piston will
                        then be allowed to descend to the bottom, by allowing the cylinder gradually
                        to cool, when the weight may again be raised as at first; and so on for any
                        number of operations.</p>
                    <p>But the most perfect of Leupold’s machines is that re presented in the
                        following figures, 60, 61. It is a true water pumping high-pressure
                        steam-engine; a machine which might be efficiently used without any
                        alteration at the present day, only the modern machines are calculated to do
                        the work with a smaller expenditure of fuel. Two pumps for raising water are
                        directly worked by steam, by connecting the handles of the pumps with the
                        pistons of two high-pressure cylinders, in such a manner, that when the
                        pistons are raised by the steam the water is forced up in the pump-pipe. T
                        and V are the barrels of two pumps placed in a reservoir, from which water
                        is raised through the joint-pipe K; G arid H are the handles or levers by
                        which the pumps are worked. The pistons of the steam cylinders C and D are
                        attached to the ends of the levers. In figure 60, at A C the steam is shown
                        in the act of entering into the cylinder C, and pushing up the end of the
                        lever G, so as to force the water; and<pb break="no"
                        facs="ht:chi.28490924&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=754" xml:id="kp-eb0720-0754-0646"
                        /> in figure 61 the steam is shown entering into the cylinder D to work it.
                        This change is effected by turning round the disc A F into the position R S,
                        which reverses the passages, as will appear on examination. It is to be
                        noticed, that while the steam is entering the cylinder C through A C, the
                        steam from the cylinder D is escaping through E F into the open air; and
                        that in the second sketch of the valves, the steam is passing into the
                        cylinder D through A E, and passing out of the cylinder C through C F. The
                        action of this <hi rend="italic">four-way stopcock</hi> is very simple and
                        beautiful, and deserves to be carefully studied. By continually turning it
                        round in one direction, communications are simultaneously effected between
                        the boiler and each of the cylinders alternately, and between each cylinder
                        and the open air. We shall afterwards revert to this mechanism.</p>
                    <p>The modern steam-engine of high pressure is in many respects analogous to the
                        machine of Leupold. It will be readily understood by the study of the few
                        following illustrations. The engine is called double acting, because the
                        steam not only enters the cylinder below the piston to raise it, but also
                        above the piston forcibly to depress it. The boiler B is placed on the left
                        of the figure; the pump, for raising water from the reservoir R to the
                        reservoir R*, is on the right of the figure; and the cylinder is placed in
                        the middle. From the boiler a <hi rend="italic">steam-pipe</hi> S S S<hi
                        rend="superscript">1</hi> S<hi rend="superscript">2</hi> proceeds to the
                        upper and lower parts of the cylinder C; and from the right hand side of the
                        cylinder two short <hi rend="italic">eduction-pipes</hi> E<hi
                        rend="superscript">1</hi> and E<hi rend="superscript">8</hi> carry off the
                        steam into the open air, after it has performed its duty. The piston P is
                        accurately fitted into the cylinder, so as to be air and steam tight, and
                        the piston-rod <hi rend="italic">p</hi> is made to carry with it the end of
                        the lever L F L, and work the pump W W. Perhaps the only difficulty that is
                        felt in understanding the mechanism of the double-acting steam engine, lies
                        in the construction and operation of the valves. S ’ S’ E <hi
                        rend="superscript"> l</hi> E<hi rend="superscript">2</hi> are four plugs,
                        each capable of exactly filling up the passage in which it is placed, like
                        S’ E <hi rend="superscript"> l</hi>, or of being withdrawn from it, like S
                        <hi rend="superscript"> l</hi> E <hi rend="superscript"> s</hi>. Therefore
                        it is evident that in figure 62, the steam has free access through the upper
                        port S <hi rend="superscript"> l</hi>, into the cylinder above the piston,
                        so as to press it down. In fig. 63, the case is shown reversed; the valve
                        S<hi rend="superscript">1</hi> is shut down, allowing steam to enter only by
                        S', the lower-valve, so as to enter at the bottom of the cylinder and force
                        the piston up.</p>
                    <p>The arrangement of the eduction valves E <hi rend="superscript"> l</hi> and
                        E<hi rend="superscript">2</hi> is also to be observed. In fig. 62, where
                        S<hi rend="superscript">1</hi> is open and S<hi rend="superscript">2</hi> is
                        shut, E<hi rend="superscript">2</hi> is also open, and E<hi
                        rend="superscript">1</hi> is shut; so that, while steam enters freely by
                        S<hi rend="superscript">1</hi> on the upper side of the piston, pressing it
                        down, there is a free passage for escape of steam from the under side of the
                        piston, by the bottom passage, through E<hi rend="superscript">2</hi> to the
                        open air; and when the whole is reversed, as in fig. 63, the steam-valve
                        S<hi rend="superscript">2</hi> at the bottom being opened for ingress of
                        steam below the piston, E<hi rend="superscript">1</hi> gives free egress to
                        what was formerly admitted above, so that it may now pass along the passage
                        E<hi rend="superscript">1</hi> into the open air. Thus then, by opening and
                        shutting alternately each of the two pairs of valves, first the under
                        steam-valve and upper eduction-valve, and then the upper steam-valve and
                        under eduction-valve, so as first to allow steam to enter above and escape
                        below, and then to get in below and out above, the one pair being always
                        shut when the others are open, the whole effect is accomplished.</p>
                    <p>It is an object of great importance to the precision of •a machine’s
                        operation, that it should be automatic; that is to say, that it should not
                        require for its successful action the continual attention and unvarying
                        assistance of an attendant. In the machine which we have just described, the
                        valves are opened and shut by the attendant. With the following simple
                        mechanism the valves are opened and shut by the machine itself :—</p>
                    <p>The two valves S<hi rend="superscript">1</hi> and S<hi rend="superscript"
                        >2</hi> are connected together by a straight rod, and the two
                        eduction-valves E<hi rend="superscript">1</hi> E<hi rend="superscript"
                        >2</hi> by another straight rod; these valve-rods are made to rest on
                        opposite ends of a lever <hi rend="italic">I l,</hi> which turns on a centre
                        O. By this simple arrangement it is brought about that the pair of valves
                        S<hi rend="superscript">1</hi> S<hi rend="superscript">2</hi> being
                        depressed, as in fig. 64, the other pair E<hi rend="superscript">1</hi> E<hi
                        rend="superscript">2</hi> are raised; but when, as in fig. 65, S<hi
                        rend="superscript">1</hi> S<hi rend="superscript">2</hi> are raised, E<hi
                        rend="superscript">1</hi> and E<hi rend="superscript">2</hi> are depressed,
                        while at the intermediate position both are situated similarly to each
                        other. In the next place it is to be noticed that the rod E<hi
                        rend="superscript">1</hi> E<hi rend="superscript">2</hi> is prolonged to T
                        upwards, and that it carries two projections fixed to it at M and T. These
                        projections are struck by the lever L L as it rises and falls. When in fig.
                        64, the lever is making its downward stroke, it comes on the plug M; and
                        pushes it down, first into the middle position, and then into the position
                        of fig. 65. The steam then entering below, raises up the piston to the top
                        of the cylinder, and with it raises also the lever, which striking on the
                        upper plug T, carries it upwards, raising the eduction valves E<hi
                        rend="superscript">1</hi> E<hi rend="superscript">2</hi>, and allowing the
                        opposite valves<pb break="no"
                        facs="ht:chi.28490924&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=755" xml:id="kp-eb0720-0755-0647"
                        /> S<hi rend="superscript">1</hi> S<hi rend="superscript">2</hi> to descend
                        into the position of fig. 64, as at first. This operation being repeated, so
                        that at the end of each upward and downward stroke, the descent and ascent
                        of the piston and lever prepare the valves for producing the inverse effect,
                        and giving the next succeeding stroke, the machine becomes independent and
                        automatic. It is rather curious that these simple valves, now described, are
                        the latest improvements that have been introduced in the steam-engine.</p>
                    <p>Considerable ingenuity has been expended on the valves and passages of the
                        steam-engine, for the purpose of forming all these communications by means
                        of a couple of passages, instead of four. The following diagrams are
                        designed to explain the manner in which this has been effected, by means of
                        a four-way cock, similar to that introduced by Leopold into his
                        high-pressure engine. For this purpose the steam-pipe S, the eduction-pipe
                        E, and the pipes of the upper and lower ends of the cylinder, communicating
                        with it above A and below B the piston, are all brought to the circumference
                        of a single circle, so as to form a St George’s cross, as in fig 66. A
                        metallic circular disc O P O B, with two curved channels communicating at
                        successive quadrants of a circle, as shown in fig. G7, is inserted in this
                        circle, so as to fit it exactly, and to be moved round by a protruding
                        handle H. In fig 68, this valve is represented <hi rend="italic">in
                        situ,</hi> a communication being formed from S to A, and the other from B to
                        E; and, in fig. 69, the handle being pushed down a communication is made
                        betwixt S and B, and between A and E. The means of effecting this
                        communication is given in fig. 70.</p>
                    <p>A vertical rod T T<hi rend="superscript">2</hi> being suspended from the end
                        of the great lever, with two plugs T T<hi rend="superscript">2</hi>, by
                        means of which the handle H of the valve is raised, in that position the
                        steam enters at S and passes up through the superior passage into the top of
                        the cylinder, forcing the piston down, while the steam already below the
                        piston finds free egress, along the inferior passage B, through the valve,
                        and escapes at the eduction pipe E into the open air.</p>
                    <p>Just before the piston gets to the bottom of its stroke, the plug T strikes
                        the handle II into the position H<hi rend="superscript">2</hi>. The steam
                        before let in above the piston suddenly escapes by the port A through the
                        valve into the eduction-pipe E, while by the same motion a connexion has
                        been effected between S and B, so that the steam now enters below the
                        piston, again to raise it up until the plug T<hi rend="superscript">2</hi>
                        strikes the handle H<hi rend="superscript">2</hi> upwards once more into the
                        position H as at first, when the piston once more descends; and this process
                        is repeated to the end.</p>
                    <p>We shall next describe a kind of valve which is more commonly in use than
                        either of the former, and by which the changes in the direction of the steam
                        are still more simply effected. In this case all the four passages are
                        united in a square box called a valve-box, or valve-chest, as in fig. 71; S
                        E A B being the steam, eduction, upper, and lower passages. Into this box is
                        introduced a small valve or cover D, fig. 72, which is of such a size as at
                        one time to leave open only one of the three openings on the right; so that,
                        by covering-two of the openings, A and E, as in fig. 73, the steam from S
                        can only find its way through B into the lower part of the engine, while the
                        steam already in the upper part of the cylinder can find its way, below the
                        valve D, into the eduction-pipe E, so as to escape into the air. The valve
                        is next shown in fig. 74 in its middle position, where all the three pas
                        sages are closed, preparatory to reversing the direction of the steam, as in
                        the third position when it slides from the upper part A, as is shown in fig.
                        75, so as to allow the steam to enter above the piston and press it down,
                        while the steam formerly below the piston escapes into the air through the
                        passage B, under the valve D, by the eduction-pipe E. This valve, named from
                        its figure the D-valve, is also worked by the machine itself, either by some
                        of its moving parts striking plugs on a rod which is fixed to the valve, or
                        by some of the other apparatus which will afterwards be described.</p>
                    <p>Another form of valve is that called the long slide or long D-valve, the
                        invention of Mr Murdoch, which gives the advantage of shutting off the
                        steam, close to its ingress into the cylinder; and so saving what in the
                        common short D-slide is lost in the passages from A and B to the ends of the
                        cylinder. It is formed thus. The valve chest extends along the side of the
                        cylinder. It is shown in fig. 76, without the valve. In figure 77 the long
                        D-slide valve is shown separately. It is a pipe extending along the whole
                        length of the cylinder. Towards the ends, this pipe is almost semicircular,
                        its flat side which forms the diameter of the circle, being a narrow flat
                        plate capable of covering the opening or port of the cylinder. This pipe is
                        left open, and perfectly clear from one end to the other, so that steam<pb
                        break="no" facs="ht:chi.28490924&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=756"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0720-0756-0648"/> may traverse it freely lengthwise. The
                        semicircular ends are polished, and rendered truly cylindrical, that the
                        packing in the valve-chest may embrace them perfectly. The steam-pipe is
                        represented as entering the valve-chest from below at S, and the
                        eduction-pipe in the middle as at E. In this valve-chest are placed
                        packing-boxes, as they are called, immediately opposite to the ports of the
                        cylinder. They contain a quantity of soft elastic hemp, soaked in oleaginous
                        matter, the object of which is to press against the outside of the
                        slide-valve when in its place, and make steam-tight partitions in the
                        valve-chest between the middle and ends of the valve, so that no
                        communication of steam can take place between the middle and the two
                        ends.</p>
                    <p>In the figures 78 and 79, the valve is shown <hi rend="italic">in situ.</hi>
                        In figure 79, the steam from S rises up along the centre of the slide, and
                        enters the upper part A, while the steam in the under part of the cylinder
                        has free egress through B to the eduction-pipe E. In figure 78, the steam
                        has free access to the lower part B, while the steam already above the
                        piston has free egress through the port A, through the eduction-pipe E. In
                        this species of slide, there is scarcely any loss of steam in the passages,
                        as it is cut off close to the cylinder.</p>
                    <p>Instead of the long D-slide, which is very heavy on a large scale, two short
                        slides, similar to its two ends, and connected together by bars, have been
                        used in the following form. Fig. 80 is a section of the slide, fig. 81, a
                        face view; and fig. 82, a section of the cylinder with the valves in their
                        place.</p>
                    <p>In this case, however, there are two eduction-pipes E E instead of one, as
                        formerly, and the steam-pipe enters between the valves.</p>
                    <p>A cylindrical slide-valve of the following form is in use in a considerable
                        number of engines, and works well in those cases which we have had an
                        opportunity of examining. The valve-chest is an upright cylindrical pipe P
                        Q, the inside of which is bored truly cylindrical, and is exactly fitted by
                        two metallic cylindrical plugs, which are ground so smooth in their places
                        as to be steam-tight. It will be apparent from the figure that these two
                        plugs being raised and depressed by the valve-rod which connects them, will
                        effect the same purpose as the former valve.</p>
                    <p>The conical valve is a species of valve introduced by Mr Watt, and improved
                        by his assistant Mr Murdoch, from whom the steam-engine of Watt has received
                        many valuable appendages, and much of its practical perfection. It has been
                        applied in two forms. Mr Watt’s own form, the earlier one, is given in the
                        following figures. For a single engine four valves are required. One of them
                        is represented separately in figures 84. 85, which are vertical sections
                        through the valve, at right angles to each other. The valve is shown open in
                        fig. 84, and shut in 85. S is the entrance of the steam, A the port, V the
                        conical valve, and N the seat or nozzle which it covers. On a cursory
                        glance, it is evident that when the conical cover V of the aperture N is up,
                        as in the first diagram, the steam has free entrance; and when it is closed,
                        the steam will merely press the valve down into its seat, without obtaining
                        an escape from the nozzle. The manner in which this is effected for all the
                        passages, is shown in the following perspective diagram, fig. 86. <hi

                        verted, so that these valves open when drawn down wards, while the
                        steam-valves open when drawn upwards. Each valve has a toothed rack attached
                        to it, which is acted on by a toothed sector, fixed on an axis, whose end
                        passes through the valve-box, and carries an arm or handle by which it is
                        moved as follows ;—the arm or handle of the upper steam-valve is connected
                        by the rod 10 with an arm fixed on the axis <hi rend="italic">t</hi>, and
                        the arm on the axis of the lower exhausting valve is also connected by the
                        rod 11 with a similar arm fixed on the same axis <hi rend="italic">t.</hi>
                        The arms of the lower steam-valves and upper exhausting valves are in the
                        same manner connected with arms on the axis <hi rend="italic">u,</hi> by
                        means of the rods 13, 14. These axes <hi rend="italic">t, u,</hi> carry each
                        a handle <hi rend="italic">t r</hi>, <hi rend="italic">u s</hi>; and on
                        these the plugs or chocks 1, 2, 3, 12, of the plug-rod <hi rend="italic"
                        >l,</hi> 12, act. When the plug rod is descending, its chock 1 comes in
                        contact with the handle <hi rend="italic">t r</hi> of the axis <hi
                        rend="italic">t,</hi> and depressing it, turns round the axis <hi
                        rend="italic">t,</hi> so as to shut the upper steam-valve and the lower
                        exhausting valve; and at the same instant its chock 3 comes in contact with
                        the handle <hi rend="italic">us of</hi> the Iower axis <hi rend="italic"
                        >u</hi>, and depressing it, opens the lower steam-valve and the upper
                        exhausting valve. In the upward motion of the plug-tree, the position of the
                        handles arc reversed by the chocks 12, 2. The axis <hi rend="italic">t</hi>
                        carries a short lever 4, to the end of which there is a weight hung through
                        the rod 4 4. When the valves connected with the axis <hi rend="italic"
                        >t</hi> are opened, this weight keeps them open; but is prevented from
                        open<pb break="no" facs="ht:chi.28490924&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=757"

                        rod, as seen in the figure. The lower axis <hi rend="italic">u</hi> has a
                        similar apparatus, 15, 15, for the same purpose. It remains to notice how
                        the exhausting valves are prevented from being opened by the pressure of the
                        steam. The rods which connect the arms on the axes of the valves with the
                        arms on the axes <hi rend="italic">t u</hi>, it will he observed, are bent
                        at one extremity in such a manner as that when the valves are shut, the
                        connecting rods and the arms on the axes <hi rend="italic">t</hi> and <hi
                        rend="italic">u</hi> fall into the same straight line, as is seen in the
                        case of the upper exhausting valve in the figure. In this condition the arms

                        these axes round, and the valves are thus effectually locked un til released

                        and bottom eduction-valves. The steam valves <hi rend="italic">b</hi> and
                        <hi rend="italic">e</hi> are raised or lowered by hollow rods or tubes,
                        through which the spindles or rods of the eduction valves <hi rend="italic"
                        >h i</hi> work freely without interference. A rod 10 joins the short levers
                        19, 20 of the valves <hi rend="italic">b e</hi> together, and another rod 13
                        joins the levers of the valves 18 and 21 together; so that by inserting into
                        sockets, formed on the ends of the levers 20 21, the bars <hi rend="italic"
                        >r s,</hi> shown by dotted lines, and by using them as lever handles, the
                        upper steam and lower eduction-valves are opened simultaneously by the
                        handle <hi rend="italic">r,</hi> and by the other lever s the lower steam
                        and upper eduction-valves are opened also stmultaneously and alternately
                        with the former. The rods 10 and 13 are connected by the rods 11 and 12,
                        with an apparatus of levers and weights, acting through an axis at 22, by
                        which the valves are retained in their seats.</p>
                    <p>The last valve which we shall describe is the crown valve, or
                        equilibrium-valve, which is in use on the Cornish engine, and has also been
                        introduced into rotative engines by Mr Fairbairn, and Messrs Caird &amp;
                        Co., and which deserves to be better known than it is. Its value consists in
                        effecting a large opening, and requiring little force to work it, while
                        large valves of the common sort are heavy, or are so much pressed in one
                        direction by the steam as to require great force to work them. The valve has
                        been called the crown-valve, from the resemblance of its appearance to that
                        of a diadem. Let there be conceived a chamber, fig. 89, out of which an
                        aperture A leads into the cylinder, and into which a pipe S brings steam.
                        The aperture A is surrounded by an upright ring or collar rising a few
                        inches into the chamber, which ring is on all sides perforated by slits of
                        considerable size, but closed at the top. The next figure, 90, represents
                        the crown or cover of this valve, which is also a ring attached to a steel
                        rod or spindle, by which it is raised or depressed. All round at top and
                        bottom, the collar in the chamber and the crown-valve are ground, so as
                        accurately to fit each other. The next diagram, fig. 91, represents the
                        valve on its seat, and closed on all sides, so that no steam can find
                        admittance; and fig. 92 represents it open or raised up from its seat, with
                        steam entering freely on every side.</p>
                    <p>These valves are arranged in a manner similar to the common conical valves,
                        and work in the same way, four of them being used in a single engine,
                        instead of four conical valves as in fig. 86. The following diagram shows
                        the valves and valvegear of a Cornish steam-engine, with the gear for
                        working the valves either by the hand or with the pump-rod of the
                        steam-engine. It is very perfect, and deserves the study of the intelligent
                        en gineer. The valves are equilibrium valves, such as we have already
                        described. Although we cannot here enter into a detailed description of the
                        mechanism, the engineer will at once understand it from the drawing.<pb

                        xml:id="kp-eb0720-0758-0650"/> In immediate connexion with the valves and
                        passages of a steam-engine, which admit the steam on alternate sides of the
                        piston to do its work, and afterwards dis charge it, we may consider the
                        means by which the engine is rendered automatic, or capable of performing
                        its labour in the most perfect manner, without the continual assistance of a
                        man to open and shut its valves. There are two ways in which valves are
                        worked by the steam-engine itself. The first of these is by the agency of
                        some part of the engine that happens to move up and down, or perform a
                        reciprocating motion, and the other is by the agency of some part of the
                        engine which revolves. The following is a simple method, which we have seen
                        applied to the short D slide, already described. In figure 95, A B P is the
                        cylinder, P the pis ton, acting on the end L, of a great lever L L<hi
                        rend="superscript">2</hi>, raising and depressing it alternately, while the
                        other end L<hi rend="superscript">2</hi>, united by a connecting rod L<hi
                        rend="superscript">2</hi> R to the handle or crank of a Iarge wheel, turns
                        it round. The manner in which the steam-valves are moved is by the long
                        vertical bar T T, suspended from the lever L L<hi rend="superscript">2</hi>,
                        so as to move up and down with it. This bar T T carries two projecting plugs
                        of wood s s<hi rend="superscript">2</hi> upon it, which strike alternately
                        up and down the handle <hi rend="italic">l l</hi><hi rend="italic
                        superscript"> 2</hi> at the bottom and top of the stroke, and so produce the
                        reciprocating motion of the slide valve D,and by admitting the steam on
                        alternate sides of the piston, and discharging it at the opposite ports,
                        produce the continuous motion of the engine. In the figure, the steam is
                        represented in the act of forcing down the piston; but when the piston gets
                        near the bottom, the plug <hi rend="italic">s</hi> will have come in contact
                        with the valve-rod <hi rend="italic">l l</hi><hi rend="italic superscript">
                        2</hi><hi rend="italic">,</hi> and will have forced it and the slide valve D
                        into the opposite position, and so permitted the steam, formerly above the
                        piston, to pass into the open air, while the steam on the<pb break="no"
                        facs="ht:chi.28490924&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=759" xml:id="kp-eb0720-0759-0651"
                        /> other side presses up the piston, so as to bring the plug s<hi
                        rend="superscript">2</hi>, in contact with the lever, pressing it up, and
                        the valve D down into its first position, and so on alternately.</p>
                    <p>This first plan of moving the valves by means of a plug frame, rising and
                        falling with the alternate strokes of the piston, has been principally
                        adopted for pumping engines that have no revolving motion. We have, how
                        ever, seen it adopted with ndvantage even in marine engines. It is noisy, as
                        the sudden strokes of the prime mover produce an instant jerk, but it is
                        effective, in so far as it at once opens the ports to their fullest extent,
                        and so allows full effect to the entering steam, and full clearance to that
                        escaping. The form in which we have seen it adopted in marine engines is as
                        follows. The piston was kept in its true position by moving along two guide
                        bars G G, on which it rested, through a cross bar H H; O P and O P are the
                        cranks of the revolving axis; R R is a rod connecting the piston-rod with
                        the ends of the cranks which it turns round. The valve-rod <hi rend="italic"
                        >r r</hi> is extended upwards as far as the piston-rod works, and two plugs
                        r <hi rend="italic">τ</hi> are so placed by adjusting screws, as to admit of
                        the rod being raised and depressed at the proper moment by a projecting part
                        of the crossbar H, at the end of each upward and downward stroke.</p>
                    <p>A very beautiful method of working the valves of the steam-engine has been
                        recently invented by Mr. Melling, the superintendent of locomotive engines
                        on the Liver pool and Manchester railway, and applied with perfect success.
                        It consists in deriving the motion of the valves neither from the
                        rectilineal nor the circular motions of the machine, but from the
                        connecting-rod, one end of which rod moves round in the circle of the crank,
                        while the other end performs a rectilineal, or a circular reciprocating
                        motion. Before entering on the consideration of this motion, it may he well
                        to attend to the curve which a point in the connecting-rod describes.</p>
                    <p>The curve, Fig. 97, is manifestly a curve resembling the ellipse, although by
                        no means a correct ellipse. It is an oval, one end of which is more oblate,
                        and the other more elongated, depending on the length of the connecting rod,
                        and deviating more and more from a true ellipse, as the connecting-rod
                        becomes shorter. In the centre of this oval, Mr. Melling places an axis,
                        having a projecting arm, and in the connecting-rod there is placed a round
                        projecting pin, which carries with it a radius arm from a fixed axis in the
                        centre of the oval. This axis again carries another arm, or small crank,
                        which is turned round with the axis, and is attached to the valve-rod, which
                        it moves just as in the case of the eccentric. This motion has several good
                        qualitics. It is said to continue longer in perfectly good order than the
                        common eccentric motion, and it is said to save steam. This last fact we are
                        disposed to question. The motion exaggerates the properties of the
                        eccentric. </p>
                    <p>One of the commonest of the many applications of the steam-engine is to
                        produce the revolving motion of an axle and wheel, and in the second system
                        of valve appa ratus, by which the steam-engine is rendered automatic, the
                        reciprocating motion of the steam valves is derived from the continuous
                        revolving motion of one of the shafts or wheels. Of the various methods in
                        which this has been done, the following are some examples.</p>
                    <p>On the axis O, fig. 98, which is turned round by the rod LR so as to make one
                        complete revolution during each alternate ascent and descent of the piston,
                        and at the centre O, is placed a smaller axis, carrying round a cam or
                        projection with it. A square frame s<hi rend="superscript">1</hi> s<hi

                        >s</hi><hi rend="italic superscript"> 4</hi> encloses this cam. As the axis
                        turns round, the cam comes into such positions as to bear upon the bars s<hi

                        alternately, <hi rend="italic">s e v</hi> is a small crank, to which the
                        motion of the frame is applied so as to make it move round its centre <hi
                        rend="italic">e</hi>, and so to raise the point <hi rend="italic">v,</hi>
                        and the valve rod <hi rend="italic">v v</hi> up and down, giving the valve
                        to which it is attached a reciprocating motion. The different positions into
                        which the frame is forced by the cam are sketched in figs. 99, 100, 101.</p>
                    <p>Another form in which this motion has been given, is by connecting the large
                        axle of the crank with a smaller one by toothed wheels, thus :—</p>
                    <p>The principal or crank axis carries round a wheel <hi rend="italic">a b
                        c</hi> whose teeth give motion to the equal wheel <hi rend="italic">d e

                        which the crank is connected by the rod E <hi rend="italic">s,</hi> so as to
                        raise and depress the valve-rod. It is manifest, that during the revolution
                        of the wheels <hi rend="italic">a b c</hi> and <hi rend="italic">d e f</hi>
                        the point E will be carried round a circle, and communicate alternate motion
                        to the rod E <hi rend="italic">s,</hi> equal in extent to the diameter<pb

                        be chosen of a diameter equal to the required motion or threw of the steam
                        valves attached to the cylinder.</p>
                    <p>This motion has been modified into a very excellent and durable arrangement
                        in the following form.</p>
                    <p>Here the toothed wheels are as in the former figure, and the eccentric pin or
                        crankpin is car ried round by the inner one. On the crankpin is a square
                        brass nut or collar, made to fit exactly a space left between two parallel
                        bars S<hi rend="superscript">1</hi> S<hi rend="superscript">2</hi> and S<hi
                        rend="superscript">3</hi> S<hi rend="superscript">4</hi> that are kept <hi
                        rend="italic">in situ</hi> by means of nuts and screws at their extremities,
                        and capable of adjustment. S<hi rend="superscript">3</hi> and S<hi
                        rend="superscript">4</hi> are connected with the straight bar S<hi
                        rend="superscript">5</hi> and S<hi rend="superscript">6</hi>, which works
                        steadily through the collars S<hi rend="superscript">5</hi> and S<hi
                        rend="superscript">6</hi>, and from its end a connecting link S<hi
                        rend="superscript">6</hi> and S<hi rend="superscript">7</hi> passes to work
                        the crank and valve-rod S <hi rend="italic">c v</hi>. This apparatus we have
                        seen work well without repair for a long period. It was executed by the
                        Messrs Carmichael of Dundee. Figs. 104, 105, 106, show the apparatus in
                        three other positions.</p>
                    <p>Another mode of prod icing the motion of the valves is by a projection in the
                        great axis of the engine itself. A rigid circular hoop S encloses the axle
                        as in figs. 107, 108, 109, 110. lt is evident that if the projection E be
                        just equal to the radius of the hoop the axle will revolve without producing
                        motion in the hoop; but, if on the contrary, the axle and its projection be
                        equal to the diameter of the hoop, as in the figs. 107, 108, 109, 110, it is
                        apparent that the projection or cam, in passing round, must push the hoop in
                        alternate directions.</p>
                    <p>But that modification of this principle, which is in by far the most general
                        use, is in the form called “the eccentric.” The eccentric is a circular
                        disc, or ring of metal placed upon the shaft or axis, turned by the crank.
                        O, fig. Ill, is the centre of the shaft or axis, to which revolution is
                        given by the crank R of the steam-engine. On this axis the circular disc E E
                        E is placed, but eccentric to it, so that its centre <hi rend="italic"
                        >d</hi> moves round the axis. The distance of the centre <hi rend="italic"
                        >d</hi> of the disc from the centre O of the axis, is called the
                        eccentricity, and it is equal to half the throw or range of the motion of
                        the valves to he moved by the eccentric. The rod, fig. 112, is called the
                        eccentric rod, and is attached to a hoop or circle that exactly fits the
                        eccentric disc. The various positions which the eccentric will take during
                        the revolution of the engine, is shown in the succeeding figures.</p>
                    <p>We have used the common eccentric in a much simpler form than that generally
                        adopted, by placing it immediately over the valve which it moves. In engines
                        which require compactness and simplicity, this way is useful, and is
                        valuable where the axis of rotation is immediately over the valves,
                        thus:—</p>
                    <p>The valve-rod, figs. 117. 118., branches out into four portions; a flat brass
                        plate is inserted at their separation, an<pb break="no"
                        facs="ht:chi.28490924&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=761" xml:id="kp-eb0720-0761-0653"
                        /> other at the summit unites them. The eccentric disc works between the
                        side forks of the ro∣l, and bears against its top and bottom plates, as seen
                        in fig. 117. The other forks of the rod are made, in width, equal to the
                        diameter of the axle, which thus prevents the rod from deviating from the
                        vertical position as seen in fig. 118; a handle is added to work by hand,
                        and the reversing process is performed as usual.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic">The Crank —</hi> One of the most important appendages of
                        the steam-engine is the crank, by means of which the force of steam,
                        although at first producing motion only upwards and downwards in the right
                        line of the axis of the cylinder, is nevertheless rendered capable of
                        exerting that force equally well in a circular direction. When the
                        steam-engine is only employed for some such purpose as pumping up water, no
                        crank is necessary, but as some of the most usual and valuable applications
                        of the steam-engine are those where it turns wheels of mills, cotton
                        machinery, steam-vessels, or locomotive engines, the crank, by which this is
                        accomplished in an admirable and simple manner, which has superseded every
                        other plan of trans mission, is entitled to very minute consideration.</p>
                    <p>A crank is an elementary machine which has been used from the earliest times
                        for the purpose of converting a revolving into a rectilineal motion, or the
                        reverse. It is figured in the old machines of the Egyptians, Chinese,
                        Greeks, and Romans, and in water machinery it has been in common use from
                        the time of Ctesebius.</p>
                    <p>A crank is merely a handle to a wheel, by which it may be turned round. Let
                        <hi rend="italic">a</hi> x be an axis of a wheel <hi rend="italic">b c d,
                        a</hi> R P the usual bent (or crooked) handle, by which it is turned round
                        by the man, whose arm first pushes it from him, and then draws it towards
                        him, and so continually turns the “wheel round, then the part <hi
                        rend="italic">a</hi> R radiating from the centre, is called the crank, the
                        axis <hi rend="italic">a</hi> x is called the crank-axle, and the straight
                        part PR is called the crank-pin.</p>
                    <p>Now imagine, instead of a man’s arm, a rigid metallic connecting-rod, and
                        instead of the strength of his body, conceive the force of steam to be
                        applied through a cylinder piston and piston-rod to the crank by means of
                        the connecting-rod, and the steam will produce the revolution of the wheel
                        by means of the crank, axle, and pin, as in the figure, A the cylinder, <hi
                        rend="italic">p</hi> the piston-rod, <hi rend="italic">p</hi> R the
                        connecting rod, R the crank, and <hi rend="italic">a x</hi> the axis.</p>
                    <p>On examining, in detail, the action of the crank, it is to be observed that
                        the force exerted by the steam is neither continuous in direction nor in
                        action. If the steam be admitted first below the piston, it forces it to the
                        top of the cylinder; it is then cut off preparatory to its being admitted
                        above the piston; and in the interval it has no motive action. When admitted
                        above the piston, it forces it to the bottom of the cylinder; and again
                        there is a cessation in its action during the change in the position of the
                        valve. Now it is evident that this recurring cessation of action between the
                        alternating impulses, would prevent the production of continuous revolution
                        in the wheel, but for the power of the wheel itself of continuing the
                        motion, by what is termed the momentum of its mass. When the steam, during a
                        stroke of the machine, is acting most powerfully on the piston, part of its
                        power is absorbed in giving motion to the wheel; and when, at the end of the
                        stroke, it ceases for a time to act, the wheel gives out the power which it
                        had absorbed, and continues its motion until the next stroke gives it a
                        fresh accession of power. A wheel of this kind, when attached to an axle for
                        the purpose of equalizing motion, is termed a fly wheel; and to obtain the
                        full benefits of its equal zing power, it is made of large diameter, that
                        its rim may move rapidly, and it is made of great weight, being formed
                        either of lead or iron, that it may acquire momentum to render the motion ns
                        uniform as possible.</p>
                    <p>Still, however, it must be remembered, that the equalization of the motion
                        produced by the flywheel is partial, not perfect. Matter only takes up or
                        gives out force when it changes from one velocity to a different one. If,
                        therefore, the flywheel take up into itself the accession of force of the
                        steam at one part of the stroke, it does so by slightly accelerating its
                        motion; and if it give out force during the cessation of the stroke, it is
                        by slightly reducing its own velocity in so doing. The approximation to
                        perfect uniformity in the motion of the steam-engine, will be proportioned
                        to the mass of matter in the rim of the wheel and to the square of the
                        wheel’s velocity. Although, therefore, the flywheel improves the action of
                        the crank, so as to make it perfectly adapted to all ordinary purposes,
                        still the effect is not so equable as the power of a waterwheel, where <hi
                        rend="italic">extreme</hi> delicacy is re quired. In all ordinary cases it
                        is sufficiently uniform.</p>
                    <p>The following substitute for a fly-wheel was suggested and constructed by Mr
                        Buckle of Soho, for Mr Lucy of Birmingham, and is an admirable and elegant
                        substitute or auxiliary; so as to be, for even the most delicate operations,
                        practically perfect. Mr Lucy had constructed at Birmingham a flour mill
                        driven by steam; and it had been his object to obtain perfection without any
                        limitation of expense. He had got one of Bolton and Watt’s best
                        steam-engines, and yet he found that his mill neither produced such perfect
                        flour nor moved so smoothly as mills driven by water. On the contrary, it
                        was found that the irregularity of the motion produced a larger quantity of
                        coarse than of fine flour, at a mercantile loss to the owner; and it was
                        likewise found that the irregular pro pulsion <hi rend="italic">a tergo</hi>
                        interfering with the uniform motion, to wards which the millstones tended by
                        their own momentum, produced a clanging reciprocation along the whole line
                        of toothed gearing, which was most injurious, and rapidly destructive to the
                        toothed wheels. When we visited the spot in 1838, the ruins of former
                        wheels, most unequally worn and totally destroyed, were strewed about the
                        yard. The usual plan of increasing the weight of the fly-wheel was resorted
                        to without success; and Mr Lucy applied to Mr Buckle to propose a remedy for
                        the evil. This remedy Mr Buckle found in the very simple contrivance of a
                        pneumatic pump. In the mint at Soho a pneumatic pump had been introduced by
                        Mr Watt, for the purpose of producing a reaction, on the principle of the
                        experiments of Otto Guericke, which we have already de scribed. The force of
                        the steam-engine was made to draw up a piston from the bottom of a cylinder,
                        leaving a va\cuum below it. Into this vacuum the piston was again carried
                        down, after the action of the steam had ceased, by the whole force of the
                        atmosphere, amounting to about 15 lbs. on every inch of its surface. Thus
                        the atmosphere was rendered a reservoir of power, the power being first of
                        all taken up by forming the vacuum, and again given<pb break="no"

                        /> out by the atmosphere pressing the piston down into the vacuum.</p>
                    <p>The following is the arrangement by which Mr Buckle accomplished the object
                        which he had in view. P, fig. 121, being the usual piston and cylinder of
                        the steam-engine, L L the usual lever, L R the connecting rod, R O the
                        crank, and R W W W a toothed wheel carried round by the crank, as usual in
                        the steam-engine: there is added <hi rend="italic">r w w</hi> a smaller
                        wheel of half the number of the teeth of the other, so that during a
                        semi-revolution of the small wheel, the large one performs a quarter of a
                        revolution; <hi rend="italic">l I</hi> is a second lever to which there is
                        attached a piston rod L H, carrying a piston from top to bottom of an open
                        cylinder H. When the piston is at the bottom of the cylinder H, the crank R
                        is near the point 1 in the figure. While the crank passes from 1 to 2, it is
                        raising the piston in the pump, and against the pressure of the atmosphere,
                        the steam exerting its greatest force; but when the crank reaches point 2,
                        the little wheel <hi rend="italic">w w τ</hi> is at the bottom of its
                        circuit, the piston in the pump is at the top; and now the pressure of the
                        atmosphere carries the piston down into H, turning the little wheel <hi
                        rend="italic">r w w</hi> along with it, and propelling the large wheel and
                        crank from 2 to 3, through that part of the stroke where there is a
                        cessation of the action of the steam: then again from 3 to 4 the excess of
                        the power of the steam is employed in raising the pump piston; while from 4
                        to 1 the piston of the pump, carried down by atmospheric pressure, brings
                        round the mechanism once more to the point 1.</p>
                    <p>So perfect was the action of this mechanism that the flywheel had been wholly
                        removed, and the engine and the whole millwork were moving in the most
                        smooth and effective manner. It was found that the change enabled them to
                        give all the grinding stones a greater velo city than formerly, so that the
                        quantity ground was greater, in the proportion of 56 to 52, and the quantity
                        of the finest or first flour, from the same wheat was like wise much
                        increased; so that, both by quantity and qua city, the owner of that mill
                        was now able to “command the market.” The same motion has subsequently been
                        applied to cotton-mills with perfect success; the quality and the quantity
                        of yarn produced being much improved.</p>
                    <p>From the circumstance already noticed, that at one point the steam possesses
                        no power of giving revolution to the crank, it has been imagined that some
                        considerable Ioss of the power of the steam takes place during the
                        transmission of its moving force through the crank. This is a grave error,
                        and it has produced other errors, which we shall consider in our chapter on
                        rotatory steam-engines.</p>
                    <p>Figs. 122 to 125 re present the crank in different positions. In figs. 122,
                        125 the connecting rod and crank are in the same straight line, technically
                        called the position “on the centre,” or passing the line of centres, in
                        which the action of the crank neither tends to produce motion in the one
                        direction nor the other. Again, at M and N, figs. 123, 124, where the crank
                        is represented as acted upon at right angles by the connecting-rod, it is
                        plain that the whole force transferred through the rod is acting to produce
                        the effective motion of the crank; while in the intermediate positions there
                        are two effects produced, one acting on the centre of the crank, and another
                        acting to give it revolution. For the purpose of examining the proportion of
                        these forces to each other, we may use the two following diagrams:</p>
                    <p>Fig. 126 represents the circle of the crank, the ar <hi rend="smallcaps"
                        >γows</hi> showing the direction in which the crank-rod would require to
                        act, in order that all its force should be undivided, and produce alone the
                        single effect of causing revolution. Fig. 127 indicates the deviation which
                        the actual motion of the crank exhibits from this hypothetical condition.
                        The arrow <hi rend="italic">a</hi> indicates the direction of the action of
                        the connecting-rod, which at divisions 10 and 20 is acting only towards the
                        centre of the circle with no effect in producing revolution. At divisions 5
                        and 15, the whole effect takes place in producing revolution only. Through
                        the first half of the circle the pressure of the rod acts wholly downwards,
                        and through the latter half of the stroke wholly upwards. The circumference
                        of the circle being divided into 20 equal parts, the analysis of the force
                        is given in the figure at several of these points. At the second division,
                        <hi rend="italic">a</hi> re presents the direction of action of the
                        crank-rod, <hi rend="italic">b</hi> is parallel to the direction of the
                        circumference (or tangent) of the circle at that point, while the line <hi
                        rend="italic">c</hi> is directed to the centre; <hi rend="italic">a</hi>
                        indicating the direction of the whole force of the connecting-rod, <hi
                        rend="italic">b</hi> representing the effect produced in the direction of
                        the tangent to turn it round, and <hi rend="italic">c</hi> the effect of the
                        force of the connecting-rod acting to produce pressure on the centre of the
                        crank; but as the centre of the crank is fixed and prevented from moving,
                        none of the moving power of the crank is given out in producing motion
                        towards the centre, but only in producing motion in the circumference. At
                        the fourth division of the circumference, it may be observed, that the
                        effect of the connecting-rod is differently distributed. The whole force <hi
                        rend="italic">a</hi> is now more nearly in the direction of <hi
                        rend="italic">b,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">c</hi> is comparatively small;
                        showing that as we approach the end of the first quarter revolution, the
                        force of the connecting-rod is producing much less pressure in the centre of
                        the crank, and pressing in a higher proportion in the direction of the
                        revolving effect, until at last the connecting-rod being at right angles to
                        the crank, its whole pressure acting to turn round the crank, none of it is
                        directed towards the centre. After passing the quadranted point 5, the
                        crank-rod still presses downwards, as shown by the arrow <hi rend="italic"
                        >a</hi> at point 7; but, at its two effective pressures, one represented by
                        <hi rend="italic">b</hi> still acts in turning round the crank, while
                        another represented by <hi rend="italic">c,</hi> instead of acting towards
                        the centre, as in the upper quadrant, now produces a pressure which would
                        draw the crank away from the centre; but as the crank is fixed, none of the
                        motive power is employed in producing any motion of the crank away from its
                        centre. Similar alternating effects are produced through the other
                        quadrants; so that, while the pressure of the steam, acting through the
                        connecting-rod upon the extremity of the crank, is divid ed into two
                        effects, one of these is prevented from expending the moving force of the
                        engine by the fixed ness of the crank centre, and the whole motive power is
                        given out only at the circumference of the crank circle in turning it round,
                        but in a proportion of pressure<pb break="no"

                    <p>The mean pressure on the crank being in the table about 63 pounds, taken on
                        an average of the whole circumference of the circle, the pressure varies
                        from 36 pounds above the mean, to 63 pounds below it. The total pres sure of
                        the steam in the cylinder, forces the connecting rod up and down through a
                        space equal, each time, to the diameter of the circle, while the
                        connecting-rod carries the crank through a space which is equal to the whole
                        circumference; and as the circumference of a circle bears to twice its
                        diameter an approximate ratio of 100 to 03, it follows, that the pressures
                        on the crank and piston are inversely as the spaces through which they move;
                        the motive power of steam in the cylinder being 100 lbs. moved through a
                        space of 03, and the motive power given out in the crank, being a mean of
                        about 63 lbs. moved through the circumference of a circle which is
                        represented by 100, so that the motive power is in the one case 100 lbs. ×
                        63 = 6300 lbs., and in the other case 03 lbs. × 100 = 6300 lbs.</p>
                    <p>The crank is merely one beautiful exemplification of the great dynamical
                        principle, which includes in it the law of operation of all the elements of
                        machinery, “that in uniform motions the quantities of motive power, or <hi
                        rend="italic">vis viva,</hi> may be transferred from one point to another,
                        through every variety of direction, velocity, and intensity, by material
                        mechanism, without being thereby altered in quantity, except in so far as
                        friction and imperfect rigidity may diminish its amount by a certain
                        percentage, which diminution it is the aim of all perfect construction and
                        design, in the practical application of machinery, to <hi rend="italic"
                        >reduce</hi> to the smallest possible amount.” To render uniform the
                        effective pressure given out by the crank, is the object of the flywheel,
                        and of the pneumatic pump of Mr Buckle. For the same purpose many other
                        expedients have been devised; and the following explanation is intend ed to
                        facilitate the comprehension of the nature and value of these
                        expedients.</p>
                    <p>The variation of pressure on the crank of a steam engine, may be conveniently
                        represented by curves.</p>
                    <p>Let the circumference of the circle described by the crank be represented by
                        the straight line A X, fig. 128, and divided into any number of equal parts;
                        let straight lines <hi rend="italic">y</hi><hi rend="italic superscript">
                        1</hi> y<hi rend="superscript">2</hi><hi rend="italic">y</hi><hi
                        rend="italic superscript"> 3</hi> &amp;c., be drawn to represent the amount
                        of pressure converted into the direction of the motion of the crank,
                        according to the line <hi rend="italic">b</hi> in fig. 127, being the
                        amounts represented in the line of figures, then the curved line A <hi
                        rend="italic">y y y x</hi> passing through the summit of all these lines
                        will represent the variation in the power of the crank at each instant of
                        time, each ordinate <hi rend="italic">y</hi><hi rend="italic superscript">
                        1</hi> y<hi rend="superscript">2</hi><hi rend="italic">y</hi><hi
                        rend="superscript"> 3</hi> being the pressure, and the area of the whole
                        figure will repre sent the whole motive power, having a maximum of <hi
                        rend="italic">y</hi><hi rend="italic superscript"> 5</hi> and y <hi
                        rend="superscript"> 15</hi>, and a point of change of direction from
                        pressure one way to pressure the opposite way at <hi rend="italic">y</hi><hi
                        rend="superscript"> 10</hi>.</p>
                    <p>Now one method of equalizing the rotative pressure on the crank has been
                        proposed, and is very generally adopted, viz. to make two steam-engines act
                        on the same axis by means of two cranks at right angles to each other, so
                        that when the one ceases to exert force, the other may he at its point of
                        greatest force.</p>
                    <p>Thus in the figures 129 to 132 two cranks are represented as coming from two
                        cylinders, and attached to the same axis, so that when the one of them is at
                        0, the other is at 5, when the first is at 5 the second is at 10, and so on;
                        so that while either is on the line of cessation of force, the other is at
                        the point of maximum.</p>
                    <p>The joint effect of two such cranks may be represented by curves in the
                        following way:—</p>
                    <p>Let the circumference of each crank circle be represented by the lines A X
                        and A<hi rend="superscript">2</hi> X<hi rend="superscript">2</hi> as
                        formerly, each semi circumference being divided into eight parts, and let
                        the pressure be calculated from a table of sines, where each will be found
                        as the sine of the arch of the circumference to which it corresponds; the
                        numbers thus obtained being arranged on the right of the figures, so as to
                        obtain by the two curves the representation of the varying quantity of
                        force, but without regarding the reversion of direction. If now we place
                        these curves together, as in fig. 135, their whole ordinates taken across
                        from the one curve to the other, will truly represent the amount of the sum
                        of the forces and its variation; and if we place all these ordinates from a
                        fourth axis, we shall have truly represented, by the new curve fig. 136, the
                        variations of the sum of the forces of the two cranks. The figures in the
                        third column represent the sums of the ordinates, in which it is shown that
                        the maximum is 41 per cent greater than the minimum pressure, even when
                        two<pb break="no" facs="ht:chi.28490924&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=764"

                    <p>Hence the point of greatest pressure is at 45° from the minimum, and the
                        minimum sums at the termination of each quadrant, the maximum being to the
                        minimum as the square root of 2 to unity.</p>
                    <p>It is obvious then, in conclusion, that with two engines the variation above
                        the mean, amounts to about 12,6— 141 = 15 in 126, or about eleven per cent,
                        and that the decrease below the mean amounts to twenty percent.</p>
                    <p>It is a matter of some difficulty to decide at what angle the cranks should
                        be placed in a double engine, so as to give the best effect. If we place
                        them at a greater angle than 90° apart, the minima become small, and the
                        maxima, however, are by no means sudden. If we place them at a less angle,
                        the maxima become excessive; and although the minima be larger, the maxima
                        are also larger. The following diagrams, 137, 138, show the effect of these
                        two methods.</p>
                    <p>When a lever intervenes between the crank-rod and the piston-rod, new
                        irregularities are introduced. The variation in the direction of the
                        connecting link, and in the position of the lever-ends from a straight line,
                        introduces modifications of these effects of a serious nature, hut not of a
                        large amount. It is worthy the attention of practical men to consider these
                        variations, and the manner in which they affect the uniformity of the
                        pressure. They affect it by way of increase at the beginning and end of the
                        stroke. By proper arrangements these very obliquities may he rendered very
                        considerable improvements in the working of the engine. It should also he
                        observed that the stroke of the piston and crank will not remain of the same
                        length.</p>
                    <p>The agency of the crank in transmitting a force parallel to the piton rod has
                        been represented by the curve of sines, as in fig.139.</p>
                    <p>But if we represent, in a similar way, the pressures produced by the obiquity
                        of the crank rod, we shall find the form become that given in the following
                        figures.</p>
                    <p>Fig. 140 represents the variation of pressuro with a crank-rod of four times
                        the length of the crank, fig. 141 with a crank-rod of double the length of
                        the crank, and fig. 142 with a crank-rod equal to the length of the
                        crank.</p>
                    <p>It is obvions, that with the shortening of the crank rod, the irregularity of
                        the motion becomes very great. Two maxima rapidly succeed each other, and
                        these are wide apart from the next pair. Thus two violent pressures succeed
                        at a short interval, and a long pause intervenes, when the force is very
                        small.</p>
                    <p>By the same system of curves we may proceed to ex amine the pneumatic
                        equalizer of Mr Buckle. Let the rotative pressure of the crank be again
                        represented, as formerly, by the curve in fig. 143. And let the rotative
                        pressure of the pneumatic crank of the equalizer be re presented by the
                        curve in fig. 144, lying on alternate sides of the axis, so as to show the
                        alternate coincidence with, or opposition to, the action of the steam-crank.
                        Then if we place the two axes as in fig. 145, the lines between the two
                        curves will represent the sums of the pressures; and if we set off these
                        intercepted parts in a third curve, we shall get the line representing the
                        variation of the resulting force, corresponding to the sums and differences
                        of the former ordinates. The values of these are given in columns of figures
                        on the right through one quadrant. The mean value 03 is in this case
                        exceeded by 19 per cent, and is receded from below by nearly 20 per cent.
                        The deviation from the mean pressure is not, therefore, greater than 20 per
                        cent, and the equalization produced by Mr Buckle’s pneumatic equalizer is as
                        sufficient as a pair of engines, and much less complicated and
                        expensive.</p>
                    <p>Still, however, it is to he noticed, that as there is a variation of force
                        amounting to about 20 per cent above or below the mean, with a pair of
                        engines as well as with the pneumatic reservoir of power, it is obvious that
                        the combination of a flywheel with either of these systems of arrangement,
                        would be required to obtain the nearest possible approximation to uniformity
                        in cases of delicacy.<pb break="no"

                        /> Instead of using two cranks for the purpose of applying the force of two
                        steam-engines to the same axis of revolution, two engines have been used
                        with their cylinders laid at right angles to each other, and having their
                        connecting∙ro∣ls applied to the same crank. For an engine of this kind, fig.
                        147, Mr. Brunel obtained a patent; and we have seen his machine working in a
                        satisfactory manner. An arrangement of a similar description has also been
                        introduced in steamboats by M. Cave of Paris.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic">Of the connecting-rod and Parallel Motion.—</hi> In
                        considering the agency of the crank in modifying the force and velocity of
                        steam, so as to connect its direction and distribute its force in the manner
                        required to produce a rotative motion in the machinery, from the original
                        reciprocating motion of the piston in the cylinder, we have hitherto avoided
                        the introduction of another important element, by which a further variation
                        of force and of motion is produced. The connecting-rod is a rigid bar of
                        metal which conveys the motion of the piston from the pis ton-rod to the
                        crank either immediately or through the interposition of the lever or beam;
                        and as the connecting-rod, in doing so, takes various directions different
                        from those either of the piston-rod or of the crank, there is an obliquity
                        of pressure produced at both extremities of the connecting-rod, which gives
                        rise to a variation of force and of direction, which must be practically
                        provided for, and carefully appreciated in quantity, in so far as it may
                        affect the ultimate operation of the machine.</p>
                    <p>There are two ways in which the motion of the piston-rod is most commonly
                        transferred to the crank; either immediately through the connecting-rod, as
                        in fig. 148, or through the medium of the great lever, as in fig. 149; both
                        ends of the great lever describing circles around its middle fulcrum as a
                        centre, and the head of the piston-rod being connected with the one end of
                        the lever by means of an iron strap or connecting link. From inspection of
                        the figure, it becomes plain that the connecting rod or link, is never,
                        except at two points, in the same straight line with the piston-rod, so as
                        to propagate its unmodified force to the crank, but that in these oblique
                        positions it would produce a lateral motion in the end of the piston-rod
                        which would not only be a waste of power in producing motion in a place
                        where it is useless, but would have the effect of continually bending the
                        piston-rod in opposite sides so as either to break it, or materially to
                        impair its working. In the first of these figures, P <hi rend="italic"
                        >p</hi> being the direction of the piston-rod, <hi rend="italic">p</hi> R
                        that of the crank, the force in the piston-rod in the direction <hi
                        rend="italic">p a</hi> becomes resolved into two parts <hi rend="italic"
                        >p</hi> R and <hi rend="italic">p c,</hi><hi rend="italic">p</hi> R being

                        tending only to give lateral motion to the piston-rod, or else to bend it,
                        or else break it across. And so also in the second figure there is a similar
                        separation of pressure.</p>
                    <p>To prevent these lateral pressures from wasting the power of the steam, by
                        producing lateral, useless, or injurious motions, is the object of a series
                        of contrivances called parallel motions, or parallel guides. The most
                        notable of these we owe to Mr Watt.</p>
                    <p>Let it be supposed that we desire to prevent the top of the piston-rod <hi
                        rend="italic">p</hi>, fig. 150, from being moved by the obliquity of the

                        left, then it is accomplished in the following way. A fixed support, <hi

                        the other <hi rend="italic">s</hi><hi rend="italic superscript"> 2</hi> at
                        equal distances from it, and two parallel bars <hi rend="italic">g s</hi>

                        appreciable extent from the straight line. This is accordingly produced in a
                        very simple way. The following figures show the effect of these links in
                        various positions.</p>
                    <p>This elegant and simple contrivance is not, however, absolutely perfect; and,
                        in accurate workmanship, and on a larger scale, great allowance requires to
                        be made for its errors, or it will produce very many serious derangements of
                        the machinery to which it is applied. By this arrangement the point <hi
                        rend="italic">p</hi> is not kept perfectly in a straight line, but is, on
                        the contrary, compelled to deviate from it<pb break="no"

                        /> so as to describe a looped curve. The nature of this devintion will
                        become very evident if we suppose the parallel motion to be altogether
                        detached from the piston-rod, and the motion of the parallel bar and link
                        carried to its extreme, as in the following figures, 154, 155. A pencil
                        being used to trace the motion of the middle point, <hi rend="italic">p</hi>
                        will describe, not a straight line, but the curve <hi rend="italic">p x
                        y.</hi> When we carry the rods up to the position represented in the first
                        of the following figures, where the bar <hi rend="italic">g s</hi> comes
                        into the straight line with the link <hi rend="italic">g g,</hi> the point
                        <hi rend="italic">p</hi> deviates from the straight line by a quantity equal
                        to <hi rend="italic">p',</hi> and this is reversed in the opposite extreme.
                        In the next figure the deviation is much greater when the link <hi
                        rend="italic">g g</hi> comes into the same line with the other bar <hi
                        rend="italic">g</hi> s, and is also reversed in the position at the bottom
                        of the figure. By the time the links have been returned to their primitive
                        position, they have described the curve</p>
                    <p>It is important to diminish the amount of this deviation, which increases
                        more rapidly than the square of the length of the stroke. Having ascertained
                        the amount of greatest deviation at the end of the stroke, and also the
                        amount at ½th part of the stroke from the middle, bring the centres <hi
                        rend="italic smallcaps"> s</hi> and <hi rend="italic">s</hi> each nearer to
                        the other by a quantity equal to the deviation at the said 8th part, and the
                        amount of the greatest deviation will now be reduced to less than one
                        quarter of its former amount: the curve will now become a line of the sixth
                        (eighth?) order.</p>
                    <p>The parallel motion of one point having thus been se cured, it is easy to
                        transfer it to any other point. This is most commonly done by a jointed
                        parallelogram. Thus, to transfer it to a point in connexion with <hi
                        rend="italic">s g</hi> prolonged to <hi rend="italic">t</hi>, (figs. 158 to
                        158) take a second link <hi rend="italic">tq,</hi> equal to <hi
                        rend="italic">g g,</hi> and a second bar, called the parallel bar <hi
                        rend="italic">g q,</hi> equal to <hi rend="italic">g t,</hi> the corner <hi
                        rend="italic">q</hi> of the parallelogram will give a motion <hi
                        rend="italic">t q</hi> similar to <hi rend="italic">p.</hi> Figs. 159, 160,
                        show the parallel motion transferred to a point still farther from the
                        original point.</p>
                    <p>Another form of Mr Watt’s invention consists in placing two bars in the same
                        direction, with such a difference in their length, that the excess of the
                        continuance of the one above the other may afford the means of compensation.
                        Suppose that the point <hi rend="italic">p</hi>, fig. 161, is to be guided
                        to move in the straight line <hi rend="italic">p g g’; s s</hi><hi
                        rend="italic superscript"> '</hi> are pointe on the same side of the
                        required direction of motion, and <hi rend="italic">s g</hi><hi rend="italic
                        smallcaps"> s'</hi><hi rend="italic">g'</hi> are the differential bars
                        connected by a link <hi rend="italic">g</hi><hi rend="italic superscript"
                        >,</hi><hi rend="italic">g,</hi> which is prolonged to <hi rend="italic"
                        >p.</hi> The dotted lines of the figure show the bars in different
                        positions. The line described by the point <hi rend="italic">p</hi> is not a
                        straight line, but a curve, like figs. 154, 155. The motion of the point <hi
                        rend="italic">p</hi> may be transferred to a distance, as in the former
                        instance, by a jointed parallelogram <hi rend="italic">g p t q,</hi> fig.
                        162. All these parallel motions may be inverted, and, indeed, generally are
                        inverted in steamboat engines. For practical examples of them, the reader
                        may consult the plates.</p>
                    <p>All these motions are imperfect; that is to say, the motion of the end of the
                        piston-rod does not take place in a perfectly straight line, but possesses
                        high curvature. Various plans have, from time to time, been adopted for the
                        purpose of remedying the evil. In American steam engines Watt’s parallel
                        motion has been to a great extent abandoned, because in them long strokes
                        and long cranks are preferred; and in such cases the deviations of the point
                        <hi rend="italic">p,</hi> that is to say, of the piston-rod, from a straight
                        line, become excessive. Watt and his assistants and followers were perfectly
                        aware of this, and hence were led to construct beams, and connecting-rods,
                        and parallel motions, of <hi rend="italic">very great length,</hi> so as to
                        diminish the evil as far as possible. This has, of course, the effect of
                        rendering the whole engine both bulky and expensive, and is, therefore, in
                        many cases inexpedient.</p>
                    <p>The American engineers, therefore, use the sliding parallel motion; that is,
                        they have substituted for the radius bars of the parallel motion of Mr Watt,
                        a sliding bar or groove in which the top of the piston-rod is guided.</p>
                    <p>The head of the piston-rod <hi rend="italic">p,</hi> figs. 163, 164, is
                        enclosed between two flat surfaces, or between two parallel iron bars, which
                        are kept in the vertical position by means of stiff framing: on these it
                        slides, or to diminish the friction a wheel may be added; but there are
                        reasons why this wheel does not in practice work very well, and the plain
                        slide is therefore preferred.</p>
                    <p>In fig. 163 we have represented this motion as applied to an engine of the
                        simplest form, and in fig. 164 to a beam engine.</p>
                    <p>Another species of parallel motion was, we think, first adopted in America,
                        but it has also been used in this country. It is the engine with vibrating
                        pillar.<pb break="no" facs="ht:chi.28490924&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=767"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0720-0767-0659"/> The pillar, which supports the beam or lever,
                        instead of being fixed in an upright position, has a joint at the bottom, as
                        will be seen in fig. 165, on which it and the beam and the crank rod perform
                        a joggling motion back wards and forwards during each stroke.</p>
                    <p>The motion is of the following nature. The point <hi rend="italic">s,</hi>
                        fig. 166, is fixed; so is <hi rend="italic">s’; s g</hi> and s' g' are
                        moveable bars; <hi rend="italic">p g</hi> is ½ of <hi rend="italic">p
                        g'.</hi> The point <hi rend="italic">g</hi> describes a circle round s, and
                        <hi rend="italic">g'</hi> round <hi rend="italic">s'</hi>: hence <hi
                        rend="italic">p</hi> describes the curve <hi rend="italic">p s p',</hi> of
                        the sixth order. The oscillation of the moving mass of the engine in
                        alternate direc tions, with a sudden jolt at the end of the stroke, renders
                        this a bad engine when made on a large scale; and it is obvious that the
                        deviation of the piston rod from the straight line is very great.</p>
                    <p>A very elegant parallel motion was invented by the Rev. Mr Cart wright, and
                        applied by him to the steam-engine so early as 1797. Two equal toothed
                        wheels N N, fig. 167, work into each other, and from corresponding points of
                        their circumference two connecting links unite at the extremity of a cross
                        bar, to the middle of which the piston-rod is joined. These wheels and
                        connecting-rods being always in similar positions on opposite sides of the
                        piston rod, the obliquity of their actions balances each other, and the rod
                        describes a straight line. But it is difficult to make and to maintain the
                        wheels of this machine in the state of accuracy and perfection necessary to
                        its working well.</p>
                    <p>The cycloidal parallel motion is one of high geometrical beauty. It was
                        invented by Messrs Fenton, Murray, and Wood, and applied to the steam-engine
                        in practice in 1802. lt. depends on this principle that an encycloidal
                        curve, described by one-circle rolling within another, approaches a straight
                        line as the inner circ!e becomes more nearly equal in diameter to the radius
                        of the outer one. For the purpose of applying this principle, a large wheel
                        <hi rend="italic">q q,</hi> fig. 168, with teeth on its inner circumference,
                        is fixed on a frame concentric with the axis and circle of the crank O O. N
                        O is a wheel with external teeth, which is fixed freely on the crankpin, and
                        <hi rend="italic">p</hi> is the point of attachment of the piston-rod <hi
                        rend="italic">p l.</hi> By this arrange ιnent the small wheel N O is
                        compelled, by the pressure of the piston-rod upwards, to roll round the
                        great circle, ascending on the one side, and descending on the other, so
                        that the distance of the end of the piston-rod from the point of contact of
                        the circles is always equal to the distance of the circle from the diameter;
                        (or, <hi rend="italic">n</hi> + <hi rend="italic">r.</hi> sin. <hi
                        rend="italic">e —</hi><hi rend="italic                         underline">

                        rend="italic">e,)</hi> and thus the straight line is always preserved. We
                        have seen this motion working very well.</p>
                    <p>But the principle which furnishes the most perfect parallel motion, is one
                        which, although it be well known, we have never seen applied to practice. It
                        is well known that the locus of the extremity of a straight line, the middle
                        of which moves in a circle, the other end being confined to one straight
                        line, is also another straight line at right angles to the former.</p>
                    <p>Let a straight bar <hi rend="italic">x y,</hi> fig. 169, be placed with one
                        end <hi rend="italic">y</hi> confined in an horizontal groove <hi
                        rend="italic">a s</hi>, and let <hi rend="italic">a</hi> pin in the middle
                        <hi rend="italic">g</hi> be allowed to slide in a circular groove <hi
                        rend="italic">y g .x,</hi> then the end .r will always describe a straight
                        line <hi rend="italic">s x</hi>: perpendicular to the first.<pb break="no"
                        facs="ht:chi.28490924&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=768" xml:id="kp-eb0720-0768-0660"
                        /> Or it may he thus modified. If the arc of a semicircle have one of its
                        extremities placed in a given straight line, while it moves along a given
                        fixed point, the other extremity of the arc will describe another straight
                        line at right angles to the former. Let a semicircular round bar <hi
                        rend="italic">ybs,</hi> fig. 170, be allowed to slide through a fixed centre
                        at <hi rend="italic">s,</hi> the one end <hi rend="italic">y</hi> sliding in
                        a groove, or along a bar <hi rend="italic">s y,</hi> then the point <hi
                        rend="italic">x</hi> will describe the perpendicular s <hi rend="italic"

                        perfect straight line.</p>
                    <p>To put this in practice in a form which shall not deviate widely from
                        received forms of construction, is not difficult. The semicircular grove,
                        and the semicircular bar, are not good constructive expedients. But if we
                        take a radius bar <hi rend="italic">s g,</hi> figs. 171, 172, 173, fixed at
                        a centre <hi rend="italic">s,</hi> so that its end <hi rend="italic">g</hi>
                        de scribes a circle freely round it; and if we take a rigid bar <hi
                        rend="italic">p y,</hi> of double the length of <hi rend="italic">s g,</hi>
                        and united to it at <hi rend="italic">g,</hi> then the middle of <hi
                        rend="italic">p y</hi> being thus constrained to move in the circle round
                        <hi rend="italic">s,</hi> we have only to permit <hi rend="italic">y</hi> to
                        slide freely in an horizontal groove, and the point <hi rend="italic">p</hi>
                        being carried up and down, will describe the straight line <hi rend="italic"
                        >p s p.</hi> Fig. 174 shows the application of this motion to the simple
                        engine, and fig. 175 to the beam engine.</p>
                    <p>Mr Oldham of the Bank of England has shown us an application of this
                        principle, of which he has made a model: he adds a refinement which
                        diminishes the friction at <hi rend="italic">y,</hi> while it introduces an
                        infinitesimal error of the second degree. To the end <hi rend="italic"
                        >y</hi> he has attached Watt’s parallel motion, as represented in fig. 177;
                        <hi rend="italic">s g g</hi><hi rend="italic smallcaps"> s</hi> being the
                        radius bars, and <hi rend="italic">g y g</hi> the connecting link on a small
                        scale, the point <hi rend="italic">y</hi> is by this parallel motion guided
                        in the horizontal direction. Instead of this refinement, which only produces
                        infinitesimal error, we propose, if it were required, to preserve the
                        principle without error, and to introduce only infinitesimal friction. This
                        we accomplish by placing a secondary geometrical motion like the primary one
                        upon the point <hi rend="italic">y,</hi> fig. 176, so that its motion may
                        take place in a perfectly straight line. The effect of the friction will
                        thus become an infinitesimal of the third order. These last refinements are,
                        however, of a higher order than the degree of practical precision in the
                        steam-engine usually requires.</p>
                    <p>Such is the mechanism which the obliquity of the direction between the
                        connecting-rod, or link, renders necessary to prevent any of the motion,
                        propagated through them, from being expended in producing oblique trans
                        verse motion in the top of the piston-rod. Still, however, the motion of the
                        piston-rod is modified by transference in an oblique direction, and we have
                        now to consider the nature of that modification. Suppose the crank O R to
                        bein the position in the diagram fig. 178, where the connecting-rod <hi
                        rend="italic">p</hi> R is at right angles to it, then the connecting-rod <hi
                        rend="italic">p</hi> R makes with the piston-rod <hi rend="italic">Pp</hi>
                        an angle Op Ror θ <hi rend="italic">.</hi> The force F therefore, acting
                        along the piston-rod <hi rend="italic">Pp,</hi> being represented by the
                        length of <hi rend="italic">p x,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">x y</hi> and <hi
                        rend="italic">p y</hi> being drawn parallel to R <hi rend="italic">p</hi>
                        and R <hi rend="italic">x, we</hi> see that the line <hi rend="italic">x
                        y</hi> or <hi rend="italic">p</hi> R = F<hi rend="superscript">1</hi> /cos.θ
                        represents the force in the piston-rod along the crank-rod, tending to make
                        it revolve, while <hi rend="italic">p y =</hi> R <hi rend="italic">x =</hi>
                        R <hi rend="italic">p</hi> sin.θ = F. <hi rend="superscript"> sin.θ</hi> /
                        <hi rend="subscript"> cos.θ</hi> represents the amount of pressure sustained
                        by the parallel motion.</p>
                    <p>Thus we have a true representation of what takes place when the
                        connecting-rod, instead of being in a line with the piston, or parallel to
                        it, is at right angles to the crank; and in this case the whole force
                        communicated in this oblique position to the crank·rod, acts immediately and
                        entirely in turning round the crank. But at other points, such as are given
                        in the two succeeding figures, the motion is again modified by the obliquity
                        of the direction of the connecting-rod <hi rend="italic">p</hi> II to the
                        trank O R. If Ο R be prolonged to S, and from <hi rend="italic">ρ</hi> a

                        rend="italic">p</hi> R resolved into It σ and R ρ; whereof R ρ alone tends
                        to turn round the crank, R σ producing only pressure towards the centre. In
                        this case the angle <hi rend="italic">ρRσ</hi> is equal to the two interior
                        angles of the triangle <hi rend="italic">p</hi> R O, that is to ω + θ, the

                        piston. Hence the whole force in the connecting-rod becomes resolved into

                        whole force of the steam on the piston-rod becomes on the extremity of the

                        the steam engine, upon which much of the efficiency of its operation
                        depends, is the piston. Pistons were at first very rude implements for steam
                        to work with. A large block of wood cut round to fit the inside of the
                        cylinder, and driven very tight so as pretty nearly to fill up the cylinder,
                        was considered a sufficient obstacle to resist the passage of the steam,
                        until it had performed its duty, either of driving the piston from the
                        bottom to the top, or from the top to the bottom of the cylinder. It next
                        became usual to cover this piston with leather; but the heat of the steam
                        soon dried up the leather, and deprived it of the requisite pliability. The
                        next step was to make the piston of metal, like the piston of Otto
                        Guericke’s atmospheric engine, and then to make a groove around this piston,
                        which was filled with bands of plaited hemp, now technically called a
                        gaskin, so put together as to be spongy and elastic, and to interpose this
                        elastic sub stance between the piston and cylinder, so that the hemp,
                        yielding to the inequalities of the cylinder, should fill them up without
                        permitting the steam to escape. This has been successfully used for a long
                        period, and, where the cylinder is in good condition, used with ad vantage:
                        and it is still very extensively employed. In stead of using a solid piston
                        with a groove for the hempen packing, it was found better in practice to
                        contruct the piston as shown in fig. 182. The lower part of the piston is
                        formed of a plate attached to the piston-rod; the under edge of this plate
                        is of a diameter a little less than that of the cylinder, and it gradually
                        curves inwards, so as to form the lower portion of a groove for the packing.
                        The upper part of the piston consists of a plate with a similarly curved
                        rim, completing the groove. This upper plate is called the piston-cover, and
                        is attached to the lower plate or body of the piston by screws. In the
                        groove are carried round bands of soft plaited hemp or gaskin, which fill up
                        the cavity; and as the gaskin wears, the upper plate is screwed closer to
                        the lower one, and forces the packing against the sides of the cylinder. The
                        piston is represented <hi rend="italic">in situ</hi> in figure 184.</p>
                    <p>The only fault of this hempen packing is its liability to wear out, and
                        become rigid and unelastic. A plan was next adopted of protecting this hemp,
                        and still using its elasticity. Around the piston, in front of the packing
                        and enveloping it, two brass hoops, fig. 186, with slits in them, were
                        placed, to protect it from contact with the cylinder. These slits allowed
                        the hoops to enlarge and contract their diameter, in correspondence with the
                        ine qualities of the cylinder; while by the elasticity of the hemp, they
                        were kept continually pressed out in contact with the surface. This simple
                        metallic packing is re presented as applied to the piston in figure 185.</p>
                    <p>A still more independent metallic packing is produced in the following
                        manner, so as to dispense altogether with the elastic action of the hemp.
                        Large metallic belts of considerable thickness are cast, so as to form solid
                        rings, about a hundredth part greater in diameter than the inside of the
                        cylinder they are to fit, and turned on a lathe truly cylindrical to that
                        diameter. A small portion is then cut out of the circumference of each ring,
                        so as to make them open hoops like those represented in the last figure; and
                        the two open ends are then forcibly brought together, until their diameter
                        is just such as to admit them into the cylinder, their ends being now in
                        contact so as to form complete rings, and they are again placed in the lathe
                        and turned truly cylindrical. By this arrangement it is brought about, that
                        the elasticity of the rings continually urges them outwards, towards their
                        original diameter, and so dispenses with the elasticity of the hemp, forming
                        a packing wholly metallic. This is employed on a large scale by some of the
                        very best engineers in this country, and is greatly to be recommended for
                        its simplicity. Of course the break in the ring would allow steam to pass;
                        but this is avoided either by interposing a metallic tongue at the break, or
                        by using a number of rings, so that the break in one of them may be opposite
                        to the sound portion of the other.</p>
                    <p>Another form of piston may be called the wedge metallic piston. The rings are
                        cut into a number of parts, and are pressed upon the cylinder by wedges,
                        which again are kept in their places by springe; and so it is supposed that
                        a more perfect adaptation is gained of the parts of the ring to the
                        cylinder. This is certainly the case; but the ring is much more complex than
                        in the other form ;—</p>
                    <p>In fig. 187, wedges are shown to be inserted behind the rings, with springs
                        behind them, forcing them out wards; and in the figure 188, a single elastic
                        hoop is substituted for all those springs. Springs without wedges<pb
                        break="no" facs="ht:chi.28490924&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=770"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0720-0770-0662"/> are also in very common use for metallic
                        pistons with divided rings, double sets of rings being used, and the springs
                        pressing directly on the segments of the metallic rings, as in figs. 189,
                        190.</p>
                    <p>A stuffingbox is an apparatus used in immediate connexion with the piston. A
                        simple aperture in the cylinder cover to permit the passage of the
                        piston-rod, as in fig. 191, could not be made steam-tight: so that to
                        prevent the escape of steam, a stuffingbox has to be made use of. This
                        consists of a box cast round the hole of the cylinder-cover, fig 192, in
                        which is laid, around the piston-rod and in contact with it, a large
                        quantity of hempen packing. This packing is lubricated with oleaginous
                        matter, and the ring, fig. 103, is then placed on the top of this matter,
                        and pressed hard down upon it by screws, so as to squeeze the stuffing into
                        every crevice. Stuffing-boxes of this description are employed wherever it
                        is necessary to pass a rod out of a vessel, or into it, with out permitting
                        the escape of the steam. Thus there is one at the entrance of each valve-rod
                        into the steam chest of the cylinder valves, and also, wherever a rod passes
                        into the interior of a boiler.</p>
                    <p>The governor is an appendage to a steam-engine, of much value in all its
                        applications to the production of uniform revolving motion. It is merely a
                        modification of an apparatus similar to the pendulum, and by which Huyghens
                        once attempted to make a timekeeper in stead of the common pendulum. If we
                        suppose the axis A <hi rend="italic">x</hi>, fig. 194, to revolve on its
                        centre, and the ball B hung by a thread from .r, two pieces of iron, <hi
                        rend="italic">x</hi> C and <hi rend="italic">x</hi> C, being bent so as to
                        form cheeks of a form called the cycloidal curve; then when the string B <hi
                        rend="italic">x</hi> comes in contact with the cheeks, it will perform each
                        semi-revolution in the same time in which it performs two oscillations as a
                        common pendulum; that is, if it be 39.1 inches from the centre of B to <hi
                        rend="italic">x</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">,</hi> the pendulum will revolve
                        once in two seconds. If, however, the ball B be suspended from <hi
                        rend="italic">x</hi> by a straight bar, such as B <hi rend="italic">x</hi>
                        in the next figure, the line B <hi rend="italic">x</hi> in deviating from A
                        <hi rend="italic">x</hi> will describe the circular arch A B, instead of a
                        cycloid as formerly, and the time of oscillation will vary as the ball
                        recedes from A, the revolutions being more rapid at <hi rend="italic">b</hi>
                        than at B. If in the position B, the line <hi rend="italic">x</hi> C be
                        39.14 inches, then will the revolution be performed in two seconds, or at
                        the rate of 30 revolutions per minute; while at <hi rend="italic">b</hi>
                        they will he performed in less time, and between B and A more slowly; and in
                        general to find the height <hi rend="italic">C x</hi> for any required
                        number of revolutions, it is only necessary to find by the rules for
                        calculating the rates of the pendulums of timekeepers, what length of
                        pendulum will give double that number of beats per minute, and that is the
                        desired height for C <hi rend="italic">x.</hi> The rule for this pur pose is
                        easy. Divide the number 35226 by the square of the number of revolutious per
                        minute, and the result is the height <hi rend="italic">Cx.</hi> Thus to find
                        the length of <hi rend="italic">Ax</hi> for 30 revolutions per minute:—</p>
                    <p>30 squared = 30 × 30 = 900)35226(</p>
                    <p>required height = 39.14 inches.</p>
                    <p>The required regulation is effected in the following manner ;—</p>
                    <p>The balls B B, fig. 196, are suspended by rigid bars from the centre <hi
                        rend="italic">x,</hi> and are prolonged to <hi rend="italic">k k.</hi> These
                        bars are joined by links, <hi rend="italic">k y</hi> and <hi rend="italic">k
                        y,</hi> to a moveable socket <hi rend="italic">y,</hi> which can slide up
                        and down the axis. The straight lever <hi rend="italic">y p</hi> is acted on
                        at one end by <hi rend="italic">y,</hi> and at the other it draws or pushes
                        down or up the handle of a circular disc <hi rend="italic">v,</hi> so as
                        either to close it or open it to different degrees; this disc is in the
                        steam-engine placed in connexion with the steam pipe that supplies the
                        cylinder, so that if the engine should nt any instant move round too slowly,
                        from having too much work to do, the balls will collapse, raise up <hi
                        rend="italic">y,</hi> and open <hi rend="italic">υ</hi> to the fullest
                        extent, as at 4, in the small sectional figure to the right; 3 being the
                        mean position; while, on the other hand, should the engine, from its work
                        being taken off, go round too quickly, the balls would fly off from the
                        axis, bring down <hi rend="italic">y,</hi> close the valve to 2; or if it
                        had happened, as by an accident, that the load was suddenly withdrawn, close
                        the valve altogether, as at 1 in the side figure.</p>
                    <p>But the action of this governor is not always sufficiently delicate, its
                        power of adjustment being some what slow. An improvement has been made upon
                        it by Messrs Cheetham and Bailey, of Staley Bridge, in Lancashire, which
                        renders its action much more rapid. On the centre of the throttle-valve, as
                        the disc <hi rend="italic">v</hi> in the steam pipe is called, there is
                        placed an iron tube, like a gun barrel, partially filled with mercury. When

                        xml:id="kp-eb0720-0771-0663"/> is held perfectly horizontal, an equal
                        quantity of mercury lies in both ends; but, on the contrary, when the
                        slightest inclination is given to either end, the mercury instantly
                        preponderates to that lower end, and suddenly changes its inclination in
                        either direction. In practice I have seen this work well.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic">Of Condensing Apparatus.—</hi> The parts of the condensing
                        steam-engine which we have hitherto examined, are in all respects identical
                        with those of the high-pressure steam-engine. The characteristic difference
                        consists in the manner in which the steam is disposed of after having
                        produced its effect, and in the apparatus required for the purpose. In the
                        high-pressure steam engine, the steam is discharged from the cylinder simply
                        by allowing the entering steam to press the piston upon the outgoing steam,
                        and force it through the eduction pipe into the open air. Now, it requires
                        considerable force to effect this; we know that the atmosphere must he
                        pushed away before the steam with a force equal at least to 15 lbs. on each
                        square inch of the surface of the pipe; and, therefore, this amount of the
                        force of the steam, which is a balance for the air, that is, an atmosphere
                        of steam, is consumed or thrown away in this employment. In the condensing
                        steam-engine this atmosphere is saved. The steam is annihilated almost
                        instantaneously. A vacuum is formed on one side of the piston by this
                        annihilation, and the steam is allowed to employ that part of its force,
                        which formerly was spent in the useless labour of forcing the steam into the
                        air, in forcing the piston through the performance of useful labour.</p>
                    <p>If, therefore, we take a high-pressure engine, such as we have already
                        described, and if we desire to form it into a condensing steam-engine, we
                        must add to it a large reser voir of cold water, named the cold well, such
                        as is described in one of Watt’s steam-engines, in the historical part of
                        this article; and in this reservoir we must place a close vessel having an
                        aperture or small pipe in it, from which a jet of water shall play and
                        spread over the interior, so as to form a condenser, into which shall be
                        conducted the eduction-pipe, by which the steam is led out of the cylin der.
                        The quantity of cold water thrown into this vessel to cool it, will require
                        to be six or eight times as much as is boiled off in the shape of steam.
                        Attached to the condenser is a blow-through valve, opening outwardly, which
                        allows the whole condenser, before starting the engine, to he filled with
                        steam, so as to blow out at the valve all the air that may have previously
                        got into it. The reader is referred to the historical part of this article
                        for those parts in the description of Mr Watt’s engine, and also to plates,
                        and their descriptions of the parts of steam-engines at the end of the
                        article.</p>
                    <p>It must already have occurred to the attentive reader, that such a condenser
                        as has now been described could not act efficiently for any considerable
                        time. On the contrary it would rapidly become filled with water; for it is
                        plain that the jet of water entering the condenser will fill it up at last
                        with water; and even were this not the case, it is plain that the whole
                        steam which passes through the engine being turned back into water in the
                        condenser, this water would accumulate and fill the condenser. This water
                        must therefore by some expedient be removed out of the condenser without
                        admit ting the air. And again, it is well known that all water contains a
                        large quantity of air mingled with it, and permanently retained in its
                        pores, but which escapes from it the moment it is placed in a vacuum. Now
                        this air would of itself accumulate rapidly, to such an extent as to fill up
                        the vacuum of the condenser and render it inefficient. Air must therefore be
                        removed out of the condenser, along with the accumulations of injection
                        water, and the condensed water of the steam; and therefore an air-pump must
                        be provided, capable of removing nir and water from the condenser. This air
                        pump is placed beside the condenser in the cold well, communicating with it
                        by a foot-valve, which permits the air and water to go out and prevents
                        their return, and delivering that air and water which it removes into
                        another smaller reservoir, named the hot well, from the circumstance that
                        the water withdrawn from the engine has been made warm by contact with the
                        hot steam which it has condensed, and which it does not generally cool to a
                        lower temperature than 80° or 90°.</p>
                    <p>These appendages of the condenser, the cold well, the injection-pipe, the
                        air-pump, the hot well, the blow through valve, the foot-valve, the

                    <p>The reader will find other arrangements of these parts in the plates and
                        their descriptions. The air-pump is generally worked by the great beam of
                        the steam-engine, as in the figure, and is about half the area and half the
                        stroke of the cylinder of the engine.</p>
                    <p>The cold well requires a continual supply of water, either from a running
                        stream, or to he forced up by a pump like that marked cold-water pump in the
                        figure.</p>
                    <p>Dry condensation is a subject which has attracted much attention from
                        machinists; that is to say, it has been considered very desirable to
                        condense the steam without injecting water amongst it. Mr Watt originally
                        condensed in this manner. He merely placed upright pipes among cold water,
                        and letting the steam into them, allowed it to be condensed by simply coming
                        in contact with the inside of these tubes, which thus formed a con denser.
                        The introduction of a jet of cold water was thus avoided, the introduction
                        of air along with the water was also avoided, and thus the air-pump had its
                        duties much diminished. But the efficiency of the engine was found to be
                        very materially impaired; for the instantaneous annihilation of the steam
                        was not effected, in this process of mere surface condensation, in the
                        efficient way in which it had been by the old system of injection by a <hi

                            simplest, the most elementary, and the most appropriate manner of
                            applying the moving power, that the steam should itself follow the wheel
                            which it turns, round the circumference of its circle of gyration, and
                            so it is supposed, by acting immediately and directly on the wheel to be
                            turned round, produce the most powerful effect. In this way the action
                            of the steam would be made to resemble the turning of a millwheel by the
                            action of the water on the buckets of its rim; and the arrangements by
                            which such an elementary mode of action might be brought about, form
                            what is called a <hi rend="smallcaps">Rotatory Steam-Engine.</hi></p>
                        <p>That simplicity of form and of outline are essential to simplicity of
                            action, and excellence of mechanical action, is a fallacy; that
                            simplicity of figure and fewness of parts are objects of higher
                            importance in machinery than durability, precision, and economy of
                            operation, is a fallacy; that such an elementary machine, if
                            constructed, could give forth any more of that power than is now
                            rendered effective by the common steam-engine in everyday use, is a
                            fallacy, arising in ignorance, ending in disappointment.</p>
                        <p>We have to state with regret, that very injurious consequences have
                            arisen from this popular error. Many men of high talent and inventive
                            genius have sacrificed their talents, their industry, their lives, to
                            this delusion. The patent-offices of England, Scotland, Ire land, and
                            France and America, the mechanical periodicals of them all, the
                            transactions of societies for promoting the arts, the “machines
                            approuvées par l’Académie,” the journal of the Franklin Institution, all
                            teem with inventions of rotatory engines, and substitutes for the crank
                            of the common steam-engine, by which power and simplicity are to be
                            united in the highest degree. And yet, when we look around us, we
                            nowhere find that a phalanx of talent thus concentrated with a
                            singleness of purpose, and an indomitable perseverance worthy a more
                            hopeful object, has ever been successful in producing one form of
                            mechanism to stand in competition with the common everyday reciprocating
                            engine, with its crank and its flywheel and all its much condemned
                            appendages. In this country alone a crowd of inventors have not only
                            proceeded so far as to expend their ingenuity, labour, and money, in
                            inventing and constructing machines of this class, and making them the
                            subject of experiment, but more than a hundred of them have actually
                            laid out in succession four or five hundred pounds apiece in procuring
                            the royal grant of monopoly for their valuable contrivances. We feel it,
                            therefore, to be our duty to give a full and uncompromising exposure of
                            the fallacies of the rotatory engine. We regard such a fallacy as a
                            grievous obstruction to the advancement of the arts and the industry of
                            Great Britain. It is to the prevalence of ignorance on this subject,
                            that much of the misdirection of mechanical talent, in so far as it has
                            been applied to the improvement of our prime movers, is to be
                            attributed. Again and again, year after year, do we find the same
                            machine invented and reinvented, and the same experiments repeated and
                            the identical failures encountered. Of these failures, however, there is
                            only a small number comparatively which comes before the public. Those
                            alone which obtain patents are dragged into light; and of these we are
                            only left to infer the subsequent failure, from the circumstance of
                            discovering that their existence is recognised nowhere except in the
                            parchments of the Patent-Office. It is indeed a matter of general
                            regret, not limited to the subject of rotatory engines, that false pride
                            should prevent m n from publishing the results of such experiments as
                            may not be perfectly successful in accomplishing the objects originally
                            intended, lt should be recollected, that, as evidence of the truth or
                            falsehood of some great principle, no experiment is valueless, if simply
                            and faithfully described; and that, if it do not serve as a signal-post
                            to point the way to truth, it may at least prove useful as a beacon to
                            warn from the path of error. It is to unsuccessful experiments that we
                            owe many of our most valuable scientific discoveries. The failure of an
                            attempt to make a sucking pump more than 33 feet long led to an
                            acquaintance with the doctrine of atmospheric pressure, and open ed a
                            new field of research to the genius of Galilei, Torricelli, and Boyle;
                            and Sir Humphrey Davy is reported, on an occasion where he was shown a
                            dexterously manipulated experiment, to have exclaimed, “I thank God I
                            was not made a dexterous manipulator, for the most important of my
                            discoveries have been suggested to me by failures.” Thus we find that
                            the record of error may often prove a contribution to truth; and the man
                            who is sufficiently unselfish to impart to others the benefit of such
                            experience, is the disinterested friend of science. Had all the failures
                            of the rotatory engine been publicly recorded, that avenue of
                            misdirected effort would long ago have been closed.</p>
                        <p>Our present object is to bring together, and place under the eye of the
                            reader, all that has been done upon this subject, the attempts that have
                            been made, and the failures of those attempts. We shall thus show that
                            the attempts at a successful rotatory steam-engine which are every day
                            produced, are mere repetitions of experiments which have long ago been
                            tried in circumstances precisely the same, and have long ago hopelessly
                            failed and been abandoned; that these attempts were made in
                            circumstances that were well suited to ensure their success, had success
                            been possible. Let it be recollected that the only office performed by
                            machinery, is the transmission of power from an animal or element, and
                            never the creation of power. It can modify motion in direction,
                            velocity, and force, so as to expend itself in one manner rather than
                            another, but it can never create motion or generate power. This is true,
                            or all the experience of the laws of matter which has been obtained
                            since the use of inductive philosophy is false. Solid matter may obey
                            force and modify it, but can never create power. The only enquiry to be
                            made, therefore, in regard to any engine is this: when force is applied
                            to the machine, whether the force of steam or any other, does it turn
                            all the force of the agent to a useful purpose, without further
                            diminution than is occasioned by necessary friction and resistance of
                            the air, and the least possible loss of power by transmission? When
                            steam bursts a boiler, or water overturns the embankment of a reservoir,
                            the power of heat and of gravity produces its full effect; hut it is not
                            a useful effect. The object of a machine is to expend it parsimoniously
                            in rendering the greatest portion of its effect useful. The only
                            question entertained is, which form of engine is best calculated for
                            converting the power of steam to a useful purpose, so as to do so with
                            the smallest diminution in its quantity?</p>
                        <p>The common, or reciprocating steam-engine, is distinguished from the
                            rotatory steam-engine by the nature of certain parts of its mechanism,
                            which convey the motion of the steam to the machinery which is to be
                            moved: these are a piston-rod and crank. Now, it is owing to a radical
                            misconception of the nature of this elementary machine, the crank, that
                            innumerable schemes have been devised for the production of circular
                            motion, without the intervention of the crank, either by giving to the
                            steam itself an immediate circular action, or by the substitution of
                            some other less elementary mechanism between the reciprocating piston
                            and the revolving axis, as the means<pb break="no"

                            common form of the rotatory engine, the cylinder, piston-rod, and
                            cranked axle are superseded by a cylinder, valve, stop, and axis. In the
                            same way as a millwheel is compelled to move in a circle, either by the
                            direct action of water or wind upon it, so is the drum, or wheel, with
                            valves, fans, or other projections on its circumference, urged round by
                            the force of the steam, and, enclosed in an outer cylinder, or ease,
                            gives revolution to an axis to which it is attached. This direct
                            rotatory action of the steam will, it is imagined, give out the effect
                            of the steam more powerfully, uniformly, and economically, than the
                            common mode of reciprocating action when converted by the crank into re

                            forms the earliest, as well as the most rude and element ary, method of
                            giving motion to mechanism by the escape of vapour or steam. It is
                            described by Hero of Alex andria, in his <hi rend="italic"
                            >Pneumatica,</hi> upwards of 120 years before the Christian era, and
                            depends for its effect upon the same principle which gives to a rocket
                            its career, and makes a fire-wheel revolve in displaying its beautiful
                            lights. In these, as in all instances where fire or steam or any fluid
                            or gas is generated in a chamber, from which it is permitted to issue
                            with violence, it will, in its exit, drive the vessel from which it
                            issues away from it in the opposite direction; and it is, in fact,
                            merely an application of the principle of recoil, where the gas
                            generated by the explosion of the powder urges the hall outwards in one
                            direction, and forces the breech of the gun backwards in the opposite
                            one. The same recoil is felt in all cases of simple emission of a fluid
                            from a reservoir; and if it be so arranged that water, steam, air, or
                            the gaseous product of gunpowder, rushes out of a chamber through the
                            arms of a revolving wheel, the openings of escape being properly
                            directed, the recoil will urge round the wheel, and we shall have a
                            revolving engine of simple emission. By availing himself of this
                            principle, the machinist of Alexandria produced a working engine, merely
                            by heating a vessel containing water and air, and allowing the vapour to
                            rush from two opposite orifices, at the end of two arms proceeding from
                            a sphere, which the emission was employed to move.</p>
                        <p>Instead of using the principle of recoil, the force of steam, issuing
                            with violence as we see it from the month of a kettle or boiler, may be
                            directed upon the naves of a wheel so as to blow them round; and thus we
                            have a second variety in the manner of converting the simple issue of
                            steam into a moving power. This second species of the rotatory
                            steam-engine of simple emission was in vented by Branca. 1629. Since
                            that time the engines of this class have been frequently reinvented and
                            slightly modified.</p>
                        <p>The theory of machines of simple emission has been frequently and fully
                            investigated; and the result is, that there is no possibility of
                            obtaining by simple emission, in the most favourable circumstances
                            imaginable, more than one-half of the whole power of the steam, so as to
                            make it available to useful mechanical effect. The other half is wasted
                            in giving off its impulsion to the air, or is ex pended in a current
                            equally unavailing. Practical experience corroborates the predictions of
                            theory. Smeaton and Pelectan have made the machine of simple issue the
                            subject of careful experiment:—3 parts out of 11, 8 parts out of 27, and
                            2 parts out of 5, are the highest measures of the useful effect that it
                            has been found practicable to attain; and by no possible improvement can
                            more than one-half of the whole power be turned to a useful effect.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Class</hi> II.—Rotatory engines of medial effect are
                            those which do not immediately give revolution to an axis, by the action
                            of steam upon the wheel, but have a medium of communication between the
                            power and the effect, which medium is the direct agent in circular
                            motion. This class of engines will ba well understood, by taking as its
                            type any simple steam-machine, such as Savary’s or Newcomen’s, used for
                            raising water; which water, by falling on the floats of a common
                            millwheel, will then give rotatory motion to it. The engine of Savary
                            raises water by pressing directly on its surface; and it is only
                            necessary to allow this water to fall on a wheel, and it will be made to
                            revolve, and form an engine of the second class.</p>
                        <p>A variety of this class has been invented, of which the Fire-wheel of
                            Amontons is a type. The steam pushes water through certain channels that
                            form the arms of the wheel, from a set of chambers on one side of the
                            wheel, to a corresponding set of chambers on the opposite, and thus the
                            side filled with water preponderates over the other, and the wheel
                            revolves. The water being constantly driven off by the steam from a
                            given side of the wheel to that opposite, uniform revolution is the
                            result of the weight of the water. In this case, although steam is the
                            agent, water is the means of communicating the rotatory motion.</p>
                        <p>Solids have also been made the medium of effecting rotation in this
                            manner. Weights of solid matter, in the form of pistons, have been
                            transferred by the force of steam to a considerable distance from the
                            centre on one side of a wheel, and drawn nearer to it on the other side,
                            so as, by bringing about a continual preponderance of one side, to
                            effect a revolution. Watt and De Witty have de signed arrangements of
                            mechanism of this nature.</p>
                        <p>In this class of engines the loss of effect is manifest; for it is
                            necessary that the steam, in order to produce the circular motion, shall
                            give out its force in setting the medium in motion, and in overcoming
                            the very great <hi rend="italic">resistance</hi> of the liquid in all
                            the pipes and passages and valves, through which it is transmitted to
                            alternate sides of the wheel in every revolution. The force thus
                            subtracted from useful effect, is power lost.</p>
                        <p>In those which move weights from and towards the circumference, there are
                            mere groups of reciprocating pistons, without cranks, and partaking of
                            the defects to be explained in Class V. In fact, itι the engines of Watt
                            and Do Witty of this class, we have a number of reciprocating engines
                            ranged round a wheel to do the work of one.</p>
                        <p>In the case of the fluid medium we have not only a loss of all the power
                            expended in moving the medium itself, but also the additional loss of
                            effect encountered in all modes hitherto adopted for applying a fluid to
                            the rotation of a wheel; a loss, in the best examples ever presented in
                            practice, amounting of itself to more than ⅙th part of the power.</p>

                            are more effective than either of the former classes. As invented by
                            Watt, in 1796, this species of engine consisted of steam-vessels, in the
                            form of hollow rings or circular channels, with proper inlets and
                            outlets for the steam, mounted on horizontal axles, like the wheels and
                            buckets of a watermill, and wholly immersed in some fluid.<pb break="no"

                            xml:id="kp-eb0720-0774-0666"/> These tubular wheels were made of iron,
                            six feet in diameter, and the reaction of mercury was employed to give
                            revolution to them. The engine moved, but was found to be inefficient,
                            and was abandoned, although it had been tried in very favourable
                            circumstances. The principle of action is this. Steam is admitted into a
                            circular channel, or chamber, on the circumference of a wheel. This
                            chamber is partially filled with some liquid; the pressure of the steam
                            is expended in pushing the mercury in one direction, and the end of the
                            chamber in the opposite way; so that, while the liquid is thus forced
                            out of the chamber, the chamber is by an equal force pushed away from
                            the liquid. The wheel is thus moved round. It is apparent that a part of
                            the force is employed in propelling the wheel, and the remainder is
                            expended in overcoming the resistance of the liquid of reaction, and
                            expelling it from the chambers, which remainder is a large portion of
                            the power withdrawn from useful effect.</p>

                            piston are constructed on a much better principle, a.∙.d hold out much
                            fairer prospects of successful competition with those of the
                            reciprocating piston, than any of the species of the first three classes
                            that have been already considered. In these classes the steam is not
                            confined in rigid vessels, but its action is expended in producing
                            currents in fluids, and expending motion in medial effects, which are
                            useless. This is not the case in the steam-engine of the revolving
                            piston. The steam is confined in a close and rigid chamber, and acts
                            only on solid in flexible surfaces, and escapes along confined passages,
                            so that its full effect may be obtained in useful work. Abstractly
                            considered, it is an engine capable of giving out the full power of the
                            steam, and, therefore, may fairly be imagined to come into competition
                            with the ordinary reciprocating crank engine. The objections to it are
                            entirely of a practical nature, and regard the engine, not in its
                            abstract mathematical form, but as a machine made of
                            destructiblematter—of matter imperfectly elastic—of surfaces offering
                            resistance to motion—of matter obeying the known laws of motion and
                            rest. These objections are not the less valid that they are of a
                            sensible and tangible, rather than a speculative description. But, as a
                            natural consequence of the more plausible deceptions held out by this

                            involving fallacies similar to those in which the revolving piston has
                            originated. These two may therefore be considered together.</p>
                        <p>Although the name of Watt has been included in the list of inventors of
                            substitutes for the crank, it should be observed that he was only driven
                            to the invention of a substitute by the circumstance of a patent having
                            been previously obtained for the crank in its simple form; and that he
                            abandoned his beautiful, but more complex, mechanism on the instant that
                            the elementary crank was re leased from the fetters of monopoly. lt is
                            due also to his memory to say, that the sun and planet wheel, which he
                            substituted for the crank, is a disguised crank, possessing all the
                            valuable properties, excepting simplicity and smallness of friction,
                            which give to the crank its pre sent eminence as a mean of obtaining
                            rotatory effect. It is remarkable that the fallacies regarding the now
                            universally employed crank were coeval with its first sug gestion as the
                            vehicle of rotative steam power. John Stewart, in describing his
                            mechanism for this purpose, in the Philosophical Transactions, 1777,
                            observes that “the crank or winch is a mode of obtaining the circular
                            motion which naturally occurs in theory, but in practice it would be
                            impossible, from the nature of the motion of the engine, which depends
                            on the force of the steam, and cannot be ascertained in its length; and,
                            therefore, on the first varia tion, the machine would either be broke to
                            pieces or turned back.” Mr Smeaton agrees with Mr Stewart on the
                            inapplicability of the crank; but adduces another objection, “That great
                            loss would be incurred by the absolute stop of the whole mass of moving
                            parts as often as the direction of the motion is changed, and that al
                            though a heavy flywheel might be applied to regulate the motion, it
                            would be a great encumbrance to the mill." In such phrase of evil omen
                            was it thus confidently predicted that the simple means now in everyday
                            use for the communication of steam power to revolving machinery would
                            either be attended with great loss, be very desultory in its action, or
                            altogether break the machine to pieces. At that time, however, the crank
                            was not in use; but the very same objections are still urged by those
                            who have, every day, before them the practical confutation of their
                            assertions.</p>
                        <p>I. In the abstract and purely theoretical view of the subject, it can be
                            shown that the present mode of applying the steam possesses none of the
                            disadvantages, and that the rotatory mode possesses none of the
                            superiority attributed to it.</p>
                        <p>In making the comparison between the rotating and reciprocating piston,
                            let it be supposed that the vessels containing the steam are equally
                            rigid, equally perfect in their form, and are equally divested of
                            friction, and that there shall have been obtained for the steam a <hi
                            rend="italic">point d’appui</hi> as satisfactory in the case of the
                            rotatory, as that which the reciprocating engine possesses in the ends
                            of the cylinder; then, upon this hypothetical condition, neither engine
                            will excel the other, each will move over a space with a power and
                            velocity proportioned to the steam which it makes use of, and that
                            engine will do most work which uses the greatest quantity of steam.</p>
                        <p>The great fundamental principle in the construction of machinery is, that
                            the work done depends in quantity only upon the quantity and velocity of
                            the power applied, and not at all upon the form of the machine; in other
                            words, that a machine has no power, either of consuming or creating
                            motive power; that it can only transmit it; that it can only modify it
                            to suit particular purposes; and that what it loses in pressure it will
                            gain in velocity; this is on the supposition, of course, that the
                            machine is perfectly well made, without friction, and without permit
                            ting the escape and waste of power in some effect not conducive to the
                            end in view. Setting out, then, from this great fundamental principle of
                            virtual velocities, we might satisfy ourselves with asserting the truth
                            we now wish to establish as a simple self-evident deduction from it, and
                            conclude that from this great principle of virtual velocities there
                            could not possibly be loss of power by the crank steam-engine.</p>
                        <p>This summary process would not, however, satisfy the enquirer or inventor
                            who has taken the erroneous view of the subject, unless he were given to
                            understand how this great doctrine may be made to bear on the peculiar
                            difficulties of the case. He will return upon us with the question—“How
                            is it that, in the common crank, we are able to show that, at two given
                            points in its revolu tion, the position is such that an infinite power
                            would produce no effect at all; that there are only two instants of time
                            in which the force and its effect are equal; and that, at every other
                            point, the pressure given out by the steam to the crank is less than the
                            original pressure of<pb break="no"

                            xml:id="kp-eb0720-0775-0667"/> the steam on the piston? How is this
                            inconsistency to be reconciled?” We think it right to give a direct
                            answer to this question, because a considerable authority, Mr Tredgold,
                            has committed a grievous error in reporting, and apparently
                            demonstrating, that the rotatory and crank engines actually differ in
                            theory in the proportion of 3 to 2 — the proportion being against the
                            rotatory engine; whereas, if they he not equal, our whole system of
                            mechanics since the time of Galileo has been resting on a fallacy.</p>
                        <p>Let it be recollected, then, that at the two extremes of the line of
                            centres the greatest loss is said to take place. Now, here the fact is,
                            that it is impossible there can be loss of power, for there is no power
                            at all exerted; there is no steam in action: it is forgotten that, at
                            this point, the communication which supplies the steam from the boiler
                            has been cut off. The steam on one side of the piston having done its
                            work, only waits to he released from the chamber, and escapes on the
                            instant of the opening of the eduction-valve, and at the same instant is
                            in the act of being permitted to enter on the opposite side, for
                            reversing the motion. At these points, therefore, all application of
                            force has ceased, and arrangements are making for reversing the motion;
                            and, as no power is applied, none can be lost.</p>
                        <p>In regard to the remaining points of the circle, at which it is said that
                            power is lost, it is easy to show that the velocity imparted to the
                            crank is such as to be an exact equivalent to the force which is
                            apparently lost. The following table presents the results of very
                            accurate calculations of power and velocity, showing that the velocity
                            at a given point in the circle is increased exactly in the same ratio as
                            the force or pressure is diminished, so as at all times to present the
                            same dynamical equivalent. The table extends from one neutral point to
                            the other neutral point of the orbit of the crank, comprehending a
                            semicircle divided into ten equal parts. The first column indicates the
                            point in the semicircle at which the force and velocity are estimated;
                            the next column shows the percentage of the direct force of the steam on
                            the piston, which is given out in pressure upon the crank of the engine;
                            and the last column, the velocity given out at each point.</p>

                        <p>From this table it is evident that when we take note, as we must do in
                            every correct estimate of power, both of force and velocity, the crank
                            has at each point the equivalent in greater velocity for less force.</p>
                        <p>The numbers in the second column also represent the velocity of the
                            piston in relation to the crank, so that when the velocity of the crank
                            is uniform, the velocity of the piston, or the steam consumed, which is
                            proportional to its velocity, is in the exact ratio of the pressure on
                            the crank.</p>
                        <p>The last consideration which we shall submit upon this part of the
                            subject is, that if the average of the pressures on the crank be taken
                            for every point of its orbit, it will amount to about G3.3 per cent. for
                            the whole circumference of the circle. Now, as the same circumference of
                            the orbit of the crank is greater than the stroke of the piston in the
                            cylinder, the whole space described in a given time by the crank is
                            greater than the whole space described by the piston, also in proportion
                            of 3.1416 to 2; so that if we combine the greater length of the whole
                            orbit with the force on it, we shall have an exact equivalent to the
                            greater force on the piston moved through a smaller space.</p>
                        <p>The error of Mr Tredgold lies, not in his estimate of the effect of the
                            crank, but in his estimate of the effect of the steam in the rotatory
                            engine. By a strange oversight, he gives a statement of its power as
                            much over the truth as that of the crank is generally stated under the
                            truth. We admit that, in the first abstract view of the subject, the
                            rotatory is theoretically a perfectly efficient propagator of power, and
                            we have merely designed to show that in theory the crank has not the
                            faults usually attributed to it, and is also a perfect machine. We shall
                            by and by show what the considerations are by which the impracticability
                            of the rotatory scheme is exposed.</p>
                        <p>It appears, therefore, that the power of steam is by no means
                            disadvantageously applied through the medium of the crank in the
                            ordinary way, because, 1. the velocity of the crank is in the inverse
                            ratio of the pressure upon it; 2. because the mean pressure on the crank
                            during the whole revolution is less than the pressure on the piston,
                            only in the proportion in which the whole space moved over by the latter
                            is less than the space described by the former, so that the whole effect
                            is equal to the whole power; 3. because the steam is not at all ex
                            pended at the neutral points, and because its expenditure is at every
                            point exactly proportioned to the pressure which it gives out, the
                            velocity of the piston being in that ratio. In theory, therefore, the
                            ordinary crank possesses no inferiority to the rotatory machine, as an
                            engine for applying the power of steam to revolving machinery.</p>
                        <p>II. In a practical point of view, it may be shown, that the rotatory
                            steam-engine is greatly inferior to the common reciprocating
                            crank-engine in simplicity of parts, easy construction, cheapness,
                            amount of friction, compactness, precision and uniformity of work, and
                            durability and economy in use; and that it does not possess any of the
                            peculiar applicability that has been attributed to it, to the great
                            purposes of inland navigation and railway transport.</p>
                        <p>1. Simplicity.—A little unfairness is sometimes inadvertently used by
                            inventors of rotatory engines, in making comparisons with their machines
                            and the common crank-engine; they select the large beam-engine with all
                            its conveniences and appendages, and compare it with the simplest form
                            of the rotatory engine; but in justice we may be allowed to take the
                            simplest form of both. Now, there is a simple form of engine used both
                            in America and in this country, of the oscillating species as it is
                            called, and this species of reciprocating engine consists only of the
                            following parts:—cylinder, piston, and cranked axle; there are no valves
                            or further mechanism of any kind, so that where simplicity is the first
                            great requisite, this kind may be used with advantage. The rotatory
                            engine of the most simple species must have its drum, diaphragm, piston,
                            and axle.</p>
                        <p>If we take those forms of the rotatory engine which require valvegear,
                            air-pump, condenser, force-pumps, &amp;c., such appendages will have no
                            advantage of any kind, in either form; but in working the pumps which
                            are themselves reciprocating, the reciprocating engine will have the
                            advantage of more direct, immediate, and simple action; for in the
                            rotatory engine additional mechanism is necessary to convert the
                            revolving motion into one calculated for reciprocating pumps.<pb

                            xml:id="kp-eb0720-0776-0668"/> 2. In ease of construction the simple
                            form of reciprocating engines incomparably excels the rotatory. To
                            possess equal powers, the rotatory drum would require to be of much
                            larger diameter than the reciprocating cylinder; and the difficulty of
                            construction increases in a high ratio with the diameter. The diaphragm
                            is also a sliding or revolving piece of mechanism, whose rubbing
                            surfaces require the greatest precision of workman ship. The revolving
                            piston is also a practical problem of the greatest difficulty, and one
                            which has never been satisfactorily solved; for if it be rectangular
                            with plane surfaces, it is scarcely possible to make its surfaces steam
                            tight; and if it be a circular and revolving piston, its surface and
                            that of the drum become surfaces of double curvature, and the difficulty
                            is then prodigiously increased. The metallic piston of the common
                            steam-engine is the most perfect and most simple piece of mechanism,
                            which can be made by a very ordinary workman, and which, if imperfectly
                            fitted, will, in the progress of doing its work, become of itself every
                            day more and more perfect. An editor of a well-known practical journal,
                            although a believer in the rotatory engine, speaking of one of its
                            simplest forms is compelled to admit, “that there being no mode
                            described of making the parts of the engine steam tight by packing, they
                            must he all made so by accurate workmanship and grinding, the expense of
                            which, in the outset and in repairs, would certainly be too considerable
                            to allow it to come into competition with other steam engines of a more
                            common and practicable construction.”</p>
                        <p>His admission is equally applicable and fatal to all the forms of the
                            engine.</p>
                        <p>3. The cheapness and first cost of the engine, will result from the two
                            former points of inferiority, and will be further shown, from those
                            which follow, to be greatly and necessarily in favour of the common
                            engine. Not only are the parts, from their nature, more easy of
                            construction, but the extent of polished surface will be shown to be
                            much greater in the rotatory, than in the reciprocating engine.</p>
                        <p>4. The quantity of surface exposed to friction is greater in the rotatory
                            engine. Let it be recollected that, in the rotatory engine, the piston
                            describes the semi circumference of the circle, while the piston of the
                            reciprocating engine is describing the diameter of it. Let it also be
                            recollected, that the reciprocating piston passes back through the
                            returning stroke, over the very same surface through which it formerly
                            descended, while the rotatory piston necessarily revolves over a new sur
                            face, forming the other semi-circumference of its orbit. Let it also be
                            recollected, that the form of the reciprocating cylinder may be so
                            proportioned, that it may have a minimum of surface, while the length of
                            the circuit of the rotatory piston prevents the possibility of giving it
                            a proportion to the radius of the piston by which this object would be
                            attained; for it would be equivalent to making a circle whose diameter
                            should be equal to its circumference, which is impossible. It is
                            impossible, therefore, that the friction can ever be as small in the
                            rotatory as in the reciprocating engine.</p>
                        <p>5. Compactness.—It follows in like manner, that the bulk and space
                            occupied by the rotatory engine must be greater than in the
                            reciprocating engine; for in the one case the piston must describe the
                            circumference of a circle, whose diameter is greater than twice the
                            radius of the piston, and in the other ease it is only necessary that
                            the piston pass through the diameter of it.</p>
                        <p>6. In precision and uniformity of working, its inferiority will be
                            rendered manifest under head III., when the peculiarities of the crank
                            are expIained</p>
                        <p>7. In durability and economy in the wear and tear of ordinary working,
                            the rotatory must, from certain elements in its constitution, be
                            necessarily far inferior to the common engine. It contains in the very
                            nature of its action, elements of speedy destruction and expensive and
                            frequent repairs, so that it can never become an economical engine.
                            Before proceeding, however, to demonstrate the cause of this
                            inferiority, the fact of this inferiority, as existing in all previous
                            engines, we shall adduce from the unwilling evidence of a friend to
                            rotatory engines. Speaking of Mr Halliday’s engine, he says that, “the
                            extreme accuracy and nice fitting of parts necessary for it, will make
                            it very difficult to execute and very easily deranged. Rotatory
                            steam-engines possess considerable advantages both as to speed and
                            economy of power, and would therefore be preferable if they could be
                            made to work as well for a continuance, and be as easily kept in good
                            order as common alternating steam-engines; but from their being so very
                            seldom used, we apprehend that this is very far from being the case with
                            any of them at pre sent, and that the production of a rotatory
                            steam-engine possessed of these necessary qualities, is still an object
                            of research.” So far the Editor of the Repertory of Arts, in testimony
                            that the rotatory steam-engine <hi rend="italic">never has</hi> been
                            made to work durably and economically; we now <hi rend="italic">go</hi>
                            on to show that it <hi rend="italic">never can.</hi></p>
                        <p>It is essential to the durability of a machine that its parts should wear
                            uniformly, and that, if possible, the mere process of wearing should
                            make them fit each other more closely. This is preeminently true of the
                            piston and cylinder of a common reciprocating steam engine. Its piston,
                            cylinder, and valves fit more closely as they wear, and are worn with
                            perfect uniformity, so as not to require repair until, by long working,
                            the whole thickness of matter in action shall at length have been
                            consumed. This is the perfection of mechanism, and is admirably
                            exemplified in the metallic piston of a steam engine, which, working
                            night and day. will require no re pair of any kind until, after a long
                            period of years, the whole strength of the metallic rings shall have
                            been consumed.</p>
                        <p>ln the very nature of the rotatory piston, this uniformity of friction,
                            this increasing adaptation of surfaces, this permanence of the best
                            working condition is impossible. A common reciprocating steam-engine
                            attains its best working condition after it has wrought for some years;
                            but a rotatory steam-engine, if it have been brought by care and
                            precision in workmanship to a state of high finish and perfect accuracy,
                            so as to work well for a day, commences from that moment a rapid course
                            of deterioration, every succeeding degree of which accelerates the
                            progress of decay; a decay which can only be retarded by continual,
                            laborious, and expensive repairs. The following considerations may
                            render obvious the nature of the elements of self-deterioration in the
                            constitution of a rotatory steam-engine.</p>
                        <p>Suppose two perfectly flat plates of polished metal perfectly round to be
                            laid one upon the other, so as exactly to coincide at every point; let
                            the undermost rest upon a table, and let the uppermost be so made as to
                            turn round on an axis while in contact with the other, and let a rapid
                            motion be communicated to the upper most; let us consider what the
                            result of the attrition of one of these upon the other will be: will
                            they wear equally, so as to remain in a state of mutual adapta tion, or
                            will they not? Experience furnishes us with a reply that exactly
                            quadrates with a reasonable expectation: they will not wear equally,
                            they will not retain their form, they will not remain flat; they will
                            wear away most rapidly at the circumference, and wear open there while
                            they are quite close at the centre. Let it be considered that the outer
                            edge performs a larger circuit than a part nearer to the centre; that,
                            therefore, since all<pb break="no"
                            facs="ht:chi.28490924&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=777"
                            xml:id="kp-eb0720-0777-0669"/> the parts revolve in the same time, those
                            nearer to the circumference move with greater velocity than those
                            towards the centre; that the attrition is consequently most rapid at the
                            circumference, and diminishes uniformly towards the centre of the
                            plates; and it necessarily follows, that towards the edges the plates
                            must commence an immediate and rapid waste, while the centre remains
                            uninjured. This result is established as matter of experience. It is a
                            circumstance that has caused the failure of many beautiful inventions.
                            It is the reason why conical bearings have been universally abandoned
                            for cylindrical ones; and it is the reason why a most beautiful class of
                            inventions has been totally useless to the improvement of the common
                            steam-engine; wo refer to the revolving valves invented by Oliver Evans
                            and by Murray, hut now universally abandoned, in spite of their
                            simplicity and original cheapness, on account of this inequality in the
                            attrition of flat surfaces revolving round a centre.</p>
                        <p>The application of the result of this illustrative experiment to the
                            subject in question is abundantly obvious. The rotatory piston is
                            necessarily and inevitably of this nature. Performing a circuit round a
                            centre, different portions of the bearing surfaces subjected to
                            pressure, and necessarily in contact and requiring to be steam tight,
                            revolve at unequal distances from the centre, and therefore with unequal
                            velocities; hence the circumferential surfaces, under this excessive
                            attrition, wear more rapidly, and become unfit for use long before the
                            central parts have suffered any sensible effect. It is to this
                            difference of velocity and of attrition, arising from the necessary
                            circumstance of motion round a centre, which renders it impossible to
                            keep the rotatory engine in a working condition with advantage, and from
                            which it follows that each day’s work renders the engine less fit for
                            the duty of the succeeding day.</p>
                        <p>8. The peculiar applicability of the rotatory form of steam-engine to the
                            purposes of steam navigation and land locomotion, has been much insisted
                            on by projectors of rotatory engines. To both these purposes it is, from
                            its form, supposing it to possess no other disadvantage, most
                            inapplicable, ln a steam-vessel, it is first of all desirable to have
                            the axis of the paddles as high as possible, and the weight of the
                            engine as low as possible. Now if the engine be placed on an axis, which
                            is the case in this application of the rotatory engine, one of two evils
                            is incurred: either the axis of the wheels must be brought low, which
                            impairs the action of the paddles, or the weight of the engines must be
                            exalted so as to render, the vessel top-heavy, unsteady, or, as it is
                            technically called, “crank,” and liable to be upset. By the ordinary
                            engine, the axis is elevated to or above the deck, while the weight of
                            the engine remains on the floor, at the bottom of the vessel. Again, to
                            the application of the rotatory steam-engine to the purpose of
                            terrestrial loco motion in propelling carriages on railways or other
                            roads, there are insuperable objections. As the rotatory engine is
                            placed immediately upon the axle of the propelling wheels, there can be
                            no springs between it and the wheels, so that every jolt would derange
                            the machinery. The weight of the engine placed on the axle would in turn
                            reciprocate the evil by knocking the wheels to pieces. In the
                            reciprocating engine these evils are prevented by the detachment of the
                            engine from the axle, and the propagation of power through rods, wheels,
                            or chains, to the propelling wheel or axis; and if any fault still
                            remain in the principle of locomotive engines, it is the want of perfect
                            detachment in the very respect which the introduction of the rotatory
                            engine would render impossible.</p>
                        <p>In addition to all these obstacles which stand in the way of rotatory
                            engines, it may be worth while to mention another circumstance of a
                            practical nature which gives great superiority to the common
                            steam-engine; we mean the facilities which it presents, and which the
                            rotatory engine does not possess, for the attachment of the appendages
                            that are indispensable to the functions of a perfect steam engine. The
                            subordinate parts of an engine which belong equally to a rotatory and
                            reciprocatiι∣g steam-engine are, an air-pump, a feedpump, and a
                            well-pump. These merely require to be attached directly to the beam of
                            the common engine, and they are worked without the intervention of
                            auxiliary mechanism, because the motion of the pumps is reciprocating,
                            and the action of the steam is also in the common engine reciprocating;
                            while, on the other hand, in the case of the rotatory steam engine, it
                            would be necessary to convert the revolving movement, by a crank or
                            other more complex mechanism, into the very reciprocating effect which
                            it is intended to supersede.</p>
                        <p>All these considerations, of a most important and im mediate practical
                            bearing, clearly prove that although, in the most abstract and
                            elementary theoretical view of the subject, there be an apparent
                            equality of effect in the rotatory and the reciprocating steam-engines,
                            yet there are practical objections of an insuperable nature inherent in
                            the very constitution of rotating mechanism, that prevents the
                            possibility of rendering it more perfect.</p>
                        <p>III. It is lastly our duty to show that the common reciprocating crank
                            steam-engine, not only does not possess the disadvantages attributed to
                            it, hut that it possesses certain very peculiar properties which may not
                            have been hitherto clearly understood and defined, but which
                            nevertheless do adapt it in so admirable a manner to the nature of steam
                            and of solid matter, and to the necessary imperfections of all human
                            mechanism, as to have rendered it triumphant in universal practice over
                            every competitor.</p>
                        <p>1. It was long imagined that the transmission of power through a <hi
                            rend="italic">crank,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">bend,</hi> or <hi
                            rend="italic">handle</hi> in an axle, was attended in the steam-engine
                            with great loss of effect. In the opinion of such men as Smeaton, the
                            crank was never likely to be used as the means of obtaining rotatory
                            motion from steam; while it is thievery crank that is, in our day, used
                            alone and universally over all other methods, although a great variety
                            of other methods have been successively invented, and finally abandoned
                            for the simple elementary crank. Yet it is not without some show of
                            reason, that objections have been made against the practical working of
                            the crank. We admit that the argument was rather a staggering one, but
                            the difficulty has lately been wholly removed.</p>
                        <p>The staggering fact, to which we refer, was this: it is given as stated
                            by Dr Penneck of Penzance, Corn wall, in describing a substitute
                            proposed by him for the crank. “Some have considered a wheel as
                            one-third more powerful than the crank, and others that no power is lost
                            by the crank; but, confining myself to <hi rend="italic">practical
                            results,</hi> it appears from the report of the duty of steam engines as
                            done in Cornwall, and published by the Messrs Lean, that the performance
                            of the crank-engines bears no proportion to those in which no crank is
                            employed.” He then proceeds to show the advantages of his own engine, in
                            which a ratchet-wheel is moved by an arm, always acting at the extremity
                            of a radius, by which means he hopes to save the loss of power
                            occasioned by the crank. The fact related by Dr Penneck was perfectly
                            accurate. It had happened that the crank steam-engines, working
                            expansively in Cornwall, had never given out an adequate effect. That
                            the fault did not lie in the crank, hut in other parts of the
                            arrangement, is now apparent: it consisted in the want of proper
                            adjustments to admit of favourable action in using the steam
                            expansively. Ar<pb break="no"

                            xml:id="kp-eb0720-0778-0670"/> rangements for this purpose have,
                            however, been at Iength accomplished, and crank-engines are now in
                            Cornwall doing the same work as the average of those that have no crank.
                            We have before us the printed reports of last year, stating the duty
                            done by the crank-engines of Charleston and Wheal Kitty, constructed by
                            Mr Sims. We have also before us indications of the <hi rend="italic"
                            >actual pressure of the steam On the cylinder,</hi> as obtained by a
                            very accurate indicator, applied in the course of the summer of 1837 by
                            Mr Smith for Mr Fairbairn of Manchester, who visited the mines for that
                            purpose, and has been kind enough to favour us with a copy of his
                            diagrams and observations. We have thus the means of comparing the power
                            actually exerted on the piston with the work done, and find the result
                            of the comparison to he, that <hi rend="italic">the work done is within
                            ten per cent of being perfectly equal to the power employed.</hi> Here,
                            then we arrive at this conclusion, that the utmost conceivable reach of
                            improvement in the mechanism of the steam-engine, if it even attained to
                            perfection, would not save more than a few per cents. That the crank
                            engine is, therefore, as at present used, as near in practice to the
                            perfection of mechanism as any thing we can hope to obtain, is, we
                            think, satisfactorily explained.</p>
                        <p>2. The crank, as a means of converting the reciprocation of the piston of
                            a steam-engine into continuous revolving movement, possesses certain
                            singular and beautiful properties which distinguish it from every other
                            means of producing that conversion, and which appear to be so perfectly
                            adapted to the nature of steam and the constitution of solid matter,
                            that we are indebted to it mate rially, though indirectly, for the very
                            great advantages which we derive from the modern steam-engine as a
                            source of mechanical power. Let us examine into the causes of this
                            well-established practical superiority of the crank to all other modes
                            of producing revolving motion. Let it be observed, that in the
                            reciprocating piston, from which the crank derives its motion, the
                            following things take place: the piston is to be put in motion in one
                            direction, then stopped, then put in motion in the opposite direction,
                            stopped again, and then its motion resumed in the first direction. We
                            shall see how admirably the crank adapts itself to these changes; so
                            that, while the piston with which it is rigidly connected takes every
                            velocity between its maximum velocity and perfect rest, the crank goes
                            forward with a motion perfectly regular and perfectly unimpeded. The
                            necessity of this gradual change from motion to rest, and a reverse
                            direction of motion, is ob vious. Matter in motion acquires momentum and
                            can not be stopped, but its impetus must be equally and gradually
                            removed, otherwise these moving parts are subjected to concussion as if
                            by the stroke of a hammer, and must either suffer injury or produce it;
                            for, when in motion, matter requires a force to stop it equal to the
                            force which gave it that motion. And, on the other hand, when brought to
                            rest, matter cannot instantly be set in motion in the opposite direction
                            without a stroke and concussion equally violent. To work smoothly,
                            durably, profitably, and uniformly, matter must be put in motion by
                            gentle gradations, beginning with a very gentle ve 1ocity, and gradually
                            increasing in velocity like a body set in motion down an inclined plane,
                            where, if it move one foot in the first second, it moves three in the
                            next, five in the next, seven in the next, and so on: and in like manner
                            in coming to rest, it must do so in the same gradual way in which an
                            arrow shot from a bow vertically into the air loses its motion; for in
                            the end of its course it moves seven feet in the first quarter of the
                            last second of time, five feet in the next quarter of a second, three
                            feet in the next, and only one foot in the last, and then subsides into
                            rest at the instant before it again recommences motion downwards, which
                            it does in a manner perfectly similar. It is required, therefore, that
                            while the motion which the steam gives off by the crank be uniform and
                            continuous, the parts of the engine itself shall be allowed time to be
                            alternately brought into a state of rest, without shock, concussion, or
                            jolt, and equally, gradually, and gently be again urged to their
                            greatest velocity in the opposite direction. All this the crank effects
                            with the most exquisite nicety of adjustment; it stops the piston when
                            in motion as gently and softly as if a cushion of eider were placed to
                            receive it; and after having brought it to rest again begins and
                            accelerates its motion, as gradually and gently, to the highest velocity
                            in the opposite direction. An adjustment so perfect is only possible in
                            such a rela tion as that which subsists between the circle of the crank
                            and the axis of the piston. Now if we compare this mode of action with
                            any of the substitutes for the crank, by which it has been proposed to
                            gain uriformity of power, we shall find that in these it would be
                            required that the transitions from rest to motion and from motion to
                            rest should be instantaneous; and hen∣∙e such arrangements, being soon
                            disordered, have been abandoned, lt will also be found that in rotatory
                            engines it is necessary that the transitions and changes of arrangement,
                            where these exist, are necessarily instantaneous, or if not, that steam
                            is lost, or that the boasted uniformity of power is sacrificed.</p>
                        <p>3. The next property of the crank, as an elementary machine for the
                            conversion of motion, is its remarkable power of reducing errors of
                            construction, arrangement, and execution. It is one of the highest
                            recommendations of a piece of mechanism that any trivial errors
                            committed in its construction shall not materially injure its
                            efficiency; and that any slight derangement in its adjustment shall not
                            be attended with immediate deterioration or aggravated injury; but that,
                            on the other hand, the efficiency of the machine shall be consistent
                            with such degrees of correctness in workmanship, and accuracy in
                            adjustment, and care in making use of it, as are consistent with the
                            ordinary amount of intelligence and attention of ordinary workmen; and
                            that the progress of derangement and necessary tear arid wear shall be
                            so gradual as to give timely warning of danger, and admit of ready
                            repair and re-adjustment. The crank is precisely such a piece of
                            mechanism. Errors in adjustment or construction of valves and other
                            vital mechanism, are diminished in effect by the crank one hundredfold;
                            the changes of the valves, the essential part of the mechanism, take
                            place only at the top and bottom of the stroke. Now at these instants
                            the crank is on the “line of the centres,” as it is technically called;
                            and it is just in this position that a minimum of force is made to act
                            on the crank, so that if the valves do not open with perfect precision,
                            but either a little too soon, or a little too late, then will such error
                            at that part of the circuit be of comparatively trifling consequence,
                            because then the motion of the piston is so slight, that through an arc
                            of twenty degrees of the crank it does not describe the hundredth part
                            of that space; and the effect of any error committed within that range,
                            will not affect the result in the crank by one hundredth part of its
                            full amount.</p>
                        <p>In like manner, errors in management and errors arising from wearing, are
                            reduced a hundredfold in effect by transmission through the crank. It
                            has frequently been to us matter of astonishment, to see at the mouths
                            of coalpits, mines, and quarries, mere remnants of engines, frail rusty
                            old fragments of iron and wood, so loose as scarcely to stand upright
                            upon their bases, to see these superannuated drudges still performing
                            heavy work to a very large percentage of their full power.<pb break="no"
                            facs="ht:chi.28490924&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=779"
                            xml:id="kp-eb0720-0779-0671"/> 4. To these circumstances we may add,
                            that it is to the possession of these properties that we may attribute
                            the fact, that reciprocating engines are constructed of enormous weight
                            in their moving parts, and of ponderous dimensions, without being
                            thereby sensibly deteriorated in working. The crank acquires a slow
                            motion at the commencement of the stroke, and an accelerated motion is
                            thereby acquired in a manner equally gradual by all parts of the
                            machine; and in like manner, at the termination of the stroke, it brings
                            them to rest again in a gradation so gentle and uniformly retarded, as
                            again to receive from them much of the impetus which it had formerly
                            communicated. The impetus, therefore, given to the reciprocating parts
                            is only <hi rend="italic">lent,</hi> not <hi rend="italic"
                            >lost.</hi></p>
                        <p>We have thus endeavoured to expose the nature of the fallacy under which
                            they labour who imagine that the present steam-engine, as derived from
                            Watt, is a machine which destroys or absorbs a large portion of the
                            power it is designed to transmit, and who look to the rotatory engine as
                            a means of increasing the amount of the power given out in useful
                            effect. That the rotatory engines which appear day after day are not
                            new, we show from the fact, that the five great classes which comprehend
                            them all have already been invented and re invented by upwards of a
                            hundred individuals. That their inventions have been unsuccessful, is
                            manifest from the nonexistence of their machines in the daily use of
                            ordi nary manufactures. That the failures of these contri vances did not
                            arise from defects accidental to the peculiar arrangements and
                            contrivances of the engine, is rendered probable by the great variety of
                            forms in which they have been reinvented, tried, and abandoned. That
                            they have not failed from deficiencies in the workman ship and practical
                            details, is rendered still more probable by the circumstance of finding
                            among the names of inventors those of the most eminent practical
                            engineers. We have next shown, that in theory, the crank of the
                            steam-engine in common use cannot, as has been sup posed, be attended
                            with a loss of power, as such loss would oppose the established doctrine
                            of virtual velocities. It is also shown, from very simple and elementary
                            considerations, that what appears to be lost in force is resumed in
                            velocity; that in proportion as the mean force on the piston is greater
                            than the mean force on the crank, in that proportion is the space
                            described by the latter greater than the space described by the former;
                            that the dynamical effect produced in a given time, is exactly in the
                            proportion of the steam expended in that given time. And thus have we
                            arrived at the conclusion, that the common reciprocating crank
                            steam-engine has not the faults attributed to it in theory, and which
                            the rotatory engines have been designed to remedy. We have next taken
                            the practical view of the subject. In simplicity of parts, the rotatory
                            engine has no advantage over the reciprocating piston; in difficulty of
                            construction, the rotatory piston far exceeds the reciprocating engine:
                            it is more expensive at the outset—it has more friction—it is more bulky
                            and less compact—it is inferior in precision and uniformity of action to
                            the crank engine—and there is a radical fault inherent in the very
                            nature of rotatory mechanism, from which it follows that the rotatory
                            engine can never be rendered either an economical or a durable machine.
                            We have further shown, that even if the rotatory engine could be made
                            economical and durable, its very nature renders it un suited to the
                            great purposes of steam navigation and inland locomotion; objects to
                            which it has been considered peculiarly applicable. We deemed it an
                            appropriate and instructive conclusion to our enquiry, to examine into
                            the action of the crank, for the purpose of discovering what those
                            remarkable qualities are which have given to the crank of the common
                            steam-engine its unrivalled superiority as an element for the production
                            of circular motion, and a degree of perfection unattainable by any other
                            mechanism. We have seen that well constructed crank steam-engines are
                            daily performing duty which is within ten per cent of the theoretical
                            maximum of possible effect—of absolute perfection; that this practical
                            perfection arises from the simplicity of the crank, from its wonderful
                            adaptation to the nature and laws of tarnter, and of circular motion in
                            connexion with rectilineal motion—from its reduction of errors either in
                            construction, adjustment, or management, so as to work well without the
                            absolute necessity of greater intelligence, expertness, and precision
                            than belong to ordinary work men—and from the compensating nature of the
                            arrangement of its structure, by which it is accommodated in a
                            remarkable degree to the necessary imperfections of all human
                            mechanism.</p>

                        <p>The construction of a boiler must appear so simple an arrangement of
                            materials, as to require very little inge unity or contrivance; a large
                            enough boiler placed upon a large enough tire being sufficient to
                            generate any requisite supply of steam. Simple, however, as such an
                            arrangement may seem, the best construction of boiler is a subject upon
                            which very widely different and even opposite opinions are entertained
                            by men of the greatest science and experience. There is perhaps no
                            branch of practical art in which so much remains to be determined and
                            improved, and scarcely any which science has done so little to advance.
                            To follow servilely what has, in a given instance, been “found to
                            answer,” is the rule of the most sagacious mechanics, and the doctrine
                            of the wisest authors. Those who have attempted to in vent have commonly
                            erred; those who have generalized have invariably been rash and
                            unsuccessful, and their erroneous theories have led astray their
                            followers, when they happen to have any.</p>
                        <p>The art of constructing steam-boilers is, we have said, in its infancy;
                            but it is likely, we think, to make rapid progress. The construction of
                            the boiler of the locomotive-engine, which every day performs what at a
                            former period we should have termed impossibilities, exhibited a
                            strikingly anomalous phenomenon, by which the attention of all men who
                            thought upon such subjects was suddenly arrested: this little barrel of
                            water generates as much steam in an hour, as would formerly have been
                            raised from a boiler and fire occupying a considerable house. The
                            frequent explosion of boilers, both here and in America, has also
                            directed attention to the efficient construction of boilers. The patient
                            experimental enquiry that has since been set on foot, must lay open the
                            whole of the important parts of the question so tho roughly, and bring
                            out the facts with such clearness and precision, as to lead, by safe and
                            rapid induction, to the general principles by which we may be able to
                            predict the result of every supposed case, and deduce safe rules for the
                            guidance of practical men in all circumstances. The investigation of the
                            whole subject of steam-boilers, recently undertaken in America by the
                            Franklin Insti tute, has already done much to settle many pointe of
                            dispute. The publication of the reports of the American and English
                            Governments on the explosions of steam-boilers, has elicited many
                            valuable contributions<pb break="no"

                            practical treatise of Mr Armstrong has given us an instructive view of
                            the state of practice in the busy district of Lancashire; the treatises
                            of Mr Wood and M. de Pampbour on Railway Locomotives; and the papers, in
                            the Transactions of the Institution of Civil Engineers, on the
                            statistics of Boilers and Combustion, have supplied and discussed a
                            large collection of important facts, that will materially assist the
                            future investigation of the best construction of steam boilers.</p>
                        <p>During the first period of the history of the steam engine, the danger of
                            bursting the boiler, and the difficulty of making it strong enough to
                            resist the internal force acting towards explosion, and also of making
                            the joints tight against the leakage of highly elastic steam, formed the
                            chief obstacles to the introduction of steam as a mechanical mover.</p>
                        <p>The first important point in preparing a steam-boiler is to secure
                            strength, without unnecessary expense of mate rials. If we take the
                            simplest form of vessel: suppose a simple rectangular watertank—suppose
                            the vessel on a small scale, made of sheet-iron, and soldered at the
                            edges so as to form an airtight box; then, by simply blowing into it, we
                            shall manifest its weakness; for the sides will first of all bulge out,
                            and, if the materials yield and allow the vessel to change its shape, it
                            will at last swell into a globular form, with angular knobs upon it at
                            the cor ners, from which pyramidal extremities, the globular parts, will
                            finally he torn away with an explosion which will, in all probability,
                            take place long before the vessel has attained the shape mentioned
                            above.</p>
                        <p>The globular or spherical shape was very early adopt ed, as one of
                            greatest capacity, as a shape in which, the pressure at every point
                            being equal, there remained no force tending to produce flexure, or
                            destroy the equilibrium of strength and strain at any point. A fire was
                            then lighted below the boiler, and the steam confined until the heat had
                            raised it to the temperature required for the given pressure. This form
                            was accordingly adopted by Hero, Savary, and others, as may be seen in
                            the representations of their boilers, which we have given in the
                            historical portion of the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Steam
                            Engine.</hi> lt was soon found that a spherical boiler, being set upon
                            an open fire, required an enormous consumption of fuel to raise a small
                            quantity of steam, the heat being co piously radiated not alone to the
                            water in the boiler, but also in very great quantity to the surrounding
                            objects, besides being rapidly carried off by the air. To surround the
                            spherical boiler with nonconducting substances, and to keep the flame
                            throughout its whole extent in contact with the surface of the boiler,
                            so as to prevent radiation to surrounding objects, and also to diminish
                            the size of the fire by making it wind round the boiler, were the first
                            steps towards improvement; and we accordingly find in the work of Dr
                            Desaguliers the subsequent form of a boiler. Fig. 198 is a front view of
                            the boiler <hi rend="italic">set</hi> in a building of brick, a
                            substance which is good as a non-conductor of heat, and calculated to
                            withstand the destructive action of fire. A deep <hi rend="italic"
                            >ashpit</hi> lies immediately under the fire, which rests on a number of
                            parallel iron <hi rend="italic">bars,</hi> placed so close to each other
                            as to prevent the fuel from falling through, and at the same time to
                            admit between them the air requisite for combustion; and the <hi
                            rend="italic">door of the furnace</hi> being kept closed at all times,
                            except when fuel is to be added to the fire, the whole of the matter of
                            the fuel is in this way supplied with air, which passes up through the
                            interstices of the bars. The flame, after having passed along lhe bottom
                            of the boiler, winds in a corkscrew form around its sides, in contact
                            with the surface of the boiler, in a spiral channel formed by the
                            bricks, and called a <hi rend="italic">flue,</hi> by which the smoke and
                            hot air are at last conveyed into a <hi rend="italic">chimney. A
                            damper,</hi> as it is called, is formed by a small plate of iron,
                            admitted through a slit into the opening where the flue joins the
                            chimney; so that, by pushing this plate into the opening, the passage of
                            the smoke out into the chimney, and consequently of the fresh air into
                            the fire, may be obstructed, the combustion of the fuel retarded, and
                            the too rapid generation of steam prevented. In this simple way, the
                            attendant is enabled, by merely pushing in or drawing out the damper, to
                            regulate with great precision the generation of the steam. The pipe
                            which conducts the steam to its ultimate destination, is called the <hi
                            rend="italic">steam-pipe;</hi> and there is another pipe necessary to
                            the continued action of the boiler, called a <hi rend="italic"
                            >feedpipe,</hi> through which water may be made to enter the boiler, as
                            it is evident that otherwise the water, being continually boiling off in
                            the shape of steam, would soon leave the boiler empty; so that a
                            constant supply of an inch of water forevery foot of steam, or six
                            gallons of water for every horse power, is required to enter the boiler
                            through the feedpipe.</p>
                        <p>The form of boiler next in simplicity to the spherical boiler is the
                            cylindrical. From the facility with which a cylinder is made, it was
                            introduced at a very early period. It stood upright, as in fig. 199, the
                            fire being placed at the bottom, and the flue winding round that part of
                            the sides covered with water. This form of boiler was found, however, to
                            have the disadvantage of weakness in the bottom part.</p>
                        <p>For the prevention of these two evils, the cylindrical form of boiler was
                            very soon modified and improved by two opposite expedients, one applied
                            at the top and the other at the bottom of the cylinder. The top being
                            made hemispherical, possessed all the advantages of a spherical boiler;
                            and the bottom being arched upwards, so as to present a large concave
                            dome to the impact of the flame, this dome being sustained by the
                            cylindrical belt round its spring, a very strong and extensive surface
                            was obtained, as in Fig. 200.</p>
                        <p>In this cylindro-spherical boiler, it was found that the action of the
                            flame on the upright round sides produced a very slight effect in
                            raising heat. It was therefore desirable that the flame should he
                            brought somewhat under the sides, by inclining them a little outwards.
                            The boiler then assumed a form which has since become very common, and
                            from its shape, has not inaptly been named the naycock boiler, fig.

                            xml:id="kp-eb0720-0781-0673"/> The same effect was next obtained in many
                            of the boilers of Newcomen, in the way represented in fig. 202, so that
                            the flame in the flues impinged upon a surface directly over them; the
                            flues in this case forming a recess in the sides of the boiler, instead
                            of being built around it by the brickwork alone. In process of time,
                            boilers of much larger size came to be required, and the spherical shape
                            was found cumbrous and too capacious, that is to say, contained an
                            enormous mass of water, which it required much time and fuel to heat to
                            the boiling point before any steam could be raised. The diameter, also,
                            of the boiler was so great when much steam was required, that the
                            enormous dome became weakened. To make a stronger boiler, and one which
                            should, at the same time, cover a large fire, the <hi rend="italic"
                            >waggon boiler</hi> was introduced by Mr Watt; an oblong boiler, of
                            whose form no better definition can be given than the descriptive
                            epithet which forms its name. It closely resembles those long, heavily
                            laden, four-wheeled wag gons, which a team of six or eight horses may
                            occasion ally be seen dragging along with difficulty.</p>
                        <p>The waggon boiler is made of considerable length, and its transverse
                            section, fig. 203, resembles that of the old circular boiler.</p>
                        <p>In this form the boiler was long made by Messrs Watt and Bolton. It was
                            afterwards improved by hollowing inwards the sides, for the purpose of
                            bringing them more immediately over the flame. Of this form of the
                            waggon boiler, which is universally used at the present day, fig. 204
                            exhibits a transverse, and fig. 205 a longitudinal section. These forms
                            of boiler, although very convenient, are weak: they are very different
                            from the spherical or cylindro-spherical boilers in strength and safety.
                            The metal of which they consist is not in the form that will resist, to
                            the utmost of its tensile force, a change of shape; but, on the
                            contrary, a very small pres sure has been found sufficient to bulge
                            these boilers downward towards the fire, and outwards at the sides.</p>
                        <p>From this circumstance it has been found necessary to place in them
                            strong iron stays, for the purpose of connecting a given part of the
                            surface of the boiler having a tendency to bulge out in one direction,
                            with a similar portion of surface, having a tendency to bulge out in the
                            opposite direction; so that this tie-bar being stretched in opposite
                            ways, is made to resist, by its tensile force, the outward or bursting
                            pressure. These stays are essential to strength and security in boilers
                            having large surfaces, concave outwardly, or perfectly flat. Their
                            application to the forms of boilers which we have just described, is
                            seen in figs. 206, 207, and 208.</p>
                        <p>To avoid the use of stays, and to secure great strength without any other
                            metal than the shell of the boiler itself, is the object of that
                            construction of cylindric boiler now much in use, especially where
                            considerable pressure is used. It is certainly one of the cheapest,
                            safest, and best boilers. A cylinder, figs. 209 and 210, perhaps thirty
                            feet in length and four feet in diameter, with two hemispherical ends,
                            is laid with its axis nearly horizontal; and below it, at one end, is
                            placed the fire, enclosed by brick, as usual. The flame traverses the
                            bottom of the boiler, beating directly upon its under horizontal surface
                            till it reaches the end farthest from the fire. The flame and hot air
                            then return along the one side of the cylinder, being confined in a
                            brick flue, and, passing along in front of the end which is over the
                            fire, traverses the other side towards the chimney, which it enters
                            after having thus traversed the length of the boiler three times, and
                            applied its heat successively to every point of the cylinder which is
                            covered with water. This is a boiler that requires no stays, and is
                            valuable where room is not important. It contains much water, requires
                            much heat to raise its temperature after being cooled at night, and is
                            very bulky.</p>
                        <p>The Americans have adopted this boiler to a great ex tent. It was
                            introduced among them by the ingenious Evans. It is generally of a
                            smaller diameter than three feet, and has flat cast-iron ends of great
                            thickness, which they call heads.</p>
                        <p>These boilers, the spherical, cylindrical, and waggon shaped, may
                            properly be denominated the simple boilers. But some hundreds of kinds
                            of boilers have been invented for different purposes; almost all of them
                            designed to save either bulk, weight, or fuel. Some of these have been
                            much more successful than others; and it<pb break="no"

                            xml:id="kp-eb0720-0782-0674"/> is necessary to examine upon what
                            principles any improvements attempted in boilers should proceed. In
                            steam navigation, diminished bulk, weight, and con sumption of fuel, are
                            all objects of the first importance, as also in locomotive engines on
                            land.</p>
                        <p>To make a little boiler generate a great deal of steam in a very short
                            time, is a very difficult matter. Let any one take a common open
                            caldron, or boiler such as is used to boil a few gallons of water; sup
                            pose the vessel to hold 84 gallons of water, to be set on a fire so that
                            9 or 10 feet of its bottom surface are exposed to the fire; then he will
                            find that he cannot turn more than about 6 or 7 gallons of water an hour
                            into steam. By blowing the fire violently, this quantity may be
                            exceeded, but with a great waste of coal: and it will require a very
                            good chimney, with an excellent draught, to produce even 6 gallons an
                            hour in steam, which is about the quantity of water an hour required to
                            furnish steam for an engine of one horse power; 6 gallons an hour being
                            nearly one cubic foot.</p>
                        <p>Suppose, then, a greater quantity of steam is to he produced; how is that
                            to be obtained? The answer is this: only by a larger boiler and a larger
                            fire, acting on a larger surface. This general statement must be under
                            stood in the following way.</p>
                        <p>A larger boiler, calculated to generate more steam, does not exactly mean
                            one which holds more water. It is found that the power of the boiler
                            depends primarily upon the extent of its exposure to the action of the
                            fire, or, as it is generally designated, the extent of heating surface.
                            It appears that the heat cannot penetrate through the material of the
                            boiler with more than a certain rapidity, and that the water evaporated
                            over each square foot by the heat passing through, is not more than
                            about ⅗ths of a gallon in an hour; and so it requires some 9 or 10 such
                            feet of heating surface to boil off 6 gallons, or a cubic foot of water,
                            capable of producing one horse power in the steam-engine. Now, for every
                            such foot of heating surface there will be a cor responding generation
                            of steam; and a boiler having 100 square feet of surface exposed to the
                            fire will be capable of evaporating 100 times ⅗ ths of a gallon of water
                            an hour, being 60 gallons, and about 10 horse power. The extent of
                            heating surface, and not the quantity of fluid contained in it, is the
                            measure of the power of a boiler.</p>
                        <p>One great object of improvements in boilers has been, to in crease as
                            much as possible the extent of heating surface without increasing its
                            general dimensions.</p>
                        <p>One very efficient mode of doing this, is by the adoption of internal
                            flues. Thus Bolton and Watt have inserted a flue in the middle of the
                            large waggon boiler, in the manner shown in figs. 212 and 213; so that,
                            after the flame has passed along the bottom of the boiler to the further
                            end, it returns along the flue in the middle of the water to the front,
                            and then makes an entire circuit of the outside of the boiler before
                            entering the chimney. Thus, in a boiler 6 feet wide and 8 feet high and
                            20 feet long, an internal flue 3 feet wide and 3 feet deep, along the
                            whole length, adds about 240 square feet of surface to the boiler,
                            without increasing the bulk of the room taken up by it.</p>
                        <p>The same plan has been extensively employed in cylindrical boilers, the
                            flame and hot air being made to traverse a hollow tube or cylinder in
                            the interior of the boiler: sometimes several such flues have been used,
                            and these multiflued boilers are now in great repute. Several
                            modifications are given in the figures. The small internal pipes or
                            cylindric flues, surrounded with water, traverse the whole length of the
                            boiler, and expose a greater quantity of surface of water to the action
                            of heat, in pro portion as the tubes are small and numerous. These
                            tubular-flued boilers are at the present day extensively used. They
                            economize space, and, with a small exterior surface of boiler, generate
                            a large quantity of steam. They are much used in Cornwall, in marine
                            boilers, and in locomotive boilers.</p>
                        <p>In these boilers a large surface is still exposed to the cold air, and
                            the brickwork in which the fire is placed radiates off a considerable
                            portion of heat, which is lost. To remedy this evil, the furnace has
                            been so contrived that the fire is in the inside of the boiler. This was
                            probably done for the first time by Smeaton, who succeeded in producing
                            almost as high a proportion of steam from fuel as engineers of a more
                            modern date. His portable-engine boiler is represented below, figs. 216,
                            217. The interior of this haycock boiler contains a hollow ball of
                            cast-iron, in which the fuel is burned. Air enters by an aperture at the
                            bottom, a large cast-iron pipe leads through the water to the door, and
                            another pipe in the opposite direction passes through the water,
                            conducting the products of combustion to the chimney, immediately round
                            which is introduced the fresh supplies of cold water for replenishing
                            the boiler.</p>
                        <p>But a much better boiler than this, and one indeed which might bear
                            comparison with many boilers of the present day, is one given by Mr
                            Farey as the invention of an unknown author. In the centre of a large
                            old fashioned haystack boiler, figs. 218, 219, is placed a large round
                            furnace, from which there passes a simple rectangular flue, winding
                            round and round the<pb break="no"
                            facs="ht:chi.28490924&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=783"
                            xml:id="kp-eb0720-0783-0675"/> boiler in spiral circuits till it reaches
                            the outside, and thence passes to the chimney.</p>
                        <p>In the same way it has often been provided that the furnace should be in
                            the interior of a cylindrical boiler, by placing another cylindrical
                            tube of large dimensions in the interior of the outer case, to serve at
                            once as fur nace and flue. This was probably first done by Trevithic,
                            the advocate of high-pressure engines in this country.</p>
                        <p>To the great central flue there have been sometimes added lateral flues
                            on each side, for the return of the products of combustion, fig. 221.
                            Thus, again, this internal flue has been made elliptical, fig. 222, a
                            dangerous and weak form.</p>
                        <p>It is one of the faults of the boilers that have their fires in the
                            internal tubes, that the ashpit and interior of the furnace over the
                            fuel are so confined, as to pre vent that perfect combustion of fuel
                            which may bo obtained by a deep ashpit, a large expanse of fire grate,
                            and a deep and wide furnace. These evils may, in some measure, be
                            obviated by an internal flue of large dimensions; but this very large
                            one is extremely dangerous, and liable to explosion. The evil has been
                            remedied by the following species of boiler, where the fire is still
                            surrounded by water, and gives ample room for most perfect
                            combustion.</p>
                        <p>In this species of boiler, the tube opens out at the front, so as to
                            leave a semicircle or a semi-cylinder above the fire, and two vertical
                            spaces, or “water legs,” as they are called, which cover the fire on
                            both sides; thus obstructing the heat that would otherwise pass away
                            into the brick building, and at the same time covering a large and wide
                            space of furnace bars, a deep ashpit, and so ensuring adequate
                            combustion. The internal surface of this boiler has been still further
                            increased, by substituting for this single tube a number of smaller ones
                            six inches in diameter.</p>
                        <p>After passing through all these tubes, the flame and hot gases again
                            return along the bottom and sides on the right of the boiler, and pass
                            back on the other side to the chimney. A form of boiler similar to this
                            is much used in Lancashire, and is called the Butterly Boiler. It has
                            the large internal flue, but wants the fire-legs, and in this respect is
                            inferior to the former.</p>
                        <p>Those boilers, already described, are the practical forms in use among
                            intelligent engineers. The varieties of boiler that have been invented,
                            amount to some hundreds. The Patent Records of the present day teem with
                            new and improved boilers; and yet it is a matter of constant complaint
                            with engineers, that no great improvement has ever been made in boilers,
                            but that as satisfactory results have been obtained from plain, simple
                            boilers, of the kind used half a century ago, as from the modern and
                            most complex forms.</p>
                        <p>The conclusion to be drawn from all that has been attempted or achieved
                            in boilers is, we believe, the following: that there exist certain
                            limits prescribed by the constitution of fuel, the nature of metals, and
                            the properties of water and steam, which cannot be exceeded without
                            incurring evils that greatly overbalance the partial gain. The best
                            boilers that have ever existed have been those in which a large number
                            of principles have been applied, and so adjusted in relation to each
                            other as to gain the maximum, not of any one property, but of all the
                            valuable properties, each in the degree of its individual importance.
                            The first cost of the boiler must not be rendered too great, or that
                            will neutralize the economy of using it: the space to which it is
                            confined may be as small as possible; but if that be produced by
                            intricacy of construction, the loss may surpass the advantage. Then,
                            again, if complex and confined, it may be impossible to cleanse or to
                            repair the boiler; and therefore it must be remembered, that, unless
                            easy access can be gained to every part of a boiler, and of its flues,
                            that boiler will soon become totally useless. Then it is further
                            demanded <pb break="no" facs="ht:chi.28490924&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=784"
                            xml:id="kp-eb0720-0784-0676"/>of a good practical boiler, that, if one
                            part should be damaged or give way, the whole should be so constructed
                            that the damage done to that part must not endanger the rest. An
                            extensive heating surface is to be obtained for economy’s sake; but that
                            large surface must at the same time remain unimpaired to resist
                            bursting; a property to a certain extent inconsistent with extensive
                            surface. The surface which is thus spread as widely as possible, so as
                            to apply the fire to the water through every part of its mass minutely
                            and in great subdivisions, if extended beyond a certain degree, will not
                            have over it a body of water capable of conducting heat from it with the
                            rapidity adequate to the rapid generation of steam, and to the
                            preservation of the intensely heated metal from the destructive action
                            of the fire. Then, again, it is desirable to have long and tortuous
                            flues, to extricate as much heat as possible from the fuel and the
                            products of combustion; but these, by their very length, may interfere
                            with the draught of the chimney, so as to diminish the efficacy and
                            vigour of the combustion of the fuel, and produce loss instead of gain.
                            Thus it happens that the whole question of boilers is an exact and
                            judicious combination and adjustment of parts, so as to obtain each of
                            these many points in that degree which is most advantageous for every
                            one of the other qualities, and of all of them together. The question is
                            a practical one of no common difficulty.</p>
                        <p>It is principally by the collection of facts, of accurately recorded
                            statistics of boilers, of the practical experience of the most eminent
                            engineers, that we can gather data for the solution of the question of
                            the best boiler. We are not without such data, although it is much to be
                            regretted that they are not so abundant as we should wish. We shall now
                            examine the various points in the structure and functions of a boiler in
                            a simple succession.</p>
                        <p>The materials of which a boiler should be formed, have been a subject
                            much discussed. Copper, iron, brass, cast-iron, lead, and even stone,
                            have been employed. Boilere of steam-vessels are frequently made of
                            copper. Many steam-boilers have been made of cast-iron, and have lasted
                            long, and been very efficient under careful management.
                            Wrought-iron-plate boilers are very common in this country; and in
                            America have been much used, with cast-iron ends or heads of
                            considerable thickness. The boilers of locomotive engines have the
                            interior, which is exposed to the direct impact of the flame, formed of
                            copper, and sometimes partly of brass; the exterior of the boiler being
                            wrought-iron. Cast-iron boilers were extensively used under Mr Smeaton,
                            towards the end of last century; and when used with care, were employed
                            with advantage where fuel was plentiful, from their cheapness. A stone
                            exterior jointed with cement, the interior being copper, where subject
                            to great heat, and when the steam has scarcely any greater pressure than
                            the atmosphere, has also been employed; and a dome or cupola of lead was
                            often seen, in earlier times, when the art of working iron-plate was
                            less common than it is now, forming the cover of the antiquated
                            Hay-stack Boiler, which, in these times, the “Waggon” of Watt has almost
                            entirely removed out of use.</p>
                        <p>Copper is the best of all substances for steam-engine boilers, in a
                            mechanical point of view. That it is not best in a mercantile point of
                            view, is proved by the almost universal use of wrought-iron boilers. Yet
                            it is difficult to see why this should be the case, if we remember that
                            copper lasts for ever, and is worth, when old, nearly two-thirds of its
                            first cost, besides being a much better conductor of heat, and so saving
                            fuel and space. The labour, too, of making a copper boiler is no greater
                            than an iron one. The relative value of these materials for boilers may
                            be stated thus ;—.</p>

                        <p>The combination of all these ratios is in favour of copper; and if we add
                            the trouble of replacing the new iron boiler, and detaching it from all
                            its connexions, five times for once in the case of copper, the scale
                            still further preponderates on the same side. We must look, therefore,
                            for the explanation of the general use of iron to the state of
                            mercantile affairs, and the value of money in a commercial community. It
                            proves that a certain loss, within 15 or 20 years, in a proportion of 12
                            to 1, is considered preferable to an original expenditure of four times
                            the amount of capital; showing either that the price of money is too
                            high for such an investment, or that the contingencies of mercantile
                            life are too great to allow the risk of so large a sum as the value of a
                            copper boiler for the period required to reimburse the proprietor. Rich
                            governments and individuals have not failed to profit by this knowledge;
                            but it may be noticed of a government which considers its tenure of
                            office insecure, that it does not furnish even its war-steamers with
                            copper boilers, as that would involve the expenditure of a large sum by
                            which their successors would profit. So also the man who is shortened in
                            means, but hopes to be rich enough by the time one boiler is done to get
                            a new one; or who does not know whether he shall be solvent so long as
                            to see the boiler out; or who, at any rate, cannot spare so much money
                            at once—procures at once the cheapest boiler he can; and finds, as
                            usual, that in a short time the expenses of coal and of repairs have
                            drawn from him a heavier than the usurer’s percentage. All this applies
                            more peculiarly to steam-vessels.</p>
                        <p>Another peculiarity of copper is the greater safety which arises from the
                            uniformity of its texture. It is scarcely possible to account for the
                            singular differences of sheets of iron that have passed nominally
                            through the same processes of manufacture. One plate will become
                            deteriorated by heat in half the time of another apparently identical.
                            The parts of the same plate are frequently heterogeneous. The
                            consequences of this heterogeneity are serious, and sometimes
                            destructive: a single plate in a series gives way, and, having broken
                            the chain of connexion, the whole fabric is destroyed; or a latent crack
                            developes itself in the place most difficult to restore; or one plate,
                            or a part of it, is burnt through when all the rest remains sound. All
                            this tells in favour of copper. The matter of the copper is very nearly
                            homogeneous: its durability is nearly uniform, if it is not made too
                            thick. We have examined the part of a copper boiler exposed to most
                            intense heat after years of action, and found, when the soot was cleared
                            away, the smooth shining surface, produced by the rollers in the process
                            of manufacture, remaining as perfect as the day after the boiler was
                            started. In this case the metal was no more than one-eighth of an inch
                            thick.</p>
                        <p>There are some forms of boiler for which copper is less suitable than
                            iron. The strength of copper to resist flexure is not nearly so great,
                            especially at high temperatures, as that of iron. A copper boiler must
                            therefore be well stayed, and if there be round, or any other unstayed
                            flues in the boiler, they cannot be of more than a foot in diameter
                            without incurring danger; they will readily collapse or bend. Thia
                            caution in regard to<pb break="no"

                        <p>In the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Steam,</hi> we have already
                            introduced our readers to the important experimental researches of the
                            Commission of the Franklin Institute in America, concerning the
                            structure, phenomena, and explosions of steam-boilers. We shall, in
                            another place, present the results of their investigations of the causes
                            of explosion. But there is a branch of the investigation undertaken by
                            the committee, which is of importance to our present enquiry. It regards
                            the strength of the materials of steam-boilers; a subject not before
                            satisfactorily examined; and relates more immediately to the effect of
                            high temperatures on the cohesive attraction of the particles of metals;
                            an enquiry essential to our knowledge of the manner in which the known
                            strength of metal, when cold, may be altered when, in a boiler, it is
                            subject to the action of a fierce fire. The subcommittee to whom this
                            subject was intrusted, were men of great practical skill and eminent
                            scientific attainments. Professor Walter R. Johnson, Benjamin Reeves,
                            Esq., and Professor A. Dallas Bache, were the members to whom the
                            enquiry Was committed; and it has been carried on with a degree of
                            judgment in its arrangements, and of precision in the experiments, which
                            warrant our implicit confidence in the results, and deserve our sincere
                            thanks for the valuable additions made to our knowledge of this
                            important and difficult subject. The importance of the branch of enquiry
                            committed to these gentlemen, may be judged of from the following
                            statement of its principal branches.</p>

                            elongation in boiler plate, and that which will entirely overcome its
                            tenacity?</p>
                        <p>11. What amount of elongation may the several kinds of metallic plates

                        <p>These are some of the many important subjects of experiment undertaken by
                            the committee. They have discharged the duties devolved upon them in a
                            manner which is highly honourable to themselves, and which reflects
                            great credit on the institution and the country that has sent forth into
                            the world so valuable a contribution to practical science. We regret
                            that the limits of this article will not permit us to enter into the
                            experimental details and subsidiary enquiries connected with the
                            extensive and laborious investigation; details which are always
                            ingenious and instructive, and will amply repay the minute study of the
                            mechanical philosopher or engineer as a valuable body of experimental
                            truth. But, although we cannot convey to our readers the pleasure we
                            have enjoyed in the perusal of these interesting records, we should do
                            them and our subject injustice did we omit to convey to them the general
                            conclusions which have been obtained.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Strength of Copper Boiler Plates</hi> The experiments
                            upon this subject were very numerous. 32° being taken as the standard,
                            it was found that the increments of heat always caused a diminution of
                            strength. Thus, a stripe of copper, capable of carrying 10,000 lbs., was
                            only capable of carrying 7,500 lbs. when heated to a temperature of
                            500°; while at 820° the same bar could support no more than a tension of
                            5,000 lbs, and at 1200° a visibly red heat in day-light no more than
                            about a tenth part of the strength remains. By these experiments the law
                            which connects the diminution of cohesion with the increase of
                            temperature has been accurately determined, and it appears conformable
                            to the following simple expression,</p>
                        <p>σ=σ</p>

                            been ascertained for one temperature, it may be found for every other
                            according to the following rule. From the logarithm of (<hi
                            rend="italic">t'</hi>) the temperature (reckoned from 32°) of the
                            diminution sought, subtract the logarithm of a given temperature, (<hi
                            rend="italic">t</hi>) and multiply three halves of the remainder by the
                            logarithm of the known diminution (d) of strength at the latter
                            temperature, and the product is the logarithm of the required diminution
                            at the temperature assigned.</p>
                        <p>The following table exhibits the close accordance of the experiments with

                        <p>We are, therefore, warranted in admitting the conclusion, that the square
                            of the diminution of strength varies with the cube of the
                            temperature.</p>
                        <p>Hence we learn, that between the temperature of freezing and boiling
                            water copper loses 5 per cent of its strength; that at 550° it loses
                            about a quarter of its strength; at 850° the half of its strength; and
                            at 1330° loses all its strength, becoming a viscid, granular, soft,
                            incohesive, substance; although it does not actually melt until it
                            attains nearly 2000°. These phenomena in copper are strikingly at
                            variance with the phenomena exhibited by iron at the same
                            temperatures.</p>
                        <p>In this substance the remarkable anomaly was discovered, that the
                            additions of heat, instead of weakening the metal, as we should have
                            expected, and as was found<pb break="no"

                            increased its strength, so that iron plate at 550° above the freezing
                            point was 16 per cent stronger than when cold. After this point the
                            strength began to diminish rapidly, so that this point appears to be the
                            temperature of maximum strength. It was assumed as the standard
                            strength, on both sides of which the strength was found to be diminished
                            both by heat and cold. The strength diminishes rapidly with increments
                            of temperature, after passing the maximum at 570°: thus,</p>

                        <p>The law of variation of the strength of iron and of copper by temperature
                            may be easily illustrated by the following curves, of which the
                            horizontal ordinates are temperatures, and the vertical abscissas are
                            diminutions of strength.</p>
                        <p>The temperatures are measured from the origin A towards T. The total
                            strength being = AX = 1000, the diminutions of strength are represented
                            by the fractions of A X measured from A towards X. These curves
                            represent to the eye very distinctly the characteristics of the metals.
                            The line for copper, rising from zero at A, shows, by continual
                            recession from its maximum AA, the continual and regular diminution of
                            strength by increased temperature according to the law already stated.
                            The line representing the iron, on the contrary, having its origin 15
                            per cent above A, descends and shows an increase of strength until it
                            reaches a maximum about 500°, whence it suddenly rises, showing a very
                            rapid diminution of strength up to 1000°, when again it changes, turns
                            outwards having a point of inflection beyond which it may be carried to
                            a great distance, while at last it becomes liquid between 2000° and
                            3000°.</p>
                        <p>The next branch of the enquiry was, how the strength of iron is affected
                            by the mode of its manufacture, and by the different states in which it
                            is used, as in bars, in wire, or in plates, produced by hammering,
                            drawing, or rolling. The following are the results of several
                            experiments on the tenacity of different kinds of iron, at ordinary
                            temperatures.</p>

                        <p>The specific gravity of iron boiler plate was found to range from 7.7922
                            to 7.6013., and to be at a mean value 7.7344.</p>
                        <p>The effect of repeated piling and welding was found to be a great
                            increase on the strength of iron. The iron given in the preceding table,
                            from the Centre Company’s manufactory, whose strength when rolled
                            amounts to 58,400, was found to be so much improved by piling four bars
                            and welding twice, as to support a mean of 59,247 lbs., and to be so
                            homogeneous that the highest did not differ from the lowest results by
                            more than 3.4 per cent in the different specimens. Simple welding twice
                            without piling, gave a result of 58,787 lbs.</p>
                        <p>It has been thought that by welding together different kinds of iron of
                            different degrees of fineness, and then rolling it out, a valuable
                            boiler-plate might be obtained. This was tried, and the highest result
                            gave only 40,600 lbs.</p>

                        <p>The effect of use and long exposure on the strength of boiler iron was
                            found to be a great diminution of its strength, none of the specimens
                            coming up to 50,000 lbs.</p>
                        <p>The effect produced by the accidental overheating of a boiler, was found
                            to be the permanent reduction of its strength from 64,000 or 65,000
                            lbs., to 45,000 lbs. per square inch, being about <hi rend="superscript"

                        <p>The permanent extension produced on iron plate by weights much less than
                            are required finally to overcome its cohesion, was a subject of careful
                            examination. The extension began to take place in general when <hi
                            rend="superscript"> 3</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"> 5</hi> ths of the
                            breaking weight were applied, and sometimes when only <hi
                            rend="superscript"> 2</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi> ths had been
                            applied. The total extension varied between <hi rend="superscript">
                            1</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"> 10</hi> th and <hi rend="superscript">
                            1</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"> 16</hi> th of the total length, and was
                            greater in the longitudinal than the transverse direction of the
                            bar.</p>
                        <p>The following diagram of a fracture is highly instructive. The elongation
                            transversely is <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> / <hi rend="subscript">
                            10</hi> th of the original dimension, and the curve, is <hi
                            rend="superscript"> 1</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"> 7</hi> th longer than
                            the chord. The longitudinal direction of the fibres is in the line of
                            the shortest dimension. It is evident that the diminution of the
                            thickness, previously to fracture, must have greatly weakened the plates
                            of the boiler. This boiler plate was taken from that part of the boiler
                            immediately over the fire, and had burst where sediment had collected,
                            and excluded the water from contact with the boiler, so as to allow it
                            to get overheated.</p>
                        <p>It is evident that the diminution of area at the point of fracture, which
                            accompanies this stretching of the plate before fracture, must weaken
                            the plate very greatly when it is exposed to strains that stretch it
                            much beyond its initial length, this strain being about half the
                            ‘breaking strain due to the original thickness. This constriction or
                            thinning out of the plate is observed to take place much more in
                            thickness than in breadth, and to amount in iron to about 16½ per cent
                            of the whole area. It is remarkable, that the constriction was found
                            less in heated than in cold specimens of iron, a result the reverse of
                            that which we should have anticipated. The fractures at high
                            temperatures were found to take place suddenly, and the surfaces of
                            fracture presented appearances altogether different from those exhibited
                            at low temperatures; the peculiarity of the fracture at high
                            temperatures being, that the section is smooth and flat instead of
                            jagged, fibrous, and irregular, and that it takes place directly across
                            the plate, and tapering off at an angle of 45°, so that the separate
                            fragments resemble “the edges of two mortising chisels.” One result
                            which we deduce from the American investigation is, that boiler iron
                            cannot safely be trusted with a greater pressure than ’th of its
                            standard maximum cohesion. Such are some of the valuable facts elicited
                            by this transatlantic investigation. The experiments should be repeated
                            in this country upon the different species of our own iron; and we have
                            no doubt the subject will be taken up by some of those gentlemen who
                            have prosecuted valuable researches on the strength of metals; into
                            which, however, they have not yet introduced the element of high
                            temperature.</p>
                        <p>The increase of the strength of iron, with the increase of its
                            temperature up to 570°, is a remarkable anomaly which should incite us
                            to examine other metals, and metallic alloys, in a similar manner, for
                            the purpose either of resolving this phenomenon into some general law of
                            corpuscular force, or of setting it aside as a characteristic and
                            distinctive property of that singular metal. To the practical man, this
                            discovery is of importance, insomuch as it has shown him a quality in
                            iron, as a material for boilers, which may weigh strongly with him when
                            he hesitates in choosing.</p>
                        <p>The comparative value of copper and iron boilers is materially affected
                            by this enquiry. The great advantages of copper are its durability, its
                            high conducting power, and the value of the old materials. It is by no
                            means so strong as iron, being, when cold, <hi rend="superscript">
                            3</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"> 5</hi> ths of the strength of iron, and
                            at 500° only about <hi rend="superscript"> 3</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"
                            > 8</hi> ths of the strength of iron. But thin iron decays so rapidly,
                            that its strength to-day is no criterion of its strength tomorrow: it
                            decays so rapidly, especially with the salt water of steam vessels, that
                            its very strength at first is necessarily followed with subsequent
                            danger; for an iron boiler having once borne a great pressure with
                            impunity, will afterwards, when the rapid but unseen decay has
                            insiduously eaten through the metal, be again subjected to the same
                            ordeal by which it had been formerly proved; and although under
                            apparently the same circumstances, it may yield to the strain, and
                            produce the distressing consequences of a violent explosion. It is time
                            alone, then, that is the great enemy of iron boilers, while the
                            integrity of the copper will continue unimpaired for a quarter of a
                            century. On the whole, we find that the following general result should
                            limit our faith in the materials of boilers :—</p>

                        <p>To a steam-engine boiler there are many appendages, contrived for the
                            purpose of facilitating the regulation of the quantity of fuel or of
                            water, the intensity of combustion, the elasticity of the steam. One of
                            the most simple and essential of these is a water-gauge. Water-gauges
                            are of three kinds, glass-gauges, stopcockgauges, and float-gauges.</p>
                        <p>The glass-gauge is of two kinds, plane and tubular. A plane glass-gauge
                            consists simply of a small window in a boiler, of very thick glass,
                            inserted at the place up to which the water should rise in the boiler.
                            The tubular glass-gauge is a small pipe of glass about half an inch in
                            the internal diameter, and an inch and a quarter in thickness. It is
                            placed on the outside of the boiler, and communicates at the top and
                            bottom by stopcocks with the interior of the boiler; the higher stopcock
                            enters the boiler among the steam, a little above the upper surface of
                            the water, and the lower stopcock enters a little below the surface of
                            the water, so that the water, standing in the glass tube on the same
                            level with the water in the boiler, shows itself in the glass tube to
                            the attend<pb break="no" facs="ht:chi.28490924&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=788"
                            xml:id="kp-eb0720-0788-0680"/> ant. These two gauges are shown in the
                            accompanying drawings.</p>
                        <p>Fig. 231. Fig. 232. Fig. 233.</p>
                        <p>In figs. 231,232, G is the window of very thick glass, set in a brass
                            frame with a cement of red and white lead, after which, the frame is
                            firmly bolted on the front of the boiler, at the aperture to which it is
                            fitted. <hi rend="italic">gg,</hi> fig. 233, is the tube glass-gauge,
                            communicating with the water below and the steam above. There are shown
                            in the same figure two other kinds of gauges. W <hi rend="italic">w</hi>
                            is a tube open at both ends, regulated at the external termination by a
                            stopcock, but passing into the boiler, so that the other end descends
                            below the surface of the water in the boiler. Another gauge-tube S <hi
                            rend="italic">s</hi> is of similar construction, and is placed higher
                            up, so that the end S is open in the boiler among the steam. By this
                            means the engineer has it always in his power, on opening these cocks
                            successively, to determine whether there be an excess or deficiency of
                            water in the boiler; for, the orifices of the tubes in the inside of the
                            boiler are adjusted in such manner, that when the water is at the proper
                            level, it covers the orifice of the lower one, but does not reach the
                            orifice of the upper one. In this state steam will issue from the upper
                            pipe, and water from the lower pipe; but if it should be found that
                            water issues from both, the water is too high, and if steam from both,
                            there is too little water in the boiler. Another species of gauge is
                            also shown in figs. 231, 232. It consists of a float A resting on the
                            surface of the water in the boiler, to this is attached a chain, which
                            passes over a pulley C, and carries at its other end a counterweight R.
                            The pulley is fixed on an axle DD, which passes through the boiler and
                            carries on its outer end an index. The index shows, by means of a
                            dial-plate, the state of the water in the boiler.</p>
                        <p>By these means, a careful attendant may always ascertain the state of the
                            water in the boiler, with sufficient ease to enable him to regulate the
                            supply of water thrown in, or the feed of the water to the boiler, so as
                            to replace, with cold water, the deficiency occasioned by the continual
                            conversion of the water into steam. But if by any cause the attention of
                            the keeper should be directed from the examination of the state of the
                            boiler, it will gradually become emptied, and will either be exploded or
                            burned out, from being made red hot. Various contrivances have been
                            attempted for the purpose of rendering boilers automatic; so that the
                            very fact of the water becoming low in the boiler should of itself be
                            the means of furnishing a fresh supply. The manner of accomplishing this
                            is somewhat different in different circumstances; but the following
                            methods are the most common and the best.</p>
                        <p>A self-regulating feeding apparatus may be adapted to the boiler of a
                            low-pressure steam-engine, in the following simple way. The water that
                            is to feed the boiler, is to be conducted into a reservoir <hi
                            rend="italic">v r,</hi> of some 18 inches diameter, having a long pipe
                            to lead down from it to the bottom of the boiler. The top of this pipe
                            is closed by a tapered plug which hangs by the rod <hi rend="italic">v
                            r</hi>, from a lever supported at <hi rend="italic">f</hi> and having
                            two weights, one at either end, W and <hi rend="italic">w.</hi> The
                            larger weight W, of stone or cast iron, rests on the surface of the
                            water, in the boiler, and is counterpoised by a smaller weight <hi
                            rend="italic">w</hi> in such a manner, that a part of the weight W is
                            sustained by the water; therefore, whenever the water in the boiler
                            falls below the proper point, the weight W preponderates, the arm L of
                            the lever is pulled down by the wire W L, which passes steam-tight
                            through a stuffing box at <hi rend="italic">s,</hi> the end of the lever
                            <hi rend="italic">l</hi> ascends, and the valve <hi rend="italic">v</hi>
                            being withdrawn, allows the water to descend through the open end of the
                            pipe, and replenish the boiler; and after a time, when the supply has
                            become sufficient to raise the water to its proper level, the weight W,
                            and the end L of the lever, are raised, the opposite end <hi
                            rend="italic">l</hi> is depressed, and the valve <hi rend="italic"
                            >v</hi> once more closed, until a further supply has become necessary,
                            when it is given again in the same manner.</p>
                        <p>This self-acting valve is sufficiently efficient when the boiler is of
                            low pressure, or when the reservoir is more than two feet two inches
                            high above the surface of the water for every pound of pressure per
                            square inch of the boiler. But it very often happens that the boiler is
                            fed with cold water in a different manner: a force pump is attached to
                            the steam-engine, by which each stroke of the engine sends back into the
                            boiler a quantity of water equivalent to that which has been evaporated
                            out of the boiler in forming the volume of steam which has given to the
                            engine motion through that stroke by which the pump has been impelled.
                            Now, if the size of the pump were accurately proportioned, so as to
                            replace in the boiler at each stroke the precise quantity of water
                            evaporated from it in the same interval of time by the engine, it is
                            evident that no further provision for adjustment would be necessary.
                            This quantity is exactly one cubic inch of water for each cubic foot of
                            atmospheric steam given to the engine, or one cubic foot = six gallons
                            per horse-power per hour. But the evaporation of the water to a
                            steamengine is not thus uniform, nor so easily determined. The
                            variations of intensity in the fire cause steam more or less dense to
                            pass over into the engine; the steam now raises the safety-valve and
                            escapes into the air, and now falls below the standard; the boiler, now
                            tight, and again allowing water and steam to leak through its joints,
                            consumes a greater or a less quantity of steam; and thus, even with this
                            automatic supply, there is required a regulating or governing power. A
                            stopcock is attached to a pipe by which the feed-pump obtains its supply
                            of water to force into the boiler, and so, by impeding or facilitating
                            the passage of water into the boiler, the attendant may regulate the
                            supply. We have said that this cock is attached to the pipe by which the
                            pump obtains its supply of water, and not to the pipe by which the same
                            pump forces its contents into the boiler it is about to supply; and we
                            have done so for this reason, that it is dangerous to apply such a
                            stopcock on the pipe between the pump and the boiler, because, if the
                            force-pump become once filled with water, and be forced down by the
                            engine when the stopcock is wholly or nearly closed, the pipe will be
                            burst from the incompressibility of the water, unless its valves should
                            be so leaky as to allow the water to pass back into the reservoir from
                            which it bas been withdrawn. As however, it<pb break="no"

                            xml:id="kp-eb0720-0789-0681"/> is sometimes desirable to have the
                            regulating cock on the boiler feed-pipe, the following provision is made
                            to render that method of regulation safe and efficient. Between the
                            feed-pump and the boiler, there is inserted, in connexion with the
                            feed-pipe F, at any point</p>
                        <p>V beyond the valve of the pump V* which prevents the return of the water
                            into the pump, a loaded escape-valve</p>
                        <p>V; its load W being so adjusted, that whenever the regulating stopcock It
                            is turned so as to impede the passage of water towards the boiler B, the
                            force of the feedpump pushes the water up against the loaded valve V,
                            and by it escapes through the return pipe <hi rend="italic">r r r</hi>
                            into the reservoir of supply H, again to be brought back into the pump
                            when required for the future supply of the boiler.</p>
                        <p>Still, however, this apparatus depends in some measure on the adjustment
                            of the regulator-valve R by an attendant; and contrivances have been
                            invented to render this also automatic. In the boiler, and on the
                            surface of the water, is placed a weight W, with a partial counterpoise
                            <hi rend="italic">w,</hi> so as to rest on the surface of the water.
                            From the point <hi rend="italic">m</hi> a small rod passes downwards and
                            up again, through the feed-pipe L <hi rend="italic">l</hi> to the point
                            V, where a conical valve or plug V opens the communication with the
                            feed-pipe F F and the water of the boiler when it is raised, and shuts
                            it again when depressed. Now, when the water is abundant, the weight VV
                            floats high, and keeps down <hi rend="italic">m</hi> and V; and when
                            low, W descends, and raising <hi rend="italic">m</hi> and V, admits the
                            required supply into the boiler without any assistance.</p>
                        <p>Where a high-pressure boiler is used for purposes in which a steam-engine
                            is not employed, detached self-acting feeding apparatus must be
                            employed. The following elegant and most effective apparatus has been
                            invented by Mr Macdowall of Johnstown, and is now in extensive use in
                            Scotland. We have seen it in an efficient working state, after being
                            employed for many years, and it only costs about £20. It is nothing less
                            than a small steam-engine, but it is applied in a most effective and
                            simple way to the purpose designed.</p>
                        <p>A very simple feeding apparatus, on a similar principle, was adapted some
                            years ago to the purpose of feeding a boiler without the assistance of a
                            steam-engine. A close vessel or reservoir is placed above the level of
                            the boiler, and is in communication with the water in the boiler through
                            one pipe, and with the water to be supplied to the boiler through
                            another; a third small pipe connects the steam-chest of the boiler with
                            the top of the said reservoir. All these pipes being closed by moveable
                            regulators or stopcocks, the attendant is first to open the steam
                            communication, that the reservoir may be emptied of air and filled with
                            steam, and the stopcock is then shut. In the next place, the
                            communication with the cold water to be supplied is opened, and the
                            reservoir on getting cool becomes vacuous, so that the pressure of the
                            atmosphere fills it with cold water, and the communication is then cut
                            off. Lastly, the third stopcock is opened, and the water in the
                            reservoir having free communication with the water in the boiler, it is
                            only necessary to open the steam-cock once more, and the water, being in
                            equilibrium by the pressure of the steam, will run freely, by its own
                            pressure, from its height above the boiler, into it; and the process of
                            alternately filling and emptying the boiler may be repeated as often as
                            required by turning the cocks in this succession. A simple process
                            renders all these valves self-acting.</p>

                            connected with the boiler-float, would render the play of this apparatus
                            dependent on the requirements of the boiler itself. The reader who is
                            acquainted with the steam-engine of Savary, will perceive at once that
                            this reservoir, with its apparatus, is a mere Savary’s steamengine,
                            applied to pump water into the steam boiler; and that this application
                            of that engine is not liable to the objection urged against it in other
                            circumstances, namely, that the water is heated as well as raised. In
                            this instance, the communication of heat is attended with no loss.</p>
                        <p>Indices of pressure and safety apparatus, form an important series of
                            appendages to a boiler. These are of four kinds; dynamometers,
                            safety-valves, fusible plugs, and alarms.</p>
                        <p>The dynamometer, which is generally applied to measure the force of steam
                            in a boiler, is a simple tube, bent upwards at the end, and formed
                            sometimes of glass<pb break="no"

                            xml:id="kp-eb0720-0790-0682"/> and often of iron. The two ends of this
                            tube being curved up, so as to give it the form of the letter U, one of
                            these extremities is applied to the boiler, and placed in communication
                            with the steam; mercury is poured into the tube, so as to fill one-half
                            of it, and the pressure of the steam upon one of the extremities Figs.
                            241,242. Fig.243. of the column of mercury, forces the mercury to ascend
                            in the other, and to indicate, ou a divided scale, the amount of
                            pressure, which is about one pound on the inch for each inch of height
                            on the scale. It is necessary, in all these mercurial gauges, that the
                            tube be of equal diameter throughout its length. If the tube be of iron
                            instead of glass, it is necessary that a float of wood, or iron, or
                            ivory, figure 241, resting on the top of it, thou;d ascend above the
                            tube, and indicate on a scale the place of the mercury. For
                            high-pressure boilers a longer tube and scale are, of course, necessary;
                            and a very convenient form for this purpose is given in figure 243. From
                            a float resting on the fluid stretches a string carrying a counterpoise
                            at the other end, and passing over a pulley raises or depresses the
                            index of a valve on which the pounds of pressure are indicated by the
                            inches of the scale.</p>
                        <p>Another very convenient index of pressure, preferable to any other with
                            which we are acquainted, is the pistongauge. A tube of small diameter,
                            two or three inches, is bored truly cylindrical, and attached to the
                            steam chest of the boiler, figure 244. This cylinder has a solid plug or
                            piston truly turned, and ground exactly, but not loosely, into it. The
                            pressure of the steam bearing up the piston on the lever, one end of
                            which is attached to the spring indicator, gives the true indication of
                            the pressure on the piston. The spring is also applied directly above
                            the piston, as shown in the second figure; but this instrument is used
                            on a smaller scale than the other. The ordinary safety-valves are
                            described in another part of this article.</p>
                        <p>There is a species of safety boiler apparatus in which great faith has
                            been placed by many mechanicians and men of science. It has been
                            proposed and enacted that boilers be furnished with fusible plugs, or
                            that in parts of a boiler exposed to high temperature and pressure,
                            there should be placed plugs, forming small parts of the boiler, which
                            plugs being composed of metals easily melted, shall give way when by
                            accident too great pressure and heat have been employed, and so, by a
                            less evil, prevent the greater one of total disruption of the boiler.
                            This method of creating a less evil to avoid a greater, has lately been
                            shown to be fallacious, and ought to be abandoned. For the complete
                            exposure of the inadequacy of the system of <hi rend="italic">rodelles
                            fusibles,</hi> we are indebted to the Committee of the branklin
                            Institute, already so often named with gratitude. The American
                            experimenters found, that when alloys of tin, lead, and bismuth are
                            applied to steam boilers in the way recommended by the Commission des
                            Rodelles Fusibles, the alloy does not melt in the manner of an
                            homogeneous metal, ns has been supposed; but that, in fact, the more
                            fusible metal melts in the minute cells of the less fusible metal, long
                            before the whole mass becomes liquid; that the minutely divided, but
                            more obdurate metal, forms a grating, or rather sponge, in which the
                            other lies melted, so that when the temperature of the steam rises to
                            melt the first metal, the pressure of the steam gradually expels the one
                            metal out of the meshes of the other unmelted metal in globules, in such
                            a manner, that the plate at last consists merely of the one unmelted
                            metal, the other having, by repeated heatings, completely exuded from
                            it, and been replaced by such particles of debris as the water of a
                            boiler in common use always supplies in abundance. Thus, a plate of two
                            metals, originally designed to give way at 250°, may still deceive the
                            unconscious attendant, and withhold its warning till it have reached a
                            temperature of 500°, and contain a combination of caloric and water as
                            dangerous as gunpowder, and greatly more treacherous.</p>
                        <p>The following experiment will illustrate the whole of this enquiry. A
                            plate of alloyed metals, of which the melting point in the crucible was
                            about 260°, was submitted to heat under pressure. Such a plate would be
                            applied to a boiler, of which the temperature was not designed ever to
                            exceed in the most extreme case one atmosphere, and of which the usual
                            working pressure would not be more than 5 or 10 lbs. It was found that
                            at 256° small particles of melted metal began to exude from the cells of
                            the unmelted metal; the globules thus driven out were carefully
                            examined, and found to be fusible at 222°. At 260°, a second portion
                            exuded, and their dross were found to melt by themselves at 232°∙ At
                            270°, the remaining metal was still tenacious, and was not burst until
                            the steam reached a temperature of nearly 300°, with an explosive force
                            of three times that at which it should have given warning by fusion, and
                            the escape of water and steam, from the small aperture it had filled.
                            This last residual porous plate of metal was found not to melt until it
                            reached the temperature of 345° instead of 260°. “These experiments the
                            Committee (properly enough) deem conclusive, in regard to the use of
                            fusible plates in the ordinary way; and they conceive that substituting
                            fusible plugs of greater thickness, say half an inch, as has been
                            directed by a recent ordinance in France, would not serve as a remedy to
                            the defect thus exposed.”</p>
                        <p>The true remedy for this evil was the next object o the enquiries of this
                            excellent Committee. They properly inferred, that the fusion of an alloy
                            of metals at a given temperature was only to be depended on when it was
                            not exposed to the mechanical action of steam, that is, when not exposed
                            to its pressure, but only to its temperature. “The true remedy is to be
                            sought in enclosing the fusible metal in a case, in which it shall not
                            be exposed to the pressure of the steam; so that the more fluid parts of
                            the metal shall not be exposed to being forced out of the mass, but the
                            whole become fluid, as if exposed to heat in a crucible.” With this view
                            of the subject, trial was made of an apparatus described by Professor
                            Bache, in the Journal of the Franklin Institute for October 1832, under
                            the title of “An Alarm to be applied to Steam Boilers.”</p>
                        <p>The construction of Professor Bache’s alarm is sufficiently simple. “A
                            tube of iron or copper, according to the material of the boiler, closed
                            at the lower end, passes through the top of the boiler, its closed end
                            reaching the flue to which it is attached. This tube, it will be
                            observed, affords a ready access to the flue to ascertain its
                            temperature, without any restraint from packing.<pb break="no"
                            facs="ht:chi.28490924&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=791"
                            xml:id="kp-eb0720-0791-0683"/> A mass of fusible metal placed at the
                            bottom of the tube will become fluid very nearly as soon as the flue
                            takes the temperature of its fusion. To show when the metal at the
                            bottom of the tube becomes fluid, a stone is attached with a cord and
                            weight, or with a lever and weight. The weight and longer arm of the
                            line, descending, may be made to ring a bell, or turn a cock, or open a
                            valve, permitting just enough of steam to issue, to give the alarm. A
                            projection on the lower end of the rod prevents it from being drawn from
                            the metal until this latter is fused, and by widening the lower part of
                            the tube the metal is kept from being drawn out by the rod. BB, fig.

                            trumpet, or raising a valve. This apparatus of Professor Bache’s is a
                            valuable addition to the mechanism of steam.</p>
                        <p>The common alarms, the steam whistle, and the steam trumpet, may be made
                            to give noisy indications of an excessive pressure of steam. A small box
                            on the steam chest is to cover a lockup safety-valve, loaded at the
                            highest pressure the boiler should endure. On this box is to be placed a
                            steam whistle or a steam trumpet, so that an alarming noise will be the
                            consequence of any excessive pressure; for the steam issuing through the
                            aperture of the instrument will give it voice with an intensity
                            proportioned to the pressure.</p>
                        <p>In figs. 247, 248, a steam whistle is represented. A <hi rend="italic"

                            carrying, by a pillar fixed on its top, another inverted cup E. When the
                            stopcock is opened/the steam enters the cup <hi rend="italic">cc</hi>
                            through holes in the foot of the hollow piece <hi rend="italic">bb</hi>,

                            produces an exceedingly loud and shrill sound. No stopcock is, of
                            course, required when this alarm is placed on the box of a safety-valve,
                            in the manner stated nbove.</p>

                        <p>The quantity of water to be evaporated in a common steam-engine, is
                            generally reckoned at one cubic foot an hour for each horse power. But
                            if allowance be made for accidental leakage of the boiler, for blowing
                            off at the safety-valves, for priming, and other accidents, an addition
                            of one-fifth part may be provided for. The standard for calculating is,
                            however, one cubic foot of water for each horse power.</p>
                        <p>The area of the grating in the furnace on which the fuel is laid, is an
                            important element of efficiency in a steam-engine boiler. Here practice
                            somewhat varies. The bars are generally about one inch wide on the top
                            and the interstice from ¼ to ½ an inch. These apertures supply oxygen to
                            the fuel, and regulate the combustion, which is only perfect when the
                            supply of air to the incandescent fuel is ample. It is found that a
                            supply of air, such as will pass through each square foot of the area of
                            the grate of the fire, is adequate to the effectual combustion of so
                            much fuel as will, in a proper boiler, evaporate one cubic foot of water
                            an hour, and supply one horse power in a steam-engine. Thus, a fire
                            grate 6 feet long by 6 feet wide, containing 6 × 6 = 36 square feet, is
                            found to give an ample supply of air for the combustion of as much fuel
                            as will supply an engine of 36 horse power, evaporating 36 cubic feet of
                            water an hour. But although this is a safe and excellent proportion for
                            ordinary practice, yet it has been found, that with a quick draught a
                            smaller amount of fire surface is adequate to the effect required. So
                            low a proportion of fire grate as <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> / <hi
                            rend="subscript"> 3</hi> ds of a foot, and even ½ of a square foot to
                            each horse power, has been employed by eminent engineers, and has
                            succeeded, while others recommend a much larger allowance even than one
                            square foot. It is certain that the larger area of fire-grate is
                            conducive to economy and durability. The standard of surface is,
                            therefore, to be taken at the most desirable proportion, and only to be
                            deviated from where limited space, as in locomotive-engine and
                            steam-ship boilers, renders this rule inapplicable. This standard is one
                            square foot of area of grate for each horse power.</p>
                        <p>The next condition on which the success of the boiler problem depends, is
                            the extent of the surface of the boiler acted on by the fire, so as to
                            apply its heat to the water. This is also a subject on which practice
                            varies widely; so widely indeed as from 8 square feet to 36 square feet
                            per horse power. Eight square feet require a clean thin copper boiler,
                            and a very direct impact of the hottest part of the flame, with the loss
                            of a portion of the heat; but 36 square feet, on the contrary, imply the
                            possession of profuse space, and a desire to economise to the very
                            utmost the powers of the fuel. The standard of practical effect with the
                            usual iron boilers, in ordinary circumstances, is fifteen square feet of
                            heating surface for each horse power.</p>
                        <p>Of this surface, about one-third is horizontal, and two-thirds are
                            vertical surface; and of these, the horizontal surface is imagined to be
                            twice as effective as the vertical surface. Arguing on this supposition,
                            some have given it as a rule to calculate <hi rend="italic">each
                            vertical foot as only half an effective foot</hi> of heating surface,
                            and so to make nine or ten square feet of effective heating surface the
                            standard of boiler power. But this rule, though giving the same result
                            as the former, proceeds on a supposition not yet established, and which
                            does not always coincide with the fact. It will be easily seen that 5
                            feet of horizontal surface, added to 10 feet of vertical surface,
                            making, according to the one mode of calculation, 15 feet of surface,
                            divided in the proportion of two-thirds vertical and one-third
                            horizontal surface, forms an exact equivalent to the other mode—of
                            reckoning the 10 feet of vertical surface only equal to 5 effective feet
                            of surface, and adding to the said 5 effective feet of surface the 5
                            feet of horizontal surface, making in all 10 feet called effective feet
                            of heating surface..</p>
                        <p>The next essential consideration is the area of the chimney and flues. It
                            has already been given as a standard, that the fire grate should have
                            the area of one square foot for each horse power. Now, this area for the
                            admission of air should be accompanied with a sufficient passage to
                            carry off’ the gaseous products, and hot<pb break="no"

                            xml:id="kp-eb0720-0792-0684"/> air and flame resulting from combustion.
                            From an examination of the best boilers, it appears to us decided that
                            one-fifth of the area of the fire grate, gradually diminishing to a
                            chimney, which shall have one-tenth of the area of the fire grate, is an
                            excellent proportion. We therefore feel disposed to recommend it as a
                            standard for steam-engine boilers: one-fifth, diminished at the chimney
                            to one-tenth part of the area of fire grate.</p>
                        <p>The chimney should be of the same diameter throughout its interior; and
                            if of 40 feet height and one-tenth part of the area of the fire grate,
                            it will give an abundant draught. If the height of the chimney be
                            greater than this, the area may be diminished as the square root of the
                            height is increased.</p>
                        <p>The quantity of water to be contained in a boiler is a matter of some
                            importance. If we consider bulk and weight as of no consequence, and if
                            the boiler be in constant work, there cannot, perhaps, be too much
                            water. On the contrary, if there be only a small quantity, many evils
                            are encountered. In the first place, a large mass of water serves to
                            regulate the production of steam from a boiler, much in the same way as
                            a fly-wheel regulates the speed of an engine; whereas with a small
                            charge of water, the unavoidable oscillations that happen in the supply
                            of cold water or the additions to the fire, make sudden and injurious
                            changes in the production of steam. In the next place, it is well known
                            that steam is a very bad conductor of heat, and has a single capacity in
                            its gaseous state for the acquisition of caloric. Hence it is found that
                            if the production of steam be rapid, and the water present in a smaller
                            proportion, the caloric is not carried off from the metal heated by the
                            fire sufficiently fast, the boiler is overheated and rapidly
                            deteriorates, while the production of steam is greatly retarded. For
                            these reasons, it is necessary to have a large supply of water. Eight to
                            thirteen cubic feet are very commonly allowed by practical men. As a
                            standard, or perhaps as a minimum, we may assign for the quantity of
                            water in the boiler, in its mean condition, ten cubic feet of water in
                            the boiler for each horse power. In like manner, we will do well not to
                            leave a smaller proportion of capacity in a boiler for containing steam
                            than the quantity assigned for the water, being ten cubic feet of steam
                            in the boiler for each horse power.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Economy of Fuel in Steam Boilers.—</hi> The ordinary
                            consumption of coal by one of Mr Watt’s engines is 10 lbs. of fuel for
                            each horse power every hour. The work done by this fuel is equivalent to
                            the power of raising 150 lbs. 220 feet high in a minute, or of raising
                            220 times 150, that is (220 × 150 = 33,000) 33,000 lbs. one foot high,
                            or any equal product of mass by height in every minute, by the
                            combustion of 10 lbs. of coal, or 3,300 lbs. of weight raised one foot
                            high every minute, which gives in every hour 198,000 lbs., raised one
                            foot high by the combustion of one lb. of coal. This, however, by care
                            and economy, is often exceeded by Mr Watt’s engines; and the following
                            are about the standards of work done at a given expenditure of fuel in
                            ordinary engines, which is called the Duty of Steam Engines.</p>
                        <p>The Duty performed by Ordinary Steam Engines is—</p>
                        <p>One horse power exerted by 10 lbs. of fuel an hour.</p>
                        <p>Quarter of a million of lbs. raised one foot high by one lb. of coal.</p>
                        <p>Twenty millions of lbs. raised one foot by each bushel of coals.</p>
                        <p>The constant aim of engineers is to increase the amount of this duty; in
                            other words, to make a less quantity of fuel than 10 lbs. do the work of
                            one horse, or to obtain a greater duty than a quarter of a million of
                            lbs. from one lb. of fuel, or more than 20 millions of duty from a
                            bushel or 84 lbs. of fuel. To such an extent has this effort been
                            successful, that one cubic foot of water has been converted into steam
                            capable of exerting one horse power by the combustion of less than 5
                            lbs. of coal; and this steam has been so managed in the engine as to
                            raise one million of lbs. one foot high by one lb. of coal, and in one
                            case 125 millions of lbs. by a bushel of coals was the duty obtained in
                            Cornwall. Of these improvements part, is due to the economy of steam in
                            the engine itself, and does not come under this head. That part,
                            however, which is the result of economy in the boilers deserves our
                            attention here.</p>
                        <p>By a series of experiments, carefully conducted or collected, and ably
                            discussed, by Mr. Parkes of Warwick, the statistics of steam-engine
                            boilers have been placed in an aspect sufficiently clear to enable us to
                            deduce some general results of considerable economic importance. These
                            experiments are contained in the table on the opposite page.</p>
                        <p>The observations contained in this table are made upon three great
                            classes of boilers; the Cornish high-pressure boiler, I. to IV.; the
                            waggon boiler and common low-pressure boiler, V. to XIV.; and the
                            locomotive-engine boiler, XV. and XVI. The waggon boiler, V., was
                            treated at Warwick in a peculiar manner by Mr Parkes himself, who is the
                            advocate of a peculiar system of management, by which very slow
                            combustion of the fuel is produced.</p>
                        <p>The Cornish boilers I. to IV. are distinguished from the common boilers,
                            both in construction and treatment. The surface which they expose to.
                            the fire is enormous, being four or five times as great as the standard
                            of usual practice, as we find in I., where 34 horse power has a surface
                            of 2600 feet, and in II., where 48 horse power has a surface of 3170
                            feet exposed to the fire. This species of boiler is invariably
                            cylindrical, and traversed longitudinally by cylindrical iron flues. It
                            is also surrounded by external flues, except on the upper surface, which
                            is placed under a roof, and enclosed to a considerable depth in sawdust,
                            or other nonconducting matter. The circuit which the flame and hot gases
                            perform, in contact with the flues, is about 150 feet long. The
                            treatment of the Cornish boiler is as peculiar ns its structure, for
                            instead of a strong draught, a tall chimney, and an intense fire, the
                            fuel is laid on in large masses, it is allowed to cake and to consume
                            very slowly, while its products pass up the chimney after having paid a
                            leisurely visit to the two or three thousand feet of absorbent heating
                            surface that surround its long and circuitous passage towards the open
                            air. Very perfect combustion is obtained by the thorough combination of
                            the oxygen, and the ample time permitted for the communication of the
                            heat thus developed. Durability in the materials used, economy in the
                            fuel employed, and increase of useful effect, are obtained by the
                            Cornish construction and usage, to an extent that excels every other
                            mode of generating steam with which we are acquainted.</p>
                        <p>The economy of the Cornish boiler and its causes may be estimated by
                            comparison with the standards we have already given of very ordinary
                            practice.</p>

                        <p>The few selections from the valuable magazine of practical facts
                            presented in this table, serve to show how much is to be gained even
                            without the assistance of new inventions, by judicious construction and
                            treatment of ascertained and practical kinds of boilers and ordinary
                            fuel. A saving of 50 per cent over ordinary practice is gained in
                            Cornwall by large fire grates, thick fires, slow combustion, internal
                            flues, extensive fire surface, and external coverings. He who desires to
                            improve the construction or management of his boilers, has only to
                            fulfil the conditions that are now brought under his attention.</p>
                        <p>The common waggon boiler stands contrasted in all points with the Cornish
                            boiler. Yet it is cheering to see how much advantage may be gained by
                            judicious construction of fire grate, and a proper system in managing
                            the fire, as is shown in Mr Parkes’s experiments on his boiler at
                            Warwick. The only peculiarities of the Warwick treatment appear to have
                            been a largo fire grate, 1 <hi rend="superscript"> 5</hi> / <hi
                            rend="subscript"> 4</hi> square feet to the horse power, and slow
                            combustion, the high result of 10 lbs. of water evaporated by each pound
                            of fuel, and the economical result of only 6 lbs. of fuel to each H.P.
                            per hour, appear as the reward of this treatment.</p>
                        <p>The locomotive-engine boiler is in every point contrasted with the
                            Cornish boiler. To pursue this part of the investigation more minutely
                            than its exhibition in the table, would not coincide with the objects of
                            this section. (<hi rend="smallcaps">c. a.</hi>)</p>
