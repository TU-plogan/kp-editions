                <p><label type="entry"><hi rend="smallcaps">Self-Love</hi></label> is that
                    instinctive principle which impels every animal, rational and irrational, to
                    preserve its life and promote its own happiness. It is very generally confounded
                    with selfishness; but we think that the one propensity is distinct from the
                    other. Every man loves himself, but every man is not selfish. The selfish man
                    grasps at all immediate advantages, regardless of the consequences which his
                    conduct may have upon his neighbour. Self-love only prompts him who is actuated
                    by it to procure to himself the greatest possible sum of happiness during the
                    whole of his existence. In this pursuit the rational self-lover will often
                    forego a present enjoyment to obtain a greater and more permanent one in
                    reversion; and he will as often submit to a present pain to avoid a greater one
                    hereafter. Self-love, as distinguished from selfishness, always comprehends the
                    whole of a man's existence, and in that extended sense of the phrase, we
                    hesitate not to say that every man is a self-lover; for, with eternity in his
                    view, it is surely not possible for the most disinterested of the human race not
                    to prefer himself to all other men, if their future and everlasting interests
                    could come into competition. This indeed they can never do; for though the
                    introduction of evil into the world, and the different ranks which it makes
                    necessary in society, put it in the power of a man to raise himself, in the
                    present state, by the depression of his neighbour or by the practice of
                    injustice, yet in the pursuit of a prize which is to be gained only by
                    soberness, righteousness, and piety, there can be no rivalship among the
                    different competitors. The success of one is no injury to another; and,
                    therefore, in this sense of the phrase, self-love is not only lawful, but
                    absolutely unavoidable. It has been a question in morals, whether it be not
                    likewise the incentive to every action, however virtuous or apparently
                    disinterested?</p>
                <p>Those who maintain the affirmative side of this question say, that the prospect
                    of immediate pleasure, or the dread of immediate pain, is the only apparent
                    motive to action in the minds of infants, and indeed of all who look not before
                    them, and infer the future from the past. They own, that when a boy has had some
                    experience, and is capable of making comparisons, he will often decline an
                    immediate enjoyment which he has formerly found productive of future evil more
                    than equivalent to all its good; but in doing so they think, and justly, that he
                    is still actuated by the principle of self-love, pursuing the greatest good of
                    which he knows himself to be capable. After experiencing that truth, equity, and
                    benevolence in all his dealings is the readiest, and indeed the only certain
                    method of securing to himself the kindness and good offices of his
                    fellow-creatures, and much more when he has learned that they will recommend him
                    to the Supreme Being, upon whom depend his existence and all his enjoyments,
                    they admit that he will practise truth, equity, and benevolence, but still, from
                    the same principle, pursuing his own ultimate happiness as the object which he
                    has always in view-. The prospect of this great object will make him feel an
                    exquisite pleasure in the performance of the actions which he conceives as
                    necessary to its attainment, until at last, without attending in each instance
                    to their consequences, he will, by the great associating principle which has
                    been elsewhere explained, feel a refined enjoyment in the actions themselves,
                    and perform them, as occasions offer, without deliberation or reflection. Such,
                    they think, is the origin of benevolence itself, and indeed of every virtue.</p>
                <p>Those who take the other side of the question can hardly deny that self-love thus
                    modified may prompt to virtuous and apparently disinterested conduct; but they
                    think it degrading the dignity of a man to suppose him actuated solely by
                    motives which can be traced back to a desire of his own happiness. They observe,
                    that the Author of our nature has not left the preservation of the individual,
                    or the continuance of the species, to the deductions of our reason, computing
                    the sum of happiness which the actions necessary to these ends produce to
                    ourselves. On the contrary, he has taken care of both, by the surer impulse of
                    instinct planted in us for these very purposes. And is it conceivable, say they,
                    that he would leave the care of our fellowcreatures a matter of indifference,
                    until each man should be able to discover or be taught that by loving his
                    neighbour, and doing him all the good in his power, he would be most effectually
                    promoting his own happiness? It is dishonouring virtue, they continue, to make
                    it proceed in any instance from a prospect of happiness or a dread of misery;
                    and they appeal from theory to fact, as exhibited in the conduct of savage
                    tribes, who deliberate little on the consequences of their actions.</p>
                <p>Their antagonists reply, that the conduct of savage tribes is to be considered as
                    that of children in civilized nations, regulated entirely by the examples which
                    they have before<pb break="no" facs="ht:chi.28490924&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=97"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0720-0097-0083"/> them; that their actions cannot be the offspring
                    of innate instincts, otherwise savage virtues would, under similar
                    circumstances, be everywhere the same, which is contrary to fact; that virtue
                    proceeds from an interested motive on either supposition; and that the motive
                    which the instinctive scheme holds up is the more selfish of the two. The other
                    theory supposes, that the governing motive is the hope of future happiness and
                    the dread of future misery; the instinctive scheme supplies a present motive in
                    the self-complacency arising in the heart from a consciousness of right conduct.
                    The former is a rational motive; the latter has nothing more to do with reason
                    than the enjoyment arising from eating or drinking, or from the intercourse
                    between the sexes. See <hi rend="smallcaps">Metaphysics</hi> and <hi
