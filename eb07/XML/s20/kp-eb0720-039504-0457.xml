                    significant corrections to the OCR text, predominantly in cases of confusing "c"
                    and "e." Isolates 90 entries that were mistakenly included at the end of prior
                    entries in v1 and v2. Normalizes ordinal numbers. Separates metadata in
                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra
                    space around the <gi>pb</gi> tag. Where a word is hyphenated at a <gi>pb</gi>,

                    where the son was born, at Killicagh, on the 19th of April 1660. At a very early
                    period, he displayed a strong inclination for natural history; and this
                    propensity being encouraged by a suitable education, he employed those hours
                    which young people generally lose by pursuing low and trifling amusements, in
                    the study of nature, and contemplating her works. When about sixteen, he was
                    attacked by a spitting of blood, which threatened to be attended with
                    considerable danger, and which interrupted the regular course of his application
                    for three years. He had, however, already learned enough of physic to know that
                    a malady of this kind was not to be suddenly removed, and be prudently abstained
                    from wine and other liquors that were likely to increase it.</p>
                <p>By strictly observing this severe regimen, which he in some measure continued
                    ever afterwards, he was enabled to prolong his life beyond the ordinary bounds;
                    being an example of the truth of his own favourite maxim, that sobriety,
                    temperance, and moderation, are the best and most powerful preservatives that
                    nature has granted to mankind. As soon as he recovered from this infirmity, he
                    resolved to perfect himself in the different branches of physic, which was the
                    profession he had made choice of; and with this view lie repaired to London,
                    where he hoped to receive that assistance which he could not find in his own
                    country.</p>
                <p>On his arrival in the metropolis, he entered himself as a pupil of Stafforth, an
                    excellent chemist, bred under the illustrious Stahl; and by his instructions he
                    gained a perfect knowledge of the composition and preparation of the different
                    kinds of medicines then in use. At the same time, he studied botany at the
                    garden at Chelsea, assiduously attended the public lectures of anatomy and
                    physic, and in short neglected nothing that he thought likely to prove
                    serviceable to him in his future practice. His principal merit, however, was his
                    knowledge of natural history; and it was this part of his character which
                    introduced him early to the acquaintance of Mr. Boyle and Mr. Ray, two of the
                    most eminent naturalists of that age. His intimacy with these distinguished
                    characters continued as long as they lived; and as he was careful to communicate
                    to them every object of curiosity that attracted his attention, the observations
                    which he occasionally made often excited their admiration and obtained their
                    applause.</p>
                <p>After studying four years at London with unremitting severity, Mr. Sloane
                    determined to visit foreign countries for further improvement. In this view he
                    set out for France in the company of two other students, and having crossed to
                    Dieppe, proceeded to Paris. In the way thither they were elegantly entertained
                    by M. Lemery the elder; and in return Mr. Sloane presented that eminent chemist
                    with a specimen of four different kinds of phosphorus, of which, upon the credit
                    of other writers, Μ. Lemery had treated in his book of chemistry, though he bad
                    never seen any of them. At Paris Mr. Sloane lived as he had done in London. He
                    attended the hospitals, heard the lectures of Tournefort, De Verney, and other
                    eminent masters; visited all the literati, who received him with particular
                    marks of esteem; and employed himself wholly in study.</p>
                <p>From Paris he proceeded to Montpellier; and, being furnished with letters of
                    recommendation from Μ. Tournefort to M. Chirac, then chancellor of that
                    university, he found easy access, through his means, to all the learned men of
                    the province, particularly to M. Magnol, whom he always accompanied in bis
                    botanical excursions in the environs of that city, where he beheld with pleasure
                    and admiration the spontaneous productions of nature, and learned under his
                    instructions to class them in a proper manner.</p>
                <p>Having here found an ample field for contemplation, which was entirely suited to
                    his taste, he took leave of his two companions, whom a curiosity of a different
                    kind led into Italy. After spending a whole year in collecting plants, he
                    travelled through Languedoc with the same design; and passing through Toulouse
                    and Bordeaux, returned to Paris, where he made a short stay. About the end of
                    the year 1684 he set out for England, with an intention of settling there as a
                    physician. On his arrival in London, he made it his first business to visit his
                    two illustrious friends Mr. Ray and Mr. Boyle, in order to communicate to them
                    the discoveries which he had made in his travels. The latter be found at home,
                    but the former had retired to Essex; to which place Mr Sloane transmitted a
                    great variety of plants and seeds, which Mr. Ray has described in his <hi
                    rend="italic">History of Plants,</hi> and for which he makes a proper
                    acknowledgment.</p>
                <p>About the year 1706 Sloane became acquainted with Sydenham, who soon contracted
                    so warm an affection for him that he took him into his house, and recommended
                    him in the strongest manner to his patients. He had not been long in London
                    before he was proposed by Dr. Martin Lister as a candidate to be admitted a
                    fellow of the Royal society, on the 26th of November 1684; and being approved,
                    he was elected on the 21st of January following.</p>
                <p>In 1685 he communicated some curiosities to the Society; and in July the same
                    year he was a candidate for the office of assistant secretary, but without
                    success, as he was obliged to give way to the superior interest of his
                    competitor Dr. Halley. On the 12th of April 1687, he was chosen a fellow of the
                    College of Physicians in London; and the same year his friend and fellow
                    traveller Dr. Tancred Robinson, having mentioned to the society the plant called
                    the star of the earth as a remedy newly discovered for the bite of a mad dog,
                    Dr. Sloane acquainted them that this virtue of the plant was to be found in a
                    book called De Grey’s <hi rend="italic">Farriery;</hi> and that he knew a man
                    who had cured wilD it twenty couple of dogs. This observation he made on the
                    13th of July, and on the 12th of September following he embarked at Portsmouth
                    for Jamaica with the duke of Albemarle, who had been appointed governor of that
                    island. The doctor attended his grace in quality of physician, and arrived at
                    Jamaica on the 19th of December following. Here a new field was opened for fresh
                    discoveries in natural productions; but the world would have been deprived of
                    the fruits of them, had not Sloane, by incredible application, converted, as we
                    may say, his minutes into hours. The duke of Albemarle died soon after he
                    landed, and the duchess determined to return to England whenever an answer
                    should be received to the letter which she had sent to court on that melancholy
                    occasion. As he could not think of leaving her grace in her distress, whilst the
                    rest of her retinue were preparing for their departure, he improved it in making
                    collections of natural curiosities; so that, though his whole stay in Jamaica
                    was not above fifteen months, he brought together such a prodigious number of
                    plants, that on bis return to England, Mr. Ray was astonished that one man could
                    procure in one island, and in so short a space, so vast a variety.</p>
                <p>On his arrival in London, he applied himself to the practice of his profession,
                    and soon became so eminent, that he was chosen physician to Christ’s Hospital on
                    the 17th October 1694; and this office he held till the year 1730, when, on
                    account of his great age and infirmities, he found it necessary to resign. It is
                    somewhat singular, and redounds much to the doctor’s honour, that though he
                    received the emoluments of his office punctually, because he would not lay down
                    a precedent which might hurt his successors, yet be constantly applied the money
                    to the relief of those who were the greatest objects of compassion in the
                    hospital, that it might never be said he enriched himself by giving health to
                    the poor. He had been elected secretary to the Royal Society on the 30th of
                    November 1693; and upon this occasion he revived the publication of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Philosophical Transactions.</hi> which had for some time been
                    neglected. He continued to be the editor of this work till the year 1712; and
                    the vo-<pb break="no" facs="ht:chi.28490924&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=459"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0720-0459-0397"/> lumes which appeared during that period are
                    monuments of his industry and ingenuity, many of the pieces contained in them
                    being written by himself.</p>
                <p>In the mean time he published <hi rend="italic">catalogus Plantarum gua in Insula
                    Jamaica sponte proveniunt; seu Prodromi Historice Naturalis pars prima;</hi>
                    which he dedicated to the Royal Society and the College of Physicians. About the
                    same time he formed the plan of a dispensary, where the poor might be furnished
                    at prime cost with such medicines as their several maladies might require; and
                    this he afterwards carried into execution, with the assistance of the president
                    and other members of the College of Physicians.</p>
                <p>His eager thirst for natural knowledge seems to have been born with him, so that
                    his cabinet of curiosities may be said to have commenced with his being. He was
                    continually enriching and enlarging it; and the fame which, in the course of a
                    few years, it had acquired, brought every thing that was curious in art or
                    nature to be first offered to him for purchase. These acquisitions however
                    increased it but very slowly in comparison of the augmentation which it received
                    in 1701 by the death of Mr. William Courten, a gentleman who had employed all
                    his time, and the greater part of his fortune, in collecting rarities, and who
                    bequeathed the whole to Dr. Sloane, on condition of his paying certain debts and
                    legacies with which he had charged it. These terms our author accepted, and he
                    executed the will of the donor with the most scrupulous exactness; on which
                    account some people have said, that he purchased Mr. Courten’s curiosities at a
                    dear rate.</p>
                <p>In 1707 the first volume of Dr. Sloane’s Natural History of Jamaica appeared in
                    folio, though the publication of the second was delayed till 1725. By this very
                    useful as well as magnificent work, the materia medica was enriched with a great
                    number of excellent drugs not before known. In 1708 the author was elected a
                    foreign member of the Royal Academy of Sciences at Paris, in the room of Mr.
                    Tschir-naus; an honour so much the greater, as we were then at war with France,
                    and the queen’s express consent was necessary before he could accept it. In
                    proportion as his credit rose among the learned, his practice increased among
                    the people of rank. Queen Anne herself frequently consulted him, and in her last
                    illness was blooded by him.</p>
                <p>On the advancement of George I. to the throne, that prince, on the 3d of April
                    1716, created Sloane a baronet, an hereditary title of honour to which no
                    English physician had before attained; and at the same time made him
                    physician-general to the army, in which station he continued till 1727, when he
                    was appointed physician in ordinary to George II. He attended the royal family
                    till his death; and was particularly favoured by Queen Caroline, who placed the
                    greatest confidence in his prescriptions. In the mean time he had been
                    unanimously chosen one of the elects of the College of Physicians on the 1st of
                    June 1716, and he was elected president of the same body on the 30th of
                    September 1719, an office which he held for sixteen years. During that period he
                    not only gave the highest proofs of his zeal and assiduity in the discharge of
                    his duty, but in 1721 made a present to that society of L.100, and so far
                    remitted a very considerable debt, which the corporation owed him, as to accept
                    it in such small sums as were least inconvenient to the state of their affaire.
                    Sir Hans was no less liberal to other learned bodies. He had no sooner purchased
                    the manor of Chelsea, than he gave the company of apothecaries the entire
                    freehold of their botanical garden there, upon condition only that they should
                    present yearly to the Royal Society fifty new plants, till the number should
                    amount to two thousand.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>This garden was first established by the company in 1673; and having, after
                    that period, been stocked by them with a great variety of plants, for the
                    improvement of botany. Sir Hnns, in order to encourage so serviceable an
                    undertaking, granted to the company the inheritance of it, being part of his
                    estate and manor of Chelsea, on condition that it should be for ever preserved
                    as a physic garden. As n proof of its being so maintained, he obliged the
                    company, in consideration of the said grant, to present yearly to the Royal
                    Society, in one of their weekly meetings, fifty specimens of plants that had
                    been grown in the garden the preceding year, and which were all to be
                    specifically distinct from each other, until the number of two thousand should
                    be completed. This number was completed in the year 1761. In 1733 the company
                    erected a marble statue of Sir Hans, executed by Rysbrac, which is placed upon a
                    pedestal in the centre of the garden, with a Latin inscription, expression bis
                    donation, and the design and advantages of it.</p></note> ’ He gave besides
                    several other considerable donations for the improvement of this garden, the
                    situation of which, on the banks of the Thames, and in the neighbourhood of the
                    capital, was such as to render it useful in two respects; first, by producing
                    the most rare medicinal plants; and, secondly, by serving as an excellent school
                    for young botanists, an advantage which he himself had derived from it in the
                    early part of his life.</p>
                <p>The death of Sir Isaac Newton, which happened in 1727, made way for the
                    advancement of Sir Hans to the presidency of the Royal Society. He had been
                    vice-president, and frequently sat in the chair for that great man; and by his
                    long connection with this learned body he had contracted so strong an affection
                    for it, that he made them a present of an hundred guineas, caused a curious bust
                    of Charles II. its founder, to he erected in the great hall where it met, and,
                    as is said, was very instrumental in procuring Sir Godfrey Copley’s benefaction
                    of a medal of the value of five guineas, to be annually given as an honorary
                    mark of distinction to the person who communicates the best experiments to the
                    Society.</p>
                <p>On his being raised to the chair, Sir Hans laid aside all thoughts of further
                    promotion, and applied himself wholly to the faithful discharge of the duties of
                    the offices which he enjoyed. In these laudable occupations he employed his
                    time, from 1727 to 1740, when, at the age of fourscore, he formed a resolution
                    of quitting the service of the public, and of living for himself. With this view
                    he resigned the presidency of the Royal Society much against the inclination of
                    that respectable body, who chose Mr. Martin Folkes to succeed him, and in a
                    public assembly thanked him for the great and eminent services which he had
                    rendered them. In the month of January 1741, he began to remove his library, and
                    his cabinet of rarities, from his house in Bloomsbury to that at Chelsea; and on
                    the 12th of March following, having settled all his affairs, he retired thither
                    himself, to enjoy in peaceful tranquillity the remains of a well-spent life. He
                    did not however bury himself in that solitude which excludes men from society.
                    He received in Chelsea, as he had done in London, the visits of people of
                    distinction, of learned foreigners, and of the royal family, who sometimes did
                    him the honour to wait on him; hut, what was still more to his praise, he never
                    refused admittance or advice to rich or poor who came to consult him concerning
                    their health. Not contented with this contracted method of doing good, he now,
                    during his retreat, presented to the public such useful remedies as success had
                    warranted, during the course of a long-continued practice. Among these, is the
                    efficacious receipt for distempers in the eyes, and his remedy for the bite of a
                    mad dog.</p>
                <p>During the whole course of his life, Sir Hans had lived with so much temperance,
                    as had preserved him from feeling the infirmities of old age; but in his
                    ninetieth year he began to complain of pains, and to be sensible of a universal
                    decay. He was often heard to say, that the approach of death brought no terrors
                    along with it; that he had long expected the stroke; and that he was prepared to
                    receive it whenever the great Author of his being should think fit. After a
                    short illness of three days, he died on the 11th o. January 1752, and was
                    interred on the 18th at Chelsea, in<pb break="no"

                    the same vault with his lady, the solemnity being attended with the greatest
                    concourse of people, of all ranks and conditions, that had ever before been seen
                    on the like occasion.</p>
                <p>Sir Hans being extremely solicitous lest his cabinet of curiosities, which he had
                    taken so much pains to collect, should be again dissipated at his death, and
                    being at the same time unwilling that so large a portion of his fortune should
                    be lost to his children, bequeathed it to the public, on condition that L.20,000
                    should be made good by parliament to his family. The sum, though large in
                    appearance, was scarcely more than the intrinsic value of the gold and silver
                    medals, the ores and precious stones that were found in it; for in his last will
                    he declares, that the first cost of the whole amounted at least to L.50,000.
                    Besides his library, consisting of more than fifty thousand volumes, three
                    hundred and forty-seven of which were illustrated with cuts finely engraven and
                    coloured from nature, there were three thousand five hundred and sixty
                    manuscripts, and an infinite number of rare and curious works of every kind. The
                    parliament accepted the legacy, and fulfilled the conditions.</p>
