                    PELAGIANS.</p>
                <p>The doctrines of this sect, ns well as those of their predecessors the Pelagians,
                    have their common source in Pelagius, a native of Britain, of whom we have
                    already taken notice. He is said to have been but a simple monk, and not in
                    orders. Having gone to Rome about the end of the fourth century, he lived there
                    for some years with reputation, and was considered ns both pious and virtuous.
                    Rufinus, a priest of Aquileia, having come to Rome in the year 397, is affirmed
                    by some to have been the person who suggested to Pelagius his peculiar
                    doctrines.</p>
                <p>In the year 400 Pelagius began to teach his opinions at Rome, both by speech and
                    by writing. He was not the only person who taught these doctrines, of which we
                    have elsewhere enumerated the heads. His friend and companion Celestius, an
                    abler man than himself, likewise maintained them, and with much more address and
                    subtilty. After having promulgated them in Rome, they went into Sicily, where
                    they lived for some time; and thence, in the year 411, they passed over into
                    Africa. Pelagius soon afterwards went into Palestine, while Celestius remained
                    at Carthage, and was preparing himself to take the order of priesthood; but it
                    being soon discovered that he taught a new doctrine,<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Augustinus, lib. ii. <hi rend="italic">De
                    Gratia.</hi></p></note> he was accused by the deacon Paulinus in a synod held at
                    Carthage in 412, at which Aurelius the bishop presided. Celestius, on being
                    charged by Paulinus with denying original sin, made answer, “that in truth he
                    doubted whether the sin of Adam was transmitted to his posterity.” He did not,
                    however, own that children had no need of baptism, although this was one of the
                    Pelagian tenets. On the contrary, he wrote a little discourse, in which he
                    acknowledged that children had need of redemption, and that they could not
                    obtain it without baptism. The bishops at the council of Carthage condemned the
                    doctrines of Celestius, and excommunicated him. From this sentence he appealed
                    to the bishop of Rome; but he neglected to pursue his appeal, and went to
                    Ephesus, where he endeavoured to get himself ordained priest. In the mean time,
                    Pelagius having retired into Palestine, was kindly received by St Jerome’s
                    enemy, John of Jerusalem. With him he entered into an engagement to attack the
                    reputation of that author. St Jerome defended himself from their assault,
                    attacking the doctrines of Pelagius,<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    rend="superscript"> a</hi> and in this undertaking he was soon assisted by St
                    Augustin. About this time Orosius having gone from Spain into Africa, and thence
                    into Palestine, published there the proceedings against Celestius at Carthage,
                    and was prevailed upon by the bishop of Jerusalem to enter into a conference
                    with Pelagius in his presence; but the bishop having shown too much partiality
                    for Pelagius, Orosius would not acknowledge him as a judge, but demanded that
                    the decision of that affair, which was among the Latins, might be referred to
                    judges who understood the language. This happened in the year 415, at which time
                    there were in Palestine two French prelates, who, being driven from their
                    dioceses, fled into that country, and having been apprised of the opinions of
                    Pelagius and Celestius, drew up an abridgment from their own books, of the
                    errors imputed to them.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    this they joined the articles condemned in the synod of Carthage, and some
                    others, which were sent from Sicily by Hilarius to St Augustin, and then
                    presented the abridgment to the bishop of Caesarea. The matter was referred to a
                    council of fourteen bishops, at which, when the memoir was read, Pelagius
                    explained himself upon some articles, and denied that he was the author of
                    others. He also disowned the propositions condemned at Carthage, and some others
                    ascribed to Celeslius. He did not even hesitate to condemn them; upon which the
                    bishops decided, that since Pelagius approved the doctrines of the church, and
                    rejected and condemned what was contrary to its belief, they acknowledged him to
                    be of the ecclesiastical and catholic communion.</p>
                <p>Orosius, on his return to Africa, took with him the memoir against Pelagius, and
                    presented it to a meeting of bishops held at Carthage in 416.<note

                    Augustin.</p></note> Having read over what had been done at a former meeting
                    against Celestius, they declared that both he and Pelagius ought to be
                    anathematized if they did not publicly renounce and condemn the errors imputed
                    to them. The bishops of this meeting, and those of Numidia, assembled the same
                    year at Milivetum, wrote upon the subject to Pope Innocent, who approved of the
                    judgment of the African prelates, and declared Pelagius, Celestius, and their
                    followers excommunicated.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>Marius Mercator’s Commentary</p></note> Innocent gave an account of this
                    judgment to the bishops of the East, and the matter seemed altogether at an end,
                    when he died; but Celestius having been made priest at Ephesus, and having gone
                    to Constantinople, whence he was driven by Atticus, bishop of that city, who
                    also wrote against him to Asia and Africa, he came to Rome in the beginning of
                    the pontificate of Zozimus, and undertook to pursue the appeal which he had
                    formerly made from the judgment of the synod of Carthage. Having cited his
                    accuser Paulinus, and offered to justify himself, he presented a confession of
                    faith, in which he acknowleged that children ought to be baptized, in order to
                    inherit the kingdom of heaven; but he denied that the sin of Adam was
                    transmitted to his children. He appeared before the bishops and clergymen
                    assembled by the pope, and declared that he condemned all the errors with which
                    he had been charged. The pope delayed his judgment for two months, and in the
                    mean time received a letter and a confession of faith from Pelagius, which were
                    very artfully drawn up. When the time for judgment arrived, Zozimus held a
                    synod, and said that he thought the declarations of Pelagius and Celestius
                    sufficient for their justification. He was displeased at the two French bishops
                    for not appearing against them, and wrote two letters on that head, one to the
                    bishops of Africa, and another in particular to Aurelius, bishop of Carthage.
                    The African bishops, to the number of 214, without regarding the judgment passed
                    at Rome, assembled at Carthage, and, having confirmed their former decisions,
                    condemned the doctrines of the Pelagians. They wrote to the bishop of Rome to
                    acquaint him that he had been deceived by Celestius, and discovered to him the
                    equivocations of his letter and the confession of faith of Pelagius, sending him
                    a memoir of the errors of which he should require a distinct and precise
                    revocation from the two heretics. The pope made answer, that although his
                    authority was so great that none durst dissent from his judgment, still that he
                    was willing to communicate the matter<pb break="no"

                    to them, and would let it remain in the same state, until a new deliberation
                    could take place. This letter was presented to a council held at Carthage in
                    418, at which eight canons were drawn up against the Pelagian heresy. The bishop
                    of Rome, in the mean time, was inclined to examine again the affair of
                    Celestius, and to endeavour to draw from him distinct and precise answers
                    according to the plan suggested by the African bishops in their memoir; but
                    Celestius would not come forward, and accordingly withdrew from Rome. From his
                    flight the pope concluded that he had formerly imposed upon him, and that he
                    held the new doctrines; and, accordingly, changing his opinion with respect to
                    him, he approved of the decrees of the African prelates, and renewed the
                    condemnations of his predecessor, Pope Innocent, against him and Pelagius.<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See the Letters of St
                    Augustin.</p></note> This judgment he published in a letter which was sent to
                    all the bishops. About the same time an edict was published by the Emperor
                    Honorius against Pelagius and Celestius, ordering that they should be banished
                    from Rome, and that all their followers should be sent into exile.</p>
                <p>In the following year Honorius published another edict, by which it was ordered,
                    that the bishops who would not sign the pope’s letter should be deprived of
                    their churches. Accordingly, Julian the bishop of Eclana, who was afterwards
                    head of the party, and seventeen other bishops, were cashiered; upon which they
                    wrote a letter to Rufus, bishop of Thessalonica, and demanded a universal
                    council from the emperor, which was refused. Celestius returned again to Rome,
                    but was again expelled from the city; whilst his followers, being expelled from
                    Italy, retired to different countries. Some of them came over into Britain, and
                    others went into the East. Atticus banished them from Constantinople, and they
                    were also banished from Ephesus. Theodotus, bishop of Antioch, condemned them in
                    a synod held at Diospolis, and banished Pelagius and his followers out of
                    Palestine, whither they had returned. Julian, the bishop, was condemned in a
                    provincial synod of Cilicia, whither he had retired to Theodorus, bishop of
                    Mopsuesta, who was obliged to anathematize him. What became of Pelagius is
                    unknown, as history gives no further account of him; but Celestius having
                    returned to Rome, and being driven from thence by Pope Celestin, went with
                    Julian and some other bishops of their party to Constantinople, where they
                    endeavoured to prevail upon the Emperor Theodosius to assemble a council,
                    instead of which he ordered them to leave the city. After this they joined with
                    the Nestorians,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>’
                    Prosper in his Chronicle.</p></note> and were condemned together with them in a
                    general council held at Ephesus in 431; and there now remained but a small
                    number of Pelagians dispersed in the West. Julian, after having endeavoured
                    several times to get himself reinstated in his bishopric, was at last obliged to
                    retire into Sicily, where he died.</p>
                <p>To the Pelagians succeeded the Semipelagians, who rejected the doctrines of the
                    former with respect to original sin and the power of free will to do any
                    good.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Hilary’s Letters
                    to Augustin.</p></note> They owned that man had need of the grace of God to
                    persevere in welldoing; but they believed that the beginning of good will and
                    faith did not necessarily depend upon grace; for that man, by the mere force of
                    nature, might desire to do good, and that God seconded that good will by his
                    assistance, which depended upon liberty, and was given to all men. Besides
                    these, they maintained some other peculiar tenets. The origin of some of their
                    opinions is founded in this, that some of the books which were written by St
                    Augustin in his last years, with respect to the ∞ntroversies which arose in the
                    monastery of Adrumetum, relative to correction, grace, and predestination,
                    having been carried into Gaul, happened to give offence to several persons, and
                    particularly to the monks of Lerins, who considered his doctrines as hostile to
                    that of free will. This led them to think and to maintain, that, in order to be
                    saved, it was necessary to leave to man the power of knowing and desiring good
                    by the force of nature, so that the beginning might come from man. Several
                    considerable persons in Gaul, and even some bishops, but particularly the
                    priests, were of this opinion. Cassian, deacon of Constantinople, and afterwards
                    priest of Marseilles, authorized it in his conferences; and Faustus, bishop of
                    Riez, supported it very strenuously. From its very first appearance, St Augustin
                    stood up to oppose this doctrine, and was supported by Prosper and Hilarius.
                    Pope Celestin complained to the bishops of Gaul, that they suffered their
                    priests to speak ill of the doctrines of St Augustin; Popes Gelasius and
                    Hormisdas condemned the books of Faustus; and, last of all, the council of
                    Orange, held in 529, condemned particularly the principal tenets of the
                    Semipelagians, and put an end at that time to the controversy, about a hundred
                    years after the death of St Augustin.</p>
                <p>The Semipelagians were very numerous; and their doctrines, though variously
                    explained, were received in many of the monastic schools in Gaul, whence they
                    spread themselves far and wide throughout Europe. With respect to the Greeks and
                    other Christians of the East, we may remark, that they had adopted the
                    Semipelagian tenets, even before they were promulgated in Gaul by Cassian and
                    Faustus.</p>
                <p>After the period, however, at which the Semipelagian doctrines were condemned in
                    the council of Orange, we find but little notice taken of this sect by
                    historians. Although its tenets were maintained by a few in the succeeding
                    centuries, the sect could boast of no eminent leaders, and sunk into obscurity.
                    In the beginning, indeed, of the Reformation, some of the Pelagian tenets were
                    again brought into circulation. Every one is acquainted with the hostility of
                    Luther to the doctrine of free will, who went so far into the opposite extreme
                    as to entitle one of his works against the celebrated Erasmus on this subject,
                    <hi rend="italic">Be Servo Arbitrio.</hi> But notwithstanding that Luther was
                    their leader, this doctrine of his was not adopted by some of the most eminent
                    of the reformers. His learned friend, the mild and worthy Melancthon, although
                    he at first, either from not having sufficiently considered the subject, or
                    because this doctrine was so unpalatable to the great body of the reformers on
                    account of the authority of Luther, joined with Luther in his hostility to the
                    doctrine of free will so far as to say that free will could have no effect under
                    the influence of grace, shortly afterwards changed his opinion so as to run into
                    the opposite extreme. For although Luther at his outset had affirmed, that the
                    prescience of God annihilated free will in all his creatures, he was so softened
                    down into moderation at the time of the drawing up of the famous Confession of
                    Augsburg, as to allow Melancthon, who composed it, to insert these words, “that
                    it was necessary to allow free will to all who possessed the use of reason, not
                    however in such things as regarded God, which they could not commence, or at
                    least which they could not complete, without his assistance and grace, but in
                    the affairs or works of the present life solely, and in order to perform their
                    duty towards society.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    two truths are clearly admitted: First, that there is free will in man; and,
                    secondly, that of itself it has no efficacy in such works as are purely
                    Christian or religious. But although this be evident, and although it would seem
                    as if he attributed the efficacy of religious works solely to the grace of God,
                    yet the restricting words “at least,” show that he was of opi-<pb break="no"

                    nion that free will, by its own natural force and efficacy, though it could not
                    complete, could at least commence, Christian or religious works, without the
                    assistance of grace.</p>
                <p>To such of our readers as are acquainted with ecclesiastical history, it is
                    unnecessary to remark, that this was one of the leading tenets of the
                    Semipelagians. But Melancthon did not stop here. It is true, that, in order to
                    keep well with the reformers, he was obliged, in those public instruments which
                    he drew up, to insinuate rather than avow his partiality for the doctrine of
                    free will, the exercise of which, we see, he confined, in the Confession of
                    Augsburg, to such actions merely as regarded civil life and our duties to
                    society. In the Saxon Confession of Faith, however, he proceeds a step farther,
                    and says, “that the will is free; that God neither wishes for, nor approves, nor
                    co-operates in the production of sin; but that the free will of man and of the
                    devils is the true cause of their sin and of their fall.” Many, no doubt, will
                    be of opinion, that Melancthon merits praise for having thus corrected Luther,
                    and for having more clearly expressed his own opinion, than he had done in the
                    Confession of Augsburg. He even proceeds farther, and extends the exercise of
                    free will to religious or Christian works. For after having explained in the
                    Saxon Confession of Faith the nature of free will, and the manner in which it
                    makes a choice, and having also shown that it is not of itself sufficient in
                    those works, or actions, which regard a future life, he affirms twice “that the
                    will, even after having received the influence of the Holy Spirit, does not
                    remain idle that is to say, it is not merely passive under the influence of
                    grace, but can reject it, or co-operate with it, at pleasure. Necessity, it is
                    true, obliged him to express his opinion rather obscurely. But what he
                    insinuates only in these last-quoted words, is clearly and fully expressed in
                    one of his letters to Calvin. “1 had,” says he, “a friend who, in reasoning upon
                    predestination, believed equally the two following things; namely, that every
                    thing happens among men as it is ordained by Providence, but that there is,
                    nevertheless, a contingency in actions or in events. He confessed, however, that
                    he was unable to reconcile these two things. For my part,” continues Melancthon,
                    “who am of opinion that God neither wishes for nor is the cause of sin, I
                    acknowledge this contingency in the feebleness of our judgment, in order that
                    the ignorant may confess that David fell of himself, and voluntarily, into sin;
                    that he had it in his power to preserve the grace of the Holy Spirit which he
                    had within him; and that in this combat or trial it is necessary to acknowledge
                    some exercise or action of the will.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>See Calvin’s Letters.</p></note> This opinion he confirms
                    and illustrates by a passage from St Basil, where he says, “Have but the will or
                    the inclination, and God is with you.” By these words Melancthon seems to
                    insinuate, that the will is not only active in the works of religion, but even
                    begins them without grace. This, however, was not the meaning of St Basil, as is
                    evident from several other parts of his writings; but tl∣3t it was the opinion
                    of Melancthon, appears fully from this passage, as well as from that which we
                    have cited from the Confession of Augsburg, in which he insinuates that the
                    error is not in saying that the will can of itself commence, but in thinking
                    that it can, without grace, finish or complete religious or Christian works.
                    Thus it appears, that he considered the will as capable of reject-mg the
                    influence of grace, since he declares, that David could preserve the Holy Spirit
                    when he lost it, as well as he could lose it when he kept it within him. But
                    although this was his decided opinion, he durst not avow it fully in the Saxon
                    Confession of Faith, but was obliged to content himself with insinuating it
                    gently in these* words: “The will, even after receiving the grace of the Holy
                    Spirit, is not idle or without action.” All this precaution, however, was
                    insufficient to save Melancthon from censure. Fran-cowitz, better known by the
                    name of Illyricus, being jealous of him, and his enemy, by his influence with
                    his party procured the condemnation of these words of the Saxon Confession, and
                    of the passage from St Basil, at two synods held by the reformers. At the same
                    time that one party of the Lutherans were unwilling to adopt Melancthon’s
                    opinion, “that the will is not passive when under the influence of grace,” we
                    are at a loss to think how they could deny it, since they almost unanimously
                    confess, that a person under the influence of grace may reject and lose it. This
                    opinion is avowed in the Confession of Augsburg and in Melancthon’s Apology. It
                    was even, long after that, decided upon anew, inculcated strongly in their book
                    of Concord, and brought frequently against them by their opponents as a proof of
                    inconsistency and contradiction.</p>
                <p>These are not the only instances in which the Lutherans were charged with
                    Semipelagian principles. One of the ablest and the most learned of their
                    opponents, we cannot help thinking, had in more than one instance made good the
                    charge against them. To prove this we need only refer to the remarks that have
                    been made on the eight celebrated propositions in the third book of Concord,
                    relative to the co-operation of the will with grace. According to the first
                    seven of these propositions, an attentive listening to the preaching of the word
                    of God produces grace; and according to the fifth, any man, even a libertine or
                    an infidel, is free, or has it in his power, to listen attentively to the
                    preaching of the word of God. He has it then in his power to give to himself
                    that which to him is productive of grace, and may thus be the sole author of his
                    own conversion or regeneration. In the eighth proposition it is affirmed, that
                    we are not permitted to doubt that the grace of the Holy Spirit, even though it
                    may not be felt, does accompany an attentive hearing of the word of God; and, to
                    do away every doubt about the species of attention which they mean, we must
                    observe, that they speak of attention inasmuch as it precedes the grace of the
                    Holy Spirit, and of that attention which, in consequence of its dependence on
                    free will, we have it in our power to bestow upon the word or not, just as we
                    please. It is the exercise of this free attention which they say operates grace.
                    But here it would seem that they were in extremes; for, as they said, upon the
                    one hand, that when the Holy Spirit begins to move us we act not nt all, so they
                    maintained, on the other, that this operation of the Holy Spirit, which converts
                    us without any co-operation on our part, is necessarily attendant upon an act of
                    our wills, in which the Holy Spirit has no share, and in which our liberty acts
                    purely by its natural force or power. Such of our readers as are anxious to
                    examine the progress of the Pelagian and Semipclagian principles after the dawn
                    of the Reformation, we must refer to the works of the principal reformers and to
                    those of their adversaries, as well as to the different writers upon
                    ecclesiastical history.</p>
