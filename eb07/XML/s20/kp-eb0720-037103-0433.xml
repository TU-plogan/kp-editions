                    significant corrections to the OCR text, predominantly in cases of confusing "c"
                    and "e." Isolates 90 entries that were mistakenly included at the end of prior
                    entries in v1 and v2. Normalizes ordinal numbers. Separates metadata in
                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra
                    space around the <gi>pb</gi> tag. Where a word is hyphenated at a <gi>pb</gi>,

                <p><label type="entry">SIXTUS V., <hi rend="smallcaps">Pope</hi></label>, was born
                    on the 13th of December 1521, in La Marca, a village in the seigniory of
                    Montalto. His father, Francis Peretti, was a gardener, and his mother a servant
                    maid. He was their eldest child, and was called Felix. At the age of nine he was
                    hired out to an inhabitant of the village to keep sheep; but disobliging his
                    master, he was soon afterwards degraded to be keeper of the hogs. He was engaged
                    in this employment when father Michael Angelo Selleri, a Franciscan friar, asked
                    the road to Ascoli, where he was going to preach. Young Felix conducted him
                    thither, and struck the father so much with his conversation and eagerness for
                    knowledge, that he recommended him to the fraternity to which he had come.
                    Accordingly he was received amongst them, invested with the habit of a lay
                    brother, and placed under the sacristan, to assist in sweeping the church,
                    lighting the candles, and other offices of that nature, for which he was to be
                    taught the responses, and the rudiments of grammar. His progress in learning was
                    so surprising, that at the age of fourteen he was thought qualified to begin his
                    noviciate, and was admitted the year following to make his profession.</p>
                <p>He pursued his studies with such unwearied assiduity, that he was soon reckoned
                    equal to the best disputants. He was ordained priest in 1545, when he assumed
                    the name of father Montalto; soon afterwards he took his doctor’s degree, and
                    was appointed professor of theology at Sienna. It was then that he so
                    effectually recommended himself to Cardinal Carpi, and his secretary Bossius,
                    that they ever remained his steady friends. Meanwhile the severity and obstinacy
                    of his temper incessantly engaged him in disputes with his monastic brethren.
                    His reputation for eloquence, which was now spread about this time over Italy,
                    gained him some new friends. Amongst these were the Colonna family, and father
                    Ghisilieri, by whose recommendation he was appointed inquisitor-general at
                    Venice; but he exercised that office with so much severity, that he was obliged
                    to flee precipitately from that city. Upon this he went to Rome, where he was
                    made procurator-general of his order, and soon afterwards accompanied Cardinal
                    Buon Compagnon into Spain, as a chaplain and consultor to the inquisition. There
                    he was treated with great respect, and liberal offers were made to induce him to
                    continue in Spain, which, however, he could not be prevailed on to accept.</p>
                <p>In the meantime news were brought to Madrid that Pius IV. was dead, and that
                    father Ghisilieri, who had been made Cardinal Alexandrino by Paul IV. had
                    succeeded him under the name of Pius V. These tidings filled Montalto with joy,
                    and not without reason, for he was immediately invested by the pontiff with new
                    dignities. He was made general of his order, bishop of St. Agatha, soon
                    afterwards raised to the dignity of cardinal, and received a pension. About this
                    time he was employed by the pope to draw up the bill of excommunication against
                    queen Elizabeth.</p>
                <p>He began now to cast his eyes upon the papacy; and, in order to obtain it, formed
                    and executed a plan of hypocrisy with unparalleled constancy and success. He
                    became humble, patient, and affable. He changed his dress, his air, his words,
                    and his actions, so completely, that his most intimate friends declared him a
                    new man. Never was there such an absolute victory gained over the passions;
                    never was a fictitious character so long maintained, nor the foibles of human
                    nature so artfully concealed. He courted the ambassadors of every foreign power,
                    but attached himself to the interests of none; nor did he accept a single favour
                    that would have laid him under any peculiar obligation. He had formerly treated
                    his relations with the greatest tenderness, but he now changed his behaviour
                    altogether. When his brother Anthony came to visit him, he lodged him in an inn,
                    and sent him home next day, charging him to inform his family that he was now
                    dead to his relations and the world.</p>
                <p>When Pius V. died in 1572, he entered the conclave with the other cardinals, but
                    seemed altogether indifferent about the election, and never left his apartments
                    except to his devotion. When solicited to join any party, he declined it,
                    declaring that he was of no consequence, and that he would leave the choice of a
                    pope entirely to persons of greater knowledge and experience. When Cardinal Boon
                    Compagnon, who assumed the name of Gregory XIII. was elected, Montalto assured
                    him that he never wished for any thing so much in his life, and that he would
                    always remember his goodness, and the favours he had conferred on him in Spain.
                    But the new pope treated him with the greatest contempt, and deprived him of his
                    pension. The cardinals also, deceived by his artifices, paid him no greater
                    respect, and used to call him, by way of ridicule, the Roman beast, the ass of
                    La Marca.</p>
                <p>He now assumed all the infirmities of old age; his head hung down upon his
                    shoulders; he tottered as he walked, and supported himself on a staff. His voice
                    became feeble, and was often interrupted by a cough so exceedingly severe, that
                    it seemed every moment to threaten his dissolution. He interfered in no public
                    transactions, but spent his whole time in acts of devotion and benevolence. Mean
                    time he constantly employed the ablest spies, who brought him intelligence of
                    every particular</p>
                <p>When Gregory XIII. died in 1585, he entered the con-<pb break="no"

                    clave with the greatest reluctance, and immediately shut himself up in his
                    chamber, and was no more thought of than if he had not existed. When he went to
                    mass, for which purpose alone he left his apartment, he appeared perfectly
                    indifferent about the event of the election. He joined no party, yet flattered
                    all.</p>
                <p>He knew early that there would be great divisions in the conclave, and he was
                    aware that when the leaders of the different parties were disappointed in their
                    own views, they all frequently agreed in the election of some old and infirm
                    cardinal, the length of whose life would merely enable them to prepare
                    themselves sufficiently for the next vacancy. These views directed his conduct,
                    nor was he mistaken in his hopes of success.</p>
                <p>Three cardinals, the leaders of opposite factions, being unable to procure the
                    election which each of them wished, unanimously agreed to make choice of
                    Montalto. When they came to acquaint him with their intention, he fell into such
                    a violent fit of coughing, that every person thought he would expire on the
                    spot. He told them that his reign would last but a few days; that, besides a
                    continual difficulty in breathing, he wanted strength to support such a weight,
                    and that his small experience rendered him very unfit for so important a charge.
                    He conjured them all three not to abandon him, but to take the whole weight of
                    affairs upon their own shoulders; and declared that he would never accept the
                    mitre upon any other terms. “If you are resolved,” added he, “to make me pope,
                    it will only be placing yourselves on the throne. For my part, I shall be
                    satisfied with the bare title. Let the world call me pope, and I make you
                    heartily welcome to the power and authority.” The cardinals swallowed the bait,
                    and exerted themselves so effectually that Montalto was elected. He now pulled
                    off the mask which he had worn for fourteen years. No sooner was his election
                    secured, than he started from his seat, flung down his staff in the middle of
                    the hall, and appeared almost a foot taller than he had done for several
                    years.</p>
                <p>After his accession to the pontificate he sent for his family to Rome, with
                    express orders that they should appear in a decent and modest manner.
                    Accordingly his sister Camilla came thither, accompanied by her daughter and two
                    grandchildren. Some cardinals, in order to pay court to the pope, went out to
                    meet her, and introduced her in a very magnificent dress. Sixtus pretended not
                    to know her. and asked two or three times who she was. Upon this one of the
                    cardinals said, “it is your sister, holy father.” “I have but one sister,”
                    replied Sixtus with a frown, “and she is a poor woman at Le Grotte; if you have
                    introduced her in this disguise, I declare I do not know her; yet I think I
                    would know her again, if I saw her in the clothes she used to wear.”</p>
                <p>Her conductors at last found it necessary to carry her to an inn, and strip her
                    of her finery. When Camilla was introduced a second time, Sixtus embraced her
                    tenderly, and said, “Now we know indeed that it is our sister; nobody shall make
                    a princess of you but ourselves.” He stipulated with his sister, that she should
                    neither ask any favour in matters of government, nor intercede for criminals,
                    nor interfere in the administration of justice; declaring that every request of
                    that kind would meet with a certain refusal. These terms being agreed to, and
                    punctually observed, he made the most ample provision, not only for Camilla, but
                    for his whole relations.</p>
                <p>This great man was also an encourager of learning. He caused an Italian
                    translation of the Bible to be published, which raised a good deal of discontent
                    amongst the Catholics. When some cardinals reproached him for his conduct in
                    this respect, he replied, “It was published for the benefit of you cardinals who
                    cannot read Latin.”</p>
                <p>Sixtus died in 1590, after having reigned little more than five years. His death
                    was ascribed to poison, said to have been administered by the Spaniards; but the
                    story seems rather improbable.' It was to the indulgence of a disposition
                    naturally formed for severity, that all the defects of tins wonderful man are to
                    be ascribed. Clemency was a stranger to his bosom; his punishments were often
                    too cruel, and seemed sometimes to border on revenge. But though the conduct of
                    Sixtus seldom excites love, it generally commands our esteem, and sometimes our
                    admiration. He strenuously defended the cause of the poor, the widow, and the
                    orphan; he never refused audience to the injured, however wretched or forlorn
                    their appearance was. He never forgave those magistrates who were capable of
                    partiality or corruption; nor suffered crimes to pass unpunished, whether
                    committed by the rich or the poor. He was frugal, temperate, sober, and never
                    neglected to reward the smallest favour which had been conferred on him before
                    his exaltation. When he mounted the throne, the treasury was not only exhausted,
                    but in debt; at his death it contained five millions of gold. Rome was indebted
                    to him for several of her greatest embellishments, particularly the Vatican
                    library; it was by him, too, that trade was first introduced into the
                    ecclesiastical state.</p>
