                <p><label type="entry">SIERRA LEONE</label>, a colony of Great Britain, situated on
                    the western coast of Africa. Lat.8.10. Long. 12. 30. It is a peninsula, bounded
                    on the north by the river called sierra Leone, on the south and west by the sea
                    at Calmont creek, and on the east by a line up the Calmont to the Watslod creek,
                    and down this last to the Dunce, which is indeed a part of the Sierra Leone
                    river. These boundaries enclose a tract of country extending eighteen miles from
                    north to south, and twelve miles from east to west; but there is an additional
                    tract of country adjoining Sierra Leone, which was ceded to Great Britain by an
                    African chief in 1819. sierra Leone, as its name indicates, is a mountainous
                    tract of country, but with numerous intervening valleys. The heights are covered
                    to their summit with lofty forests, giving to the distant scenery a rich and
                    romantic appearance. The territory on the north side of the river is, however,
                    low and level. Numerous streams descend from the hills, which collect into a
                    basin called the Bay of Franca, celebrated as a watering-place. The sierra Leone
                    is more of an estuary than a river; it is twenty miles in length, by ten in
                    breadth, at its mouth. The Rokelle affords a water communication for some
                    distance into the interior. The range of the thermometer at Sierra Leone is very
                    slight, and the average heat throughout the year is 82°. The rains continue for
                    six months, and the torrents which descend from the mountains deluge the plains
                    beneath. The mountains in the vicinity of Free Town, the capital, have now been
                    cleared and cultivated, which has greatly added to the salubrity of the climate.
                    Indeed, the settlement is now stated in the medical reports to be as healthy for
                    Europeans as any other tropical country, so that it is no longer the pestiferous
                    charnel-house which it was formerly considered. The edible fruits of Sierra
                    Leone are numerous and luscious, including pine apples, superior in flavour to
                    those cultivated in England;the baobab, or monkey bread, a valuable tree;
                    oranges, plantains, bananas, limes, and many others. The country is prolific in
                    various precious products of the soil, besides fruits. The animal kingdom is
                    very abundant, comprising many species of antelopes, monkeys, and other denizens
                    of a tropical country.</p>
                <p>Free Town, the capital of the colony, is built upon the south side of the Sierra
                    Leone river, and at the northern extremity of the peninsula. Immediately in
                    front of the town, the river forms a bay, where there is good and commodious
                    anchorage for vessels of all classes, and timber ships of considerable size
                    proceed with facility nearly twenty miles higher up the stream, for the purpose
                    of taking in their cargoes. The town is beautifully situated on an inclined
                    plane, at the foot of some hills, on which stand the fort and other public
                    buildings, that overlook it and the roads; whence there is a fine prospect of
                    the town rising in the form of an amphitheatre from the water’s edge, above
                    which it is elevated seventy feet. It is regularly laid out into streets,
                    stretching three quarters of a mile in length, intersected by others at right
                    angles, and parallel with the river. The buildings are commodious, and
                    substantially built of stone, which at once contribute to the beauty of the
                    place, and to the health and comfort of the inhabitants. Numbers of cocoa-nut,
                    orange, lime, and banana trees, are dispersed all over the town, imparting to it
                    a peculiarly picturesque appearance. The Madeira and Teneriffe vines flourish
                    well in the gardens. Nearly all our garden vegetables are raised there; and what
                    with yams, cassada, and pompions, there is rarely any want of vegetable products
                    for the table. There are good meat, poultry, and fish markets and almost every
                    article of housekeeping can be procured at the shops of the British merchants.
                    The population of the capital may be estimated at 10,000.</p>
                <p>Throughout the peninsula, several villages have been formed, viz., Leicester,
                    founded in 1809; Regent, in 1812; Gloucester, in 1816; Kissey and Leopold, in
                    1817; Charlotte, Wilberforce, and Bothwell, in 1818; Kent, York, Wellington, and
                    Waterloo, in 1819. These villages are generally situated in different parts of
                    the mountain, but all are connected by good roads with each other, and with the
                    capital. The two Banana islands, situated to the south-west of Free Town, were
                    ceded to the British government in 1819, by a family who receive an annual
                    payment tor them. The total population of sierra Leone is about 35,000, of whom
                    not more than 200 are Europeans; the remainder are captured or liberated slaves,
                    or their descendants, together with some native Africans. Many of the colonists,
                    besides the Europeans, possess considerable wealth. The total number of slaves
                    emancipated in sierra Leone, between June 1819 and January 1833, was 27,697.
                    Some of these, no doubt, retain their habits of indolence, but in general the
                    freed African relishes liberty, and is grateful for the boon conferred on him,
                    and several, by their industry and economy, are said to have acquired property
                    amounting to L.1000 sterling. There are public schools in each parish, and from
                    3000 to 4000 children attend them. A large portion of the colony are enjoying,
                    and all have access to, the means of moral and religious instruction. Upwards of
                    one-fourth are regular attendants on the public ordinances of religion. They
                    have built for themselves various and expensive places of worship; some of them
                    are employed as spiritual instructors of their sable brethren; and all together,
                    considering its circumstances, this negro colony is composed of an orderly and
                    well-conducted people. Agriculture has not, indeed, been sufficiently prosecuted
                    hitherto, but matters will improve in this respect when population increases,
                    and presses upon the means of supply. The soil is in part very fertile, and more
                    might be rendered so by clearing.</p>
                <p>The trade of this settlement is as follows: For the year<pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:chi.28490924&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=393" xml:id="kp-eb0720-0393-0331"/>
                    ending December 1834, there cleared inwards seventy-three vessels, whose united
                    tonnage was 17,307. Fifty-four of these belonged to Great Britain. The number
                    which cleared outwards during the same period was eighty-four, the tonnage of
                    the whole being 19,068. This shows an increase on the previous year. The total
                    value of the imports for 1831, were L.104,639; and of the exports L.81,280.
                    Subsequent returns for 1833-4, show a decrease, which does not correspond with
                    the number of vessels which arrived at, and departed from the settlement. The
                    chief articles of export are timber, cam wood, palm oil, ivory, rice, bees’ wax,
                    gold, hides, &amp;c. In 1835, these were exported to the extent of L.58,174. The
                    chief articles imported into Sierra Leone, are cottons, gunpowder, linens, salt,
                    guns, iron, hard-wares, and cutlery, and others of our own manufactures. This
                    settlement is kept up at a considerable yearly expenditure. For the five years
                    ending 1824, it was L.75,000 per annum; for the succeeding five years, it fell
                    to about one-half that sum; but still the revenue bears no proportion to the
                    outlay. Sierra Leone is governed by a civil-lieutenant governor, assisted by a
                    council. There is a chief-justice, and a vice-court of admiralty. There is also
                    established, the mixed commission for the adjudication of vessels taken in the
                    slave-trade. A detachment of the Royal African corps (blacks) is stationed in
                    the settlement, under a lieutenantcolonel.</p>
                <p>This colony was founded by Great Britain with the most philanthropic views. At
                    the suggestion of Dr. Smeathmane, the negroes discharged from the army and navy,
                    after the American war, were conveyed to Sierra Leone, furnished with
                    necessaries for forming a colony in their native land. But a series of
                    calamities overtook this singularly interesting band of settlers, which obliged
                    those who escaped pestilence and the sword to take shelter on Bance island, a
                    small place. However, the Sierra Leone Company was formed in Britain in 1787,
                    and it sent out five vessels with stores, and other succours, to these black
                    freemen, together with a large reinforcement of free negroes from America. Still
                    the difficulties with which the colony had to struggle, again placed it in
                    critical circumstances, whilst in 1794, it was plundered by the French; and so
                    much had calamities accumulated, that the company entered into an arrangement
                    with the government, to place the colony under their jurisdiction. It was
                    subsequently placed under the African Institution, established for the
                    improvement of the western part of Africa. Great accessions were made to its
                    population, by sending thither the negroes taken in slave ships, and to initiate
                    them in the habits of civilized life; the Church Missionary Society undertook to
                    furnish schools and religious instructors. But the success of this body has not
                    been equal to its benevolent intentions, at least with regard to other parts of
                    Africa, little or no impression having as yet been made on the general mass of
                    the population from this quarter. Since the dissolution of the African Company,
                    Sierra Leone has again reverted to the British crown.</p>
