                <p><label type="entry">SURAT</label>, a large and populous city of Hindustan, in the
                    province of Gujerat, situated on the south side of the Taptee river, about
                    twenty miles above its junction with the sea. It is one of the largest cities in
                    Hindustan; and is termed by Bishop Heber a very large and ugly city, with narrow
                    winding streets, and high houses of timber-frames filled up with bricks, the
                    upper stories projecting over each other. The city is about six miles in
                    circuit, in the form of a semicircle, of which the river Taptee or Tuptee forms
                    the chord. Near the centre of this chord, and washed by the river, stands a
                    small castle, with round bastions, glacis, and covered way, in which are
                    stationed a few sepoys and European artillerymen; and which is distinguished by
                    the singularity of two flag-staffs, on one of which is displayed a union jack,
                    on the other a plain red flag, the ancient ensign of the emperors of Delhi; an
                    arrangement which was adopted in courtesy when the fort was conquered from the
                    nawab of Surat, and was continued, though the nawab is only a pensioner on the
                    bounty of the government. In the neighbourhood are most of the English houses of
                    a good size. Without the walls is a French factory, containing some handsome and
                    convenient buildings, but now quite deserted by their proper owners, and
                    occupied by English officers. A French governor with several officers came to
                    take possession of the factory, which was restored in 1814 at the conclusion of
                    peace; but the governor died, and his suite was so thinned by disease that the
                    survivors returned to the isle of Bourbon, and no one has appeared to supply
                    their place. The city is protected on one side by a river; and on the other
                    three sides by a brick rampart, or a ditch. The wall is entire and in good
                    repair, with semicircular bastions and battlements. There is also a strong
                    citadel, erected on the bank of the river, and surrounded by an esplanade.</p>
                <p>Surat formerly carried on a very extensive trade. In 1775 a greater quantity of
                    ships belonged to the port than to Bombay. Large exports of cotton were formerly
                    sent to China, but they are now chiefly sent by the way of Bombay. The trade has
                    greatly declined, consisting of little but raw cotton, which is chiefly shipped
                    in boats for Bombay. In manufactures the native artisan is now undersold by the
                    English; a dismal decay, says Heber, has consequently taken place in the
                    circumstances of the native merchants; and he mentions an instance of an ancient
                    Mussulman family, formerly of great wealth and magnificence, who were reduced to
                    dispose of their library for subsistence. The most thriving people in Surat are
                    the Boras, or money-lenders, who drive a trade all through this part of India,
                    and the Parsees. The last are the proprietors of half the houses in Surat. They
                    are dexterous mechanics, good servants, and skilful merchants. They intermarry
                    with each other, and retain all their ancient customs and prejudices, among
                    which is their repugnance to extinguish fire, and the exposure of their dead to
                    be devoured by birds of prey. The boats which lie in the river are of thirty or
                    forty tons, with two masts. Vessels of greater burden must lie about fifteen
                    miles off, below the bar, at the mouth of the Taptee; but few larger vessels
                    ever come to Surat. There is a very neat and convenient church, as well as an
                    extensive and picturesque burial-ground, full of large and numerous tombs of the
                    former servants of the Company; most of them from 120 to 180 years old, and in
                    the Mussulman style, with large apartments surrounded by vaults. There are no
                    remarkable buildings in Surat. The nawab’s residence is modern, but∙not
                    particularly handsome. The British society is numerous and agreeable, this city
                    being the station of a considerable force, of a collector, a board of customs,
                    and the courts of justice. Of the ancient history of Surat under the Hindoo
                    dynasties there are no authentic records. It was taken by the emperor Akbar in
                    1572, after a vigorous siege of forty-seven days. It was in 1664 taken and
                    plundered by Sevajee, the great Mahratta chief, and was again visited by him in
                    1671, and laid under contribution, as it was by his successors in 1702 and 1707.
                    Surat was surrendered to a British force in 1750 by the nabob, the ancestor of
                    the present nawab, who was compelled to have recourse to foreign aid. He was
                    succeeded by his sons, the last of whom agreed in 1800 to resign all his
                    authority to the British for an annual pension of L. 12,500. Surat is fifty-one
                    miles south-west by south from Lucknow. Long. 73. 3. E. Lat. 21. 13. N. <hi
