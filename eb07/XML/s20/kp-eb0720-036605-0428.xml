                <p><label type="entry">SINGAPORE</label>. The island of Singapore is situated at the
                    extremity of the peninsula, in the straits of Singapore, through which lies the
                    route of vessels to and from the China seas. The town stands in lat. 1. 17. 22.
                    N., long. 103. 51. 45. E., on a point of land near the western part of a bay,
                    and is easily distinguished by a pleasant hill behind it, mostly cleared of
                    trees, which abound on the island. This was the situation chosen by Sir Stamford
                    Raffles for establishing a settlement under the protection of Britain, which
                    might, in some degree, command the free navigation of the Straits of Malacca. He
                    accordingly sailed from Calcutta for this purpose in the latter end of the year
                    1818, and in 1819 he hoisted the British flag, with a population of not more
                    than 200 souls. In three months, according to the official letter of Sir
                    Stamford Raffles, the number had increased to 3000; and at the date of the
                    letter, April 1820, to 10,000, principally Chinese. Not less than 173 sail of
                    vessels, of different descriptions, principally native, arrived and sailed in
                    the course of the first two months, and in a short time it had grown up into an
                    important commercial port. The rapid rise of this important station, is,
                    perhaps, unequalled in the history of any other country, and marks the sagacity
                    with which so central a situation was chosen, with respect to India and China,
                    from the latter of which it is distant only five days’ sail; in regard also to
                    Java, the great islands of Borneo and Sumatra, and the Eastern Archipelago. Its
                    natural advantages are great. It is placed on a rich soil, with fertile tracts
                    of land in the neighbourhood, which give ample scope to agricultural
                    ira-provement; and this, combined with the freedom from imposts, and the
                    security for life and property, under a mild and enlightened government, are the
                    circumstances which have attracted these industrious settlers, who, descrying
                    from afar the ensign of freedom and justice, fly to it for protection from the
                    tyranny and extortion of their own native rulers. The island of Singapore, which
                    has been surveyed since the British settlement was established, is about
                    twenty-seven miles in its greatest length, and fifteen in its greatest breadth.
                    It is estimated to contain an area of 270 square miles; is diversified with hill
                    and dale, and is adapted to the growth of numerous and valuable commodi-<pb

                    xml:id="kp-eb0720-0429-0367"/> ties. Plantations of gambier, pepper, and spices,
                    have been already begun; cultivation has also extended to the neighbouring
                    islands, which formerly afforded a harbour for pirates. The water that is found
                    in the island is excellent; the soil is rich and fruitful; the temperature is
                    comparatively cool, the thermometer ranging between 71 and 89; and the climate,
                    on the whole, is salubrious. On the south side of the island, an inlet
                    penetrates into the interior, which is about 300 feet wide towards its mouth,
                    has regular tides, and is capable of admitting lighters for about a quarter of a
                    mile from the sea. On this inlet the town is built. Between this and a parallel
                    inlet, at the distance of a quarter of a mile, is a square plain, faced with a
                    high sandy beach free from surf, and terminated on the inner side by a steep
                    hill, of a sufficient elevation to possess a beautiful and commanding view of
                    the surrounding country and the straits. On the frontier side of the inlet, is,
                    on one hand, a regularly built Chinese town; and, on the other, beyond the
                    rivulet, an extensive plain, in front of which the sandy beach stretches into an
                    inner bay, and whence another inlet encompasses it behind. Singapore harbour, or
                    rather roadstead, situated four miles to the N.N.E. of St. John’s island in
                    Singapore straits, affords a safe anchorage to ships in all seasons; and, being
                    clear of sudden danger, the approach to it is rendered easy by day or by night.
                    Its position is also favourable for connecting the navigation of the straits,
                    the track which the ships pursue being distant about five miles. The ships are
                    well sheltered at the anchorage from E.N.E. round to north and west, as far as
                    S. by W.</p>
                <p>The population of Singapore consists of Chinese, Malays, Buggis. The principal
                    merchants are Englishmen, of whom there are also a few shopkeepers, auctioneers,
                    &amp;c. Some of the respectable merchants are Chinese, as are also the
                    cultivators and other labourers. The Malays are chiefly employed as fishermen,
                    in cutting timber, and in bringing supplies into the town from the surrounding
                    neighbourhood; and the boatmen are chiefly natives of the Coromandel coast.</p>
                <p>Singapore trades to a great extent with all the countries and islands in the
                    Eastern seas. One of the most valuable branches of trade is with Siam, which is
                    carried on in the Siamese junks, which frequent the port of Singapore to the
                    number of eighteen or twenty, and which are from 100 to 350 tons burden, the
                    greater number being from 150 to 200. They import chiefly sugar, rice, cocoa nut
                    oil, saffron wood, garro root, dried fish, and a small quantity of gamboge,
                    sticklac, elephants’ teeth, raw silk, and onions; and are said to be of the
                    value of from 3000 to 15,000 Spanish dollars each. Many of these vessels belong
                    entirely to their commanders, and the others to parties residing in Siam. Sugar
                    is the most valuable part of their cargoes, which is nearly all taken by the
                    European merchants, and is shipped for Europe, whither, also, are sent the
                    elephants’ teeth and gamboge. Of the numerous tribes who visit this settlement,
                    the Siamese carry off the greatest quantity of manufactured goods. Their return
                    cargoes consist of Bengal muslins, sannahs, and gurrahs, (pieces of dress,)
                    chintzes, European long clothe, cambrics, long ells, camblets, woollens, bees’
                    wax, camphor, gold dust, and a few rattans; cotton twist is now also sought
                    after. This trade is entirely confined to the Chinese, who are chiefly natives
                    of the country, descendants of Chinese settlers. The trade with Cochin-China is
                    not nearly so extensive or valuable as that with Siam. It is also carried on by
                    means of junks, verging from 100 to 200 tons burden, which come to the number
                    annually of between thirty and forty, from various ports along the whole coast
                    of that immense country, and the gulf of Tonquin. The imports consist chiefly of
                    rice and salt; but they bring also in small quantities sticklac, gamboge,
                    saffron wood, tortoise shell, coarse sugar, cocoa nut oil, cocoa nuts, pigs and
                    goats, salted vegetables, and other provisions. The return cargoes consist
                    chiefly of opium, also of European long cloths, long ells, cambrics, Madras
                    cloths, Indian piece goods, woollens, camlets, and a small quantity of gambier
                    and rattans. A considerable trade is carried on with Campar, an ancient Malayan
                    state on the east coast of Sumatra. This trade is entirely in the hands of the
                    Malays, there being no Chinese settlers in that country, and is carried on in
                    small proas, which visit Singapore monthly, in small fleets of ten or twelve,
                    well armed, to guard them against the attacks of pirates, who infest the
                    numerous straits that are formed amongst the Asiatic islands. They carry from
                    fifteen to thirty men, and are armed with two long brass guns, spears, swords,
                    &amp;c. Their cargoes consist principally of coffee; but they also bring
                    gambier, bees’ wax, twine, and cassia of an inferior quality, elephants’ teeth,
                    rhinoceros’ horns, and a few rattans. These articles they readily dispose of on
                    their arrival, to Chinese merchants, and receive in return white and unbleached
                    Madras cloths, raw silk and cotton, European shirtings, cambrics, and chintzes,
                    handkerchiefs, camblets, lead, iron, steel, gold thread, Java tobacco, sticklac,
                    &amp;c. Singapore also trades with the west coast of the island of Borneo,
                    situated between Tanjong Dattoo and the northern extremity of the island, and
                    with the Dutch settlements of Sambos, Mampawa and Pontianak. The whole of this
                    trade is conducted by the Malays and Buggis, in proas belonging to the different
                    ports whence they come. The proas from Borneo Proper are chiefly of the burden
                    of from 800 to 1200 piculs, carrying from forty to sixty men each, and, like
                    most native vessels, are well armed with long brass guns, as well as with
                    spears, swords, and small arms. About fifteen or twenty of these vessels trade
                    with Singapore; and they make generally two voyages in the course of a year.
                    Their imports principally consist of pepper, camphor, bees’ wax, birds’ nests,
                    tortoise shell, mother-of-pearl shells, and pearls; the cargoes being valued at
                    from 2000 to 8000 Spanish dollars each. They are very readily disposed of to the
                    richest Chinese merchants, in barter for blue and white Madras cloths, Bengal
                    chintzes and white goods, European chintzes and long cloths, iron, steel, cotton
                    twist in blue, red, and white, blue and yellow nankeens, Chinese gold thread,
                    and various other minor articles. The annual value of this trade is estimated at
                    from 60,000 to 70,000 Spanish dollars. With the Dutch settlements the trade is
                    still more considerable. From Sambas about fifteen to twenty proas arrive at
                    Singapore every six months, each bringing cargoes of gold dust, according to the
                    means of the trader, and scarcely any other commodity, on account of the heavy
                    duties imposed on exports to a British port. From Mampawa and Pontianak about
                    thirty or forty proas come twice a-year with gold dust, diamonds, tin, and
                    rattans. The different cargoes are said to vary from 2000 to 20,000 dollars; the
                    value of the whole trade is estimated at 250,000 Spanish dollars. In return they
                    take chiefly Bengal and Madras piece goods and iron. They take no British
                    manufactured goods, in consequence of the heavy protecting duties imposed on
                    them by the Dutch, for the encouragement of the trade of the mother country; and
                    no opium, because it is monopolized by the government, of which, however, only a
                    few chests are disposed of; the chief supply being brought by the contraband
                    traders. About ten or twelve Chinese junks commonly arrive from Amoy and Canton.
                    Their imports are earthenware, tiles, granite, slates, paper umbrellas,
                    vermicelli, dried fruits, sticks, paper, tobacco, and a few nankeens, raw silk,
                    &amp;c. The cargoes from Canton are said generally to consist of the same
                    articles, with the addition of silk, camlets, satins, camphor, sugar candy, and
                    tea, and a much greater proportion of nankeens and raw silk. Those cargoes, of
                    which the value of each is from 30,000 to 60,000 dollars, generally belong to
                    the owners of the junks, who remain in China. These junks are generally of about
                    from<pb break="no" facs="ht:chi.28490924&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=430"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0720-0430-0368"/> 350 to 400 tons burdens; they carry from eighty
                    to a hundred seamen; and such is their ignorance of navigation, that great
                    numbers, notwithstanding their being so fully manned, perish in the stormy seas
                    that wash the Chinese shores. They bring annually about 2000 Chinese; and for
                    several days after their arrival, the Sampan proas which trade to Rhio, Malacca,
                    Penang, &amp;c., are literally crowded with emigrants proceeding to the various
                    neighbouring ports, with a view of getting employment in the pepper, coffee, and
                    gambier plantations, and in the tin mines. Great numbers go to Java to the sugar
                    and coffee plantations, and many to Borneo to collect gold dust. Those various
                    imports, however, are not consumed in Singapore, which is rather a mercantile
                    depot of goods, from which they are dispersed all over the Eastern seas. The
                    goods which are adapted for a European remittance, such as raw silk, nan-kccns,
                    and camphor, are chiefly purchased by the Europeans from the Chinese merchants,
                    through whose hands the trade chiefly passes. The other articles are taken by
                    the proas which frequent the harbour, and are by these spread over the whole
                    Archipelago. The exports of the Chinese from Singapore, are birds’ nests,
                    camphor, beche de mer, sandal wood, ebony, tortoise shell, rattans, flint
                    stones, buffaloes’ hides, sharks’ fins, tripang, European camlets, woollens, and
                    long ells, and a few pieces of chintzes, long cloths, Bengal piece goods, tin,
                    pepper, gambier, and from eight to ten chests of opium, a contraband article,
                    the importation of which into Canton is now effectually proscribed. The exports
                    of Singapore to Calcutta, Madras, and Bombay, amount in value to about
                    2,600,000, and the imports to 2,748,026 sicca rupees.</p>
