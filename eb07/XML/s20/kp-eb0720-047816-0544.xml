                    significant corrections to the OCR text, predominantly in cases of confusing "c"
                    and "e." Isolates 90 entries that were mistakenly included at the end of prior
                    entries in v1 and v2. Normalizes ordinal numbers. Separates metadata in
                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra
                    space around the <gi>pb</gi> tag. Where a word is hyphenated at a <gi>pb</gi>,
                    the end fragment is now joined to the start fragment, making a machine-readable
                    word.</change>

                <p><label type="entry">SOOLOO <hi rend="smallcaps">Isles</hi></label>. These isles,
                    about sixty in number, derive their name from Sooloo, the principal island in
                    the group. They form a chain which extends in a northeast and southwest
                    direction, from the northeastern extremity of Borneo to the western extremity of
                    Magindanao, and from the 4th to the 7th degrees of north latitude. The island of
                    Sooloo is about thirty miles in length by twelve in average breadth, and
                    contains 60,000 inhabitants. It lies midway between the islands of Borneo and
                    Magindanao, is well cultivated, and affords a fine prospect from the sea; nor
                    has it any certain rainy seasons, like the other Malay islands. This is owing to
                    the moderate height of the hills not intercepting the clouds in their passage
                    from the sea. Most rain falls, however, during the southwest monsoon, and also
                    at the change of the monsoon, especially the au tumnal. But these changes are
                    not followed by any storms, and very seldom at any other time, so that the
                    island enjoys almost a perpetual summer. There are several good harbours among
                    these islands, particularly at Bewabewa, Tavitave, Tappool, Secassee, between
                    Boobooan and Tap peantana, south of Basselan. The harbour of Bewan, the capital
                    of Sooloo, is not good, except during the southwest monsoon. This place is
                    situated on the seacoast, on the northwest part of the island, and is of
                    considerable size. The houses are built after the manner of the Malays, elevated
                    about four feet from the ground with bamboos, of which the floors also are made.
                    The island of Sooloo being small in proportion to its population, habits of
                    industry prevail, and great attention is paid to agriculture. Rice is planted;
                    but it is a precarious crop, owing to the uncertainty of the rains. Many roots
                    are in consequence cultivated in its stead, namely, the Spanish or sweet
                    potatoe, and yams of different species. They have abundance and variety of every
                    species of tropical fruit. The oranges are equal in quality to those in China:
                    they have also a fruit called jack or nanka, durians, a kind of large custard
                    apple, called madang, mangoes, mangustines, rambustines, and a fruit they call
                    bolona, like a large plum or mangoe, white inside. The trees in the woods are
                    loaded with fruits, which ripen well, and are not injured by too much mois<pb

                    xml:id="kp-eb0720-0545-0479"/> ture. The Sooloos, from the great number of the
                    Chinese that are among them, have learned from them the art of gardening; and
                    they ingraft and improve their fruits.</p>
                <p>Wild elephants are to be found in the woods; which is a remarkable circumstance,
                    considering that the island is small and populous. Spotted deer, goats, and
                    black cattle, are also abundant. Wild hogs abound, and do much mischief; but the
                    natives have few sheep. They have, how ever, a good breed of horses, which are
                    trained to trot, but not to gallop. After harvest the inhabitants hunt both the
                    elephants and the wild hogs, with a view to destroy them.</p>
                <p>The island of Sooloo was formerly the centre of an extensive trade, and was
                    frequented by ships from Japan, which imported silver, amber, silks, chests,
                    cabinets, and other curiosities made of fragrant woods, besides great quantities
                    of silks and porcelain from China. It was also visited by vessels from Java,
                    Sumatra, Ceylon, and the coast of Coromandel, with valuable cargoes. This trade
                    has greatly declined. The intercourse with China is now confined to two junks,
                    which arrive annually from Amoy with cargoes of brass salvers, iron, sugarcandy,
                    raw silk, black nankeen, white linen of a strong fabric, china ware, flowered
                    silks, besides tea, cutlery and other hard ware, brass wire, gongs, beads of all
                    colours, little swan-shot, fireworks, &amp;c. In return they export to China
                    biche de mer, black and white wax, pearl-oyster shells, bird-nests, and
                    tortoiseshell; also a seaweed used as gum or glue, and other articles, such as
                    Carooang oil, clovebark, black wood, ratans, sago, various barks for dyeing,
                    cassia, pepper, native camphire, sandalwood, curious shells for grottoes,
                    pearls, and spices. These islands are also occasionally visited by country
                    ships, which import articles of European manufacture, such as brasiery, cutlery,
                    cloth, gunpowder, firearms, manufactures in glass, iron, opium, piece-goods,
                    saltpetre, shot, swords, tin ware, watches, sugar, tobacco, &amp;c. From Borneo
                    are imported sago, biche de mer, cowries, and tortoiseshell. Rice is imported
                    from Magindanao, and is paid for with Chinese goods. Cotton manufactures from
                    Celebes complete the list of imports. There is a famous pearl-fishery at Sooloo
                    and the neighbouring islands.</p>
                <p>These islands are governed by a hereditary prince or sultan, whose power is,
                    however, counterbalanced by the nobles. The Sooloos seldom venture from home in
                    their own vessels, except for the purpose of predatory excursions to make slaves
                    among the Philippine Islands. They are warlike in their habits, though they
                    depend less on firearms than on the lance, sword, and dagger, in the use of
                    which they are very dexterous. The inhabitants have reached a higher stage of
                    civilization than is generally attained in the Asiatic islands. The women are
                    not strictly confined, as in many Mahommedan countries. In their houses are
                    domesticated many Philippine and some Spanish slaves, who are purchased from the
                    Illanos and Magindanese cruisers. Not withstanding their boasted civilization,
                    murder is a crime extremely common among them, and occurs on the least
                    provocation. In 1800 they treacherously assassinated the captain of a country
                    ship, and his boat’s crew; and afterwards made an attack on the ship, but were
                    repulsed.</p>
                <p>Of the early history of these islanders little is known. They assert, that they
                    once formed a part of an ancient Bornean empire, founded by the Chinese. But the
                    Magindanese assert that they were formerly subject to them. From the period when
                    the Spaniards obtained possession of the Philippines, they have been engaged in
                    a constant warfare with the Sooloos, but with little advantage to them selves,
                    being always repelled in their attempts to obtain possession of these
                    islands.</p>
