                <p><label type="entry">STIRLING</label>, one of the most ancient towns in Scotland,
                    and capital of the county of the same name, is situated in 5° 40' west
                    longitude, and 56° 6' north latitude, in a plain called the Carse, watered by
                    the river Forth, and on the sloping ridge of a rock, at the western and
                    precipitous extremity of which the castle is built. The town is very irregular,
                    the street upon the crest of the hill being broad and spacious, but the other
                    streets narrow and inconvenient. Within the last few years great improvements
                    have been undertaken. The pavement of the streets, which was of the worst
                    description, has been rendered equal to that of almost any other place in the
                    kingdom; and the opening of the town at its lower extremity is affording scope
                    for the most marked improvements. Many elegant houses and fine shops have been
                    erected. In the suburbs there are many handsome villas; in Southfield, Melville
                    Terrace, Allan Park, Wellington Place, and Dunbarton Road. Stirling is a most
                    convenient place for the residence of people of small but easy fortune.
                    House-rents are low; and ground for gardens may be procured upon easy terms.
                    There arc no local public burdens of any kind; the streets being lighted and
                    cleaned, and water brought to the town, at the expense of the corporation. The
                    situation of Stirling is very convenient in other respects. The steam-boats
                    supply an easy and cheap conveyance to and from Edinburgh; and many coaches pass
                    through the town in different directions. “In point of extent, variety, and
                    magnificence, the view from Stirling Castle is perhaps unequalled by any other
                    in Britain.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>M‘Culloch’s
                    Statistical Account of the British Empire, vol. i. p. 299.</p></note></p>
                <p>The public buildings are the two parish churches, both in the Gothicstyle, with a
                    modern erection between them, which adds nothing to their beauty: they are
                    called the East and West Churches. The former is a fine building, erected in the
                    year 1494. In the two churches there are three clergymen, and in one of the
                    United Secession churches two. The town council has the patronage of the
                    churches, and two of the ministers are entirely supported by the corporation. It
                    also bears the whole expenses of the jail for the counties of Stirling,
                    Clackmannan, and Kinross, except a part of the jailer’s salary, paid by the
                    counties. Besides two chapels belonging to the United Associate Synod, there is
                    an Old Light church, the minister of which, and a majority of the congregation,
                    have within a few weeks joined the established church. There are likewise an
                    Episcopal and a Roman Catholic chapel, the latter a neat building, erected
                    within the last two years; a Cameronian, a Congregational, and several Baptist
                    places of worship. The townhouse, with a spire, in which there is a set of
                    music-bells, which play a tune before the striking of each hour, and the jail
                    behind, which is very insecure, form two sides of a quadrangle, the third side
                    of which is finely fitted up as a courtroom, in which the circuit court sits
                    twice a year, and also frequently the sheriff court. The fourth side of the
                    quadrangle is private property, which is very inconvenient. In the town-house
                    are still kept the pint jug, the ancient legal standard for liquid measure in
                    Scotland, and two silver keys, representative of the keys of the two ancient
                    gates of the town; and in the circuit court-room about a dozen of the fine
                    ancient carvings known by the name of the Stirling heads. In the narrow lane
                    leading to the castle, there is a military hospital. The building was once the
                    property of the Argyle family, and is still called Argyle House. Near it, and
                    close beside the two churches, is situated a ruin, called Mar’s Work. It is an
                    unfinished house, begun, but never completed, by the regent Mar. The Athenaeum
                    is a handsome house in King Street, with a spire 120 feet high. In the
                    ground-floor there are shops, but the two upper stories contain, the first a
                    public reading-room, to which respectable strangers have access at all times,
                    and the second a subscription library, containing about 5000 volumes. Close
                    beside the Athenaeum is the corn-market, for the accommodation of which a
                    splendid hall has been erected within the last twelvemonths. There are three
                    public school-houses in the town. The parish school has four departments, viz. a
                    grammar-school, a mathematical, and two English schools. In addition to their
                    fees, the teachers have each a salary of fifty pounds from the town council; and
                    the master of the grammar-school has twenty pounds more for an assistant.
                    Education is cheap and good. In the town there are four charitable endowments,
                    commonly called hospitals, in full<pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:chi.28490924&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=874" xml:id="kp-eb0720-0874-0728"/>
                    operation, two for the support of the aged poor, and two for educating the
                    young. One of the former has an income approaching to L.3000 annually, wholly
                    arising from land; but when public burdens are paid, with necessary repairs,
                    there remains scarcely one half for the support of the poor, who receive from
                    8s. to 1s. 6d. per week, according to circumstances. Two of the others have
                    incomes of about L.700 each, derived in the same way, and bearing the same
                    burdens. The fourth has the interest of L.4000. The two latter educate, clothe,
                    and allow 2s. 6d. a week to between forty and fifty boys. The funds of the whole
                    of these are distributed to parties designated by the founders; all having their
                    operation according to the old constitution of the borough. They are, like every
                    thing else in the town, under the patronage and management of the town council,
                    with the addition in one case of the first, and in another of the second,
                    minister. In addition to these, the late Mr John Maclaren of Liverpool, a native
                    of Stirling, has bequeathed a sum, the amount of which is not yet fully known,
                    for the purpose of founding and endowing schools upon a most liberal scale, for
                    the instruction, not wholly gratuitous, but at a very low rate, of children from
                    four to sixteen years of age. A clause in his will provides that no clergyman
                    shall have any control or management of his fund. One of the above charities had
                    an hospital built for the accommodation of twelve decayed members of the
                    incorporation of guildry, but nobody could be persuaded to inhabit it, although
                    pleasantly situated. The consequence was, that the funds accumulated, until what
                    was originally L.2222 sterling, has now increased to about L.3000 yearly. As in
                    these circumstances the intentions of John Cowane, the founder, could not be
                    carried into effect, the town council and the first minister, who are the
                    governors, have for a long period been in the habit, and latterly with the
                    consent of the Court of Session, of dividing the funds among the poor belonging
                    to the incorporation, so that now upwards of 180 persons are deriving benefit to
                    the amount of from 8s. to 1s 6d. a week, from a fund which was intended for the
                    support of only twelve. The hospital stands near the East and West Churches,
                    ornamented with a small spire and a statue of Cowane; and its hall is now used
                    for the meetings of the guildry. The other charity had also an hospital, which
                    is still standing, without however being the property of the charity; and the
                    funds are divided in a similar manner among the poor of the seven incorporated
                    trades. They are all at present in a thriving condition. Besides the above
                    charities, the general poor of the town are supported by the kirk-session, the
                    various churches to which they belong, and by a voluntary subscription
                    denominated the poor-scheme; the people preferring this mode to a regular
                    assessment, of which they have a salutary dread. There is also a public
                    dispensary, which affords relief to many. Notwithstanding all these provisions,
                    public mendicancy is exceedingly common; nor do the authorities, from false
                    notions of humanity, exert themselves to put a stop to this practice, so
                    degrading to the poor, and annoying to the public.</p>
                <p>The literature of the place is sustained by two reading-rooms, one of which
                    belongs to artisans. The public library, already noticed, is under excellent
                    management, excepting that the entry-money and annual payment are both too high;
                    it has about 140 subscribers. The School of Arts, or Mechanics Institution,
                    generally supports a course of lectures in the winter season, attended by from
                    200 to 300 males and females. It possesses also a chemical and electrical
                    apparatus, and various other philosophical instruments, and something like the
                    foundation of a museum. To the care of this institution, a gentleman in
                    Manchester, a native of Stirling, has committed a number of fine casts,
                    principally from the antique, which form a small but interesting gallery of
                    statuary. It is daily open for the inspection of the public. This society has
                    also an excellent library, consisting of upwards of 1000 volumes, which are very
                    much read. The price of admittance to all the benefits of the institution is
                    only four shillings a year. All that is wanting to render it a most useful
                    institution, is a house to contain its literary wealth. In almost every one of
                    the churches and chapels there is also a congregational library, chiefly
                    consisting of theological, although some admit historical works. Besides those
                    of a general nature, there is also a consulting library for the legal
                    profession, a medical, and likewise a horticultural library. There is likewise a
                    singular kind of library, of which Stirling is the centre. It circulates among
                    the landed gentlemen chiefly in the neighbourhood, and the subscription is at
                    least two guineas a year. The funds are expended upon publications of the
                    current year, at the end of which they are sold, and the proceeds are added to
                    the stated contributions. This town has two weekly newspapers, the Stirling
                    Journal and the Stirling Observer, the former Tory, and the latter Whig, both
                    having an average provincial circulation.</p>
                <p>The chief article of domestic trade in Stirling, situated as it is in a large and
                    fertile district, now under the best culture, is grain of all kinds, amounting,
                    it is said, to the value of upwards of L.500,000 annually, there being a great
                    deal of barley consumed in the distilleries and breweries, which are numerous
                    and upon extensive scales around Stirling. The manufactures are chiefly tartans,
                    carpets, plaid-shawls, trouser-stuffs, and wool-spinning, which is beginning to
                    be conducted with spirit in the town. Stirling shalloons, which figured so long
                    in the statistics of the town, have now wholly disappeared, and their place is
                    supplied by the articles enumerated above. Coach-building seems also to thrive
                    here, as one establishment employs nearly seventy people, that of Mr Kinross,
                    who within the last twelvemonth has been honoured with the distinction of
                    coach-maker to the queen for Scotland. There are other two establishments, one
                    of which has been lately commenced. To facilitate commercial and manufacturing
                    industry, there are four stationary banks, and one which does business only on
                    one day in each week, namely, on Friday, the market-day. They are all branches
                    of banking establishments in Edinburgh or Glasgow. The commerce of the town is
                    very limited, consisting chiefly of timber, grain for the distilleries, and a
                    few other articles of little importance. There is a line of packets between
                    Stirling and Leith, and another conveyance for goods by steam twice a week. But
                    until the river be deepened, little improvement can be expected in this respect,
                    as vessels above seventy tons burden cannot reach the town even at spring tide.
                    The town council of Stirling is rather an important body, having the management
                    of considerable funds; for, besides the sum already mentioned belonging to the
                    charities, the town’s finances, arising from salmon-fisheries, customs,
                    shore-dues, &amp;c., amount to between L.3000 and L.4000; all of which revenue
                    is expended for the benefit of the public, in paving the streets, building and
                    repairing the public markets, and other purposes, as has been already
                    mentioned.</p>
                <p>The castle, at the western extremity of the eminence upon which the town is
                    built, is of greater antiquity than the town, and still exhibits marks of royal
                    magnificence. Here James II. was born; and here also with his own hand he
                    stabbed William earl of Douglas. The hall built by James III., who resided much
                    here, for the meeting of parliament, is now used as barracks. The chapel royal,
                    built by James VI. (who was educated here under the tuition of the celebrated
                    George Buchanan) for the baptism of his son Prince Henry, and which was at that
                    time the scene of one of the most pompous ceremonies ever exhibited in Scotland,
                    is now fitted up as a store-room and armoury. The palace of James V. is a large
                    quadrangular building, ornamented externally with many grotesque figures, and
                    enclosing a small court called the lion’s den. The lower story is<pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:chi.28490924&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=875" xml:id="kp-eb0720-0875-0729"/>
                    now converted into barracks, with a canteen or sutlery; and the upper flat into
                    apartments for the officers. In one of the apartments, called the king’s room,
                    the roof was covered with rich carvings in oak, which have been engraved and
                    described in a work published in 1817, under the appellation of <hi
                    rend="italic">Lucunar Strevelinense.</hi> The quaint appellation of James V. <hi
                    rend="italic">the gudeman of Ballingeich,</hi> was derived from a hollow place
                    immediately on the outside of the castle. Besides the places already noticed,
                    the castle contains a large space, also surrounded by the exterior wall, in
                    which magazines are built, called the Nether Baillery. The defences are the
                    French, the Seven-Gun, and Queen Anne’s Batteries, with several pieces of
                    ordnance here and there, amounting in all to twenty-six. On the south side of
                    the castle is a piece of flat ground called the Valley, which was appropriated
                    for tournaments. It is now used as a horse-market. There is an adjoining rock
                    called the Ladies Hill, whence they viewed the sports below. From the castle not
                    fewer than twelve battle-fields are seen. In 1831 the population of Stirling was
                    8556. <hi rend="smallcaps">(d. d.)</hi></p>
