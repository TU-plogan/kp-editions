                    significant corrections to the OCR text, predominantly in cases of confusing "c"
                    and "e." Isolates 90 entries that were mistakenly included at the end of prior
                    entries in v1 and v2. Normalizes ordinal numbers. Separates metadata in
                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra
                    space around the <gi>pb</gi> tag. Where a word is hyphenated at a <gi>pb</gi>,
                    the end fragment is now joined to the start fragment, making a machine-readable
                    word.</change>

                <p><label type="entry">SOAP</label>, a composition of caustic, fixed alkaline salt,
                    and oil, sometimes hard and dry, sometimes soft and liquid; much used in
                    washing, whitening linens, and by dyers and fullers. Soap may be made by several
                    methods, which however all depend upon the same principle. The soap which is
                    used in medicine is made without heat.</p>
                <p>In manufactures where large quantities of itare prepared, soap is made with heat.
                    A lixivium of quicklime and soda is made, but is less concentrated than that
                    above referred to, and only so much that it can sustain a fresh egg. A part of
                    this lixivium is to be even diluted and mixed with an equal weight of oil of
                    olives. The mixture is to be put on a gentle fire, and agitated, that the union
                    may be accelerated. When this mixture begins to unite well, the rest of the
                    lixivium is to be added to it; and the whole is to be digested with a very
                    gentle heat, till the soap be completely made. A trial is to be made of it, to
                    examine whether the just proportion of oil and alkali has been observed. Good
                    soap of this kind ought to be firm, and very white when cold; not subject to
                    become moist by exposure to air, and entirely miscible with pure water, to which
                    it communicates a milky appearance, but without any drops of oil floating on the
                    surface. When the soap has not these qualities, the combination has not been
                    well managed, or the quantity of salt or oil is too great, which faults must be
                    corrected.</p>
                <p>In soft or liquid soaps, green or black soaps, cheaper oils are employed, as oil
                    of nuts, of hemp, of fish, &amp;c. These soaps, excepting in consistence, are
                    not essentially different from white soap. Fixed alkalies are much disposed to
                    unite with oils that are not volatile, both vegetable and animal, since this
                    union can be made even without heat. The compound resulting from this union
                    partakes at the same time of the properties of oil and of alkali; but these
                    properties are modified and tempered by each other, according to the general
                    rule of combinations. Alkali formed into soap has not nearly the same acrimony
                    as when it is pure; it is even deprived of almost all its causticity, and its
                    other saline alkaline properties are almost entirely abolished. The same oil
                    contained in soap is less combustible than when pure, from its union with the
                    alkali, which is an inflammable body. It is miscible, or even soluble, in water,
                    to a certain degree, by means of the alkali. Soap is entirely soluble in spirit
                    of wine; and still better in aquavitae sharpened by a little alkaline salt,
                    according to an observation of Mr. Geoffroy.</p>
                <p>The manufacture of soap in London first began in the year 1524; before which time
                    this city was served with white soap from foreign countries, and with gray soap
                    speckled with white from Bristol, which was sold for a penny a pound; and also
                    with black soap, which sold for a halfpenny a pound.</p>
                <p>Concerning the decomposition of soap by means of acids, we must observe, first,
                    that all acids, even the weakest vegetable acids, may occasion this
                    decomposition, because every one of them has a greater affinity than oil with
                    fixed alkali. Secondly, these acids, even when united with any basis, excepting
                    fixed alkali, are capable of occasioning the same decomposition; whence all
                    ammoniacal salts, all salts with bases of earth, and all those with metallic
                    bases, are capable of decomposing soap, in the same manner as disengaged acids
                    are; with this difference, that the oil separated from the fixed alkali, by the
                    acid of these salts, may unite more or less intimately with the substance which
                    was the basis of the neutral salt employed for the decomposition.</p>
                <p>Soap may also be decomposed by distillation, as Lemery has shown. When first
                    exposed to fire, it yields a phlegm called by him a <hi rend="italic"
                    >spirit;</hi> which nevertheless is neither acid nor alkaline, but some water
                    which enters into the composition of soap. It becomes more and more coloured and
                    empyreumatic as the fire is increased, which shows that it contains the most
                    subtle part of the oil. It seems even to raise along with it, by help of the oil
                    and action of the fire, a small part of the alkali of the soap: for, as the same
                    chemist observes, it occasions a precipitate in a solution of corrosive
                    sublimate. After this phlegm the oil rises altered, precisely as if it had been
                    distilled from quicklime, that is, empyreumatic, soluble in spirit of wine, at
                    first sufficiently subtle and afterwards thicker. An alkaline residuous coal
                    remains in the retort, consisting chiefly of the mineral alkali contained in the
                    soap, and which may be disengaged from the coal by calcination in an open fire,
                    and obtained in its pure state.</p>
                <p>Alkaline soaps arc very useful in many arts and trades, and also in chemistry and
                    medicine. Their principal utility consists in a detersive quality that they
                    receive from their alkali, which, although it is in some measure saturated with
                    oil, is yet capable of acting upon oily matters, and of rendering them
                    saponaceous and miscible with water. Hence soap is very useful to cleanse any
                    substances from all fat matters with which they happen to be soiled. Soap is
                    therefore daily used for the washing and whitening of linen, for<pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:chi.28490924&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=499" xml:id="kp-eb0720-0499-0433"/>
                    the cleansing of woollen cloths from oil, and for whitening silk and freeing it
                    from the resinous varnish with which it is naturally covered. Pure alkaline
                    lixiviums being capable of dissolving oils more effectually than soap, might be
                    employed for the same purposes; but when this activity is not mitigated by oil,
                    as it is in soap, they are capable of altering, and even of destroying entirely,
                    by their causticity, most substances, especially animal matters, as silk, wool,
                    and others; whereas soap cleanses from oil almost as effectually as pure alkali,
                    without danger of altering or destroying; a circumstance which renders it very
                    useful.</p>
                <p>Soap was imperfectly known to the ancients. It is mentioned by Pliny as made of
                    fat and ashes, and as an invention of the Gauls. Aretaeus and others inform us,
                    that the Greeks obtained their knowledge of its medical use from the Romans.</p>

                    tax, which was fully 100 per cent. on the cost, gave occasion to a great deal of
