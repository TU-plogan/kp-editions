                    >Manufacture</hi> or <hi rend="smallcaps">Irον</hi> was published in the usual
                    order of the progress of this work, certain changes have been introduced in the
                    process of making iron, of so extensive and important a character, that we
                    cannot consider them in any other light than as effecting an entire revolution
                    in those branches of industry and of commerce connected with the manufacture and
                    application of that most valuable of metals. The change has been comparatively
                    unnoticed, extending itself during the last ten years, from the little spot in a
                    remote part of this island whence it took its origin, and has now found its way
                    over a great part of the old world, and been adopted extensively in the new.
                    Wherever it has found its way, wealth and prosperity have attended it, poverty
                    and sterility have fled before it; and there have been opened up vast stores of
                    mineral wealth to assist in the advancement of civilization and industry, which
                    our former impotence and want of skill had marked with the stigma of utter
                    unproductiveness. It is therefore necessary that we give in this article, as
                    supplementary to our former treatise, an account of the new process, now well
                    known over the whole manufacturing world as the <hi rend="italic">hot-blast
                    process</hi> for smelting iron.<pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:chi.28490924&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=473" xml:id="kp-eb0720-0473-0407"/>
                    The hot-blast process was invented in Scotland by Mr. James Beaumont Neilson, a
                    practical engineer at Glasgow, and was by him made the subject of a patent,
                    dated September 1828, being entitled, an “improved application of air, to
                    produce heat in fires, forges, and furnaces, where bellows and other blowing
                    apparatus are required.”</p>
                <p>The invention of Mr. Neilson, like a great many other inventions, and indeed some
                    of the most valuable, is characterized by extreme simplicity; and his invention
                    so perfectly accords with all the known laws of physics, that we at once apply
                    to it the well known exclamation of wonder, “how strange! that a thing so
                    obvious should not have been done long before !” an exclamation in which we too
                    often find ourselves doing an act of injustice to the very inventors to whom we
                    lie under the weightiest obligations. Mr. Neilson’s hot blast is as simple a
                    contrivance as was the steamengine condenser of his countryman, Mr. Watt, and
                    indeed bears a very close analogy to its character as an invention. Before the
                    time of Mr. Watt, steam was introduced into that part of the steam-engine where
                    it performed its labour, and was then condensed into water in the same place
                    where it had done its duty, thereby causing great waste of fuel and loss of
                    power; and to remedy this defect, Watt introduced his new principle on which his
                    fame rests; he used a <hi rend="italic">separate condenser,</hi> that is, cooled
                    the steam, and reconverted it into water, not in the cylinder, where it was
                    detrimental, but in a separate vessel communicating with it. In like manner, Mr.
                    Neilson’s invention consists in separately heating that which was formerly done
                    so as to be injurious to the process intended. Cold air was blown into a furnace
                    designed to produce intense heat for the smelting of iron from ore, so that the
                    cold blast of air itself required to be heated by the fuel in the furnace
                    intended to smelt the iron, and so its temperature was cooled down by the very
                    intensity of the blast required for the desired combustion. To remedy this
                    defect, Mr. Neilson introduced his new principle of hot blast; and instead of
                    allowing this blast of cold air to enter at once from the blowing machine or
                    bellows into the furnace, to be heated there, he provided a <hi rend="italic"
                    >separate heating apparatus,</hi> by which the air of the blast was to be heated
                    by a separate furnace and fire, previously to its entrance into the smelting
                    furnace. This is the whole invention. A hot blast of air, instead of a cold one,
                    is thus introduced for the generation of heat. Could any thing be more simple,
                    more natural, more appropriate, or more likely to prove effectual? This is the
                    hot blast, which has already in this and other countries created many millions
                    of valuable property out of what was formerly worthless, because unavailable by
                    any of the processes formerly known.</p>
                <p>Like most other inventions, the progress of this was at first very slow. Retarded
                    by practical difficulties, which beset all new processes in their first use, by
                    men who have every thing to learn,—stopped every now and then by the prejudices
                    of custom and ignorance, which cling with inveterate tenacity to maxims of
                    established practice, and repel equally the innovations which improve and those
                    which merely alter without improvement,—opposed also by the change of interests
                    which such a revolution must necessarily involve; the invention, tardy in its
                    first steps, and feeble in its early efforts, was more than once at the point of
                    being altogether abandoned. Like the invention of Watt, a great part of the
                    interest in its possible remuneration was transferred by the inventor to
                    strangers, whose combined efforts and influence it was necessary to obtain on
                    the side of the innovation. To Mr. Dunlop of Clyde iron-works Mr. Neilson had to
                    give up three-tenths of his patent rights; to Mr. Mackintosh three-tenths; and
                    one-tenth to Mr. Wilson of Dundivan, retaining to himself only three-tenths of
                    this valuable monopoly. But the transfer was judicious; it was necessary. Mr.
                    Mackintosh is distinguished as a man of much practical science; Mr.Dunlop was
                    one of the most sagacious iron-masters of his time; and Mr. Wilson was a man of
                    tried practical talent. The co-operation of these gentlemen was essential to the
                    speedy and successful trial of the novel though simple process.</p>
                <p>The following is the specification of Mr. Neilson’s patent: “I, James Beaumont
                    Neilson, do hereby declare, that the nature of my said invention for the
                    improved application of air to produce heat in fires, forges, and furnaces,
                    where bellows or other blowing apparatus are required, and the manner in which
                    the same is to be performed are particularly described and ascertained as
                    follows: That is to say, a blast or current of air must be produced by bellows
                    or other blowing apparatus in the ordinary way, to which mode of producing the
                    blast or current of air this patent is not intended to extend. The blast or
                    current of air so produced is to be passed <hi rend="italic">from the bellows or
                    blowing apparatus into an air vessel or receptacle, made sufficiently strong to
                    endure the blast, and through and from that vessel or receptacle, by means of a
                    tube, pipe, or aperture into the fire, forge, or furnace.</hi> The air vessel or
                    receptacle must be air-tight, or nearly so, except the apertures for the
                    admission and emission of the air; and at the commencement, and during the
                    continuance of the blast, it must be kept <hi rend="italic">artificially heated
                    to a considerable temperature.</hi></p>
                <p>“It is better that the temperature be kept to a red heat, or nearly so; but so
                    high a temperature is not absolutely necessary to produce a beneficial effect.
                    The air-vessel or receptacle may be conveniently made of iron; but as the effect
                    does not depend upon the nature of the material, other metals or convenient
                    materials may be used. The size of the air vessel must depend upon the blast,
                    and on the heat necessary to be produced. For an ordinary smith’s fire or forge,
                    an air vessel or receptacle, capable of containing 1200 cubic inches, will be of
                    proper dimensions; and for a cupola of the usual size for cast-iron founders, an
                    air-vessel capable of containing 10,000 cubic inches will be of a proper size.
                    For fires, forges, or furnaces, upon a greater scale, such as blast-furnaces for
                    smelting iron, and large cast-iron founders’ cupolas, air-vessels of
                    proportionably increased dimensions and numbers are to be employed. The form or
                    shape of the vessel or receptacle is immaterial to the effect, and may be
                    adapted to the local circumstances or situation. The air-vessel may generally be
                    conveniently heated by a fire, distinct from the fire to be affected by the
                    blast or current of air, and generally it will be better that the air-vessels
                    and the fire by which it is heated should be inclosed in brick-work or masonry,
                    through which the pipes or tubes connected with the air-vessel should pass. The
                    manner of applying the heat to the air-vessel is, however, immaterial to the
                    effect if it be kept at a proper temperature. In witness whereof, I, the said
                    James Beaumont Neilson, have hereunto set my hand and seal, the 28th day of
                    February, in the year of our Lord 1829.”</p>
                <p>The only part of the process of smelting the iron which is at all affected by
                    this novelty, is the transit of the air from the blowing machinery into the
                    smelting furnace. The bellows, steam-engine, water-wheel, blowing cylinders,
                    equalizing reservoirs, or other apparatus of whatever sort, for producing the
                    current of air to blow the fire, are left unchanged, as we have already
                    described and figured them in our article on <hi rend="smallcaps">Iron</hi>. The
                    furnace may be left of its former shape and dimensions in every respect as used
                    in the old process, and as we formerly described them; all that is required for
                    the introduction of the new process, is to interpose between the smelting
                    furnace and the blowing machinery an oven, heated by a separate fire, through
                    which, in appropriately shaped vessels or pipes, the blast of air on its way to
                    the furnace may be heated to a considerable temperature,—400°, 600º, or any
                    temperature found most suitable to the purpose, and so blown upon the
                    incandescent fuel in the furnace in a hot blast, as distinguished from the
                    ordinary cold blast of atmospheric air.</p>
                <p>The consequences of this hot blast system in an econo<pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:chi.28490924&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=474" xml:id="kp-eb0720-0474-0408"/>
                    mic point of view, may be illustrated by the following experimental facts.</p>
                <p>In a given furnace in Scotland, previous to the introduction of the new process,
                    the following was the average result obtained:</p>
                <p>20 tons of coal (coked), with 3 <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> / <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 2</hi> tons of limestone, smelted 4 <hi rend="superscript">
                    1</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> tons of iron, being 3 <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 1</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> tons of fuel to each
                    ton of iron.</p>
                <p>In the same furnace, by the introduction of the new process, the result was as
                    follows:</p>
                <p>14 tons of coal (raw), with 2 <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> / <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 4</hi> tons of lime, smelted 8 tons of iron, being 1 <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 3</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"> 4</hi> tons of fuel to each
                    ton of iron.</p>
                <p>Here, then, we see that, in the first place, one half of the fuel only is
                    required; that coking, a very expensive process, is avoided, the coal being used
                    raw, which was formerly impossible; and that only about one-third of the
                    quantity of limestone is required to flux the iron, and all the cost of these
                    materials, and all the labour employed in their transport, and in the process of
                    melting, are clearly saved. But these were not the only benefits conferred on
                    the iron-master. The same furnace, blowing apparatus, and establishment, that
                    formerly produced fifty tons a-week, yielded under the hot blast more than
                    double that quantity.</p>
                <p>As it was in Scotland that these advantages were first obtained, so it is there
                    that they are still possessed in the highest degree. Previously to the
                    introduction of the hot blast, it had become an almost hopeless competition to
                    produce iron there at so cheap a rate as the Welsh iron-masters could import it
                    into Scotland. The hot blast at once turned the scale; and Scotland now
                    transmits annually many thousand tons of iron to all the markets of England, and
                    even into the very heart of the iron districts of the principality itself.</p>
                <p>The cause of this difference between the advantage which Wales has derived from
                    the hot-blast process, and that conferred on Scotland, is simply this: the coal
                    fields of Wales are a rich, strong, and highly carbonaceous fuel, which loses
                    not more than thirty to forty per cent. in the process of coking. The coal basin
                    of Scotland in the iron district is, on the contrary, of a poor, earthy, light
                    description, so as to lose from fifty to sixty per cent. in the process of
                    coking, and giving, for every two tons of coal, not more, and frequently much
                    less, than one ton of coked fuel fit for the cold-blast smelting-furnace. The
                    expense and loss in the Scotish coal by this preparatory process of coking, was
                    therefore excessive, when compared with the Welsh coal; and hence the adoption
                    of this new plan, which did not require this preliminary process of coking,
                    became a much greater boon to the Scotchman, in exact proportion to his former
                    disadvantage.</p>
                <p>Great as these advantages have been found in Scotland, they have by no means been
                    limited to the country of the inventor. In Staffordshire, in the wonderfully
                    rich mineral basins of Dudley, and in Derbyshire, the invention was very early
                    introduced, and most successfully practised. The following are the general
                    results of the hot-blast system, as now practised in Staffordshire, in
                    comparison with the old system:</p>
                <p>By the cold blast,</p>
                <p>8 tons of coal (coked), with 1 <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> / <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 10</hi> ton of lime, yielded 3 tons of iron, being 2 <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 2</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi> tons of fuel to each
                    ton of iron.</p>
                <p>By the hot blast, in 1840,</p>
                <p>2 <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> tons of coal
                    (raw), with <hi rend="superscript"> 6</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"> 10</hi> ths
                    of a ton of limestone, yield 2 <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> / <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 2</hi> tons of iron, being 1 ton of fuel to each ton of
                    iron.</p>
                <p>The saving thus obtained in the article of fuel, is accompanied, it will be
                    noticed, in every instance, with a corresponding saving in the limestone
                    employed to flux the metal. But even here the whole amount of advantage does not
                    meet the eye. It was formerly important to use the very best quality of coal
                    that could be obtained,— light, bituminous, or earthy coal, being least fit for
                    the purpose, and most unprofitable. Now, although it is still desirable to have
                    a better rather than a worse fuel, the importance of this point is so greatly
                    diminished, that almost all the inferior descriptions of poorer and more
                    bituminous coal may be employed with economy and advantage. Limestone of the
                    best quality was essential to the produce of good iron by the old method; by the
                    new method, it is obvious, from inspection of the examples given, that the
                    saving in limestone varies from a third to two-thirds of the quantity employed;
                    but, in addition to this, it has become practicable to employ limestone of a
                    very inferior quality, where better may be scarce, without sensible
                    deterioration of the metal.</p>
                <p>For the production of good iron, the hot-blast system has thus opened vast
                    resources, which formerly could not be rendered available, in consequence of the
                    inferior quality of some one of the raw materials which could be brought
                    together in a given locality. In one place, abundant in excellent carbonate of
                    lime and rich ore, it became impossible to realise the mineral wealth, on
                    account of the inferior quality of the coal; while, in another, an abundant
                    supply of good limestone, and of good coal, could not be used with advantage,
                    from the poverty of the ore, which happened to be a clay stone, containing a
                    small proportion of iron. Perhaps, also, a portion of sulphur mixed with the
                    materials in such a quantity, as to ruin the iron. These all are counterbalanced
                    by the hot blast, and every one of these impracticable cases is now exemplified
                    in daily use.</p>
                <p>But there is no sphere in which the hot blast Jias exerted a more beneficial
                    influence in promoting the success of industry, and extending the resources of
                    civilization, than in its application to those sterile districts of the mineral
                    world, known as the region of the stone coal, blind coal, or anthracite
                    formation. In the blind or stone coal strata, we have that most valuable of all
                    combustibles, carbon, in a condition of high density and purity, amounting to as
                    much as ninety or ninety-five per cent. of the stone coal, with a very small per
                    centage of earthy or hydrogenous matter, yet so contracted, and, as it were,
                    iron-bound, so hard and obdurate, that, instead of forming a good combustible,
                    it seems to partake of the nature of that wonderful and brilliant substance, so
                    hard of combustion as to have been reckoned one of the incombustibles until the
                    glass of the accomplished analyst resolved the glittering brilliant into its
                    primitive carbon. The anthracite seems, in fact, truly to deserve the name of
                    the “black diamond,” having been rendered, by its dense and close structure,
                    nearly as incombustible. Although America, and many wide districts of Europe,
                    abound with this rich carbon, it has failed to furnish, even in the hands of
                    many accomplished chemists and mechanicians, an available fuel, either tor the
                    generation of steam, or for the ordinary wants of social life, and has resisted
                    even the intense heat of the blast furnace. But even its consummate obstinacy
                    has yielded to the power of the hot blast. In Wales, and in America, hot-blast
                    iron of the very finest quality is now made from stone coal; and thus stores of
                    the richest fuel which the world contains, appear only to have been reserved, by
                    their wonderful obduracy, from the rapid destruction to which all other fuel has
                    been so wastefully subjected, to supply the civilization and science of the
                    nineteenth century with the means of rewarding and extending its astonishing
                    discoveries. So kindly has Providence placed at the surface of the earth one
                    mineral fuel to replace the forests which supplied the fires of our forefathers,
                    and deposited another still richer, but more remote in the bowels of the earth,
                    to await and to reward the industry and research of<pb break="no"

                    their children and our own. What geologist will henceforth call in question the
                    abundance of that supply, which now seems to augment with the very means that
                    are invented for increasing its consumption?</p>
                <p>The Welsh coal-field is perhaps the richest in the world. Rich with bitumen on
                    one sidc, it gradually falls off by insensible gradations into a more purely
                    carbonaceous, but still free-burning coal, and, passing through every
                    intermediate gradation, is found at last in the state of a rich, resplendent
                    refractory anthractous, or stony coal. This, mixed in the proportion of two to
                    three, three to two, or half and half, smelts iron readily under he hot blast,
                    and produces a rich powerful pig, possessing the qualities of a rich charcoal
                    iron, and also capable of being converted into a most tenacious and malleable
                    bar iron. In the anthracite district of Wales, new furnaces are rapidly rising
                    into use; and Mr. Crane is distinguished by his extensive use of Mr. Neilson’s
                    hot-blast in that application of it</p>
                <p>But it is probably in America that the hot-blast system will most extensively
                    contribute to the development of mineral wealth. The anthracite is there the
                    staple of fuel. It covers a vast extent of country, and constitutes the only
                    substitute with which our transatlantic brethren can replace those forests that
                    are so rapidly receding before the advances of civilization. Here the hot-blast
                    is most successfully employed.</p>
                <p>We have thus given out readers the general specification of the hot-blast
                    improvement; a specification so general as to include all possible forms of
                    apparatus, applicable, not only to the smelting of iron, but to all cases of
                    manufacture in which a blast is employed to produce beat, and which touches only
                    the process of heating the air, without regard either to the mode of producing
                    the blast, the mode of applying the blast, or the means of beating air; and the
                    patent only provides for the carrying into effect the process of heating the
                    air, that the blast shall be passed through a heated vessel or receptacle of any
                    form or dimensions, euch as a cast or malleable iron retort, kept to a dull red
                    beat of some 1000° of temperature as the most desirable. It will readily be
                    imagined that this apparatus, described is terms of so great generality, would
                    assume various forms, according to the different views which the various
                    practical men employed to construct the apparatus took of the most effective
                    mode of heating the air. This is accordingly what occurred with the progress of
                    time, and the increasing experience of those who used the apparatus; practical
                    difficulties gradually diminished with the increased experience which was every
                    day suggesting new and better expedients. It was also soon found that the
                    advantage gained was increased in a rapid proportion with the degree of heat
                    communicated to the air, so that the apparatus which gave at first some 300° of
                    temperature to the air, and produced one measure of benefit, was soon superseded
                    by a second form of apparatus giving 400°, and conferring still higher
                    advantages; and this in its turn gave way to another and another, each giving a
                    higher temperature to the air, and promising a higher degree of economy to the
                    user. And thus at last a temperature between 600º and 700º was given to the air;
                    a temperature higher than that of melting lead, which is indeed the criterion
                    now generally applied to test the working heat of the blast.</p>
                <p>We shall probably give our readers the clearest views of these general
                    improvements, and of the progress which has generally taken place in carrying
                    them into effect, by taking a single example. For this purpose we have selected
                    the various modes of heating the air that have necessarily suggested themselves
                    to, or been put in practice by the ingenious proprietors of the Butterly iron
                    works in Derbyshire, who were the first to introduce the hot-blast into that
                    part of the country, and who have been among the most successful in carrying it
                    into effect, and producing one of the most superior qualities of hot-blast
                    iron.</p>
                <p>Elate CCCCLXII. fig. 1, shows the construction of the earliest and simplest plan
                    by which the inventous of hot-blast first brought it into use. An iron vessel
                    <hi rend="italic">h h h</hi> was formed of malleable plates, rivetted together
                    like a common steam-boiler, something near three feet in diameter, and eight or
                    ten feet long, cylindrical, and fitted at the ends to two pipes B <hi
                    rend="italic">b</hi>, communicating with the bellows, and S <hi rend="italic"
                    >s</hi> with the smelting furnace. Below this large pipe or tube a fire is
                    placed, which is fed from the door D, and the whole is enclosed in an oven of
                    brickwork OO OO, leaving a clear space all round the pipe <hi rend="italic">h h
                    h,</hi> so that the flame and hot air rising up and enveloping the receptacle,
                    should keep it so hot as to communicate through the sides of the vessel a higher
                    temperature to the air rushing through it, on its way from the bellows, B,
                    towards the smelting furnace S. And in order to communicate this temperature
                    more uniformly and completely to all the air passing through the vessel <hi
                    rend="italic">h h h,</hi> lunular partitions <hi rend="italic">ppp</hi>
                    proceeding alternately from opposite sides of the tube on its interior surface,
                    cause the stream of air to impinge first on one side, and then on the other side
                    of the heated iron pipe, as shown in the figure. By this apparatus a moderate
                    current of air has been heated to three or four hundred degrees.</p>
                <p>Fig. 2 shows the manner in which the method of beating the air was employed at
                    first in the Butterly ironworks. In the oven Ο O are placed the two cast-iron
                    retorts <hi rend="italic">hh,</hi> about thirty-two inches in diameter, and nine
                    feet long, being of metal an inch and an eighth part in thickness. They are laid
                    parallel to each other; one of them is at one end connected with the pipe B <hi
                    rend="italic">b</hi> from the blowing apparatus, and this conducts the air from
                    its other extremity through a curved junction pipe J J, into the second
                    receptacle <hi rend="italic">h h;</hi> where, on its way becoming hot, it passes
                    through the hot-air pipe S <hi rend="italic">s,</hi> from the heating furnace or
                    oven, and is blown by the orifice T through the twyre T into the hearth of the
                    smelting furnace at F. In this, as is usual, more than one blast, as at T', was
                    blown into the same smelting furnace. The fire <hi rend="italic">dd,</hi> is
                    placed at one corner of the oven on the bars <hi rend="italic">rr,</hi> and is
                    fed from the door D, and the smoke and flame rising up and surrounding <hi
                    rend="italic">h</hi><hi rend="italic superscript"> 1</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >h</hi><hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi>, pass through a partition by the flue <hi
                    rend="italic">f,</hi> and fill the second compartment of the oven, clear spaces
                    being left quite round the retorts on every side for the communication of the
                    heat; only at the points <hi rend="italic">k</hi> and <hi rend="italic">k,</hi>
                    they are supported by contact on the brick pillars <hi rend="italic">kk.</hi>
                    Finally, the products of combustion pass through a flue <hi rend="italic">f</hi>
                    into the short chimney C. In this way the cold air from the blast pipe B <hi
                    rend="italic">b</hi> passing into the vessel <hi rend="italic">h</hi><hi
                    rend="italic superscript"> 2</hi><hi rend="italic">h</hi><hi rend="italic
                    superscript"> 1</hi><hi rend="italic">,</hi> is partially heated, and is
                    conducted into a second chamber, which, being placed immediately over the fire,
                    is much more intensely hot, and from this second chamber at once discharged into
                    the smelting furnace.</p>
                <p>This apparatus was first tried in November 1830. The air was only heated to 240°.
                    Yet so admirable is the process, that it was attended with the following effect:
                    With cold blast there were previously used at Butterly,</p>
                <p>5 <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> tons coal
                    (coked), to 1 ton of iron.</p>
                <p>By the new apparatus there were required only 3 tons coal (raw), to 1 ton of
                    iron.</p>
                <p>So admirable an effect as this was not to be neglected on account of the
                    practical difficulties attending it, which indeed only served as an inducement
                    to further exertion; and in about a year after the following improved apparatus,
                    with an increased number of tubular vessels, having increased dimensions of
                    length, was successfully introduced.</p>

                    the hot air pipe S, whence, as formerly, it is discharged through the twyre into
                    the hearth of the furnace. The fuel is placed through the door D upon the fire
                    of the oven on the bars <hi rend="italic">r</hi>, and by means of a number of
                    small pigeon holes <hi rend="italic">ccc,</hi><hi rend="italic smallcaps">

                    the retorts, it would irregularly and less effectually heat their surface. The
                    manner of protecting the retorts from the direct action of the fire, is well
                    shown in the transverse section: a brick arch <hi rend="italic">aaa</hi> is
                    thrown over the fire, and the flame is only permitted to ascend through the
                    aforesaid openings <hi rend="italic">cc, ce.</hi> It will be noticed that the
                    retorts are every where clear of the building and of each other, that they are
                    wholly enclosed by the oven Ο Ο O; and it will also be seen in the transverse
                    section, and in the longitudinal section, that the products of combustion are
                    carried off by a descending flue <hi rend="italic">ff</hi> regulated by a damper
                    <hi rend="italic">ee,</hi> into the short vertical chimney C. This damper is
                    very useful in retarding the draught of air, so as to leave the products of
                    combustion a longer time in contact with the heaters.</p>
                <p>This apparatus is more effective and more durable than the last. It raised the
                    heat of the air as high as 400° to 500°, being 200° higher than the former plan,
                    as indeed we should expect from the greater number and length of the vessels,
                    and the greater surface in contact with the air. The result, compared with the
                    last, is as follows:</p>
                <p>By the former plan with air at 240°,</p>
                <p>3 tons of coal were required to melt 1 ton of iron.</p>
                <p>By the improved plan, with air at 400° to 500°,</p>

                    were required to melt 1 ton of iron.</p>
                <p>The reader will not fail to be struck with the fact, that a much greater gain was
                    obtained by the original ruder plan of using the air, when compared with the old
                    system of hot-blast, than was afterwards got from the introduction of the
                    improved apparatus over the former one. The higher temperature does not appear
                    to have conferred an advantage at all proportionable to the increased
                    temperature.</p>
                <p>Fig. 4 is a very superior and durable heating apparatus, which continues in
                    efficient use to the present time. Its form is well adapted to prevent all the
                    evils of expansion and contraction; and it is our opinion that by multiplying
                    the vessels, a more effective apparatus might be made than any now in use. Its
                    form is very ingenious, and its functions may be easily learned by studying the
                    figure, in which the letters describe the same parts with those of the previous
                    figures. B is the pipe coming from the blowing apparatus to the heating furnace

                    end, is brought back by a tube concentric with the axis to the base of the
                    retort. This process might be continued with great advantage, and make one of
                    the best series of heating vessels. The fire is covered by arches <hi

                    the former case, to prevent the vessels from being injured by the local action
                    of the intense fires.</p>
                <p>This apparatus raised the temperature to between 500° and 600°, and produced a
                    further saving in coals. By the former plan 2 <hi rend="superscript"> 13</hi> /
                    <hi rend="subscript"> 20</hi> tons of coal were required to smelt one ton of

                    rend="subscript"> 20</hi> tons of coal melted a ton ofiron.</p>
                <p>Figs. 5 and 6 are the general forms of apparatus now most extensively used. Fig.
                    5 is a form first given to the apparatus, we believe, by Mr. Dixon at Calder,
                    and hence generally called the Calder pipes. Similar pipes were also early
                    introduced at Gartsherrie, and at Wedensbury; and are very generally approved of
                    from their extensive heating surface, although they are liable to the
                    inconvenience of cracking, from unequal expansion. The form, as erected at
                    Butterly, consists of two parallel horizontal pipes L L called technically “the
                    lying pipes,” one forming a communication immediately with the cold-blast pipe
                    B, and the other with the hot-blast pipe S. Into sockets formed in the lying
                    pipe, are inserted a series of smaller pipes springing up at right angles with
                    the one lying pipe, and after forming an arch, returning down to the second
                    lying pipe, being inserted In like manner into sockets in it. The air,
                    therefore, on entering the first lying pipe, is forced through these transverse
                    heating pipes, or “A pipes” as they are called from their figure, and thus
                    exposed to the heat of a very extensive surface, is delivered into the hot-air
                    pipe. Sometimes, as at Gartsherrie and many other works, there are several times
                    as many pipes as in this example, and the air is made to cross and recross the
                    fire several times.</p>
                <p>The figures of the transverse pipes are as various as the taste of the parties
                    who use them. Sometimes they rise up and form a large semicircular arch over the
                    fire, which is placed in the centre; sometimes a double tier of such arches is
                    employed. Sometimes they cross the fire in the form of a pointed arch variously
                    acuminate. Then again by some, the pipes are carried up four, six, eight, or ten
                    feet, like columns, united at the top by a semicircular arch.</p>
                <p>The cross section of the heating pipe is as various as the form into which the
                    pipe itself is made to bend. A circular pipe was used at first, then a flattened
                    elliptical one for the purpose of exposing more surface in proportion to volume;
                    next a pipe, flat at one part, and semicircular on the other, was introduced;
                    next a pipe of a cardioid or heart-like section was employed. At Butterly Mr.
                    Terrop used a circular pipe cast with a solid core, to keep the air near the hot
                    surface, as shown in the figure; and finally, he employed the rectangular
                    section as shown in our figure 6th. All of these appear to answer their purpose
                    of heating the air sufficiently well, and all of them cause trouble and expense
                    by cracking now and then.</p>
                <p>The result of all these forms is to produce a hot-blast of more than 600°
                    temperature, and at Butterly, figs. 5 and 6 yield as follows: 2 <hi

                    ton of iron. It is found, however, at Butterly, that pigs, for the forge,
                    require about three cwt. less of coal than this average quantity, and that No. 1
                    iron requires about three cwt. more than this, as we should expect.</p>
                <p>The Scotch use less coal than the Butterly Company, principally on this account,
                    that the former use calcined ore, of which thirty-two cwt. with seven cwt. of
                    lime, makes a ton of iron, while at Butterly, the quantity used for a ton of
                    iron is 2 <hi rend="superscript"> 3</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"> 4</hi> tons,
                    with a ton of lime, being 3 <hi rend="superscript"> 3</hi> / <hi

                    in the other.</p>
                <p>The explanation of the principles from which hot-blast derives its efficacy as
                    the means of producing elevated temperature, is very easy and plain to any one
                    acquainted with the elementary principles of chemistry and mechanics. All that
                    we think it necessary to add on this subject, we shall state in the words of Mr.
                    Babbage and Dr. Ure.</p>
                <p>“The increased effect,” says Babbage, “produced by thus heating the air is by no
                    means an obvious result; and an analysis of its action will lead to some curious
                    views repecting the future application of machinery for blowing furnaces.</p>

                    one-fifth being oxygen, and four-fifths azote. According to the present state of
                    chemical knowledge, the oxygen alone is effective in producing beat; and the
                    operation of blowing a furnace may be thus analyzed.</p>
                <p>“1. The air is forced into the furnace in a condensed state, and, immediately
                    expanding, abstracts heat from the surrounding bodies.</p>
                <p>“2. Being itself of moderate temperature, it would, even without expansion, still
                    require beat to raise it to the temperature of the hot substances to which it is
                    to be applied.</p>
                <p>“3. On coming into contact with the ignited substances in the furnace, the oxygen
                    unites with them, parting at the βame moment with a large portion of its latent
                    heat, and forming compounds which have less specific beat than their separate
                    constituents. Some of these pass up the chimney in a gaseous state, whilst
                    others remain in the form of melted slags, floating on the surface of the iron,
                    which is fused by the heat thus set at liberty.</p>
                <p>“4. The effects of the azote are precisely similar to the first and second of
                    those above described; it seems to form no combinations, and contributes
                    nothing, in any stage, to augment the beat.</p>
                <p>“The plan, therefore, of heating the air before driving it into the furnace,
                    saves obviously the whole of that heat which the fuel must have supplied in
                    raising it from the temperature of the external air up to that of 600°
                    Fahrenheit; thus rendering the fire more intense, and the glassy slags more
                    fusible, and perhaps also more effectually decomposing the iron ore. The same
                    quantity of fuel, applied at once to the furnace, would only prolong the
                    duration of its heat, not augment its intensity.</p>

                    whole, clearly shews the defects of the present method, and the want of some
                    better mode of exciting combustion on a large scale.”</p>
                <p>The reader will find it interesting to compare this account with the following by
                    Dr. Ure.</p>
                <p>“Wherever a forced stream of air is employed for combustion, the resulting
                    temperature must evidently be impaired by the coldness of the air injected upon
                    the fuel. The beat developed in combustion is distributed into three portions;
                    one is communicated to the remaining fuel, another is communicated to the azote
                    of the atmosphere, and to the volatile products of combustion, and a third to
                    the iron and fluxes, or other surrounding matter to be afterwards dissipated by
                    wider diffusion. This inevitable distribution takes place in such a way, that
                    there is a nearly equal temperature over the whole extent of a fire-place, in
                    which an equal degree of combustion exists.</p>
                <p>“We thus perceive that if the air and the coal be very cold, the portions of heat
                    absorbed by them might be very considerable, and sufficient to prevent the
                    resulting temperature from rising to a proper pitch; but if they were very hot
                    they would absorb less caloric, and would leave more to elevate the common
                    temperature. Let us suppose two furnaces charged with burning fuel, into one of
                    which cold air is blown, and into the other hot air, in the same quantity. ln
                    the same time, nearly equal quantities of fuel will be consumed with a nearly
                    equal production of beat; but notwithstanding of this, there will not be the
                    same degree of heat in the two furnaces, for the one which receives the hot air
                    will be hotter by all the excess of heat in its air above that of the other,
                    since the former air adds to the heat while the latter abstracts from it. Nor
                    are we to imagine that by injecting a little more cold air into the one furnace,
                    we can raise its temperature to that of the other. With more air indeed we
                    should bum more coals in the same time, and we should produce a greater quantity
                    of beat, but this heat being diffused proportionally among more considerable
                    masses of matter, would not produce a greater temperature; we should have a
                    larger space heated, but not a greater intensity of beat in the same space.</p>
                <p>“Thus, according to the physical principles of the production and distribution of
                    heat, fires fed with hot air should, with the same fuel, rise to a higher pitch
                    of temperature than fires fed with common cold air. This consequence is
                    independent of the masses, being as true for a small stove which burns only an
                    ounce of charcoal in a minute, as for a furnace which burns a hundred weight;
                    but the excess of temperature produced by hot air cannot be the same in small
                    fires as in great; because the waste of beat is usually less the more fuel is
                    burned.</p>
                <p>“This principle may be rendered still more evident by a numerical illustration.
                    Let us take, for example, a blast furnace, into which 600 cubic feet of air are
                    blown per minute; suppose it to contain no ore but merely coal or coke, and that
                    it has been burning long enough to have arrived at the equilibrium of
                    temperature, and let us see what excess of temperature it would have if blown
                    with air of 300° C. (572° F.) instead of being blown with air at 0° C.</p>
                <p>"Six hundred cubic feet of air under the mean temperature und pressure, weigh a
                    little more than 45 pounds avoirdupoise; they contain 10∙4 pounds of oxygen,
                    which would burn very nearly 4 pounds of carbon, and disengage 16,000 times as
                    much heat as would raise by one degree cent. the temperature of two pounds of
                    water. These 16,000 portions of heat, produced every minute, will replace 16,000
                    other portions of heat, dissipated by the sides of the furnace and employed in
                    heating the gases, which escape from its mouth. This must take place in order to
                    establish the assumed equilibrium of caloric.</p>
                <p>“If the 45 pounds of air be heated beforehand up to 300° C., they will contain
                    about the eighth part of the heat of the 16,000 disengaged by the combustion,
                    and there will be therefore in the same space one-eighth of heat more, which
                    will be ready to operate upon any bodies within its range, and to heat them
                    one-eighth more. Thus the blast of 300° C. gives a temperature which is
                    nine-eighths of the blast at zero C., or at even the ordinary atmospheric
                    temperature; and as we may reckon at from 2'200° to 2700° F. (from 1200° to
                    1000° C.) the temperature of blast furnaces worked in the common way, we
                    perceive that the hot-air blast produces an increase of temperature equal to
                    from 270° to 360° F.</p>
                <p>Now in order to appreciate the immense effects which this excess of temperature
                    may produce in metallurgic operations, we must consider that often only a few
                    degrees more temperature are required to modify the state of a fusible body, or
                    to determine the play of affinities dormant at lower degrees of heat. Water is
                    solid at 1° under 32° F.; it is liquid at 1° above. Every fusible body has a
                    determinate melting point, a very few degrees above which it is quite fluid,
                    though it may be pasty below it. the same observation applies to ordinary
                    chemical affinities; charcoal, for example, which reduces the greater part of

                    under which it is inoperative, but a few degrees above, it is in general lively
                    and complete. It is unnecessary, in this article, to enter into any more details
                    to show the influence of a few degrees of heat, more or less, in a furnace, upon
                    chemical operations, or merely upon physical changes of state.</p>
                <p>“These consequences might have been deduced long ago, and industry might thus
                    have been enriched with a new application of science; but philosophera have been
                    and still are too much estranged from the study of the useful arts, and content
                    themselves too much with the minutiae of the laboratory or theoretic
                    abstractions. Within the space of seven years, the use of the hot-blast has been
                    so much extended in Great Britain, as to have enabled many proprietors of
                    iron-works to add 50 per cent. to their weekly production of metal, to diminish
                    the weekly expenses of smelting by 50 per cent., and, in many cases, to produce
                    a better sort of cast-iron from indifferent materials."</p>
                <p>The following table is from a report of M. Dufresnoy, made to the
                    director-general of mines in France in 1834.<pb break="no"

                    Since that period the cost has been rendered much lower, and those who have made
                    good arrangements for mineral property, can manufacture iron at a cost of little
                    more than L.2 per. ton.</p>
                <p>At the request of the British Association. Dr. Thomson of Glasgow examined the
                    chemical constitution of hot-blast iron, and he gives the following as the
                    result of his inquiry:</p>
                <p>“ (1.) The specific gravity of hot-blast iron is greater than that of
                    cold-blast.</p>
                <p>“The following are the specific gravities of eight specimens of cold blast
                    iron:</p>
                <p> 1st. Muirkirk 6·410 </p>

                <p>7th. From Carron 6∙9888</p>
                <p>8th. Clyde Iron Works 7·0028</p>
                <p>“The specific gravity of the Muirkirk iron is considerably less than of that
                    smelted at Carron and the Clyde Iron Works; the mean of the eight specimens is
                    6·7034.</p>
                <p>“It has been hitherto supposed that the difference between cast-iron and
                    malleable iron consists in the presence of carbon in the former, and its absence
                    from the latter; in other words, that cast iron is a carburet of iron. But in
                    all the specimens of cast iron which we analysed we constantly found several
                    other ingredients besides iron and carbon. Manganese is pretty generally present
                    in minute quantity, though in one specimen it amounted to no less a quantity
                    than 7 per cent.; its average amount is 2 per cent. <hi rend="italic"

                    while others contain less than a half per cent. Aluminum is very rarely
                    altogether absent, though its amount is more variable than that of silicon. Its
                    average amount is 2 per cent.; sometimes it exceeds 4 <hi rend="superscript">

                    weight of the iron.</p>
                <p>“Calcium and magnesium are sometimes present, but very rarely, and the quantity
                    does not much exceed <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> / <hi rend="subscript">

                    which he had smelted from pyrites, there was a trace of copper, showing that the
                    pyrites employed was not quite free from copper; and in a specimen from the
                    Clyde Iron-Works there was a trace of sulphur. The following table exhibits the
                    composition of six different specimens of cast iron. No. I, analyzed in my

                    carbon is almost the same as in cold-blast iron, No, 2 but the proportion of
                    aluminum is four times as great, while the silicon is little more than half as
                    much. The atomic ratios are, carbon, 4; silicon, 0·67; aluminum, 2·28.</p>
                <p>“3. Five specimens of hot-blast cast iron, No. 1, were analysed. Two of these
                    were from Carron,and three from the Clyde IronWorks, where the hot-blast
                    originally began; and where, of course, it has been longest in use. The specific
                    gravity of these specimens was found to be as follows:</p>
                <p>1st. From Clyde Works 7·0028</p>
                <p>2d. From Carron, 7·0721</p>
                <p>3d. From Carron 7·0721</p>
                <p>4th∙ From Clyde Works,. 7·1022</p>
                <p>Mean, 7·0623</p>
                <p>“It appears from this, that the hot-blast increases the specific gravity of
                    cast-iron by about <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> / <hi rend="subscript">
                    22</hi> nd part. It approaches nearer the apecific gravity of east iron No. 2,
                    smelted by cold air, than to that of No. 1.</p>

                <p>“Of the three columns of numbers in the table above, the first is the strength or
                    other quality in the cold-blast iron; the second is that in the hot-blast; and
                    the third is the ratio of these quantities.</p>
                <p>“The results in this table contain nearly the whole information relative to the
                    question of hot and cold-blast-iron that the preceding research affords; and
                    before adverting to them, it may be mentioned, that it is usual for the makers
                    of cast-iron to divide it. when taken from the furnace, into three classes,
                    called Nos. 1, 2, 3, differing from each other in the appearance and qualities
                    of the material. No. 1 contains the softest and richest irons, those which have
                    the largest crystals; No. 3, the hardest and densest irone, those with the least
                    crystals; and No. 2, irons intermediate between the former two descriptions.
                    Beginning with the No. 1 iron, of which we have a specimen from the Buffery
                    Iron-Works, a few miles from Birmingham, we find the cold-blast iron somewhat
                    surpassing the hot-blast in all the following particulars; direct tensile
                    strength, compressive strength, transverse strength, power to resist impact,
                    modulus of elasticity or stiffness, specific gravity; whilst the only numerical
                    advantage possessed by the hot-blast iron is, that it bends a little mote than
                    the cold-blast before it breaks.</p>
                <p>“In the irons of the quality No. 2, the case seems in some degree different; in
                    these the advantages of the rival kinds seem to be more nearly balanced. They
                    are still, however, rather in favour of the cold blast.</p>
                <p>“Referring to the No. 2 iron, from the Carron Works in Scotland, we find the
                    tensile, compressive, and transverse strengths, together with the modulus of
                    elasticity and specific gravity, all higher in the cold-blast iron than the
                    hot-blast, whilst the ultimate deflection and power of sustaining impact are
                    greater in the hot-blast. The cold-blast iron is the better, but the difference
                    is very small.</p>
                <p>" In the iron No. 2, from the Coed-Talon Works in North Wales, the tensile
                    strength is greater in the cold-blast than in the hot; but the resistance to
                    compression is higher in the latter than the former, and that is the case with
                    the specific gravity.</p>
                <p>“So far as my experiments have proceeded, the irons of No. 1 have been
                    deteriorated by the hot-blast; those of No. 2 appear also to have been slightly
                    injured by it; while the irons of No. 3 seem to have benefited by its mollifying
                    powers. the Carron iron No. 3, bot-blast, resists both tension and compression
                    with considerably more energy than that made with the cold-blast; and the No. 9
                    hot-blast iron from the Devon Works, in Scotland, is one of the strongest cast.
                    iruns I have seen, whilst that made with the cold-blast is comparatively weak,
                    though its specific gravity is very high, and higher than in the hot. The
                    extreme hardness of the cold-blast Devon iron above prevented many experiments
                    that would otherwise have been made upon it, no tools being hard enough to form
                    the specimens. The difference of strength in the Devon irons is peculiarly
                    striking.</p>
                <p>“From the evidence here brought forward, it is rendered exceedingly probable that
                    the introduction of a heated blast into the manufacture of cast-iron has injured
                    the softer irons, whilst it has frequently mollified and improved those of a
                    harder nature; and considering the small deterioration that the irons of the
                    quality No. 2 have sustained, and the apparent benefit to those of No. 3,
                    together with the great saving effected by the heated blast, there seems good
                    reason for the process becoming as general as it has done.” (c. <hi
