                <p><label type="entry">SHIELD</label>, an ancient weapon of defence, in the form of
                    a light buckler, borne on the arm to fend off lances, darts, and other weapons.
                    The form of the shield is represented by the escutcheon in coats of arms. The
                    shield was that part of the ancient armour on which the persons of distinction
                    in the field of battle always had their arms painted; and most of the words used
                    at this time to express the space that holds the arms of families are derived
                    from the Latin word <hi rend="italic">scutum.</hi> The French <hi rend="italic"
                    >escu</hi> and <hi rend="italic">escussion,</hi> and the English word <hi
                    rend="italic">escutcheon</hi> or <hi rend="italic">scutcheon,</hi> are evidently
                    from this origin; and the Italian <hi rend="italic">scudο</hi> signifies both
                    the shield of arms and that used in war. The Latin name <hi rend="italic"
                    >clypeus,</hi> for the same thing, seems also to be derived from the Greek word
                    <hi rend="italic">γλυφειv, to engrave;</hi> and it had this name from the
                    several figures engraved on it, as marks of distinction of the person who wore
                    it.</p>
                <p>The shield in war, among the Greeks and Romans, was not only useful in defence,
                    but it was also a badge of honour to the wearer; and he who returned from battle
                    without it was always treated afterwards with infamy. People have at all times
                    thought this honourable piece of the armour the properest place to engrave or
                    figure on the signs of dignity of the possessor of it; and hence, when arms came
                    to be painted for families in aftertimes, the heralds always chose to represent
                    them upon the figure of a shield, but with several exterior additions and
                    ornaments, as the helmet, supporters, and the rest.</p>
                <p>The form of the shield has not only been found different in various nations, but
                    even the people of the same nation, at different times, have varied its form
                    extremely; and among several nations there have been shields of several forms
                    and sizes in use, at the same period of time, and suited to different occasions.
                    The most ancient and universal form of shields, in the earlier ages, seems to
                    have been the triangular. This we see instances of in all the monuments and gems
                    of antiquity. Our own early monuments show it to have been the most antique
                    shape also with us, and the heralds have found it the most convenient for their
                    purposes, when they had any odd number of figures to represent; as if three,
                    then two in the broad bottom part, and one in the narrow upper end, it held them
                    very well; or if five, they stood as conveniently, as three below and two above.
                    The other form of a shield, now universally used, is square, rounded, and
                    pointed at the bottom. This is taken from the figure of the Samnitic shield used
                    by the Romans, and since copied very generally by the English, French, and
                    Germans.</p>
                <p>The Spaniards and Portuguese have the like general form of shields, but they are
                    round at the bottom, without the point; and the Germans, besides the Samnite
                    shield.<pb break="no" facs="ht:chi.28490924&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=224"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0720-0224-0206"/> have two others pretty much in use. These are,
                    first, the bulging shield, distinguished by its swelling or bulging out at the
                    flanks; and, secondly, the indented shield, or shield chancree, which has a
                    number of notches and indentings all round its sides. The use of the ancient
                    shield of this form was, that the notches served to rest the lance upon, that it
                    might be firm while it gave the thrust; but this form being less proper for the
                    receiving armorial figures, the two former have been much more used in the
                    heraldry of that nation.</p>
                <p>Besides this different form of the shields in heraldry, we find them also often
                    distinguished by their different positions, some of them standing erect, and
                    others slanting various ways and in different degrees. This the heralds express
                    by the word <hi rend="italic">pendant,</hi> “hanging,” because they seem to be
                    hung up, not by the centre, but by the right or left corner. The French call
                    these <hi rend="italic">ecu pendant,</hi> and the common antique triangular ones
                    ecu <hi rend="italic">ancien.</hi> The Italians call it <hi rend="italic">scuto
                    pendente;</hi> and the reason given for exhibiting the shield in these figures
                    in heraldry is, that in the ancient tilts and tournaments, they who were to
                    joust at these military exercises were obliged to hang their shields, with their
                    armories, or coats of arms, on them, out at the windows and balconies of the
                    houses near the place, or upon trees, pavilions, or the barriers of the ground,
                    if the exercise was to be performed in the field.</p>
                <p>Those who were to fight on foot, according to Columbier, had their shields hung
                    up by the right corner, and those who were to fight on horseback had theirs hung
                    up by the left. This position of the shields in heraldry is called <hi
                    rend="italic">couche</hi> by some writers, though by the generality <hi
                    rend="italic">pendant.</hi></p>
                <p>It was very frequent in all parts of Europe, in arms given between the eleventh
                    and fourteenth centuries; but it is to be observed that the hanging by the left
                    corner, as it was the token of the owner’s being to fight on horseback, so it
                    was esteemed the most honourable and noble situation; and all the pendant
                    shields of the sons of the royal family of Scotland and England, and of our
                    nobility, at the time, are represented thus hanging from the left corner. The
                    hanging from this corner was a token of the owner’s being of noble birth, and
                    having fought in the tournaments before; but no sovereign ever had a shield
                    pendant any way, but always erect, as they never formally entered the lists of
                    the tournament.</p>
                <p>The Italians generally have their shields of arms of an oval form. This seems to
                    be done in imitation of those of the popes and other dignified clergy; but their
                    herald, Petro Sancto, seems to regret the use of this figure of the shield, as
                    an innovation brought in by the painters and engravers, as most convenient for
                    holding the figures, but derogatory to the honour of the possessor, as not
                    representing either antiquity or honours won in war, but rather the honours of
                    some citizen or person of learning. Some have carried it so far as to say, that
                    those who either have no ancient title to nobility, or who have sullied it by
                    any unworthy action, cannot any longer wear their arms in shields properly
                    figured, but are obliged to have them painted in an oval or round shield. In
                    Flanders, where this author lived, the round and oval shields are in the
                    disrepute he speaks of; but in Italy, besides the popes and dignified prelates,
                    many of the first families of the laity have them.</p>
                <p>The secular princes, in many other countries, also retain this form of the
                    shield, as the most ancient and truly expressive of the Roman clypeus.</p>
