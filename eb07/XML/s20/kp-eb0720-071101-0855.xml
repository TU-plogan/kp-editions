                    that has been said under the articles <hi rend="smallcaps">iron</hi> and <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">smelting</hi> in reference to the sources and means of
                    procuring that metal in a state of purity, may be advantageously referred to as
                    a preliminary to the present.</p>
                <p>Steel is a carburet of iron, with probably a slight mixture of other substances
                    which are more or less essential to its perfection, and certainly in most cases
                    with some alloy which is not essential, but which, on the contrary, is to some
                    extent injurious. This description would equally apply to cast-iron, which
                    differs from steel as to its ingredients principally in the quantity of carbon,
                    cast-iron having sometimes one-fifteenth part, and good steel seldom more than
                    one two-hundredth part of that substance. The difference between the proportions
                    of the carbon does little, however, to explain the difference between cast-iron
                    and steel; for, while the condition of cast-iron is retained, it is found that
                    diminishing the quantity of carbon renders it still less like good steel. It
                    appears, in short, that the good qualities of steel—and they are very various—
                    depend upon circumstances partly chemical and partly mechanical, which have
                    hitherto detied analysis. It is not even precisely known whether the union of
                    the iron and carbon is a chemical or mechanical union: perhaps it may be partly
                    one and partly the other, for reasons which will presently be given.</p>
                <p>In consequence of this ignorance as to what constitutes the essential qualities
                    of good steel, the processes by which favourable results have been obtained have
                    in nearly all cases been empirical, and in many instances have been real or
                    pretended secrets. The processes are of a nature to forbid any very nice
                    calculations, and they are liable to great and unappreciable modifications in
                    the execution. For example, steel being, as before stated, a carburet of iron,
                    and having generally a slight admixture of oxyde of iron, must be subject to
                    many incalculable changes during its successive exposures to violent heat in
                    contact with carbonaceous fuel and atmospheric air. Moreover, the hammering, on
                    which many of its good properties depend, is obviously an operation which cannot
                    be meted out with very scrupulous nicety, and is besides liable to be very much
                    influenced by the temperature of the metal and by the direction of the blows in
                    reference to the mechanical structure of the mass.</p>
                <p>A good practical essay on steel, it is therefore evident, would consist in an
                    exceedingly minute detail of the actual operations applied to a certain
                    description of ore, or to a known specimen of manufactured iron, which, with
                    certain sorts of fuel, had been found uniformly to produce steel peculiarly
                    adapted to certain purposes. Such an essay would form a volume, and it would
                    still convey imperfectly what it professed to teach, because in all the
                    processes there are certain stages of the conversion whose advent is judged of
                    by the experienced eye and hand of the skilful workman, from symptoms which can
                    be explained only to the sight and touch. Hero we only propose to describe, in
                    very general terms, some of the principal processes, so as to convey a knowledge
                    of the <hi rend="italic">theory</hi> of steel-making without professing to give
                    the actual practice. We must premise, that the destination of the steel is of
                    great importance in estimating even the theory of those processes, as may be
                    well supposed when it is recollected that a lancet will fracture almost like
                    glass, while a bricklayer’s trowel is required to cut the most refractory lump
                    of semi-vitrified clay in the shape of a brick. These two instruments are
                    perhaps at the extremities of the scale, the perfect hardness and brittleness of
                    the lancet contrasting with the extraordinary toughness and tenacity of the
                    trowel.</p>
                <p>It was at one time, indeed, thought so difficult to combine these last-mentioned
                    qualities with sufficient hardness to sever a good stock-brick, that trowels
                    were made of a plate of iron to supply the toughness, and an edge of steel to
                    give the hardness. Even at the present time it is supposed that the peculiar
                    qualities of certain sword-blades result from their being combinations of hard
                    steel with soft tenacious iron fibre; and that the variegated or <hi
                    rend="italic">damasked</hi> surface of such blades is owing to the different
                    appearances presented by the iron and steel. By some this effect has been
                    supposed to result from chemical changes acting partially upon the original
                    carburet, depositing the carbon more profusely in some parts of the iron than in
                    others. It may arise, as already hinted, from some portions of the carburet
                    being in a chemical, and others only in a mechanical state of union. According
                    to other authorities, the structure in question has been manufactured expressly
                    by binding up portions of soft iron wire with ingots of steel, and hammering the
                    whole into a mass at a high temperature. Such a process will, it is known,
                    produce very similar appearances. Whatever be the truth in regard to the
                    sword-blades, certain combinations of iron and steel in parallel laminae are
                    advantageously employed for some put poses. The carpenter’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >plane-iron,</hi> for example, consists of a very thin hard steel face on an
                    iron back; because this instrument requires to unite a cutting edge nearly equal
                    to that of the lancet with a tenacity which shall encounter uninjured the
                    hardest knots; a trial almost as severe as that applied to the trowel.</p>
                <p>One great cause of the uncertainty and obscurity attending the practice of
                    steel-making, is the importance of the hammering or other mechanical parts of
                    the operation. If<pb break="no" facs="ht:chi.28490924&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=856"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0720-0856-0712"/> the distinction between good and bad steel were
                    principally chemical, the production of the former would long since have been
                    rendered easy and determinate. How little this is the case may be inferred from
                    the fact, that the elaborate series of experiments conducted a few years since
                    by Dr Faraday and Mr Stodart have scarcely added a new fact to the science of
                    steel-making; while, on the other hand, the immense value of mechanical action
                    is shown, among numerous instances, by the increased strength of <hi
                    rend="italic">drawn</hi> iron wire as compared with <hi rend="italic"
                    >rolled</hi> iron of equal size, a difference amounting sometimes to sixty or
                    seventy per cent.</p>
                <p>The remarkable qualities of the trowels for which a Mr. Walby was celebrated
                    about forty years since, resulted in a great measure, if not entirely, from good
                    and rapid hammering at a moderate temperature. The object of hammering being to
                    condense the steel, it is evident that when at a white heat, in a state
                    approaching to fusion, the mass is so plastic, it yields so freely, that
                    hammering is perfectly inoperative, except to change the external form; while,
                    on the other hand, if the mass be cold, it is so unsusceptible of what may be
                    called intestinal movement among its particles that the most violent hammering
                    can do little more than dislocate portions of the surface, which will
                    accordingly crack or scale off. Between these extremes a medium may be found,
                    and was, we believe, found by Mr Walby. His hammering was principally performed
                    at a low cherry-red heat; and, by means of a peculiar and ingeniously mounted
                    hammer of considerable weight, he was enabled to do all that was required before
                    the temperature was sensibly lowered. But, as we are informed, he did more than
                    this. It is quite certain that in hammering any mass, and especially in a thin
                    plate, the central cannot be under the same circumstances as the exterior
                    portions. Not only will the centre retain its heat somewhat, longer, but, what
                    is of more consequence, the tendency of the central portions to spread laterally
                    under the hammer, is resisted by the marginal parts; while these latter not
                    being so protected by a belt, spread freely, and perhaps separate into detached
                    pieces. If, for example, a circular disc of steel at a low temperature were
                    violently beaten under a flat hammer, it would be very much condensed in the
                    middle, while the circumference would gradually separate, showing radial splits
                    or cracks. The most perfect way to condense a circular disc of metal would
                    obviously be to confine it in a very strongly defended cavity, whose walls
                    should prevent all lateral spreading, and thus the full effect of each blow
                    would be felt in condensation. Such a process is, however, inapplicable to
                    trowel making, and perhaps to all other purposes except the striking of medals,
                    where we see it employed; but Mr Walby obtained nearly all the effect of such an
                    arrangement by forging each trowel considerably larger than it was ultimately
                    intended to be, and cutting off about an inch of superfluous metal after the
                    hammering was completed; cutting off, that is to say, the wall which had acted
                    to restrain the spreading of the central portion of the blade, and which had
                    probably become loose and spongy itself fur want of such restraint, thus leaving
                    only the close compact metal in the finished trowel.</p>
                <p>Having thus endeavoured to direct the reader’s attention to some of the qualities
                    demanded in steel, and to the causes which affect their production, we shall
                    briefly describe some of the operations.</p>
                <p>Steel is most frequently made from rolled bars of <hi rend="italic">good,</hi> by
                    which we mean <hi rend="italic">pure</hi> iron. To communicate to these bars the
                    desired quantity of carbon, they are formed into bundles, and are placed in a
                    large stove or furnace alternating with layers of carbon, (hard-wood charcoal is
                    preferred,) and a high temperature being maintained for a week or ten days, the
                    iron gradually absorbs the required quantity of carbon, and becomes converted
                    into steel. The completeness of this conversion is judged of from time to time
                    by the examination of certain of the bars, which are so disposed as to be
                    accessible for this purpose. If the carbon has not penetrated to the centre of
                    the metal, this will be evident on breaking the bar transversely, as the section
                    will exhibit a colour in the centre different from that near the surface: it
                    will show what the workmen call a pith. Towards the end of the process, the
                    watching requires to be skilful and constant, because, if the absorption of
                    carbon becomes very excessive, the metal may be rendered so fusible as suddenly
                    to melt; and though this would be of little consequence in a sound crucible, it
                    would be attended with great loss in a large stove or hearth. The surface of the
                    bars becomes so nearly in this condition that it is always blistered by the
                    escape or rarefaction of air or gas from the interior of the metal; and hence
                    bars so prepared have acquired the name of blister or blistered steel. The
                    process itself is called cementation.</p>
                <p>The bars thus prepared do not differ very greatly from cast-iron, except in the
                    smaller quantity of carbon which they contain, and in their freedom from
                    impurities. They have somewhat more malleability and tenacity than cast-iron,
                    but not so much as is imparted to that substance during its conversion to
                    bar-iron, and which must now, except for very coarse purposes, be communicated
                    to these bars of cementation—without, however, depriving them of their carbon.
                    With this view the bars so prepared are broken up into short lengths, are made
                    into bundles, heated almost to a white heat, hammered, welded together,
                    re-broken and re-hammered till they are reduced as nearly as possible to a
                    compact homogeneous mass of greater specific gravity than in their former state.
                    In all these weldings, care is required to preserve the surfaces clean and
                    unoxydized, as upon this depends the perfect union of the two surfaces.</p>
                <p>This care is dispensed with in the processes for making cast-steel, the nature of
                    which has been already indicated in describing that of cementation. The pure
                    iron and a certain proportion of carbon are fused together in a crucible, and
                    being cast into ingots, these are treated somewhat like the bundles of the
                    cemented bars. They are hammered at a high temperature till they are rendered
                    malleable and dense, and till a certain portion of the carbon is displaced, that
                    substance being generally in excess. Various modes of applying the carbon have
                    been proposed; but it is very difficult to determine in the abstract which of
                    these is the best. One mode of application is, by the introduction of a stream
                    of gas. Cast-steel is free from the defects which are liable to attend the
                    imperfect welding of the bars, and is likely to supersede all others for the
                    finer purposes of cutlery. It requires, however, the most skilful manipulation
                    as the point of sufficient fusion is reached, and this must be performed under
                    the most severe exposure to heat; so severe as to demand that the workmen should
                    be protected, by clothing of wetted sackcloth, from the joint effects of the
                    opened furnace and the glowing crucible. This combination of skill and severe
                    labour secures high wages, and enhances the price of the article.</p>
                <p>The experiments of Faraday and Stodart, before alluded to, were undertaken not so
                    much to improve the mode of manufacture as to determine the effect of various
                    alloys; it having been inferred, partly from the condensation which frequently
                    accompanies chemical unions, and partly from the examination of certain
                    specimens of steel which were known to possess good qualities, that a small
                    portion of foreign matter might be beneficially introduced. With this view,
                    alloys<pb break="no" facs="ht:chi.28490924&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=857"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0720-0857-0713"/> of steel with gold, silver, platinum, and many
                    other metals, in various proportions and combinations, were made, without
                    however producing any very definite results. One of the best was a mixture of
                    500 parts of steel with one part of silver. While the silver was in this small
                    proportion, it appeared to diffuse itself equally throughout the mass, and the
                    union appeared to be chemical. No remarkable increase of specific gravity
                    accompanied the union; and the opinion formed at the time, that the steel was
                    improved by the addition, is beginning to be shaken, it is worth mentioning,
                    that if the quantity of silver much exceeded the five-hundredth part, the excess
                    was distributed in small distinct fibrous masses, in such a manner as to unfit
                    the steel for most purposes of utility.</p>
                <p>Having by any of the means now mentioned manufactured a good steel or a good
                    alloy, it is found to have acquired a property on which its great value in the
                    arts entirely depends: we mean the property of becoming very hard when <hi
                    rend="italic">suddenly</hi> cooled from a high temperature. If heated to
                    whiteness, and then plunged into water, instead of the malleable tenacious
                    substance which had been produced under the welding hammers, it has become
                    nearly as hard as a diamond and as brittle as glass. The sudden cooling from a
                    white heat would, however, be found to have damaged considerably the compactness
                    of the steel; and practically it is known, that the lower the temperature on
                    which the sudden cooling can be made to act with effect, the better will be the
                    quality of the metal. It is also supposed that the lower the temperature nt
                    which the steel is manufactured—that is to say, hammered into compactness and
                    malleability—the lower will be the temperature necessary to give it hardness.
                    When all these points have been determined to the greatest exactness, there
                    remains another consideration which has been well pointed out by a recent writer
                    on the subject. Since the perfection of every steel instrument depends upon its
                    receiving a hardness very exactly proportioned to its intended use, and as the
                    subsequent operations will equally affect every part of the hardened steel, it
                    is most important that the hardening be equal in every part, in order that the
                    hardness of the whole, when reduced, shall be equal. If then the heated steel,
                    at the moment of its plunge into the water, be in some parts coated with an
                    oxyde of iron while in other parts it is clean, the rapidity of the cooling in
                    the various parts will be so different as to affect seriously the uniformity of
                    the result. In this way, among others, we can understand how it happens that one
                    part of a razor or other instrument shall be much harder than another. To avoid
                    this inequality, it has been proposed that the instrument shall be perfectly
                    cleansed upon a stone previously to hardening, and then heated with the utmost
                    care to prevent the formation, or at least the unequal formation, of oxyde upon
                    the surface. Various opinions and practices prevail as to the mode of cooling.
                    Besides water at various temperatures, saline solutions, mercury, and a current
                    of air, have been suggested; but it is doubtful whether any of them is
                    preferable to water at a moderate temperature.</p>
                <p>The steel having now been made indefinitely hard, too hard generally for any
                    practical purposes, it requires to be tempered or softened down more or less,
                    according to the nature and uses of the intended instrument. This is done by the
                    application of a moderate heat, varying from 43° to 600° of Fahrenheit; the
                    higher temperatures softening the metal proportionally more than the lower.</p>
                <p>Formerly the heat applied in tempering was judged of by the colour assumed by the
                    steel, a portion being always ground clean, to enable the operator to observe
                    exactly when the required shade of colour was obtained. These colours, it may be
                    stated, are produced by the action of the oxygen in the air upon the heated
                    metal; and though their indications are sufficiently accurate for most purposes,
                    it has been found desirable in some cases to substitute a fusible metallic bath,
                    by which a regulated temperature may with certainty be communicated.</p>
                <p>The following table, showing the temperatures according to Fahrenheit, which
                    correspond with various colours, was drawn up by the late Mr Stodart:—</p>
                <p>1. Very pale straw yellow, 430°</p>
                <p>2. A shade of darker yellow,....· 450</p>
                <p>3. Darker straw yellow 470</p>
                <p>4. Still darker straw yellow, 490</p>
                <p>5. A browner yellow, 500</p>
                <p>6 Yellow slightly tinged with purple, 520</p>
                <p>7. Light purple, 530</p>
                <p>8. Dark purple, 550</p>
                <p>9. Deep blue, 570</p>
                <p>10. Paler blue 590</p>
                <p>11. Still paler blue, 610</p>
                <p>12. Still paler blue, with a tinge of green,... 630</p>
                <p>When the hardened steel is heated only within the limits here specified, it
                    matters not how it is cooled; the softening or tempering equally takes place,
                    and is proportioned to the temperature. The knowledge of the proper degrees of
                    heat or colour adapted to various instruments, is obtained wholly by experience.

                    accurate as any :—</p>
