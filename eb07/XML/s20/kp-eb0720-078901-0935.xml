                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra

                <p><label type="entry">SUFFOLK</label>, an English maritime county, on the borders
                    of the German Ocean. It is bounded on the east by the sea; on the south by
                    Essex, from which it is divided by the river Stour; on the west by
                    Cambridgeshire; and on the north by Norfolk. Its medium length from east to west
                    is forty-seven miles, and its breadth from north to south twenty-seven. The
                    square contents are 1512 miles, or 967,680 statute acres. It consists of two
                    grand divisions, one called the Liberty of Bury, the other the Guildable Land,
                    each of which furnishes a distinct grand jury at the assizes. The next division
                    is into twenty-one hundreds, and these are subdivided into five hundred and
                    twenty-three parishes. The entire country forms a part of the diocese of
                    Norwich.</p>
                <p>The population of this county at the four decennial periods of enumeration was
                    found to amount in 1801 to 210,431, in 1811 to 234,211, in 1821 to 270,542, and
                    in 1831 to 296,000.</p>
                <p>At the last period the occupiers of land employing labourers were 4,526</p>
                <p>Occupiers not employing labourers 1,121</p>

                <p>Female servants 11,483</p>
                <p>In the same year the number of families chiefly employed in agriculture was found
                    to be 31,491; those chiefly employed in trade, manufactures, and handicraft,
                    were 18,116; and those comprised in neither of the preceding classes were
                    11,926. The number of inhabited houses was 50,139, occupied by 61,533 families;
                    the uninhabited houses were 1141, and those building 259.</p>
                <p>The annual value of the real property of the county, as assessed for the purposes
                    of the property-tax in the year 1813, was L. 1,127,404.</p>
                <p>The towns of this county containing more than 2000 inhabitants, with their
                    population in 1831, were the following: Ipswich 20,454</p>

                <p>Suffolk is generally a level tract of country, in which, as there are few
                    elevations, there are scarcely any extensive prospects. It is, however,
                    tolerably well clothed with trees, but wants running water; most of the streams
                    being very sluggish in their course, and by no means copious. The soil is as
                    various as in other districts of the same extent. On the sea-coast it is in
                    general sandy, but rendered productive by the application of shell-marl, which
                    is found in abundance. In the middle of the county, from north to south, called
                    usually High Suffolk, which is the larger part, the soil is a tenacious, loamy
                    clay, affording good pasturage for cows, whose butter is chiefly used to supply
                    the London markets.</p>
                <p>The north-western division is a poor sandy soil, in many places covered with
                    heath, and scarcely fit for any other purpose than that of feeding sheep or
                    breeding rabbits, of which latter animals, it is said, the skins of more than
                    40,006 annually supply fur to the hatters. The corn furnished by the eastern
                    division of the county, besides supplying its vicinity, is sent to London from
                    the ports of Ipswich and Woodbridge. The cultivation is commonly conducted on
                    the Norfolk system of turnips, barley, clover, and wheat; and the husbandry
                    being well executed, the crops are generally very good. The beans are peculiarly
                    productive. Turnips, and in some districts carrots, are extensively cultivated.
                    Hemp is grown in the garden of almost every peasant, and spun into linen for
                    their domestic uses. Some few hops are grown in the vicinity of Stow-market.</p>
                <p>They have an excellent breed of draught-horses, well known by the name of Suffolk
                    punches. The cows have been long celebrated for the abundance of their milk,
                    which, in proportion to their size and the quantity of food they consume,
                    exceeds the produce of any other race in the kingdom. They are all without
                    horns. The sheep, of which large flocks are kept, are mostly of the Norfolk
                    breed; but of late years they have been changed for those of the South
                    Downs.</p>
                <p>There are few manufactures in this county, though it was the first in which the
                    Flemings introduced the clothing trade. Before the extension of machinery in the
                    northern counties, the females found constant winter employment in spinning
                    worsted, but that has ceased. A small portion of the manufacture of mixed silk
                    and worsted stuffs is retained, in which 269 males above twenty years of age are
                    employed at Sudbury, forty-two are so employed at Glemsford, and a few at
                    Lavenham and at Hadleigh. At Brandon no less that sixty men are employed in
                    making gun-flints. There is some coarse linen made from hemp at Haverhill, and a
                    little bone-lace at Eye.</p>
                <p>The branch of industry which, next to agriculture, gives employment to the
                    greatest number of inhabitants, is the fishery. Many vessels are equipped at
                    Lowestoffe and Southwold to take herrings, which are cured in houses
                    appropriated for that purpose in these towns. The taking of mackerel is
                    beneficial before the season when the shoals of herrings arrive on the coast.
                    There is little other commerce in the county than that which arises from the
                    transmission of the agricultural products to the metropolis.</p>
                <p>The navigable rivers are the Sark, which passes by Thetford, and runs to the
                    Ouse; the Deben, of short course, which runs by Woodbridge to the sea; the
                    Orwell, a beautiful river, navigable to Ipswich; and the Blythe, navigable to
                    Framlingham. To these may be added the Wave-nay, which forms the northern
                    boundary of the county; and the Stour, which is its southern. The only navigable
                    canal is one between Ipswich and Stowmarket; but the river Yare having been
                    rendered navigable to Norwich, has a canal at its mouth at Lowestoffe in this
                    county: the admission is by gates, which exhibit one of the most complete
                    specimens of hydraulic architecture in the kingdom.<pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:chi.28490924&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=936" xml:id="kp-eb0720-0936-0790"/>
                    The landed property of the county is much divided. There are scarcely any
                    estates so large as to create a decided political preponderance, and there is a
                    larger number of proprietors occupying their own lands, of a value of from L.100
                    to L.400 per annum, than in any other county. Except in the heavy clay
                    districts, the farms are generally large; and the tenants being possessed of
                    ample capitals, the agricultural business is admirably conducted. There are
                    neither mines nor mineral springs in this county. In the summer season
                    sea-bathing attracts a considerable portion of company to the shore at
                    Lowestoffe, Southwold, and some other spots, where every accommodation for such
                    parties is provided.</p>
                <p>Among the antiquities stand first the remains of the ancient Roman castle at
                    Burgh, on the banks of the Yare. It is said to have been the ancient Garianonum,
                    erected by Publius Ostorius Scapula, in the reign of the emperor Claudius. The
                    walls, which are still standing, enclose a space 612 feet in length and 320 in
                    breadth; they are fourteen feet in height and nine in thickness. The whole
                    ground plan, including the wall, is more than five acres, and is capable of
                    containing a cohort and a half; having been built to keep in subjection the
                    Sceni, a people inhabiting Suffolk, Norfolk, Huntingdonshire, and
                    Cambridgeshire. The most remarkable of the Saxon antiquities are the monastery
                    at Bury St Edmund’s, that of Framlingham, and several ancient churches.</p>
                <p>The following peers derive their titles from places in this county: Marquis
                    Cornwallis; Earls of Suffolk, Orford, Euston, and Stradbrooke; and Barons
                    Rendlesham and Worlingham. The county has been formed into two divisions, the
                    eastern and western, for the purpose of electing members to parliament, each
                    division returning two. The elections for the eastern part arc held at Ipswich;
                    and the other polling places are Needham, Woodbridge, Framlingham, Saxmundham,
                    Beccles, and Halesworth. The elections for the western part are held at Bury St
                    Edmund’s; and the other polling places are Wickham Brook, Lavenharn, Stowmarket,
                    Botesdale, Mildenhall, and Hadleigh. By the reform act the boroughs of Dunwich,
                    Alborough, and Orford, which had each returned two members, have been
                    disfranchised; and Eye, which likewise returned two, now returns only one.
                    Ipswich, Bury St Edmund’s, and Sudbury return two members as before.</p>
                <p>The most remarkable seats among a very great number belonging to noblemen and
                    gentlemen in this county are, Euston Hall, Duke of Grafton; Broom Hall, Sir E.
                    Kerrison; Ickworth, Marquis of Bristol; Henham, Lord Stradbrooke; Worlingham
                    Hall, Lord Gosfordl; Boston Hall, Sir H. E. Banbury; Rendlesham, Lord
                    Rendlesham; Benacre, Sir Thomas Gooch; Haveningham Hall, Lord Huntingfield;
                    Sotterly Park, Miles Barm, Esq.; Flinton Hall, Alexander Adair, Esq.; Redgrove
                    Hall, Admiral Wilson; Woolverston Park, Charles Berners, Esq.; Long Melford, Sir
                    Hyde Parker; Shrubland Park, Sir William Middleton; and Tendring Hall, Sir
                    Joseph Rowley.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Kirby’s
