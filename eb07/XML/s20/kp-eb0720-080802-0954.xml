                <p><label type="entry">SUMBAWA</label>, a large island in the Eastern Seas, about
                    180 miles in length by forty in average breadth. It is situated between the
                    eighth and ninth degrees of south latitude, and is separated from Lombhook by
                    the Straits of Allass. It is almost divided into two equal parts by a deep bay,
                    which indents it in the middle. This island is divided into the different states
                    of Beema, Dompoo, Tambora, San-gur, Pekat, and Sumbawa, all governed by their
                    respective chiefs, who were formerly either allies or under the protection of
                    the Dutch East India Company, and were all sufficiently obedient, with the
                    exception of the chief of Sumbawa, who rebelled. Near the north-east end of the
                    island, on a fine bay which stretches seven or eight leagues south, is situated
                    the town of Beema, remarkable for its excellent harbour, the sides of which are
                    bold and high, and the approach safe; but the passage through is sometimes
                    dangerous, from the strong current which generally prevails, and the great depth
                    of water, as 100 fathoms of line, though close in shore, will hardly reach the
                    bottom. The channel in some places is only 150 or 200 yards across; but the
                    depth is so great that a ship of the line may sail on either side within thirty
                    yards of the rocky mountains. These give a grand and picturesque appearance to
                    the channel, which terminates in a safe and commodious basin, presenting one of
                    the finest harbours in the world. On the east side of the bay stands the town of
                    Beema, which comprehends under its jurisdiction the Straits of Sapy, the whole
                    of Manzeray, and the island of Gonong Api. The island produces sappan wood,
                    rice, horses, saltpetre, sulphur, wax, birds’ nests, tobacco, &amp;c., though
                    there is but little trade carried on at this place. The number of horses
                    exported under the appellation of Beema horses is very considerable. There are
                    two volcanic mountains in the island, Gonong Api and another, which are looked
                    upon with superstitious veneration by the inhabitants. Gold-dust is found in
                    Sumbawa, particularly in the district of Dompoo, which also supplies
                    teak-timber. Pearls are fished for in the large bay to the westward of Beema
                    Bay, as also at Pekat.</p>
