                <p><label type="entry">SEGOVIA</label>, one of the four provinces into which Old
                    Castille, in Spain, is divided. It is generally an open and arid district, with
                    scanty water, and little to merit description, except its capital, and the royal
                    residences of Ildefonso and the Escurial, each of which is described under its
                    appropriate article. The extent of the province is 290 square leagues, and its
                    population amounts to 221,379 souls. The greater part of the province is
                    destined to feed merino flocks, and the largest portion, particularly those with
                    the finest wool, are shorn within it, as the weather is sufficiently warm to
                    enable the sheep to bear that operation without feeling any inconvenience.
                    Though it grows wine, oil, and corn, the harvests are by no means adequate to
                    the consumption, and their wants must be supplied from other lands than their
                    own. It is watered by the Ebro, the Cresma, the Xarama, and the Duraton; and it
                    possesses mineral springs at Cinchon, Caballar, and Bartariejo. It belongs to
                    the captain-generalship of Zamora.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Segovia,</hi> a city of Spain, and capital of the province
                    of the same name, in Old Castille. It is situated on the right bank of the river
                    Duero, not far from its source, and near to the ruins of the ancient Roman city
                    of Numantia. Around it are most excellent pastures for sheep, and the wool of
                    the best of the merinos takes its name from this city. The usual quantity of
                    fine wool annually sent from this city is about 2,250,000 lbs., and the
                    management of such extensive concerns necessarily creates considerable trade.
                    There is in this city a manufactory of fine cloths, cassimeres, and other
                    articles composed of the native wool, which is carried on by the government.</p>
                <p>The remains of antiquity in this city are, however, the most interesting
                    attractions to all travellers. The aqueduct, of very ancient construction, is
                    yet in perfect preservation, and still conveys the water to the city. It is
                    carried over one of the suburbs or arches, some of which are a hundred and four
                    feet in height; the arches are in double rows, one above the other, and on the
                    uppermost a channel is made, covered with large flag-stones, through which the
                    water runs. It is a wonderful relic of antiquity, on account of the excellence
                    of the masonry, which has withstood the ravages of time for so many centuries.
                    The period of its erection is doubtful. The Spaniards, who delight in tracing
                    every ancient monument to the highest antiquity, ascribe it to Hercules; it is,
                    however, evidently of Roman construction, and none give it a later date than the
                    reign of Trajan. It discovers as yet no marks of decay, and as the city to which
                    it conveys water is on the top of a rock, if it were demolished the inhabitants
                    would be greatly distressed for that necessary of life.</p>
                <p>The ancient castle, or alcazar, is another of the curiosities of Segovia. It
                    stands on a rude mass of rocks overlooking the surrounding country, whose base
                    is washed by<pb break="no" facs="ht:chi.28490924&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=91"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0720-0091-0077"/> a rapid and limpid stream, whilst the houses of
                    the city stretch themselves from it in both directions, and terminate in woody
                    declivities. It is an astonishing pile of building, and contains some apartments
                    of stupendous extent. The foundation and the lower part of the walls are
                    obviously of Roman origin, whilst the upper part, and what may be called the
                    keep, are as plainly the execution of the Moors, whose contrivances for shooting
                    their arrows at the heads of assailants, without being themselves subject to
                    annoyance, are in the most perfect preservation. Within this castle is a
                    state-prison, which is well described by Le Sage in his Adventures of Gil Bias.
                    A part of the building is used by the artillery department of government. The
                    mint is below the castle, and furnished with all the machinery requisite for
                    coining money, which is principally set in motion by water.</p>
                <p>The cathedral of Segovia is one of the most complete specimens of the later
                    Gothic style of architecture of any religious edifice in Spain. Excepting the
                    antiquities of this celebrated city, the rest deserves little notice. The
                    streets are crooked and narrow. Many of the houses are of wood, and most of them
                    very dirty; and in spite of the great trade carried on in wool by some
                    individuals, an air of poverty pervades the mass of the inhabitants.</p>
