                    rend="smallcaps">Steam-engine</hi> in the third edition of the present work were
                    originally written by <hi rend="smallcaps">Dr Robison,</hi> and were long the
                    standards of reference upon these subjects. The rapid progress of science and
                    <hi rend="italic">of</hi> the mechanical arts during the present century, has
                    now rendered it necessary to substitute for these articles those maturer results
                    of recent research, to the attainment of which the original papers were
                    themselves the means of very materially conducing. The value of these original
                    researches was further enhanced by passing through the hands of the man of all
                    others the most capable of appreciating their value, and the best qualified to
                    increase it by his contributions. It was the early friend and companion of
                    Professor Robison, Mr <hi rend="smallcaps">Watt</hi> himself, who, towards the
                    close of his life, and notwithstanding the laborious nature of the undertaking,
                    agreed to revise those articles for republication, so as to present them to the
                    public with somewhat of that greater completeness which it is to be presumed
                    their author would himself have conferred upon them, had he lived to see the
                    investigations which he had begun, carried forward and completed. Mr Watt was,
                    however, prevented by the weakness of increasing years from doing more than
                    adding notes to these articles, and they were accordingly printed in that form;
                    but they contain a most interesting chapter of the history of inventive genius,
                    for they give us, in Watt’s own words, the history of the progress and
                    consummation of his own noble inventions, and display the efforts of genius
                    working its way through the obscurities of imperfect knowledge to the discovery
                    of pure truth and the achievement of the most exquisite combinations.</p>
                <p>While, therefore, it was impossible to retain the articles themselves, it was
                    highly desirable that all that had rendered them valuable should be retained,
                    and more especially such portions as serve to record the state of the mechanics
                    and physics of steam at that time, and the pro gress of the invention; and
                    these, together with the notes of Mr Watt, it has been thought better to give in
                    the precise words of the original, than to transpose them into language which
                    could neither be more clear nor more appropriate than that with which their
                    authors had invested them. Such portions of the articIes on steam and the
                    steam-engine, as have been in this manner retained, are distinguished by an
                    appropriate mark. Paragraphs from the pen of Dr Robison have a star * placed at
                    their commencement; those of Mr Watt, in like manner, have a cross. To all that
                    was interesting and valuable in the original articles, an attempt has been made
                    to superadd whatever subsequent labour and research may have brought to light.

                        PHENOMENA AND APPLICATIONS OF STEAM.</head>
                    <p>1. * <hi rend="smallcaps">Steam</hi> is the name given in our language to the
                        visible, moist vapour which arises from all bodies which contain juices
                        easily expelled from them by heats not sufficient for their combustion. Thus
                        we say, the steam of boiling water, of malt, of a tan-bed. It is
                        distinguished from smoke by its not having been produced by combus tion, by
                        not containing any soot, and by its being condensible by cold into water,
                        oil, inflammabIe spirits, or liquids composed of these.</p>
                    <p>2. * We see it rise in great abundance from bodies when they are heated,
                        forming a white cloud, which diffuses itself and disappears at no very great
                        distance from the body from which it was produced. In this case the
                        surrouuding air is found loaded with the water or moisture which seems to
                        have produced it, and the steam seems to be completely soluble in air,
                        composing, while thus united, a transparent elastic fluid.</p>
                    <p>3. * But, in order to its appearance in the form of an <hi rend="italic"
                        >opaque white</hi> cloud, the mixture with or dissemination in air seems
                        necessary. If a teakettle boils violently, so that the steam is formed at
                        the spout in great abundance, it may be observed, that the visible cloud is
                        not formed at the very mouth of the spout, but at a small distance before
                        it, and that the vapour is perfectly invisible at its first emission. This
                        is rendered still more evident by fitting to the spout of the teakettle a
                        glass pipe of any length, and of as large a diameter as we please. The steam
                        is produced as copiously as without this pipe, but the vapour is transparent
                        and colourless throughout the whole of the pipe. Nay, if this pipe
                        communicate with a glass vessel terminating in another pipe, and if the
                        vessel be kept sufficiently hot, the steam will be as abundantly produced at
                        the mouth of this second pipe as before, and the vessel will remain quite
                        transparent. The visibility, therefore, of the matter which constitutes the
                        steam is an accidental circumstance, and appears to require its
                        dissemination in the air; and we know that one perfectly transparent body,
                        when minutely divided and diffused among the parts of another transparent
                        body, but not dissolved in it, makes a mass which is visible. Thus oil
                        beaten up with water makes a <hi rend="italic">white opaque</hi> mass.</p>
                    <p>4. If the column of steam which ascends from a boiler that is suddenly
                        opened, be observed in a clear dry day, when the sun is shining, the column
                        of vapour, gradually widening as it rises, will be observed to be of a very
                        brilliant silvery white, and will cast a strong dark shadow upon the objects
                        which it intercepts from the direct rays of the sun: but, if the observer be
                        placed in this shadow, the sun will appear to him to be of a strong tawny,
                        or fiery red colour, or, if the column be very dense, the sun will be
                        invisible. These appearances closely resemble some phenomena of the clouds,
                        which we know are corn posed of watery vapour, and which sometimes appear of
                        a fleecy white, again of a fiery red or a burnished gold colour, or again of
                        a dappled grey, down through every degree of darkness, until the vapour
                        become so dense and opaque as altogether to obscure the light of the sun by
                        a thick black cloud. These appearances have been satisfactorily accounted
                        for. Steam, in its attenuated state, is a transparent, invisible, colourless
                        gas. When disseminated through the air, in excessive quantities, small
                        globules are formed, of a film of water, enclosing light vapour. These
                        globules, floating thickly in the air, form an aggregation of minute films
                        of fluid, capable of reflecting and transmitting light. When we are so
                        placed that the light may be reflected to us, and when the cloud is so thick
                        as to reflect it completely, we have the same brilliant white which results
                        from the comminution of glass, rosin, ice, and other transparent media; and,
                        nt the same time, an observer, placed on the opposite side of the cloud,
                        sees it as a dense black opaque mass, because the light being totally<pb
                        break="no" facs="ht:chi.28490924&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=651"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0720-0651-0571"/> reflected, none of it can be transmitted to
                        him. The richer colours transmitted by thinner strata of vapour are thus
                        noticed by M Leopold Nobili of Reggio. “The tints exhibited by the clouds in
                        every variety of aspect are al most all comprised in Sir Isaac Newton’s
                        first ring (the white, yellow, orange, red; or the blood, tawny, copper,
                        ochre, and fire red, and vialaceous red, or No. 1—12 of Mr Nobili’s scale).
                        Tints of this kind do not arise from refraction and diffraction, they are
                        produced only <hi rend="italic">by means of thin plates.</hi> Now the
                        measurements of Sir Isaac New ton have shown what are the dimensions of the
                        layers of air, of water, and of glass, which produce the colours of the
                        several rings; and, as we know that the vesicular vapours are formed of
                        water, and that they do not reflect or transmit any other tint, we may
                        conclude that their external film is in no case thicker than ten millionth
                        parts of an inch. This result appears to me to be so decidedly certain as to
                        be entitled to a place in science.” It was to the effect of thin plates on
                        light that Newton referred the colours of all bodies; and the accounting for
                        the rich golden hues of the clouds, and the fiery red colour of light
                        passing through dispersed steam, by the effect of the thin plates of water
                        enclosing the vapoury spheroids of pure steam, must be regarded as one of
                        the most satisfactory applications of his theory. (See article <hi
                        rend="smallcaps">Optics</hi>.)</p>
                    <p>5. A very singular phenomenon takes place, if the flame of a candle or lamp
                        be held below a jet of steam, as it issues from the mouth of a small pipe;
                        the steam instantly ceases to be visible. In this case, one of two changes
                        may be conceived to take place, either or both of which account for the
                        permanent invisibility of the vapour: the intense heat of the flame may
                        disperse the particles to such a distance, that there does not remain in a
                        given space a sufficient number to form a vesicle of vapour, and it
                        therefore remains diffused in combination with the air, which always holds a
                        large quantity of invisible vapour, especially at high temperatures; or the
                        vapour may be decomposed by the flame into the permanent and invisible
                        gnses, of which it consists, which may again become combined, to a certain
                        extent, with the burning substance, and support the flame.</p>
                    <p>6. *When steam is produced, the water gradually wastes in the teakettle, and
                        will soon be totally expended if we continue it on the fire. It is
                        reasonable, therefore, to suppose that this steam is nothing but water,
                        changed by heat into an aerial or elastic form. If so, we should expect that
                        the privation of this heat would leave it in the form of water again.
                        Accordingly, this is fully verified by experiment; for, if the pipe fitted
                        to the teakettle be surrounded with ice, or any cold substance, no steam
                        will issue, but water will continually trickle from it in drops: and if the
                        process be conducted with the proper precautions, the water which we thus
                        obtain from the pipe will be found equal in quantity to that which
                        disappears from the teakettle. Steam is therefore the matter of water,
                        converted by heat into an elastic vapour.</p>
                    <p>7. Steam, water, and ice, are three conditions of the same substance, which
                        it assumes under different circum stances of heat and of external pressure.
                        In each condition it obeys different laws; as a solid, ice obeys the laws of
                        the mechanics of solid bodies: in Russia it is quarried Iike rock, and is
                        used for building houses and paving ways; it is cast into moulds for
                        domestic purposes, like iron or lead; it is painted like alabaster, and
                        chiselled like marble: as a liquid, water is the exemplar of the
                        hydrostatical laws of all fluids: as a vapour, it obeys the laws of
                        aerostatics; and we now know that steam is, in all respects, similar in its
                        constitution and phenomena to all other elastic fluids or gases. If we apply
                        heat to a bar of extremely cold ice, it expands like other solids with heat,
                        gradually elongating with its increased temperature, its particles receding
                        from one another by the repulsive action induced between the particles by
                        the entrance of caloric between them, the cohesion of the particles becoming
                        less and less, until at last, if the heat be continually thrown in, the
                        cohesion of the particles is altogether overcome, they lose their
                        aggregation, they become separable without effort, and, falling to pieces,
                        the bar of ice loses its form and subsides into water. When thus melted, the
                        water being placed in a vessel, and having heat applied to it, will, like
                        other fluids, continue to expand from its point of greatest den sity, and
                        will increase in bulk nearly one-twentieth by about 172°, but at last the
                        entrance of so large a quantity of heat will produce a repulsive force
                        between the particles so strong as to cause them suddenly to spring apart
                        from one another, so as to recede to a distance twelve times as far asunder
                        as in the state of water, and they have now assumed the aerial condition of
                        gas or vapour, and constituting steam, occupy 1728 times their original
                        space. The ice passing into the condition of water, is said to be <hi
                        rend="italic">liquefied,</hi> and the heat necessary to convert ice into
                        water is called the <hi rend="italic">caloric of liquidity of ice,</hi> or
                        the <hi rend="italic">caloric of condition of water;</hi> when water is con
                        verted into steam, the quantity of caloric necessary for this purpose is
                        called the <hi rend="italic">caloric of vaporization of water,</hi> or the
                        <hi rend="italic">caloric of elasticity of steam,</hi> and the water is then
                        said to <hi rend="italic">boil</hi> or <hi rend="italic">evaporate.</hi>
                        This process may be reversed. If the steam have been collected in a close
                        receptacle, it may be squeezed by external compression into its original
                        bulk, or by cooling the outside so as to withdraw the caloric of elasticity
                        from between the particles, they may be allowed to come together by the at
                        traction of cohesion, and resuming their original proximity to each other,
                        appear once more in their former condition of water, and in this case the
                        <hi rend="italic">vapour</hi> is said to be <hi rend="italic"
                        >condensed;</hi> and if the process of abstraction of caloric, with

                        other, will gradually contract the bulk of the mass, and at a certain point
                        will take again the original character of ice, and the <hi rend="italic"

                        play many parts.”</p>
                    <p>Ice melts and becomes water by increment of heat. Water evaporates into steam
                        by increment of heat. Steam is condensed into water by decrement of heat.
                        Water congeals into ice by decrement of heat.</p>
                    <p>(8.) These phenomena are not confined to one substance: many substances,
                        apparently the most refractory, have been melted and again congealed, while
                        other sub stances which had never been observed in any other form than that
                        of transparent air or invisible gas, have been condensed by the expedients
                        of modern artifice into liquids heavier than water, and have even been
                        congealed into hard and strong solids. To so great an extent has this taken
                        place, that we are now almost warranted in deducing, from a wide induction
                        of facts, the following generalization; that all bodies assume the solid,
                        liquid, or gaseous condition, according to the accidents of temperature and
                        pressure under which they happen to be placed; and that it is merely from
                        the circumstance of their being more ordinarily found, at the present
                        temperature of the earth and under the weight of our present atmosphere, in
                        one of these states rather than another, that some substances have been
                        characterised and distinguished, and classed as permanent solids, liquids,
                        or airs. We now speak of ice only as frozen water; but had we lived under a
                        temperature such as that which the inhabitants of the planet Jupiter, at
                        their distance from the sun, may be conceived to endure, we should have
                        spoken of swallowing <hi rend="italic">melted ice</hi> as we now speak of
                        molten lead, and a separate name for melted ice would have remained unknown;
                        or, if we conceive, in like manner, our air to be withdrawn, and the<pb

                        we should then have moved under an atmosphere of steam of the same pressure
                        as at present, transparent and colourless, and might only have heard of
                        water as a curious substance obtained from the compression of the air. The
                        phenomena of steam are much simplified and more perfectly explained when we
                        take this enlarged view of its analogy with other kinds of matter.</p>
                    <p>9. We are most familiar with steam when in the act of rising violently from
                        heated water in the process of <hi rend="italic">ebullition.</hi> The
                        history of steam at this crisis is highly instructive, and its phenomena may
                        be studied with advantage by examining it in a glass vessel placed over a
                        strong lamp. When heat is first applied, a rapid circulation of the fluid
                        ensues. The water on the bottom, being first heated and expanded, becoming
                        lighter than the rest, rises to the top, and is replaced by the current of
                        colder water descending to receive in its turn a further accession of heat.
                        By and by, small globules of steam, formed on the bottom and surrounded by a
                        film of water, are observed adhering to the glass; as the heat increases
                        they enlarge, in a short time several of them unite, form a bubble larger
                        than the others, and, detaching themselves from the glass, rise upwards in
                        the fluid. But they never reach the sur face; they encounter currents of
                        water still comparatively cold, and descending to receive from the bottom
                        their sup ply of heat; and encountering them, the bubbles are robbed of
                        their heat, shrivel up into their original bulk, and are lost among the
                        other particles of water. In a short time the mass of the water becomes more
                        uniformly heated, the bubbles, becoming larger and more frequent, are
                        condensed with a loud crackling noise, and at last, when the heat of the
                        whole mass reaches 212°, the bubbles from the bottom rise without
                        condensation through the water, swell and unite with others as they rise,
                        and burst out upon the air in a copious volume of steam, of the same heat as
                        the water from which they are formed, and pushing aside the air, make room
                        for themselves. In this process, by continuing the application of heat, the
                        whole of the water may be “boiled away” or converted into steam.</p>
                    <p>10. The singular sounds produced from a vessel of water exposed to heat,
                        previously to boiling, have attracted attention; the water is then vulgarly
                        said to be simmering or singing; and, when this takes place, it is because
                        the vessel is boiling at one place and comparatively cold at another. This
                        noise is most distinctly heard when the fire or flame applied is small, and
                        its heat in teuse, when the vessel is large and the water deep; for in that
                        case the entrance of the caloric will take place more rapidly than the
                        circulation can convey it to the remote particles of fluid, and so bubbles
                        of steam will form rapidly at one place and be rapidly condensed at another;
                        the degree of velocity with which such bubbles succeed will determine the
                        pitch of the singing tone. We have observed this phenomenon in greatest
                        perfection when we have attached a slender pipe to a close boiler producing
                        steam, and carried its open mouth, of the diameter of <hi rend="superscript"
                        > 1</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"> 8</hi> or <hi rend="superscript"> 3</hi> /
                        <hi rend="subscript"> 16</hi> of an inch, down below the surface of cold
                        water in a glass jar. When the mouth of the steam-pipe is held just below
                        the surface of the water, the steam issues with great rapidity in small
                        bubbles, producing an acute tone; and, on the other hand, when the pipe is
                        held at a considerable depth, the concussions become more violent and
                        louder, their intervals of succession greater, the tone is lowered, and
                        finally, the shocks become detached, and so violent as to shake the glass
                        and surrounding objects with much force. On this subject Professor Robison
                        observes, *that a violent and remarkable phenomenon ap pears, if we suddenly
                        plunge a lump of red-hot iron into a vessel of cold water, taking care that
                        no red part be near the surface. If the hand be now applied to the side of
                        the vessel, a most violent tremor is felt, and sometimes strong thumps;
                        these arise from the collapsing of very large bubbles. If the upper part of
                        the iron be too hot, it warms the surrounding water so much, that the
                        bubbles from below come up through it uncondensed, and produce ebullition
                        without concussion. The great resemblance of this tremor to the sensation
                        which we experience during the shock of an earthquake, has led many to
                        suppose that the latter is produced in the same way; and their hypothesis,
                        notwithstanding the objections which we have elsewhere stated to it, is by
                        no means unfeasible. Any obstruction on the bottom of a boiler, on the
                        inside, as a piece of metal or stone introduced among the water, may produce
                        a succession of smart concussions by the sudden condensation of gas
                        collected under it.</p>
                    <p>11. The permanence of the boiling point is one of the most remarkable of the
                        phenomena of ebullition. When water has once been brought to boil in an open
                        vessel, it is not possible to make the water sensibly hotter, however
                        strongly the fire may be urged or its intensity increased. This circumstance
                        is very striking, because we know that heat continues to be thrown in
                        exactly as fast as before the boiling point, and that in that case the heat
                        rose rapidly, whereas now it has altogether ceased to increase. If a
                        thermometer of mercury, air, oil, or metal be placed among the water, the
                        temperature will constantly increase, and expand the matter of the
                        thermometer, until the water boils, and then, whether it boil slowly or
                        rapidly, with a strong fire or a gentle one, the thermometer will continue
                        to stand at the same point. This point is so well defined, as to furnish our
                        standard for the comparison of temperatures, and is the same on all
                        thermometers, being called <hi rend="italic">the boiling point,</hi>
                        although it is differently numbered on each, being called 212° on our common
                        thermometer or Fahrenheit’s, 80° on Reaumur’s, and 100° on the centigrade
                        thermometer.</p>
                    <p>It is also to be remarked, that the temperature of the steam issuing from
                        boiling water is the same with the temperature of the water itself, and
                        remains equally invariable; so that all the steam produced from water
                        boiling at 212° is itself at 212°. This remark will assist us in accounting
                        for the disposal of the heat which the fire gives out during the time of
                        ebullition; for it is manifest that the heat is all the while carried off by
                        the large volumes of steam, nt a temperature of 212°, that are diffused
                        through the air; and so it happens that an increase of heat in the fire,
                        instead of increasing the heat of the water, only increases the volumes of
                        the steam thrown off, and the quantity of heat carried away. This view of
                        the subject is confirmed by a simple experiment. Take a strong glass flask,
                        place water in it and a thermometer among the water, and let it be held over
                        a lamp until the water boil, and the thermometer will be observed rising
                        till it reach 212°, when the steam will begin to escape rapidly from the
                        neck of the flask. Let it now be corked tightly, and the heat continually
                        applied; and it will be observed that the thermo meter does not now stand at
                        212°, but rises rapidly from that point up to 220° and 230°, showing that
                        the free escape of the steam into the open air is necessary to the
                        permanence of the boiling point. If the heat be still applied, the
                        experiment may be rendered still more instructive, by suddenly pulling out
                        the cork of the flask, when the vapour will instantly rush out in a large
                        volume, and the thermometer sink down to 212°, showing that all the excess
                        of heat has been carried off by the steam into the air.</p>
                    <p>12. Wo have thus seen that a large quantity of heat may be given out to the
                        particles of a certain quantity of water, converting them into steam, and
                        yet that the thermometer shall afford no indication of this quantity. As
                        soon as water boils, the whole mass is heated up to 212°;<pb break="no"
                        facs="ht:chi.28490924&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=653" xml:id="kp-eb0720-0653-0573"
                        /> and although the same heat that produced the ebullition be still
                        continually applied, and although we know that this heat must be continually
                        entering into the water, still it is not detected, or in any way exhibited
                        by the thermo meter. On this account, the heat given to water during
                        ebullition is said to become <hi rend="italic">latent,</hi> or he hid from
                        the thermometer; and, indeed, the thermometer merely indicates the intensity
                        of heat, the calorimeter alone can measure its quantity. The quantity of
                        heat given out to water after it has begun to boil, is more than fivefold
                        that which is sufficient to bring it from the freezing up to the boiling
                        point; for, if we continue the fire with the same intensity that was used in
                        bringing it to boil, it will require more than fivefold that duration and
                        quantity of fuel to boil all the water away, or convert it all into steam of
                        212° of heat. Thus the sensible heat, added from 32°, will be 180°, and that
                        latent in the steam is more than fivefiold; or, in other words, the <hi
                        rend="italic">insensible caloric</hi> in steam is five fold its <hi
                        rend="italic">sensible</hi> heat; or the same quantity of matter in the
                        condition of steam at 212°, and of water at 212°, will hold different
                        quantities of caloric, in the proportion of about 6 to 1. This is called the
                        greater <hi rend="italic">capacity of steam for caloric</hi> than of water
                        for that substance; and it is in part accounted for, by the greater
                        distances of the particles of the matter of steam and water from each other
                        in the former than the latter condition; for when the distances of the
                        particles are increased 12 times, the spheres of caloric around each atom
                        may be much larger, without increased elasticity of the calorific fluid. Dr
                        Black was the discoverer of the admirable doctrine of <hi rend="italic"
                        >latent heat.</hi></p>
                    <p>13. Dr Dalton has thus illustrated the doctrine of latent heat, and of the
                        increased capacity of a liquid for holding caloric, when it passes into the
                        condition of vapour. The liquid and its vapour may be considered as two
                        reservoirs of caloric, capable of holding different quantities of that
                        fluid. Let figure 1. represent to us such an arrangement; the internal
                        cylinder of smaller capa city, the external one of enlarged capacity
                        surrounding and ex tending far above it, and a small open tube of glass,
                        communicating freely at the bottom with the inside of the cylinders. Let us
                        now conceive water to be poured into the internal cylinder, the water will
                        manifestly flow into the slender tube till it stand on the same level in the
                        tube as in the cylinder. If any additional quantity be now poured into the
                        internal cylinder, the rise of water in the slender glass tube will serve as
                        an index of the quantity of added fluid; and when it is filled to the top,
                        the fluid will stand at the height marked 212°, and will still be a correct
                        index of the addition of fluid. But if more water be now added to it, it
                        will not make its appearance in the slender tube, but will simply overflow
                        from the internal cylinder over into that of enlarged capacity, so that,
                        while a large quantity is passing into the vessel and gradually filling it
                        up to 212°, no additional rise takes place until the whole of the outer
                        cylinder become filled to that point, after which any further addition will
                        again become sensible, by a corresponding rise in the tube. This process is
                        in precise analogy to the succession of circumstances in heating a liquid,
                        and converting it into steam. The internal cylinder represents the liquid,
                        the external one the vapour of greater capacity, and the slender glass tube
                        at the side the thermometer placed in communication with them. When heat
                        flows into the liquid, it passes equally into the thermometer; and each
                        increment of the one produces an equal increment in the other, until the
                        liquid reaches the limit of its capacity, when it suddenly begins to enlarge
                        its bulk and take the form of steam; but the quantity of heat required to
                        fill up this enlarged capacity is so great as to require about 5½ times as
                        much to fill it as was contained in the whole liquid before, so that all
                        this time the thermometer is standing still, and it is not until the whole
                        of the steam is thus supplied with 212° of caloric, that the thermometer
                        will begin to show any further elevation; after which, any increment of heat
                        thrown into the steam will make its appearance on the thermometer, and
                        proceed as formerly, by simultaneous increments.</p>
                    <p>14. It appears, therefore, that the cause why water boiling under the open
                        air does not reach a higher temperature than 212°, is, that the steam which
                        is raised by any additional heat, carries that additional quantity of heat
                        along with it into the air. But here a question occurs at once to the
                        enquirer into these phenomena, viz. Why does water require to be heated up
                        to 212° before it will throw off its increments of heat and vapour into the
                        air? Why does not steam rise equally strongly from water at 200° or 180°?
                        The categorical reply is, that the elastic force of the heat is not
                        sufficient to enable the steam to force its way against the pressure of the
                        air until it reaches this point. In order to understand the means by which
                        we arrive at this conclusion, it is necessary to know that, when the
                        pressure of air on the surface of the water is artificially diminished, the
                        steam does actually rise, and the water bubbles and boils with great
                        violence, at temperatures far below 212°. It is only when the surface of the
                        water is exposed to the full <hi rend="italic">pressure of the air</hi> in a
                        common vessel that it is prevented from rising in vapour, at temperatures
                        Iower than the usual boiling point. If the surface of the hot water be
                        protected from the pressure of the air, by being placed under a glass shade,
                        and the air removed from the inside of it by an air-pump, the water may be
                        made to boil at all temperatures below 212°. The following table contains
                        the results of a series of experiments made, with great care, by Dr Dalton,
                        towards the end of last century, in order to ascertain how much of the whole
                        pressure of the air it was necessary to remove, in order to make water boil
                        at a given temperature. In order to understand the way in which this table
                        was formed, the reader must conceive a vessel of water first of all boiling
                        at 212° in the open air, as the vessel A in figure 2, the thermo meter I
                        being placed in it. After allowing the water to cool to 200°, let the vessel
                        of water and the immerged thermometer be now placed on theplate stand P of
                        an air-pump, and covered over with a strong glass receiver R; and let a
                        portion of the enclosed air he now withdrawn by the pump from the inside of
                        the receiver by the pipe F; and suppose that there are in all 30 cubical
                        inches, or other volumes, of air in the receiver at first, then the water
                        being at 200°, when about 7<pb break="no"
                        facs="ht:chi.28490924&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=654" xml:id="kp-eb0720-0654-0574"
                        /> out of the 30 parts of the air have been withdrawn, leaving only about 23
                        parts out of 30 pressing on the water, it will be observed instantly to
                        commence giving off steam in rapid ebullition. If next the process be
                        repeated, only allowing the water to cool to 190°, the ebullition will not
                        commence in this lower temperature till about 12 out of the 30 volumes of
                        air have been with drawn; and if, in a third experiment, the water be cooled
                        down to 180°, the elastic force communicated by this degree of heat will not
                        be capable of overcoming the resistance arising from the pressure of the
                        air, until one half of the original pressure of 30 has been removed. To this
                        pro cess there is no limit; for as we go on lowering the temperature, we can
                        always find a point at which the water will boil, provided the counteracting
                        pressure be suffi cient[y diminished. The following is Dr Dalton’s table,
                        containing the results of his experiments, as given in his <hi rend="italic"

                        water is lower than 212°. Now, the barometer informs us, that the pressure
                        of our atmosphere is not constantly the same; it has normal and abnormal
                        variations, it has horary, and menstrual, and annual varia tions. It
                        frequently stands at 30 inches, sometimes at 31 inches; and on the morning
                        of the 7th of January, 1839, it was observed at Edinburgh, by Sir John
                        Robison, to be as low as 27 inches and six-tenth parts. Now, on that
                        morning, water would have been found to boil in the open air at about 208°,
                        instead of 212; and for every depres sion of the barometer, there is a
                        corresponding depression of the boiling point. This variation of the boiling
                        temperature with the variation of the barometer, and of the corresponding
                        density of the air, is important: and the following short table shows the

                        is now equally well known, that the cause of this is the very limited height
                        to which air in a dense state covers the earth, the whole atmosphere being
                        equivalent to not more than 5 miles in depth of such air as we breathe; and
                        it is hence obvious, that after a vertical ascent of a mile to the top of a
                        mountain, there would be only about <hi rend="superscript"> 4</hi> / <hi
                        rend="subscript"> 5</hi> of the atmosphere remaining above the person on its
                        summit. One of the highest of the Andes has been ascended to such a height,
                        that there remained only <hi rend="superscript"> 13</hi> / <hi
                        rend="subscript"> 30</hi> of the whole atmosphere above the observer. Now,
                        in this case, the barometer, instead of being sustained at 30 inches, its
                        usual height, had fallen to 13 inches, because, according to the
                        constitution of the barometer (See Arts. BAROMETER and <hi rend="smallcaps"
                        >Pneumatics</hi>), the height of the column of mercury in it is proportional
                        to the quantity of air resting above it. Hence, a barometer being carried up
                        a mountain by an observer, falling as he ascends, enables him to ascertain
                        the height of his ascent. This he does with perfect precision, so as to
                        determine accurately the height of any point of the mountain to which he has
                        ascended, and where he has noticed the fall of the haro meter from the point
                        where it stood when at the bottom, by means of an allowance of nearly 100
                        feet of height for every tenth part of an inch that the barometer has
                        fallen, as explained more fully under the heads <hi rend="smallcaps"

                    <p>The steam of water may be rendered the means of determining the height of a
                        mountain, on the principle of diminished atmospheric pressure, so as to act
                        as a substitute for the barometer. We have just seen that water gives off
                        steam by ebullition, above or below the temperature 212°, according as the
                        pressure of the atmosphere is greater or less than the standard pressure
                        which sustains the barometer at 30 inches. And we have already given a table
                        (Arts. 14 and 15), showing how much the boiling point was raised or
                        depressed by diminishing the pressure of the atmosphere. On consulting Dr
                        Dalton’s table, we see that, when of the air were removed, water boiled at
                        so low a temperature as 180°. This, therefore, would show that, if water
                        boiled on the top of any mountain at 180°, the barometer would stand there
                        at a height of little more than 15 inches; and if nt the bottom of the moun
                        tain water boiled at 212°, showing the barometer to be then at 30 inches, a
                        similar allowance of height being made, viz. about 1000 feet for each inch,
                        or 15,000 feet, would be <hi rend="italic">a</hi> rude approximation to the
                        true height. The table at the end of the third section, and the rules under
                        the head BAROMETER in this work, will enable any one who studies this
                        subject to form rides for closer approximation; but the following table will
                        be of use to those who may merely wish to put it in practice.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic">Rule for finding heights by boiling water.</hi> —Boil pure

                        mountain, and observe with the thermometer the height at which it now boils:
                        the difference of temperature, multiplied by 530 feet, will give a close
                        approximation to the height of the upper above the lower station.</p>
                    <p>This will give an approximation; but, if greater ac curacy be required, it
                        will further be necessary to correct for the difference of the temperature
                        of the air at the two stations, in the following manner. Add the
                        temperatures of the air at the stations, and subtract 64 from their sum,
                        multiply the remainder by one-thousandth part of the height found; and this
                        will be the correction to be added to the height formerly found. The result
                        thus found will still require a slight correction for the figure of the
                        earth and latitude of the place; but this does not amount to more in our
                        latitude than an addition of about two feet in a thousand, which forms a
                        second correction. This method is, however, to be regarded only as an

                        render it equally perfect with observations by that instrument. In short,
                        this method may be considered as a telltale on the baro meter, showing where
                        the barometer would stand if placed in its position. Thus, if water boil at
                        200° on the top of a mountain, that is merely to be considered as indicating
                        that the barometer, if placed there, would stand at 22.8; after which, the
                        process of deducing the height remains the same. To illustrate the mode of
                        deducing heights from the boiling point, as we have given it, we take the

                    <p>This method, however, is seldom susceptible of so high a degree of accuracy,

                    <p>17. This method of determining heights by the ebullition of water is not a
                        recent invention. It was suggested originally by Mr Fahrenheit, in the 33d
                        volume of the <hi rend="italic">Philosophical Transactions,</hi> in a paper
                        entitled <hi rend="italic superscript"> "</hi><hi rend="italic">Barometri
                        Novi Descriptio."</hi> The subject was further matured by Cavallo, who has
                        written concerning it in the 71st volume of the same Transactions; and the
                        method has finally received from the Rev F. J. H. Wollaston the highest
                        degree of perfection of which it seems to bo capable. His paper, read before
                        the Royal Society on the 6th of March, 1817, and afterwards published in the
                        Philosophical Transactions of that year, gives an account of the very
                        beautiful and ingenious apparatus which he has contrived for facilitating
                        the procedure of taking the observations with the requisite precision. Fig.
                        4, is a view of the whole apparatus, consisting principally of a tripod
                        stand, surrounded by a sort of tent cover, which is quite essential for the
                        protection of the lamp from the strong winds generally encountered at
                        considerable altitudes. The lamp acts on a small tin vessel, which is a
                        cylinder 5½ inches deep and 1½ in diameter, the sides of which are double,
                        leaving an interstitial space of confined air to prevent cooling. Above this
                        vessel is a circular plate of metal G H K, to which the thermometer is to be
                        fixed; and the scale and neck of the thermometer are seen projecting above
                        the stand. A (fig. 3) represents the thermometer made use of, which it is
                        desirable to have of as strong and as compact a construction as possible,
                        while, at the same time, its degrees should range as extensively as
                        possible. These desiderata are attained in Ills construction. The bulb A,
                        one inch in diameter, is blown thick and strong, on the end of a tube about
                        of an inch in diameter: close above the bulb, is a cavity B, swelled out to
                        such a size as to contain whatever mercury will expand out of the bulb,
                        between 32 <hi rend="subscript"> o</hi> and the lowest temperature at which
                        the mercury is likely to boil at such altitudes as it will be used to
                        measure. It is this which renders the instrument compact; because, if it be
                        not taken out of the British islands, it will never, in all probability,
                        boil at less than 200*; and thus the whole length of the stalk is left for a
                        range of 12° or 15” of the thermometer. In the instrument figured, the scale
                        R is 5 inches long, <hi rend="superscript"> 9</hi> / <hi rend="subscript">
                        10</hi> of an inch wide, and a length 4∙15 inches is divided into 100 parts,
                        which, by a vernier reads off to 1000 parts, being 241 parts to an inch; so
                        that 1’ Fahr, corresponds to 233 parts on the scale, or to 530 feet. Each
                        part of the scale, as read by the vernier, will there fore correspond to
                        2∙275 feet, being about half the degree of minuteness of the mountain
                        barometer divided into thousandths, each of which is nearly equivalent to
                        one foot of height. The accuracy, however, of this scale is probably greater
                        than the degree of accuracy of which the method of observation is itself
                        capable.</p>
                    <p>Whether an observer have or have not the means of obtaining such an
                        instrument as this, it will be, in many cases, useful to travellers to be
                        provided with means, more or less accurate, of making observations of this
                        nature, on the summit of such mountains as they may have the opportunity of
                        visiting. For this purpose, the most convenient is a small cooking
                        apparatus, such as will supply the wants of a traveller; consisting of a
                        round tin stand, protecting a lamp, in which a small quantity of the
                        traveller’s supply of spirituous liquid may be burnt, so as to boil some of
                        the water of a small bottle, which he has also carried with him, or perhaps
                        a little melted snow. An umbrella or waterproof cloak will screen the whole
                        from the wind; and a thermometer should have been procured, with a stem as
                        minutely divided as possible, and should be insert ed, by means of a small
                        cork, in an aperture of the lid left on purpose. The quantity of the water
                        may be small, and it will serve a culinary purpose immediately after the
                        operation is completed. The thermometer should be inserted only among the
                        steam. The traveller must take great precautions for striking a light, as he
                        will find this much more troublesome in the cold rarified air of a mountain
                        summit than below.</p>
                    <p>18. Distillation is a method of separating a liquid from extraneous matter,
                        by first of all converting it into steam,<pb break="no"
                        facs="ht:chi.28490924&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=656" xml:id="kp-eb0720-0656-0576"
                        /> and then condensing that steam so as to form the liquid. Different
                        substances take the liquid form at various temperatures; and, therefore, the
                        heat may he so regulated that only one substance of a mixture shall take the
                        form of vapour, and being conveyed by a pipe through a vessel of cold water,
                        or otherwise exposed to the cooling process, the vapour being condensed will
                        give the pure liquid. A great improvement upon the process of separating
                        liquids has been successfully introduced by Mr. Howard. It consists of <hi
                        rend="italic">distillation or evaporation in vacuo,</hi> and has been most
                        usefully employed in the refining process of sugar. When sugar is dissolved
                        in water, it requires a much higher temperature than 212° to boil the
                        mixture, or to convert the water into steam and separate it from the solid;
                        and as the process goes on, and the solution comes to hold less and less
                        water, the requisite degree of heat is further augmented, until the
                        temperature he comes so high as to injure the colour and otherwise
                        deteriorate the article of merchandise in its crystallized state. Instead of
                        this increased temperature, Mr Howard places the syrup in vacuo, and thus
                        boils it at a low and innoxious heat. This he accomplishes by pumping out
                        the air and vaporized water from the close boiler, by means of a large
                        air-pump driven by machinery. The process has produced a great improvement
                        on this article of commerce, and has remunerated its inventor with an ample
                        fortune.</p>
                    <p>Distillation in vacuo is peculiarly adapted to obtaining those delicate
                        extracts and essential oils from vegetable substances, which are apt to
                        suffer deterioration from the usual high temperatures.</p>
                    <p>19. * The pulse glass, an invention attributed to Dr Franklin, is an
                        apparatus illustrating beautifully the process of ebullition in vacuo at low
                        temperatures. If two glass balls, A and B (fig. 5), be connected by a
                        slender tube, and one of them, A, be filled with water, a small opening or
                        pipe <hi rend="italic">b</hi> being left at the top of the other, and this
                        be made to boil, the vapour produced by it will drive all the air out of the
                        other, and will at last come out itself, producing steam at the mouth of the
                        pipe. When the ball B is observed to be occupied by transparent vapour, we
                        may conclude that the air is completely expelled. Now, shut the pipe by
                        sticking it into a piece of tallow or wax, the vapour in B will soon
                        condense, and there will be a vacuum. The flame of a lamp and blow-pipe
                        being directed to the little pipe <hi rend="italic">b,</hi> will immediately
                        cause it to close and seal her metically. We have now a pulse glass. Grasp
                        the ball A in the hollow of the hand; the heat of the hand will immediately
                        expand the bubble of vapour which may be in it, and this vapour will drive
                        the water into B, and then will blow up through it for a Iong while, keeping
                        it in a state of violent ebullition, as long as there remains a drop or film
                        of water in A. But care must be taken that B is all the while kept cold,
                        that it may condense the vapour as fast as it rises through the water.
                        Touching B with the hand, or breathing warm on it, will immediately stop the
                        ebullition. When the water in A has thus been dissipated, grasp B in the
                        hand; the water will be driven into A, and the ebullition will take place
                        there as it did in B. Putting one of the balls into the mouth will make the
                        ebullition more violent in the other, and the one in the mouth will feel
                        very cold. This is a pretty iliustration of the rapid absorption of the heat
                        by the particles of water which are thus converted into elastic vapour. We
                        have seen this little toy suspended by the middle of the tube like a
                        balance, and thus placed in the inside of a window, having two holes, <hi
                        rend="italic">a, b,</hi> cut in the pane, in such a situation, that, when A
                        is full of water and prepon derates, B is opposite to the hole <hi
                        rend="italic">b.</hi> Whenever the room became sufficiently warm, the vapour
                        was formed in A and immediately brought the water into B, which was kept
                        cool by the air coming into the room through the hole <hi rend="italic"
                        >b.</hi> By this means B was made to preponderate in its turn, and A was
                        then opposite to the hole <hi rend="italic">a</hi>, and the process was now
                        repeated in the opposite direction. This amusement continued as long as the
                        room was warm enough. Instead of water, alcohol or ether may be substituted,
                        and will act more readily.</p>
                    <p>20. The following experiment, where ebullition is produced by the application
                        of cold, is instructive. A Florence flask F, is about <hi rend="superscript"
                        > 1</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi> full of water, and is placed over a
                        lamp E until the water boils; and when the steam has been rising for a short
                        time violently from the neck of the vessel, the cork S is to be applied as a
                        stopper, and must fit with great accuracy. The flask thus closed is to be
                        set aside for a few minutes till it have cooled considerably, and is then to
                        be suddenly placed on a stand in the cold water W, contained in the glass
                        reservoir R. The ebullition in the flask will recommence with a degree of
                        violence proportioned to the cold ness of the water W.</p>
                    <p>The theory of this action is simple. When the flask is plunged in the cold
                        water, <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi> of its
                        contents are steam: the chill water condenses it into water, it shrinks up
                        into 11728th part of its bulk, and would leave 1727 parts out of 1728
                        vacuous; but the warm water being now in vacuo, throws up in rapid
                        ebullition (according to Art. 14) copious volumes of vapour of its own
                        temperature, which is again, by coming into contact with the sides of the
                        vessel, and by directly giving off its heat to the water, chilled into
                        water, and so in succession all the vapour thus sent up is in turn
                        reconverted into water, and the vacuum sustained, until at last, the
                        equilibrium between the temperature of the water, within and around the
                        flask, having been established, the interchange of caloric ceases; and even
                        now, if the flask were plunged into freezing water, the ebullition would
                        recommence as violently as before.</p>
                    <p>21. We have already noticed (Art. 11.) the fact that, when water is confined
                        in a close vessel, and heat is applied to it, the water will not boil even
                        at a temperature of 212°. If heat be continually thrown into the water in
                        this state, the particles will acquire a very high temperature; and, at the
                        same time, the tendency of the enclosed fluid to burst the vessel will
                        become very great. The following experiment upon this subject is one of the
                        most interesting and the earliest of which we are in possession. It was
                        published in 1663 by the Marquis of Worcester, and we give it in his own
                        words. “I have taken a piece of a whole cannon, whereof the end was burst,
                        and filled it three quarters full, stopping and screwing up the broken end,
                        as also the touch-hole, and making a constant fire under it; within
                        twenty-four hours it burst, and made a great crack.”</p>
                    <p>It is in virtue of the great elastic force by which water, when heated, tends
                        to expand into 1728 times its bulk, in the form of steam, that this element
                        has become a mechanical mover, subject to the control of man. There are two
                        great principles upon which such machines are con<pb break="no"

                        /> structed; the one commonly called high-pressure steam engines, and the
                        other low-pressure steam-engines.</p>
                    <p>In a high-pressure steam-engine, the principal source of motion is the <hi
                        rend="italic">elastic force</hi> of steam, formed by water, raised to a high
                        temperature in confined vessels, and tending to escape from them with such
                        force, as to im part motion and movement to solids or fluids, ingeniously
                        arranged to receive from it velocity or direction required for the
                        accomplishment of some end.</p>
                    <p>In a low-pressure steam-engine, the principal source of power is derived from
                        using steam merely for the purpose of forming a vacuum. For this purpose
                        steam is admirably calculated. It is only necessary to allow the steam of a
                        liquid to enter any vessel filled with air; and if there be left an aperture
                        of escape, the steam, entering in abun dance, will push the air out before
                        it. When the air has wholly escaped, it only remains necessary to close all
                        the openings of the vessel, and allow it gradually to cool down, when the
                        steam will be condensed, will shrivel up in the form of water into the
                        1728th part of its bulk, leaving the other 1727 parts vacuous. The
                        mechanical force of a vacuum on the earth’s surface is well known: it will
                        raise water to a height of more than 30 feet, and support 1.5 lbs. on every
                        square inch of surface exposed to it. What ever, therefore, the formation of
                        a vacuum on the earth’s surface can effect, of that is the force of steam
                        capable at low pressure, scarcely exceeding the temperature of 212°. Hence
                        the low-pressure engine is sometimes called the condensing engine, because
                        it acts principally by condensation of steam to form a vacuum. The high
                        pressure of steam, and its vacuumforming power, are frequently used in
                        combination.</p>
                    <p>22. There are other properties of steam, besides its mechanical force, that
                        render its use of great practical value. Its great capacity for heat enables
                        it to take up, at one time, and in one place, a large quantity of heat,
                        which it may be employed as a vehicle to transfer, at a subsequent period
                        and at a distant point, to some other substance. It is thus rendered an
                        economizer and distributer, a reservoir of heat derived from the combustion
                        of fuel. In this view it has great value as an agent in distributing the
                        heat used for warming buildings, heating baths, evaporating solutions,
                        distilling, brewing, drying, dyeing, and even for domestic cookery, and the
                        means of extracting wholesome and nutritious food from most un promising and
                        unpalateable materials.</p>
                    <p>In order, however, to its successful application as a mechanical power, and
                        its profitable use in each of the various functions which it is capable of
                        performing, it is necessary to study its various phenomena in greater de
                        tail; to obtain an intimate acquaintance with its proper ties; to determine
                        its laws in the various relations of space, time, and quantity; how much
                        heat it requires, what fuel it consumes, what force it exerts, how fast it
                        will move, how it will condense, expand, and contract, and what relation it
                        bears to the different fluids from which it may be derived. Each of these
                        enquiries, and the manner in which each of these objects may be most
                        satisfactorily attained, is the subject of one or other of the following

                    <p>23. The earliest researches we have met with into the phenomena of steam,
                        under taken with the philosophical purpose of obtaining experimental data
                        for the scientific investigation of its properties and relations, are to be
                        met with in a scarce work, printed at Basle in 1769, and entitled, <hi

                        experimentorum novorum circa fuidorum a calore rarefactionem et vapoream

                        HenricoZiegler.”</hi> His experimental boiler consisted of a copper vessel
                        (fig. 7) AA, silvered internally, and belted externally with massive iron
                        hoops BB. A strong framework of iron, attached to the upper hoop, gives
                        support to the circular cover B, (fig. 8,) in which there are an opening P
                        for admitting water, an other D into which an elaterometer is inserted,
                        consisting of a bottle G, containing mercury, and a glass tube c c cased in
                        iron, open at both ends, and immersed in the mercury at the bottom; the
                        third or central aperture E being occupied by a copper tube F, closed below,
                        and containing oil or other viscid liquid, to act as a bath for the bulb of
                        the thermometer F and its protector from the pressure of the vapour. The
                        method of using this apparatus was as follows. The digester being partly
                        filled with water, closed and placed on the fire, the generation of the
                        steam would raise the oil or mercury in the bath <pb break="no"
                        facs="ht:chi.28490924&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=658" xml:id="kp-eb0720-0658-0578"
                        />(E) to the temperature of the water and steam within, so as to give to the
                        thermometer F an indication of the temperature; and, at the same time, the
                        elastic force of the steam flowing or moving by would raise it in C to a
                        certain number of inches, so as to cause the corresponding pressure. This
                        apparatus is both appropriate and ingenious, and indicates considerable
                        mechanical knowledge in its inventor, a physician of Winterthour in
                        Switzerland. Unhappily he lived too remote from the scene of the
                        philosophical discoveries of that period, to adopt the precautions necessary
                        to give value to his experiments. He allowed atmospheric air to mingle with
                        the steam to such an extent as greatly to vitiate his results.</p>
                    <p>24. M. Betancourt visited England about the end of last century; and having
                        been employed to select ma chines, models, and drawings for the Spanish
                        government, made himself acquainted with the use of steam in Great Britain
                        at that period. On his return, he immediately undertook a series of
                        experiments on the force of the vapour of water, alcohol, and other liquids,
                        at various temperatures. His apparatus is tolerably perfect; and the
                        precautions which he adopted for the removal of atmospheric air from
                        intermixture with the vapour, give his experiments considerable value and
                        precision. Some of his experiments were made in vacuo; and he seems to have
                        been one of the first philosophers who examined the production of steam at
                        temperatures below the ordinary point of ebullition, under the pressure of
                        the atmosphere His experiments extend from 32° up to 279°, being 67° above
                        the ordinary boiling point.</p>
                    <p>His apparatus (Fig. 9) consisted of a spheroidal copper boiler A, about eight
                        inches in diameter, fifteen inches high, and a tenth of an inch in
                        thickness; a flat cover was soldered on the top of it, and three apertures
                        were formed into which were inserted a thermometer EC, a glass tube D, and a
                        plug B for admitting water. The glass tube being bent downwards at F, was
                        recurved upwards at G, leaving an upright stem, ten feet high, and
                        hermetically sealed at the top, so as to leave a perfect vacuum in that end
                        of the tube, over a column of mercury of about 30 inches in the two branches
                        of the recurvation at the bottom. The boiler was provided with a stopcock
                        <hi rend="italic">b</hi>, by which the air was extracted from the boiler
                        previous to experiment, by means of an air-pump TV, communicating with W;
                        and when this was accomplished so as to obtain a vacuum on both ends of the
                        mercurial column, the mercury stood, as in the figure, on nearly the same
                        level in both its branches. The fire was instantly applied, and the
                        crackling noise which followed informed him that the ebullition had
                        commenced, and the steam in the boiler pressing on that end of the mercurial
                        column nearest to it, raised the other in the vacuum a certain quantity
                        above its outer level, indicating its elastic force, which gradually
                        increased until it became at the usual heat of boiling water, equal to
                        twenty eight French inches, the mean pressure of the atmosphere. The
                        following table will enable us to estimate the value of these experiments;
                        it is given in degrees of Reaumur’s thermometer, of which 0° coincides with
                        32° of our common scale, and 80° with our boiling point 212° Fahren heit,
                        each degree of Reaumur being equal to 2¼ of our scale. The pressure is in
                        French inches of mercury :—</p>

                    <p>The slight deviation of these experiments from each other indicates
                        considerable accuracy of experiment; and the slight excess in the former of
                        the two series is attributed to the formation of a less perfect vacuum at
                        the commencement of the observations, arising from the smaller quantity of
                        water in the boiler when the experiments were made.</p>
                    <p>It should, however, he noticed, that there is one omis sion of some
                        importance in the experiments of M. Betan court. He inserts the <hi
                        rend="italic">bare bulb</hi> of his thermometer into the reservoir among the
                        water, so as to suffer all the variations imposed on it by the varying
                        elasticity of the steam. By following the method adopted by his predecessor,
                        M. Ziegler, of inserting a metallic tube to sustain the pressure of the
                        steam, and forming it into a mercurial bath for containing the thermometer,
                        and so transmitting the heat of the steam to it without exposure to variable
                        pressure, a source of considerable error might have been avoided. This
                        precaution is essential to a good set of experiments on steam; for a very
                        slight pressure, even of the finger, on the bulb of a thermometer will raise
                        it several degrees.</p>

                        /> phenomena of the temperature and elastic force of steam. They appear to
                        have been made in 1778. His apparatus is represented in the accompanying
                        fissure.</p>
                    <p>* ABCD (Fig. 10.) is the section of a small digester made of copper.</p>
                    <p>Its lid, which was fasterιed to the body with screws, was pierced with three
                        holes, each of which had a small pipe soldered into it. The first hole was
                        furnished with a brass safety-valve V, nicely fitted to it by grinding. The
                        area of this valve was exactly ½th of an inch. There rested on the stalk at
                        the top of this valve the arm of a steelyard carrying a sliding weight. This
                        arm had a scale of equal parts, so adjusted to the weight, that the number
                        on the scale corresponded to the inches of mercury, whose pressure on the
                        under surface of the valve is equal to that of the steelyard ou its top; so
                        that when the weight was at the division 10, the pressure of the steelyard
                        on the valve was just equal to that of a column of mercury 10 inches high,
                        and ½th of an inch base.</p>
                    <p>The middle hole contained a thermometer T firmly fixed into it, so that no
                        vapour could escape by its sides. The ball of this thermometer was but a
                        little way below the lid. The third hole received occasionally the end of a
                        glass pipe SGF, whose descending leg was about 36 inches long. When this
                        syphon was not used, the hole was properly shut with a plug.</p>
                    <p>* The vessel was half filled with distilled water which had been purged of
                        air by boiling. The lid was then fixed on, having the third hole S plugged
                        up. A lamp being placed under the vessel, the water boiled, and the steam
                        issued copiously by the safety-valve. The thermometer stood at 213°, and a
                        barometer in the room at 29∙9 inches. The weight was then put on the fifth
                        division. The thermometer immediately began to rise; and when it was at 220,
                        the steam issued by the sides of the valve. The weight was removed to the
                        10th division; but, before the thermometer could be distinctly observed, the
                        steam was issuing at the valve. The lamp was removed further from the bottom
                        of the vessel, that the progress of heating might be more moderate; and when
                        the steam ceased to issue from the valve, the thermometer was at 227∙ The
                        weight was now shifted to 15; and, by gradually ap proaching the lamp, the
                        steam again issued, and the thermometer was at 232½. This mode of trial was
                        continued all the way to the 75th division of the scale. The experiments
                        were then repeated in the contrary order; that is, the weight being
                        suspended at the 75th division, and the steam issuing strongly at the valve,
                        the lamp was withdrawn, and the moment the steam ceased to come out, the
                        thermometer was obser ved. The same was done at the 70th, 65th division,
                        &amp;c.</p>
                    <p>These experiments were several times repeated both ways; and the means of all
                        the results for each division are expressed in the subjoin ed table, where
                        column 1st expresses the elasticity of the steam, being the sum of 29∙9; and
                        the division of the steel yard, column 2d, expresses the temperature of the
                        steam corresponding to this elasticity.</p>

                    <p>* A very different process was necessary for ascertaining the elasticity of
                        the steam in lower temperatures, and consequently under smaller pressures
                        than that of the atmosphere. The glass syphon SGF was now fixed into its
                        hole in the lid of the digester. The water was made to boil smartly for some
                        time, and the steam issued co piously both at the valve and at the syphon.
                        The lower end of the syphon was now immersed into a broad saucer of mercury,
                        and the lamp instantly removed, and every thing was allowed to grow cold. By
                        this the steam was gradually condensed, and the mercury rose in the syphon,
                        without sensibly sinking in the saucer. The valve and all the joints were
                        smeared with a thick clammy cement, composed of oil, tallow, and rosin,
                        which effectually pre vented all ingress of air. The weather was clear and
                        frosty, and the barometer standing at 29.84, and the thermometer in the
                        vessel at 42°. The mercury in the syphon stood at 297, or somewhat higher,
                        thus showing a very complete condensation. The whole vessel was surrounded
                        with pounded ice, of the temperature 32°. This made no sensible change in
                        the height of the mercury. A mark was now made at the surface of the
                        mercury. One observer was stationed at the thermometer, with instructions to
                        call out as the thermometer reached the divisions 42, 47, 52, 57, and so on
                        by every five degrees till it should attain the boiling heat. Another
                        observer noted the corresponding descents of the mercury by a scale of
                        inches, which had its beginning placed at 29∙84 from the surface of the
                        mercury in the saucer.</p>
                    <p>* The pounded ice was now removed, and the lamp placed at a considerable
                        distance below the vesseI, so as to warm its contents very slowly. These
                        observations being very easily made, were several times repeated, and their
                        mean results are set down in the following table: only ob serve, that it was
                        found difficult to note down the descents for every fifth degree, because
                        they succeeded each other so fast. Every 10th was judged sufficient for
                        establishing the law of variation. The first column of the table contains
                        the temperature, and the second the descent (in inches) of the mercury from
                        the mark 29.84.</p>

                        accurate as the others, because the mercury passed pretty quickly through
                        these points. But the progress was extremely regular through the remaining
                        points; so that the elasticities corresponding to temperutures above 70° may
                        be considered as very accurately ascertained.</p>
                    <p>* Not being altogether satisfied with the method employed for measuring the
                        elasticity in temperatures above that of boiling water, a better form of
                        experiment was adopted. Indeed it was the want of other apparatus which made
                        it necessary to employ the former. À glass tube was procured of the form
                        represented in Fig. 11, having a little cistern L, from the top and bottom
                        of which proceeded the syphons K and MN. The cistern contained mercury, and
                        the tube MN was of a slender bore, and was about six feet two inches long.
                        The end K was firmly fixed in the third hole of the lid, and the long leg of
                        the syphon was furnished with a scale of in ches, and firmly fastened to an

                        escaping for some time through the safety-valve. A heavy weight was then sus

                    <p>26. In the mean time, however, Mr Watt had been led, in the course of his
                        invention of the steam-engine, to make experiments on the elastic force of
                        steam, of which he has given the following account, and which was annexed by
                        himself to Dr Robison’s original article in this work.</p>
                    <p>In the winter of 1764-5, I made experiments at G1as gow on the subject, in
                        the course of my endeavours to improve the steam-engine, and as I did not
                        then think of any <hi rend="italic">simple</hi> method of trying the
                        elasticities of steam at temperatures less than that of boiling water, and
                        had at hand a digester by which the elasticities at greater heats could be
                        tried, I considered that, by establishing the ratios in which they
                        proceeded, the elasticities at lower heats might be found nearly enough for
                        my purpose. I there fore fitted a thermometer to the digester, with its bulb
                        in the inside, placed a small cistern with mercury also within the digester,
                        fixed a small barometer tube with its end in the mercury, and left the upper
                        end open. I then made the digester boil for some time, the steam issuing at
                        the safety-valve, until the air contained in the digester was supposed to be
                        expelled. The safety-valve being shut, the steam acted upon the surface of
                        the mercury in the cistern, and made it rise in the tube. When it reached to
                        15 inches above the surface of the mercury in the cis tern, the heat was
                        236°; and at 30 inches above that surface, the heat was 252°. Here I was
                        obliged to stop, as I had no tube longer than 34 inches, and there was no
                        white glass made nearer than Newcastle-upon-Tyne. I therefore sealed the
                        upper end of the tube hermetically, whilst it was empty, and when it was
                        cool immersed the lower end in the mercury, which now could only rise in the
                        tube by compressing the air it contained. The tube was somewhat conical;
                        but, by ascertaining how much it was so, and making allowances accordingly,
                        the following points were found, which, though not exact, were tolerably
                        near for an <hi rend="italic">apercu.</hi> At 29½ inches (with the sealed
                        tube) the heat was 252°, at 75½ inches the heat was 264°, and at H0½ inches
                        292°. (That is, after making allowances for the pillar of mercury supported,
                        and the pillar which would be necessary to compress the air into the space
                        which it occupied, these were the results). From these elements I laid down
                        a curve, in which the abscissae represented the tempera tures, and the
                        ordinates the pressures, and thereby found the law by which they were
                        governed, sufficiently near for my then purpose. It was not till the years
                        1773—4, that I found leisure to make further experiments on this sub ject,
                        of which, though I do not consider the results as accurate, I shall give an
                        account here, as they were in point of date prior to any others that I was
                        then acquainted with.</p>
                    <p>A tin pan, of about five inches in diameter and four inches deep, had a hole
                        made in its bottom, near one side, and in this hole was soldered a socket
                        somewhat conical, which nearly fitted a barometer tube with which the
                        experiments were to be made. This tube was about 36 inches long, and had a
                        ball at one end about 1½ inches diameter, the contents of which were nearly
                        equal to those of the stem of the tube; some paper was lapped round the tube
                        near the ball, and it was forced tight into the conical socket of the pan,
                        so that the ball was within the latter, at such a height that it might be
                        immersed in water. The tube and pan were then inverted, and the ball was
                        filled with clean mercury, and the stem with distilled water fresh boiled.
                        The tube was re-inverted, so that the ball and pan were uppermost; the lower
                        end of the tube being shut by the finger, the water ascended into the ball,
                        and the mercury occupied the tube. The lower end of the Iatter being then
                        placed in a cistern of mercury, and released from the finger, the mercury
                        and water descended, and the ball was Ieft partly empty: being agitated in
                        this position, and let stand some time, much air was extricated from the
                        water; the tube was inclined as much as it could be, and again inverted, the
                        air let out, and its place supplied with boiling water. It was again •placed
                        with the ball uppermost, the end of the tube stop ped, the pan filled with
                        hot water which was made to boil by means of a lamp, the lower end of the
                        tube being<pb break="no" facs="ht:chi.28490924&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=661"

                        finger, the mercury descended into the cistern, but upon the water in the
                        pan being suffered to cool, partly rose again into the tube. Much air was
                        thus liberated, and more was got rid of by agitation, in the manner of the
                        water hammer, and by leaving it standing for some time erect, until at last
                        I got it so free from air, that when I raised it upright, it supported a
                        column of mercury 34 inches high; and no vacuum was formed until it was
                        violently shaken, when it fell down suddenly and settled at 28.75 inches,
                        but upon being inclined, a speck of air always remained, though, when it was
                        expanded by a pillar of mercury 27 inches high, this speck was not larger
                        than a pin’s head.</p>
                    <p>In this state, when the tube was perpendicular, I found the mercury to stand
                        at 28.75 inches, the column of water above it was about 6½ inches, = half an
                        inch of mercury. The whole then being 29.25 inches, when the stationary
                        barometer stood at 29.4, the difference, or pillar supported by the
                        elasticity of the steam = 0.15 inch. The water in the pan was then heated
                        exceedingly slowly by a lamp, and stirred continually by a feather to make
                        the heat as equal as possible. The results are shown in the following table

                    <p>At this time (1774) I tried a set of experiments in the same manner on a
                        saturated solution of common salt. When this solution was perfectly
                        saturated by boiling, and was put into the tube, it precipitated a quantity
                        of salt which disturbed the experiment. I was therefore obliged to take it
                        out, and filter it, during which process it attracted moisture from the air,
                        and appeared, by its boiling point, not to be perfectly saturated. Though it
                        was more free from air than water is, yet it parted from what it contained
                        with great difficulty, and would part with none when shaken as a
                        water-hammer, though it opened in all parts of the liquor. The result of
                        this experiment is contained in the annexed table :—</p>

                    <p>Upon considering the probable cause of the difference, especially in the
                        lower heats, between my experiments and those of Mr Southern, related in his
                        letter annexed to this essay, I can only reconcilo them by supposing that
                        the stationary barometer, with which the comparison was made, had its scale
                        placed 0.2 of an inch too low, and by adding that quantity to the
                        elasticities in table lst, they approach nearly to Mr Southern’s
                        experiments.</p>
                    <p>If that conjecture is adopted, the same addition will be necessary to tables
                        2d and 3d, as they were compared with the same stationary barometer.</p>
                    <p>To determine the heats at which water boils when pressed by columns of
                        mercury above 30 inches, a tube of 55 inches long was employed; one end was
                        put through a hole in the cover of a digester, and made tight by being
                        lapped round with paper, and within the digester the end of the tube was
                        immersed in a cistern of mercury. A thermometer was fixed in another
                        opening, so that the bulb was in the inside of the digester, and the stem
                        and scale without; and the bulb was kept half an inch from the cover of the
                        digester by a wooden collar. The cover being fixed on tight, and the
                        digester half filled with water, it was heated by means of a large lamp.</p>
                    <p>The air in the upper part of the digester expanding by heat, the column of
                        mercury in the tube was considerably raised by that expansion before the
                        water boiled. The air was let out, and the water heated to boiling; still,
                        however, some air remained, for the mercury stood at 213½°. That deduction
                        being made, the following table shows the heats and corresponding
                        elasticitics.</p>

                    <p>In making these experiments, the digester was heated very slowly, and the
                        heat was kept stationary as much as was possible at each observation, so
                        that the whole series occupied some hours. The degrees of elasticity were
                        observed by my friend Dr Irvine, whilst I observed those of the thermometer
                        in all these experiments.</p>
                    <p>With the whole of the observations, I was, after all, by no means satisfied,
                        as I perceived there were irregularities in the results which my more urgent
                        avocations did not permit me to explore the causes of and to correct.</p>
                    <p>The matter remained in that state till 1796, when I requested Mr Southern to
                        try them over again, in the<pb break="no"

                        /> performance of which he was assisted by Mr William Creighton. The results
                        of these observations are contained in Mr Southern’s letter to me, which
                        follows this memoir; and, from the very great care with which the
                        experiments were made, the known accuracy of both Mr Southern and Mr
                        Creighton, and the agreement of the experiments with one another, I have
                        reason to believe them as nearly perfect as the subject admits of. The
                        method he adopted of trying the elasticities above the temperature of
                        boiling water by a piston, accurately fitted to a cylinder, is much to be
                        preferred to that adopted by Dr Robison, and is more manageable under great
                        elasticities than that of a long pillar of mercury..</p>

                    <p>“<hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Sir</hi>,—The experiments of which the particular
                        circumstances are hereafter related, were made in 1803, with the view of
                        ascertaining chiefly the density of steam raised from water under different
                        pressures above that of the atmosphere, an apparatus having then been made
                        for a different purpose, which seemed pretty well adapted to this
                        object.</p>
                    <p>“Besides the experiments now to be related, in which the temperature of steam
                        raised under <hi rend="italic">high</hi> pressures was observed in 1803,
                        others had been made some years before, in 1797 and 98, for that purpose
                        only; and, as they were made with the greatest circumspection, both the
                        manner of making them and their results may be here described, as may also
                        the results of other experiments, made with equal care, to ascertain the
                        temperature of steam raised under <hi rend="italic">low</hi> pressures.</p>
                    <p>“The instrument used in the former was a Papin’s digester, similar to what
                        you had used; the leading differences being in adapting a metallic tube to
                        it to contain the thermometer, or rather as much of it as coatained mercury,
                        in the manner mentioned in the beginning of this letter, and instead of a
                        valve, by the load on which to measure the elasticity of the contained s
                        team, a nicely bored cylinder was applied, with a piston fitting it, so as
                        to have very little friction, and to the rod of this was applied a lever,
                        constructed to work on edges like those of a scale-beam, by which the
                        resistance against the elastic force of the steam could be accurately
                        determined; and at your suggestion, to be assured that no inaccuracy had
                        crept into the calculation, by which this resistance, through the medium of
                        the lever, was ascertained, an actual column of mercury of 30 inches high
                        was substi tuted, and the correspondence was found to be within <hi
                        rend="superscript"> 1</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"> 100</hi> of an inch.</p>
                    <p>“The observations at each of the points of pressure noted were continued some
                        minutes, the temperature at each being alternately raised and lowered, so as
                        to make the pressure of the steam on the under side of the piston
                        alternately too much and too little for the weight with which it was loaded;
                        and thence a mean temperature was adopted, the extremes of which were, as
                        well as I now recollect, not more than half a degree on each side of it. The
                        load on the piston, including its own weight, &amp;c., &amp;c., was
                        calculated to be successively just equal to 1, 2, 4, and 8 atmospheres of
                        29∙8 inches of mercury each, and the temperature of the steam was varied as
                        above till that of each point was determined; the results were thus :—</p>

                    <p>“The experiments for ascertaining the temperature of steam below the
                        atmospheric pressure were made with an apparatus essentially similar to that
                        which you originally used, and with scrupulous care and attention: and I met
                        with the same incidents as you had done; such as, the production of a bubble
                        of air whenever, after any experi ment, the tube was inclined to refill the
                        ball; and also the extraordinary suspension of a column of mercury of 35
                        inches vertical height, and of 7 inches of water above that, although the
                        counterpoise was only that of the atmosphere, then under 30 inches. I found
                        also that the tube required a considerable degree of tabouring or shaking to
                        make the column subside and leave a space in the ball. This phenomenon was
                        not produced till after much pains taken in inverting and re-inverting the
                        tube again and again, nor till it had been suffered, after these operations,
                        to stand for three or four days undistm∙bed in the exhausting position, and
                        then discharging the air that had been accumulating in the interval.</p>
                    <p>“The results to be found in the table below, were deduced from the
                        observations as you had done—viz., by adding to the height of the column of
                        mercury in the tube (ascertained by a gauge floating on the surface of the
                        mercury in the basin), that of the water above it, or rather of an
                        equivalent column of mercury, and subtracting their sum from the height of
                        the common barometer at the time. All these results were taken from
                        observations made after the apparatus had been so perfectly exhausted of air
                        as to produce the phenomenon just mentioned.</p>

                        1782, there is an account of some experiments made by M. Achard on the
                        elastic force of steam, from the temperature 32° to 212°. They agree
                        extremely well with those mentioned here, rarely differing more than two or
                        three-tenths of an inch. He also examined the elasticity of the vapour
                        produced from alcohol, and when the elasticity was equal to that of the
                        vapour of water, he found that the temperature was about 35° lower. Thus,
                        when the elasticity of both was measured by 28.1 inches of mercury, the
                        temperature of the watery vapour was 209°, and that of the spirituous vapour
                        was 173°. When the elasticity was 18.5, the temperature of the water was
                        189.5°, and that of the alcohol 154.6°. When the elasticity was 11.05, the
                        water was 168°, and the alcohol 134.4° Observing the difference between the
                        temperature of equally elastic vapours of water and alcohol not to be con
                        stant, but gradually to diminish, in M. Achard’s experi ments, along with
                        the elasticity, it became interesting to discover whether, and at what
                        temperature, this difference would vanish altogether. Experiments were
                        accordingly made by the writer of this article, similar to those made with
                        water. They were not made with the same scrunulous care, nor repeated as
                        they deserved, but they furnished rather an unexpected result. The following
                        table will give the reader a distinct notion of them.</p>

                    <p>29. Dr Dalton appears to have been the first to escape from the natural
                        enough error of assuming that the vapour of water at 32° would be = 0. His
                        apparatus is the most simple and refined of any that have been employed for
                        temperatures below 212°, and his experiments are those which, to the present
                        day, have the greatest authority. Dr Dalton’s first experiments were
                        published in 1793, in his <hi rend="italic">Meteorological Essays;</hi>
                        afterwards, when more extended, in the <hi rend="italic">Manchester
                        Memoirs,</hi> 1802; then in the first volume of his <hi rend="italic">System
                        of Chemistry,</hi> 1808; and finally in the second volume of the same work,
                        1827. The following is the account given by himself, of his early
                        experiments, in the <hi rend="italic">Manchester Memoirs.</hi></p>
                    <p>“My method is this: I take a barometer tube AB, (Fig. 13,) perfectly dry, and
                        fill it with mercury just boiled, marking the place (30) where it is
                        stationary; then, having graduated the tube, I pour a little water, or any
                        other liquid, the subject of experiment, into it, so as to moisten the whole
                        inside: after this I again pour in mercury, and carefully inverting the
                        tube, exclude all air; the barometer, by standing some time, exhibits a
                        portion of water of <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> / <hi rend="subscript">
                        8</hi> or <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"> 10</hi> th
                        of an inch, W, on the top of the mercurial column; because, being lighter,
                        it ascends by the side of the tube, which may now be inclined, and the
                        mercury will rise to the top, manifesting a perfect vacuum from air. I next
                        take a cylindrical glass tube CD, open at both ends, of two inches diameter
                        and fourteen inches in length, to each end of which a cork is adapted,
                        perforated in the middle, so as to admit a barometer tube to be put through,
                        and to be held fast by them; the upper cork, C, is fixed two or three inches
                        below the top of the tube, and is one-half cut away, so as to admit water,
                        &amp;c., to pass by, its service being merely to keep the tube steady.
                        Things being thus circumstanced; water of any temperature may be poured into
                        the wide tube, and thus made to surround the upper part or vacuum of the
                        barometer, and the effect of temperature in the production of vapour within
                        can be observed from the depression of the mercurial column at the top. In
                        this way I have had water as high as 155° surrounding the vacuum; but as the
                        higher temperatures might endanger a glass apparatus, instead of it I used
                        the following:—<pb break="no"
                        facs="ht:chi.28490924&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=664" xml:id="kp-eb0720-0664-0584"
                        /> Having procured a tin tube CD, four inches in diameter, and two feet long
                        with a circular plate soldered to one end, having a round hole in the
                        centre, like the tube of a reflecting telescope, I got another smaller tube
                        of the same length soldered into the larger, so as to be in the axis or
                        centre of it; the small tube was open at both ends, and on this construction
                        water could be poured into the large vessel to fill it, while the central
                        tube was exposed to its temperature. Into this central tube I could insert
                        the upper half of a syphon barometer, and fix it by a cork, the top of the
                        narrow tube, also, being corked—thus the effect of any temperature under
                        212° could be ascertained, the depression of the mercurial column being
                        known by the ascent in the exterior leg of the syphon. The force of vapour

                    <p>Dr Dalton afterwards resumed the experimental ex amination of this subject,
                        and was induced to modify these numbers slightly, as will be seen from our
                        final table.</p>
                    <p>30. Passing over the experiments of Schmidt, Goldner, and others, as
                        presenting no important differences from some of these we have already
                        noticed, we come to those of Dr Ure, published in the <hi rend="italic"
                        >Philosophical Transactions</hi> of 1818, and made at Glasgow during 1817.
                        The ad joining figures represent his apparatus.</p>
                    <p>Fig. 15. represents the construction used for temperatures under and a little
                        above the boiling point. Figs. 16. and 17. are those used for higher
                        temperatures, the last being the more convenient of the two; each was
                        suspended from a lofty window ceiling, and placed in a truly vertical
                        position, by means of a plumb line. Dr Ure gives the following account of
                        his mode of experimenting. “One simple principle pervades the whole train of
                        experiments —which is, that the progressive increase of elastic force
                        developed by heat from the liquid, incumbent on the mercury at L <hi
                        rend="italic">l',</hi> is measured by the length of column which must be <hi
                        rend="italic">added</hi> over L, the primitive level below, in order to
                        restore the quick silver to its primitive level above, at <hi rend="italic"
                        >l.</hi></p>
                    <p>These two stations or points of departure are nicely defined by a ring of
                        fine platina wire, twisted firmly round the tube.</p>
                    <p>“At the commencement of the experi ment, after the liquid, well freed from
                        air, has been let up, the quicksilver is made a tangent to the edge of the
                        upper ring, by cautiously pouring mercury, in a slender stream, into the
                        open leg of the syphon B, the level ring below is then carefully
                        adjusted.</p>
                    <p>“From the mode of conducting my experiments, there remained always a quantity
                        of liquid m contact with the vapour, a circumstance essential to accuracy in
                        this research.</p>
                    <p>“Suppose the temperature of the water or the oil in A to be 32° Fahrenheit,
                        as denoted by a delicate thermo meter, or by the liquefaction of ice;
                        communicate heat to the cylinder A, by means of two argand flames, playing
                        gently on its shoulder at each side. When the thermo meter indicates 42°,
                        modify the flames, or remove them so as to maintain a uniform temperature
                        for a few minutes. A film or line of light will now be perceived between the
                        mercury and the ring at <hi rend="italic">l,</hi> as is seen under the
                        vernier of a mountain barometer, when it is raised a few feet off the
                        ground; were the tube at <hi rend="italic">l</hi> and L, of equal area, or
                        were the relation of the areas experiment ally determined, then the rise of
                        the quicksilver above L would be one-half, or a known submultiple of the
                        total depression, equivalent to the additional elasticity of the vapour at
                        42° above that at 32°. Since the depressions, however, for 30 or 40° in this
                        part of the scale are exceedingly small, one-half of the quantity can
                        scarcely be ascertained with suitable precision, even after taking the above
                        precautions; and besides, the other sources of error, or at least
                        embarrassment, from the inequalities of the tube, and from the lengthening
                        space occupied by the vapour, as the temperature ascends, render this method
                        of reduction very ineligible.</p>
                    <p>“By the other plan we avoid all these evils; for what ever additional
                        elasticity be communicated to the vapour above <hi rend="italic">l</hi>, it
                        will be faithfully represented and measured by the mercurial column, which
                        we must add over L, in order to overcome it and restore the quicksilver
                        under <hi rend="italic">I,</hi> to its zero or initial level, when the
                        platina ring becomes once more a tangent to the mercury. At E, a piece of<pb
                        break="no" facs="ht:chi.28490924&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=665"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0720-0665-0585"/> cork is fixed between the parallel legs of
                        the syphon to sustain it, and to serve as a point by which the whole is
                        steadily suspended. For temperatures above the boiling point, the part of
                        the syphon under E is evidently superfluous, merely containing in its two
                        legs a useless weight of equipoised mercury. Accordingly, for high heats,
                        the apparatus, Figs. 16 or 17, is employed, and the same method of procedure
                        is adopted; the aperture at O, Fig. 17, admits the bulb of the thermometer,
                        which rests as usual on <hi rend="italic">l'.</hi> The recurved part of the
                        tube isfilled with mercury, and then a little liquid is passed through it to
                        the sealed end. Heat is now applied by an argand flame to the bottom of C,
                        which is filled with oil or water, and the temperature is kept steadily at
                        212° for some minutes. Then a few drops of quicksilver may be required to be
                        added to D', till L and <hi rend="italic">l'</hi> be in the same horizontal
                        plane. The further conduct of the experiment differs in no respect from what
                        has been already described the liquid in C is progressively heated, and at
                        each stage mercury is progressively added over L to restore the initial
                        level or volume at <hi rend="italic">l',</hi> by equipoising the progressive
                        elas ticity. The column above L being measured, represents the succession of
                        elastic forces: when this column is wished to extend very high, the vertical
                        tube requires to be placed for support in the groove of a long wooden
                        prism.</p>
                    <p>“The height of the column in some of my experiments being nearly twelve feet,
                        it became necessary to employ a ladder to reach its top. I found it to be
                        convenient, in this case, after observing that the column of vapour had
                        attained its primitive magnitude, to note down the temperature with the
                        altitude of the column, then immediately to pour in a measured quantity of
                        mercury nearly equal to three vertical inches, and to wait till the slow
                        progress of the heating again brought the vapour in equilibrio with this new
                        pressure, which at first had pushed the mercury within the platina ring at
                        <hi rend="italic">l.</hi> When the lower surface of the mercury was again a
                        tangent to this ring, the temperature and altitude were both instantly
                        observed.</p>
                    <p>“This mode of conducting the process will account for the experimental
                        temperatures being very often odd and fractional numbers. I present them to
                        the public, as they were recorded on the instant in that particular
                        repetition of the experiment which I consider most entitled to confidence.
                        To trim and fashion the results into an orderly looking series, would have
                        been an easy task; but, in my opinion, this is a species of deception very
                        injurious to the cause of science, and a deviation from the rigid truth of
                        observation, which ought never to be made for any hypo thesis: we shall
                        afterwards have ample opportunities of exposing the fallacy of such
                        premature geometrical refinements.</p>
                    <p>The thermometers were constructed by Creighton with his well-known nicety,
                        and the divisions were read off with a lens, so that <hi rend="superscript">
                        1</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"> 10</hi> th of a degree could be
                        distinguished. After bestowing the utmost pains in repeating the experi
                        ments, during a period of nearly two months, I found that the only way of
                        removing the little discrepancies which crept in between contiguous
                        measures, was to adopt the astronomical plan of multiplying observations,
                        and deducing truth from the mean. It is essential to heat with extreme
                        slowness and circumspection the vessels A, B, C. One repetition of the
                        experiment occupies on an average seven hours.</p>

                        heated. It is the concurrent opinion of all chemical philosophers, that
                        caloric travels downwards in liquids with extreme slowness and difficulty.
                        Indeed, Count Rumford’s experiments led him to infer, that heat could not
                        descend in fluids at all.</p>
                    <p>“It is evident that, in my constructions, figures 15, 16, and 17, only that
                        small portion of quicksilver within the vessels A, B, and C, will be
                        affected by the heat, but the measuring column is beyond the reach of its
                        influence.”</p>

                    <p>32. We now come to the most imposing series of experiments hitherto
                        conducted. In 1823, the government of France having resolved to legislate on
                        the means for obtaining security in the use of steam-engines, consulted the
                        Academy of Sciences, upon the mode of most effectually promoting the public
                        safety, without placing useless restraints on commercial enterprise and
                        manufacturing industry. The examination into the state of knowledge
                        concerning the phenomena of vapour at elevated temperatures, which resulted
                        from this application, having brought the imperfections of this part of
                        science prominently into notice, the Academy were induced to undertake a
                        long and laborious enquiry, not entirely free from personal danger, into the
                        law connecting temperature with the pressure of steam. The commission
                        consisted of the illustrious mem bent of the Academy, Baron de Prony, Arago,
                        Girard, and Dulong; and the results of their investigation, finish ed in
                        1829, are given in the tenth volume of the Memoirs of the Academy of
                        Sciences, printed in 1831. These experiments, conducted principally by the
                        MM. Arago and Dulong, were on a scale of magnitude and expense suited to the
                        munificence of the French government and the resources of the Academy. The
                        precautions adopted to ensure minute accuracy, entitle them to confidence,
                        no less than the names of two philosophers, so well versed in experiments of
                        a similar nature. They were carried as high as to the twenty-fourth
                        atmosphere of pressure.</p>
                    <p>The experiments were made in one of the courts of the Observatory. Fig. 18
                        represents a section of the principal portions of the apparatus. The boiler
                        <hi rend="italic">a</hi> consists of a cylindrical body, having its axis
                        vertical; the two ends forming top and bottom are spherical segments,
                        strongly riveted to the body, the whole being made of the finest plate iron.
                        The material of the cylindrical part is half an inch thick, the top and
                        bottom being considerably thicker. The aperture at the top, six inches in
                        diameter, was closed by a plate of wrought iron, an inch and three-quarters
                        thick, overlapping the hole, about two inches all round, and having on its
                        lower surface a projecting ring, adapting it to a groove on the upper side
                        of the top of the boiler: between these two surfaces was interposed a thick
                        ring of lead, and the cover was then strongly screwed down by six steel
                        bolts, the nuts of which had head-washers, so that, on screwing the whole
                        together, the cover became hermetically closed. This experimental boiler was
                        built in a furnace of considerable size and mass, intended to produce a
                        temperature of the requisite constancy; <hi rend="italic">x x</hi> are bars
                        upon which the fire rests; <hi rend="italic">y</hi> is the flue leading to
                        the chimney.</p>
                    <p>The other parts of the apparatus connected with the boiler are <hi
                        rend="italic">b</hi> A, a lever, safety-valve, and weights; <hi
                        rend="italic">y y</hi> (fig. 19) the thermometer scales; and <hi
                        rend="italic">w w</hi> reservoirs of cold water, for maintaining uniform
                        temperatures on the vertical parts of the instruments.</p>
                    <p>During the process of proving the boiler by a hydraulic pump, the common
                        safety-valve, when used as an instrument for measuring with precision the
                        pressure of the fluid in the boiler, was observed to give very erroneous
                        indications, and the necessity of a more delicate apparatus was
                        demonstrated. The improved index of pressure, made use of in the
                        experiments, is shown in fig. 18. For measuring the great pressures to be
                        used, a tube of mercury, 80 feet high, would have been requisite; but there
                        was used, as a substitute for it, a glass tube <hi rend="italic">z z,</hi>
                        closed at the upper end, filled with dry atmospheric air, and having a
                        length of only five feet seven inches, and an internal diameter of <hi
                        rend="superscript"> 1</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"> 5</hi> of an inch, and of
                        a thickness nearly equal to its diameter. It was so arranged as to furnish a
                        convenient manometer, capable of giving the same indications, by the
                        contraction of the contained air, as would have been given in similar
                        circumstances, by a column of mercury of the height due to the diminished
                        volume of the air. The graduation of this manometer, however, presented new
                        difficulties.</p>
                    <p>These difficulties were successfully encountered by the skill and ardour of
                        the academicians. Every one knows that it is impossible to obtain a glass
                        tube of considerable length and magnitude which shall have a tolerably
                        cylindrical interior; and that there are a number of practical<pb break="no"
                        facs="ht:chi.28490924&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=667" xml:id="kp-eb0720-0667-0587"
                        /> difficulties, which render it impossible to obtain even such a tube as
                        that of a common thermometer, which shall possess the uniformity necessary
                        to a good instrument. To make the proper allowance for this inevitable
                        imperfection, the academicians easily might have adopted the same method as
                        that used in the case of thermometer tubes, by determining the volume of
                        successive small portions of its interior; but even this would have
                        furnished a very partial remedy for the evil, because it had not been
                        ascertained that the space occupied by the air in the manometer would
                        diminish in bulk exactly in the proportion of the increase of compressing
                        force, or of the corresponding increase in the height of the equivalent
                        column of mercury. Two problems were therefore to be resolved at once, the
                        elimination of the error of the tube, and the determination of the
                        elasticity of air under high pressures. Both of them were satisfactorily
                        accomplished, by the following 1abori ous research.</p>
                    <p>As a preliminary measure, it was resolved to graduate the manometer, and
                        determine the law of the elastic force of air under high pressures, by
                        direct comparison with a column of mercury, from 75 to 80 feet in height.
                        Such an experiment required a suitable <hi rend="italic">locale</hi> and a
                        stupendous apparatus. Among tire buildings of the Royal College of Henri
                        Quatre, there may be observed an old square tower, sole relic of the ancient
                        church of Sainte Genevieve: there exist still in the interior three vaulted
                        floors, pierced in the centre, and affording the very supports that were
                        required for the erection of this stupendous mercurial gauge. In the centre
                        of this opening there was raised a squared tree of the required height, and
                        to this it was determined to attach the glass tube of 80 feet in height. To
                        form a single glass tube of so great length was impossible; its own weight,
                        when constructed, under the pressure of the mercury, would have endangered
                        its existence. The glass column was built of separate portions, united in
                        mastic, with great care, in viroles of steel. Each portion of tube was
                        suspended in the air by an exact counterpoise, acting over pulleys fixed to
                        the tree; and the whole of the parts were so united in equilibrio, that each
                        sustained only its own weight, and the pressure of the mercury due to the
                        height of the superior portion of the column. A homogeneous metallic scale
                        was attached, and its divisions read by a vernier, as in the common
                        barometer.</p>
                    <p>The manometer to be graduated, and this column of mercury, were both
                        connected by tubes with a strong cylindrical vase <hi rend="italic">f</hi>
                        holding about 100 lbs. of mercury. When thus placed in communication, a
                        column of water was forced into the vase above the mercury by a hydraulic
                        pump, and the pressure thus produced raised the metal with equal force up
                        into the glass tube column on the one hand, and into the manometric tube on
                        the other. The point to which the air was compressed was read off by a
                        vernier, and the corresponding height of the mercury having been determined,
                        it was manifest that the same degree of compression of the less instrument
                        would ever after serve as the index of an equivalent column of mercury. In
                        this manner the whole tube was graduated by careful experi ment. The result
                        of this graduation was satisfactory and very instructive. In forming the
                        scale of the manometer, no room was left for errors of practical execution;
                        and the comparison of the volume of the air with the height of the mercurial
                        column demonstrated the diminution of the volume of the air to be precisely
                        in the ratio of the pres sure, so that the law of Marriotte is rigidly
                        correct, even when extended to the extreme case, where the air is reduced to
                        less than <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"> 25</hi>
                        part of its usual volume.</p>
                    <p>This preliminary process having been successfully terminated, the enormous
                        column of glass was now laid aside, and the manometer, with its reservoir of
                        mercury, transported to the court of the Observatory, for the purpose of
                        being attached to the experimental boiler. Figure 18 shows the manometer <hi

                        corn posed of gun barrels welded together, connects the cover of the boiler

                        rend="italic">f,</hi> so as to conduct the pressure of the steam to the
                        surface, which formerly had sustained the mercurial column. The vacant space
                        above the mercury was filled with water, which, by condensation from a
                        stream of water on the outside, was kept full to the constant height v. A
                        column of water contained in the glass tube <hi rend="italic">z z,</hi> and
                        constantly replenished, preserved the column of air, and other parts of the
                        apparatus, at a constant temperature, indicated by a thermometer. A tube o
                        <hi rend="italic">p,</hi> of glass, communicating with the reservoir of
                        mercury above and below, indicates, on the scale <hi rend="italic">I,
                        m,</hi> the variation of level arising from the recession of the mercury
                        into the manometer tube.</p>
                    <p>To ascertain the temperature of the water and steam of the boiler, it had
                        been considered sufficient in the ruder experiments of earlier observers to
                        insert thermometers directly into the boiler itself. Every one who has an
                        acquaintance with these instruments knows, that any difference of pres sure
                        on the glass produces a false indication of the instru ments, so that even
                        the few inches of mercury in the instrument itself, when inverted, alter its
                        indications, and a slight pressure of the finger would raise it a degree;
                        the inaccuracy of the old method, when used under a pressure of 70 or 80
                        feet of mercury, or 450 pounds on every inch of the immersed surface of the
                        instrument would have been great. The French academicians avoided this
                        error, by immersing strong iron tubes <hi rend="italic">t t,</hi> (figs. 18
                        and 19,) in the water and steam, in which the thermometers, surrounded by
                        liquid metal, were kept in close communication with the heat of the fluids,
                        without exposure to their force. By adopting only very slow variations of
                        temperature, the error arising from the motion of heat was rendered
                        insensible.</p>

                    <p>A table of temperatures, from 1 to 50 atmospheres, calculated in coincidence
                        with the experiments of the French academicians, and adapted to English

                    <p>33. The latest series of experiments on the elastic force of high-pressure
                        steam, we owe to America. At the re quest of the Hon. S. D. Ingham,
                        Secretary of the Treasury of the United States, a committee of the Franklin
                        Institute, of the State of Pennsylvania, was appointed “to examine into the
                        causes of the explosions of the boilers used on board of steamboats, and to
                        devise the most effectual means of preventing the accidents, or of
                        diminishing the extent of their injurious effects.” Among other subjects,
                        such as the strength of boilers, the construction of safety-valves, to which
                        we shall refer in another place, this committee took into consideration the
                        elastic force of high-pressure steam at different temperatures. Funds were
                        placed at their disposal by the House of Representatives, and the committee
                        consisted of such a combination of scientific and practical men, as to give
                        high authority to their results. On the 1st day of November, 1830, the
                        subject was placed in the hands of the following gentle men :—Professor
                        Alex. Dallas Bache, Mr Benjamin Reeves, Mr λV. H. Keating, Mr M. W. Balwin,
                        Mr S. V. Berrick, and Isaiah Sukens.</p>
                    <p>We shall enter more fully on the description of their apparatus of experiment
                        than we should otherwise have done, because we shall have frequent reference
                        to make to the whole of their experiments, not only in this article, but in
                        our article on the Steam-Engine, where we treat of explosions of boilers and
                        their causes.</p>
                    <p>The boiler used by the committee is represented in figs. 20, 21, 22. It is a
                        cylinder, twelve inches in internal diameter, two feet ten inches and a
                        quarter in length within, and a quarter of an inch thick, of rolled iron,
                        with the ends rivetted in the usual manner. Fig. 21 is a side view. Figs. 20
                        and 22 are end views of the boiler, and of the apparatus connected with it.
                        The boiler was placed horizontally in a furnace, the fire surface extending
                        about halfway round the cylinder. The furnace was arranged for a charcoal
                        fire, the grate bars extending the whole length of the boiler, and the fire
                        being applied nearly the whole length. The draught entered by an opening,
                        closed in the usual manner, and left the furnace through a flue placed at
                        one end and side of the boiler. In fig. 20, A is the ashpit door, B the
                        furnace door, and in 21 and 22, C is the furnace chimney.</p>
                    <p>In order to examine, readily, the interior of the boiler during the progress
                        of the experiments, each end was provided with a glass window (D, figs. 20
                        and 22). The glass used was three-eighths of an inch thick. The opemngs in
                        the ends, which were rectangular, were two and a half by one and three
                        quarters inches wide.</p>
                    <p>Three gauge cocks were placed in the front end of the boiler; their positions
                        will be particularly stated hereafter; they are shown in figs. 20 and 21, at
                        <hi rend="italic">a, b,</hi> and c.</p>
                    <p>To the same end and by the side of the gauge cocks, a glass water gauge (<hi
                        rend="italic">w</hi>, <hi rend="italic">x,</hi> figs. 20 and 21) was
                        attached, a particular description of which will be given in the detail of
                        experiments made to compare its performance with that of the gauge
                        cocks.</p>
                    <p>To supply the boiler with water, a forcing pump EE'<pb break="no"

                        /> FG, figs. 21 and 22, was placed near the back end. This pump was of the
                        ordinary construction, with a solid plunger and conical valves; the diameter
                        of the pump was one inch, and the play of the piston one inch and
                        three-quarters. The diameter of the pipe F G, by which the water was
                        conveyed from the pump to the boiler, was three-hundredths of an inch. By a
                        coupling screw, this pipe could be connected with either of the stop cocks
                        <hi rend="italic">d e,</hi> fig. 22, in the back end of the boiler: the
                        opening of these cocks was two-hundredths of an inch in diameter.</p>
                    <p>To ascertain the elasticity of the steam within the boiler, a closed steam
                        gauge (H, figs. 21 and 22), was used, a particular description of the
                        construction, &amp;c. of which will he given. This instrument was placed
                        upon the same stand (I, figs. 21 and 22) which supported the pump, so that
                        the same experimenter could observe its indications and attend to the
                        working of the pump. The cistern of the gauge was connected by a flexible
                        pipe <hi rend="italic">f g,</hi> with the upper part of the boiler.</p>
                    <p>The safety-valve is shown on the top of the boiler (K, fig. 21), midway
                        between the ends. The graduation of it required much pains, and will receive
                        a separate discussion.</p>
                    <p>Near the safety-valve is represented (at L, fig. 21,) the fusible plate
                        apparatus, consisting of a sliding plate of iron, moved by a lever. On the
                        other side of the safety-valve are the thermometers (M and N, fig. 21)
                        plunged into iron tubes to give the temperature of the steam and water
                        within the boiler. Above this appears the reservoir O, containing the water
                        intended to maintain the scales of the thermometers at a constant
                        temperature. All these parts require a more detailed description.</p>
                    <p>The steam gauge consisted of a glass tube closed at the upper, and open at
                        the lower end, which passed steam tight into a reservoir for mercury: when
                        this reservoir was connected with the boiler the pressure of the steam
                        raised the mercury into the gauge tube, compressing the air which the tube
                        contained. The first mercurial gauge which was made, was broken by a sudden
                        access of sur charged steam, in the experiments upon that subject, and was
                        replaced by a second one. The method of graduation, and in general the
                        description of the second gauge, will serve also for the first; the details,
                        only varied slightly.</p>
                    <p>The glass gauge tube was 26.43 inches in length. To the lower end was
                        connected an iron ferule, terminated above by a projecting ring. This ring
                        was pressed upon the upper end of the pipe A, by a coupling screw, which
                        served to form a tight juncture between the gauge and the cistern. The
                        cistern <hi rend="italic">i</hi> was a cylindrical vessel of cast iron,
                        having the two projecting tubes <hi rend="italic">h</hi> and <hi
                        rend="italic">k,</hi> upon which screws were cut: the first of them has been
                        alluded to as giving a passage to the glass tube of the gauge; the second
                        was coupled, by the pipe <hi rend="italic">f g,</hi> to the boiler.</p>
                    <p>The gauge tube was not of precisely equal diameter throughout, and it was
                        judged more accurate to graduate small portions of it into equal volumes.
                        This was done by introducing equal measures of air from the point of a
                        sliding-rod gas measure (Hare’s); this operation was performed repeatedly,
                        and by multiple measures, to verify the results, until the marks made for
                        the equal volumes, on a paper scale attached to the tube, coincided, in the
                        various trials. The lengths of the spaces occupied by the equal volumes were
                        then carefully measured upon the brass scale to be used with the gauge. The
                        slight differences between the lengths given by adjacent parts of the tube,
                        showed that it might be considered as divided into so many small portions of
                        uniform diameter. The mercury rising into the gauge tube from the cistern
                        when pressure is applied, the level of the cistern is necessarily depressed;
                        the amount of the correction for this depends upon the relation between the
                        areas of the cistern and tube, supposed uniform. The areas of the cistern
                        were found to be, within the limits of its use, sensibly the same; those of
                        the tube might be so assumed for such a purpose: the ratio was therefore
                        found by filling the gauge tube with mercury, and pouring this into the
                        cistern, noting the rise produced; comparing this with the mean length of of
                        the tube, the ratio of depression in the gauge for elevation in the tube was
                        found to be as .01 to 1. The air within the tube was next carefully dried by
                        the introduction of a receptacle of chloride of calcium, of the same length
                        with the tube; the air having been in contact with this substance for a
                        sufficient time, the receptacle was withdrawn through the mercury over which
                        the drying had been effected; the tube was next placed over a dish of
                        mercury, in the receiver of an air-pump, and the air withdrawn, until, on
                        readmitting air to the receiver, the mercury rose in the tube above the iron
                        ferule.</p>
                    <p>The gauge tube was next introduced into the cistern, the level of which,
                        corresponding to the zero of the brass scale was then arranged, and the
                        point of the scale at which the mercury stood was ascertained, the barometer
                        and thermometer being noted.</p>
                    <p>It was intended in the experiments to keep the pipe from the gauge to the
                        boiler cool, so that it might contain water, and thus give a nearly constant
                        pressure upon the mercury of the cistern, besides preventing the exposure of
                        the apparatus to heat; the height of this column, above the level of the
                        cisteern, was therefore ascertained, after the gauge was put in its place by
                        screwing the cistern i to the stand.</p>
                    <p>All the elements for calculating the elasticity of the steam within the
                        boiler, from the height of the mercury of the gauge, were thus known; the
                        temperature of the apparatus being supposed constant.</p>
                    <p>The elastic force of the steam within the boiler, together with the column of
                        water in the steam-pipe, balances the elasticity of the compressed air
                        within the guage, together with the column of mercury above the level of
                        that in the cistern. This level is not the original zero, but lower than
                        that, by the depression produced by the rise of mercury in the gauge tube.
                        The depression of the mercury changes the level above which the pressure of
                        the column of water in the steam-pipe is measured, but the change in the
                        pressure, by the column of water, is altogether inconsiderable. The law of
                        the elastic force of dry air, which has been recently shown, by Dulong and
                        Arago, to be accurate, at pressures from one to fifty atmospheres, was made
                        use of in determining the elasticity of the air in the gauge: this
                        elasticity is inversely as the space occupied by the air. From the data
                        already obtained, and upon the principles just stated, a table was
                        calculated, by which the observed heights of the gauge were converted into
                        the corresponding pressures in inches of mercury or in atmospheres. The
                        calculations were rendered rather tedious by the unequal diameter of the
                        bore of the tube, on ac count of which equal lengths did not correspond to
                        equal volumes. The usual method of calculation was resorted to, namely, to
                        determine, by rigid calculation, the pres sures, for points sufficiently
                        near each other, and then to interpolate for intermediate heights.</p>
                    <p>The foregoing remarks take for granted that the temperature of the air in the
                        gauge, as well as that of the mercury, remains constant; to secure this, an
                        arrangement was adopted similar to that employed by Dulong and Arago for the
                        same purpose. The gauge and scale were surrounded by a glass tube <hi
                        rend="italic">l,</hi> cemented below into a brass cap <hi rend="italic"
                        >m,</hi> which had an opening in the side, communicating with a discharge
                        pipe n, fig. 21. The tube was attached above, by an airtight juncture, to a
                        tin vessel P, of considerable capacity, compared with the tube. Water being
                        introduced into the glass tube surrounding the gauge, the flow through this
                        tube was regulated by a stopcock o, placed at the end of the dis charge
                        pipe, the cistern above being filled with water.</p>
                    <p>To ascertain the temperature of the column of water<pb break="no"
                        facs="ht:chi.28490924&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=670" xml:id="kp-eb0720-0670-0590"
                        /> surrounding the gauge, a thermometer <hi rend="italic">(p,</hi> fig. 22)
                        with a very small bulb, was attached to the scale at the middle of its
                        height: by this instrument, the flow of water through the casing of the
                        gauge was regulated so as to keep the temperature nearly constant, and any
                        deviations from a constant temperature were ascertained and noted, that the
                        proper correction might be applied. The correction for the expansion of the
                        air in the gauge, by a rise in its temperature during the progress of the
                        experiments, was made according to the rules furnished by the rate of
                        expansion of the gases, as determined by Gay Lussac, extended to compressed
                        air by the experiments of Davy. The correction for the changes of height of
                        the mercurial column, within the range to which the temperature was suffered
                        to increase, could not have been appreciable if acting entirely, and the
                        counteracting effect of the expansion of the glass further justified its
                        being neglected. For similar reasons no reference was made to the effects of
                        heat on the mercury in the cistern i, on the cistern itself, and on the
                        water within the pipe communicating with the boiler.</p>
                    <p>In most of the researches of the committee, refinements in the mode of using
                        the common thermometer would have been out of place. Results which might be
                        obtained with little additional labour, and which would be interesting in
                        both a practical and scientific point of view, were not to be neglected, and
                        to some of them great accuracy was essential. In the questions of the first
                        class, the thermometers were provided with wooden scales, and were graduated
                        by immersion up to the point at which the scale commenced, the scale and
                        upper part of the tube being exposed to the air: this was proper, as they
                        were intended to be immersed in mercury nearly up to the scale. These
                        instruments were examined after coming from the maker’s hands, and the
                        instrumental error ascertained. The tubes in which the thermometers were
                        placed, and which contained mercury, were at first placed horizontally in
                        one of the ends of the boiler; this had the advantage of rendering the tube
                        for indicating the temperature of the water entirely independent of the
                        steam, and thus any difference between the temperature of one and the other
                        might be more effectually ascertained, than when the tube giving the
                        temperature of the water passed through the steam. The position of these
                        instruments interfered so much with other parts of the apparatus, and so
                        much in convenience and danger of error was experienced from the separation
                        of the column of mercury in the thermo meter, that these tubes were not used
                        after the first weeks of experiment, and two vertical tubes, placed as
                        already shown, were substituted for them.</p>
                    <p>The thermometers used, when the relation between the temperature of the steam
                        and water, and the elasticity of the steam were to be observed in
                        conjunction with some of the subjects more directly under the cognizance of
                        the committee, had much pains bestowed upon them.</p>
                    <p>The scales (M and N,) were metallic, and surrounded by glass tubes, fitting
                        into a cup <hi rend="italic">a',</hi> through the bottom of which the stem
                        of the thermometer passed water tight; a pipe <hi rend="italic">b' c,
                        fig.</hi> 20, from the side of each cup, and provided with a stopcock <hi
                        rend="italic">d,</hi> regulated the flow of water through the enveloping
                        tubes: a tight connexion above with a reservoir (O) served, as in the case
                        of the gauge, to supply the tubes with water. Small thermo meters on the
                        back of the scale of the large ones, showed the temperature of the water
                        which surrounded them. The enveloping tubes being filled with water at 60°,
                        the position of the boiling point of water and of the fusing point of tin,
                        were used to verify the accuracy of graduation. The latter point, which is
                        high upon the scale of the thermomoter, having been very accurately
                        determined, and being easily and with certainty ascertainable, serves as an
                        excellent check upon the graduation. The greatest error within the limits
                        just stated, was in one instrument, three-fourths of a degree, and in the
                        other one degree of Fahrenheit. The scales were graduated from two to two
                        degrees, one quarter of a degree being readily estimated upon them. The
                        corrections required by this examination were made through the medium of a
                        table prepared for the purpose. In order to call the attention to the
                        temperature of the water sur rounding the scales, this temperature was
                        recorded from time to lime, when the height of the thermometers was
                        observed, At no time did the rise of temperature, permitted in the water,
                        make it necessary to apply a correction for the expansion of the scale. None
                        was required for the cooling effect of the water around the stem upon the
                        mercury, owing to the method of verifying the scale.</p>
                    <p>The other parts of the apparatus, less general in their use, as the
                        water-gauge, safety-valve, fusible plate appa ratus, &amp;c., will be more
                        conveniently described in connexion with the experiments for which they were
                        devised.”</p>
                    <p>34. With this apparatus, and these precautions, a series of experiments were
                        made, the results of which are contained in the following tables :—</p>

                    <p>of the air in the gauge; its volume at the observed temperature; the volume
                        reduced to 48°, the temperature of graduation of the gauge at which the
                        column of mercury, equivalent to an atmosphere, is very nearly 30 inches;
                        the elasticity of the compressed air, in inches of mercury; the correction
                        in the height of the column of mercury, for the depression produced in the
                        cistern below; the height thus corrected: the height, after subtracting the
                        sensibly constant number for the column of water be tween the level of the
                        steam-pipe from the boiler and the cistern of the gauge; the total
                        elasticity in inches of mercury; the elasticity in atmospheres. The first
                        line of numbers in the table is merely introduced for the convenience of
                        presenting certain data required for subsequent calculation; it gives the
                        height of the mercury in the gauge before beginning the observations, after
                        correcting for the height of the barometer.</p>
                    <p>A curve traced to represent these observations, the ordinates representing
                        the pressures, and the abscissae the temperatures, is quite regular, until
                        the temperature cor responding to eight atmospheres is attained, when it
                        rises abruptly. This fact was explained, by examining the gauge; it was
                        found that the cement us&lt; d in attaching the glass tube to its ferule had
                        become softened, and had permitted the tube to rise. This defect was
                        remedied and its recurrence prevented. It was then determined to repeat the
                        entire series of observations, and to carry them as high as could be done,
                        with reasonable convenience, aiming particularly, to embrace the range of
                        working, pressures of the American engines.</p>
                    <p>The results are contained in the following table in which the observed data,
                        and calculated numbers, are arranged as in the last table. This table
                        extends to 9∙91 atmospheres, and to the temperature of 352° Fahrenheit.</p>
                    <p>Care was taken that the elasticities were increased not too rapidly, and the
                        last numbers obtained, were verified by keeping the temperature sensibly
                        constant for a considerable time.</p>

                    <p>To compare our results with those given by the committee of the French
                        Academy, we have traced a curve, from the above table, and another from
                        those of the thirty observations, selected by the committee of the Academy,
                        from their experiments which are below ten atmospheres. The curve of our
                        observations, passes at low pressures nearer to the line AB than that of the
                        French experimenters, and after coinciding at the medium pressures of the
                        table, crosses the latter, differing at 10 atmospheres 5 degrees, or at 352½
                        degrees .65 of an atmosphere.</p>
                    <p>The difference here noticed is too considerable to be admitted as within the
                        limits of errors in the apparatus or in observation. Having an authority of
                        so much weight against them, the committee have been driven to examine their
                        results very closely. The care employed in the graduation of the gauge seems
                        to exclude the idea of error from it; the upper portion of the scale was
                        divided to .05 of an inch, and could easily be read to half of that
                        distance, making about .1 of an atmosphere at the highest pressure attained.
                        A specific correction for capillarity was ascertained and employed. In one
                        point of manipulation, namely, the method employed to dry the air, the
                        committee differed from what was usual, and though they think there is
                        reason to confide in that method, they have examined what effect would be
                        produced if air were saturated with moisture. Recent experiments on the
                        passage of gases, out and into vessels placed over mercury, and observations
                        connected with them, warrant, moreover, a suspicion, that dry air standing
                        in a glass vessel over mercury, the surface of which is covered by water,
                        may become impregnated with vapour. The effect of such a source of error
                        they have calculated in the highest and lowest results of table No. II. and
                        find it to be as follows :—</p>
                    <p>For 248¼° the tension of the vapour is 1.96 instead of 1.97, and 352 „ 9.78 „
                        9.91.</p>
                    <p>Differing from the numbers given in table No. II. by .01 and . 13 of an
                        atmosphere.</p>
                    <p>This supposition is thus shown to be inadequate to explain the discordance,
                        and must, in fact, be deemed, to a certain extent, gratuitous.</p>
                    <p>The committee have next compared the results furnished by the safety-valves
                        graduated independently of the gauge, and these, as has already been shown,
                        gave calculated pressures four per cent and ten per cent higher than the
                        pressures indicated by the gauge. From these independent experimental data
                        we have then an evidence that our results are, probably, not too high."</p>

                    <head>SECT. III. ON THE MATHEMATICAL LAW WHICH CONNECTS THE ELASTIC FORCE OP
                        VAPOUR WITH ITS TEMPERATURE.</head>
                    <p>*35. An inference which may be drawn from all these experiments is, that
                        Nature seems to affect a certain law in the dilatation of aeriform fluids by
                        heat. They seem to be dilatable nearly in the proportion of their present
                        dilatation. For, if we suppose the vapours to resemble air in having their
                        elasticity in any given temperature proportional to their density, we must
                        suppose that if steam of the elasticity 60, that is, under a pressure of 60
                        inches of mercury, were subjected to a pressure of 30 inches, it would
                        expand into twice its present bulk. The augmentation of elasticity,
                        therefore, is the measure of the bulk into which it would expand, in order
                        to acquire its former elasticity. Taking the increase of elasticity, as a
                        measure of the bulk into which it would expand under one constant pressure,
                        we see that equal increments of temperature produce nearly equal multi
                        plications of bulk. Thus, if a certain diminution of temperature, diminishes
                        the bulk of steam ½, another equal diminution will very nearly diminish this
                        new bulk ½. Thus, in our experiments (Art. 25), <hi rend="italic">the
                        temperatures being in arithmetical progression, having equal differences, we
                        see that the corresponding elasticities are very nearly in the continued
                        proportion of</hi> 1 to 2, <hi rend="italic">thus:</hi></p>

                    <p>Now, although extreme temperatures differ considerably from this law, still
                        we see that there is a considerable approximation to it; and it will
                        frequently assist us, to recollect that within these limits an increase of
                        30° of temperature nearly doubles the elasticity and bulk of watery
                        vapour.</p>
                    <p>This law obtains exactly in air and other gases, all of which are subject to
                        the Boylean law, or law of Marriotte, as it is called, and have their
                        elasticity proportional to their bulk inversely. If the bulk were always
                        augmented in the same proportion by equal augmentations of temperature, the
                        elasticities would be accurately represented by the ordinates of a
                        logarithmic curve, of which the temperatures are the corresponding
                        abscissae; and we might contrive such a scale for our thermometer, that the
                        temperatures would be the common logarithms of the elasticities, or of the
                        bulks having equal elasticity; or, with our present scale, we may find such
                        a multiplier <hi rend="italic">m,</hi> for the number <hi rend="italic"
                        >t</hi> degrees of our thermometer (above the temperature where the
                        elasticity is equal to unity), that this multiple shall be the common
                        logarithm of the elasticity F; so that</p>

                    <p>36. As Dr Dalton was one of the earliest to investigate the properties of
                        steam by well-contrived experiment, he has likewise been the most successful
                        in obtaining pro found and accurate views of those general relations which
                        connect this with coordinate branches of physical know ledge. His
                        experimental researches have been the model of imitation to all subsequent
                        investigators. His apparatus was simple, his artifices were highly refined,
                        and his processes elegant and precise; and, consequently, the results of his
                        labour were immediately transferred to the works of highest philosophical
                        character on the Contiuent and at home, and became part of the staple of
                        accurate science. But his philosophical views were not so readily and widely
                        received, and the fault lay, in part, with their author himself. He had
                        overreached the ex<pb break="no"
                        facs="ht:chi.28490924&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=673" xml:id="kp-eb0720-0673-0593"
                        />isting condition of the other branches of contemporaneous science; and in
                        taking for granted the accuracy of the existing state of knowledge, he
                        proceeded to raise a theoretical structure on ground not yet sufficiently
                        ascertained and determined. The result has been, as might have been
                        anticipated, that now, when the progress of accurate knowledge has altered
                        the conditions on which his system was based, his theory, becoming
                        inapplicable to the facts, has been thrown aside, and, instead of having
                        been modified, as it ought to have been, in conformity with the ad vancement
                        of science, it has been hastily abandoned or undeservedly neglected.</p>
                    <p>From an extensive and laborious review of all that has since been added to
                        the stores of our experimental facts on the properties of vapour, we have
                        been conducted to this conclusion, that of all the views that have been
                        taken of the constitution and laws of vapour, Dr Dalton’s are those from
                        which we may gain the clearest and most adequate conceptions; and therefore
                        we have undertaken the task of reviewing the subject, and of making those
                        changes and modifications which are now required to represent with fidelity
                        and precision the advanced state of our know ledge.</p>
                    <p>If we examine any series of even the earlier experiments on the vapour of
                        water (such as those in Art. 27), we cannot fail to recognise a certain
                        d2gree of regularity in the progress of the increasing force of the vapour
                        as the temperature is successively augmented. At the temperature of freezing
                        water, the force of its vapour being taken at two-tenths of an inch, we see
                        that it becomes more than <hi rend="italic">doubled</hi> by raising the
                        temperature 22½°: this again is rather more than <hi rend="italic"
                        >doubled</hi> at 22½° of additional heat; and this is again exactly <hi
                        rend="italic">doubled</hi> by a third addition of 22½°. But another addition
                        of 22½° of heat scarcely doubles the pressure; and 22½° more fall still
                        further short of producing that effect; so that, while the increase of the
                        force of the steam takes place rapidly, with equal additions of heat, the
                        rapidity of the increase does not maintain a constant proportion, but slowly
                        diminishes as the temperature ascends. This will be plainer in the following

                    <p>From this simple collocation of results, a principle of progression is
                        manifested. The number of degrees in the first column increases at each step
                        by 22½ degrees, and the number in the second column on the same line is
                        nearly doubled every step. At first, as the third column shows, it is more
                        than doubled by <hi rend="superscript"> 17</hi> / <hi rend="subscript">
                        100</hi> next time it is more than doubled by <hi rend="superscript"> 9</hi>
                        / <hi rend="subscript"> 100</hi>, and next it is doubled exactly; after
                        this, however, it falls <hi rend="superscript"> 8</hi> / <hi
                        rend="subscript"> 100</hi> short of being doubled, next time by twice that
                        quantity, and so on, till we find at last that it falls short of doubling
                        every time by about 8 or 9 hundredths for every 11½ degrees. Although,
                        therefore, we may at first be disappointed in finding that the reduplication
                        does not proceed with the regularity of a law of na ture, still it is
                        satisfactory to know that the deviation from this progression is itself the
                        subject of a tolerably simple law, so as to enable us to predict, with some
                        measure of accuracy, what would take place if we were to add another
                        increment of 22½ degrees. We should then diminish the number in the third
                        column by <hi rend="superscript"> 9</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"> 100</hi>,
                        and by doubling the pressure, and having regard to this diminution from the
                        preceding numbers, 2— <hi rend="superscript"> 41</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"
                        > 100</hi> we should have at</p>
                    <p>234½° 45.00 2.— <hi rend="superscript">50</hi>∕<hi rend="subscript"> 200</hi>
                        —9</p>
                    <p>And again at</p>
                    <p>257 63.90 2.<hi rend="superscript">58</hi>∕<hi rend="subscript"
                        >100</hi>—8</p>
                    <p>It was in this way that Dr Dalton examined his experiments, and proceeded to
                        form his tables, so as to include not only those points which he had already
                        examined by experiment, but to fill up the vacancies, and extend them beyond
                        the range which his actual observation had reach ed. He thus completed the
                        table which we have already given. This was much more accurate than any
                        previous table, and, being more extensive, formed a valuable addition to our
                        knowledge.</p>
                    <p>This simple method of interpolation by which Dr Dalton constructed his table,
                        although it suited perfectly, the limited object which he at that time had
                        in view, and coincided with the limited range of his observations, was not
                        of a sufficiently general description to stretch far beyond that sphere. It
                        is obvious, that if his progression were continued much further, it would
                        come to an end of itself; because the constant diminution of the proportion
                        in the third column would bring it down to nothing, and so the march of the
                        method would close and retrograde, and would thus bring the method of the
                        formation into opposition with the march of the fact, for the force of the
                        vapour continues to increase. Dr Dalton was himself the first to recognise
                        the limited applicability of his method of interpolation to wide ranges of
                        temperature; and, accordingly, in his lectures on heat, delivered at
                        Edinburgh and Glasgow in 1807, and in his <hi rend="italic">New System of
                        Chemistry,</hi> published 1808, he developed those larger and more matured
                        views which had grown up in his mind during a longer and more thorough
                        investigation of the subject.</p>
                    <p>It does not belong to this article to consider the nature, and decide on the
                        merits of Dr Dalton’s theory of temperature; nor is a perfect acquaintance
                        with that theory of any further use in understanding his views of the
                        constitution of vapour, than to enable us to perceive how he was led from
                        the former to the latter. For the validity of his views regarding steam, it
                        is indeed of no consequence whether the theory of temperature from which it
                        was originally deduced, be true or erroneous. The general laws which he has
                        determined for elastic vapours, form the well-settled foundation on which
                        any theory of temperature, true or false, must in some measure ultimately
                        rest.</p>
                    <p>The only circumstances in regard to temperature which it is proper to keep in
                        view, are these: that the present thermometer used to indicate temperature
                        is not to be regarded as an exact measure of the <hi rend="italic"
                        >quantity</hi> of heat producing that temperature. This is shown from the
                        circumstance, that the same quantity of fuel which heats water 10° from 180°
                        to 190°, will not heat it from 80° to 90°, an equal interval. From
                        considerations of this nature it was evident that the divisions of the
                        common scale were too large near the bottom, and too small in the higher
                        portions; and Dr Dalton evinced this difference to be so great, that 72° of
                        the common scale below the freezing point of water down to the freezing
                        point of mercury, were to be reckoned as equivalent to as many as 207° of
                        Dalton’s scale. Proceeding on this view, it was necessary to find the ratio
                        of these two series of indications, the indications of Dalton’s and of
                        Fahrenheit’s scale; and he accordingly found that the progression of
                        Fahrenheit’s scale was in a high geometrical proportion to the increments of
                        true temperature of the new one. On this principle he proceeded to construct
                        his new scale of temperature—of which the following is a specimen.</p>

                    <p>By this new scale of temperature it was found that many of the apparent
                        anomalies in the effects of heat were resolved, and the complex relations of
                        its phenomena rendered very simple. Amongst others, the most important were
                        the phenomena of vapours, as it was found that, on the new scale of
                        temperature, the elastic force of different vapours increased almost exactly
                        in a uniform ratio to equal increments of heat.</p>
                    <p>But the further progress of experimental science soon raised up serious
                        grounds of objection to this view. It was found that Dr Dalton had rated the
                        inaccuracies of the present scale somewhat too high. His results were thus
                        rendered inapplicable to the advanced state of some branches of thermal
                        science; and his theory, instead of being modified and improved, was first
                        hastily discredited and then summarily dismissed. Unable to follow the
                        theory to its whole extent, it was abandoned even when it had furnished a
                        safe guide thoroughly to explicate the intricacies of obscure truth.</p>
                    <p>It is now, therefore, necessary to examine the views of those who have
                        endeavoured to form adequate representations of the mathematical law which
                        connects the elastic force of vapour with its temperature. We shall first of
                        all examine the methods and views which they have adopted, and then consider
                        whether there may not be deduced from the clear theoretical views of Dr
                        Dalton, tested and modified by the results of modern experiment,
                        mathematical expressions of a character, at once less empirical, and more
                        closely in accordance with observed phenomena.</p>
                    <p>37. M. de Prony was the first to represent, by a purely empirical formula,
                        the law which governs the relation between the temperature and the
                        elasticity of aqueous vapour. It was derived by him, in 1796, from the
                        experiments of M. de Betancourt, and constructed according to a method of
                        interpolation, which he afterwards presented to the Academy of Sciences, and
                        which they have placed among the <hi rend="italic">Mémoires des Savans

                        have not been observed in re cent experiments, and may therefore be deemed
                        anomalies of the formulae themselves rather than the legitimate results of
                        the experiments they were intended to represent. The formulae are, besides,
                        much too operose to be useful.</p>
                    <p>38. The experiments of Dr Dalton are adopted by La place in the fourth volume
                        of the <hi rend="italic">Méchanique Céleste,</hi> where we find him applying
                        them to the calculation of the influence of the aqueous vapour of the
                        atmosphere upon astronomical refractions. As an empirical formula agreeing
                        sufficiently with Dr Dalton’s experiments, he adopted the following
                        approximation :—</p>

                        represent, from 0° to 100° centigrade, but are found inaccurate above and
                        below these points.</p>
                    <p>39. M. Biot, adopting still the methods and experiments of Dr Dalton, found
                        it necessary to modify the formula in order to obtain a closer approximation
                        to truth. Using the notation in which we hare expressed Dr Dalton’s method
                        of calculation, Biot considers <hi rend="italic">fn</hi><hi rend="italic

                    <p>The application of this formula is laborious. It is of exactly the same
                        nature with that of Laplace and Biot, and only represents the observations
                        of Dr Ure within their narrow limits; extended to higher temperatures, it
                        seems to deviate considerably from the truth, as may be seen from our table

                    <p>41. Schmidt and Soldner, reviewing Dr Dalton’s experiments, have each
                        constructed a formula to represent them:</p>

                    <p>Soldner’s formula is—</p>

                    <p>42. In the <hi rend="italic">Edinburgh Journal of Science</hi> for 1829, Mr
                        Tregaskis has given a theorem, which furnishes a rough approximation to
                        experiment. It is this: that <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> / <hi
                        rend="subscript"> 5</hi> of the temperature above 32°, added to vapour, will
                        double its elasticity.</p>
                    <p>43. M. Roche, Professor of Mathematics at Toulon, sent to the Academy of
                        Sciences, in 1828, a memoir on this subject, in which he proposes a formula,
                        deduced from general principles. This formula is—</p>
                    <p><hi rend="superscript"> F</hi> =’“ + <hi rend="superscript"> ,0</hi> π⅛5i
                        ,∙∙∙∙ <hi rend="superscript"> h</hi> ∙</p>
                    <p>This formula agrees closely with the French experiments.</p>
                    <p>44. Dr Thomas Young invented a species of formula entirely new. Abandoning
                        altogether the formula in which one of the variables is involved as an
                        exponent, and abandoning altogether the views from which formulae of this
                        kind had been derived, he assumed an expression which is apparently
                        perfectly arbitrary, and which has been adapted empirically to the
                        experiments of Dr Dalton. It is this:</p>
                    <p>F = (1 + 0.0029.1) <hi rend="superscript"> 7</hi> 1.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic">t</hi> being reckoned above 212 Fahr, and F being the force
                        in inches of mercury. Hence we get inversely;</p>
                    <p>,_ <hi rend="underline">F)l</hi></p>
                    <p>.0029</p>
                    <p>For very small changes of temperature, Dr Young’s formula becomes t = 1.642e
                        <hi rend="italic">e</hi> being the corresponding slight variation of
                        pressure from 30 inches, which corresponds, within three-thousandth parts,
                        with the mean between Deluc’s correction 1.598, and Shuckburg’s 1.70, or
                        1.645 <hi rend="italic">e</hi>.</p>
                    <p>Notwithstanding the simplicity of the form of this expression, and the
                        facilities which it presents for ready calculation, it is impossible to
                        adopt it, as it deviates widely and rapidly from the results of observation
                        when extended to high temperatures. Induced, however, by the simplicity of
                        the expression, and not a little influenced, it may be, by the high
                        authority of a name that will ever be distinguished among the most
                        distinguished of those who have contributed immortal truths to the treasures
                        of physical science, the example of Dr Young has drawn after it many
                        followers. Southern, Creighton, Coriolis, Tredgold, Arago, and Dulong, have
                        successively attempted to modify the formula of Young, so as to twist it
                        into some measure of conformity with observed phenomena—we shall see with
                        how little success.</p>
                    <p>45. Mr Creighton adopted a similar formula to repre sent Ure’s experiments,
                        only changing the constant expon ent from 7 to 6; so that, making F the
                        force of steam in inches of mercury—0.09, and the temperature of Fahrenheit
                        (85° = <hi rend="italic">t</hi>, we have</p>

                    <p>46. Mr Southern represented his experiments by the formula p_(£+5L3)^_ <hi
                        rend="subscript"> + Oi</hi> i L.</p>
                    <p>87344.000000.</p>

                    <p>Log. (1.1 F) = 5.13 Log. (Z+51.3)10.94123</p>

                    <p>5.13</p>
                    <p>47. Mr Tredgold simply reinstated Creighton’s expo nent, altering the
                        coefficient to bring it nearer to those experiments with which he was
                        acquainted when his work was written; but it is inaccurate at high
                        temperatures, and like that of Creighton.</p>
                    <p>κw «·</p>
                    <p>48. To adapt the formula to more recent experiments, M. Coriolis (in his work
                        <hi rend="italic">Du Calcul de l’Effet des Machines,</hi> 4to, 1829) changed
                        the exponent to 5.355, making it in French measures, <hi rend="subscript">

                    <p>52. From his earlier experiments Dr Dalton constructed a scale of true
                        temperature, in which the point of freezing mercury is placed at 175°, and
                        in the method he there adopts, the increments of the scale of true
                        temperature are as the square roots of the corresponding expansions of the
                        mercury from its point of maximum density. This scale was soon made the
                        subject of a close experimental scrutiny by Messrs Dulong and Petit, and
                        afterwards of less accurate, though more acrimonious, strictures by Dr
                        Ure.</p>
                    <p>This scale was, in fact, slightly inaccurate, because it was founded on the
                        comparatively incorrect data of the experimental physics of that date. It
                        is, however, scarcely fair to institute a comparison between the results of
                        a theory based on certain phenomena and the results of experiments which the
                        improvement of our knowledge has entirely altered. It were less unjust to
                        the theory, and more wise as regards the interest of philosophy, first to
                        examine how far it would have been modified by recent discoveries and then
                        to compare its results with the legitimate consequences of the data on which
                        it rests. It ought also to be recorded, that Dr Dalton published, in the
                        third part of his <hi rend="italic">Chemical Philosophy</hi> in 1827, the
                        corrected experimental results to which he had been conducted by the
                        improved methods of observation, and the increased experience of thirty
                        years which had elapsed from his first experiments, while modern writers
                        continue to use the old numbers which should have been altogether
                        discarded.</p>
                    <p>Adopting, then, Dr Dalton’s recent experiments below the point of ebullition
                        of water, and the experiments of the French and American Institutes above
                        that point to 24. atmospheres, let us see what theory the views of Dr Dalton
                        would conduct us to, setting out from these improved data.</p>
                    <p>Now, Dr Dalton found that, in his experiments, a certain progression of
                        temperatures was accompanied by a certain progression of elastic force; but
                        his range of experiment being too small, he adopted an erroneous
                        progression, by which, reckoning this progression as rising from the
                        freezing point of mercury, and proceeding as the square roots of the equal
                        expansions of mercury above that point, gave 175° as the point corresponding
                        to the zero of the scale and the origin of his progression.</p>
                    <p>53. In examining this subject again, I have found that this gradation of
                        temperatures, though not exact in truth, is analogous to one which may be
                        deduced from the best experiments—and equally from Dr Dalton’s and those of
                        the French Academy. The law at which I have arrived is this—that if we
                        reckon the temperatures from the point of congelation of mercury in a
                        logarithmic series, the elastic force of steam forms a similar <hi
                        rend="italic">geometric</hi> series to these intervals of temperature. This
                        would indicate that equal intervals of temperature are those which expand
                        the substance of the thermometer through equal fractional parts of its bulk,
                        instead of equi-differential parts as at present, so that, instead of the
                        common arithmetical series as at present, viz.,</p>
                    <p>C + rf+2 rf+3 rf+4 rf+ <hi rend="italic">nd «</hi> we should have the
                        temperatures represented by the geo metrical series</p>

                    <p>From the combination of Dr Dalton’s experiments below 30 inches, with the

                    <p>333°</p>
                    <p>It is from equation S and equation T that we have constructed the large table
                        (Art. 56) in which the results of these formulae are compared with
                        experiment; the formula for high-pressure steam being compared with the mean
                        of the French and American experiments; but, as they do not extend below
                        212°, that part is compared with Dr Dalton’s table. The coincidence of these
                        formulae with experiment turns out to be much closer than could possibly
                        have been expected where the discrepancies of experiments from each other
                        are so great. The experiments of Dr Ure deviate from those of Dr Dalton,
                        below the pressure of the atmosphere, as much as .33, and the greatest
                        deviation of the formulae is .08. At pressures above the atmosphere the
                        maximum deviation in the first ten atmospheres between the French and
                        American experiments amounts to 6.4°, while the maximum deviation of the
                        formulae is only 1.1°.—</p>
                    <p>It is, however, remarkable, that in all the experiments hitherto made, the
                        law of elasticity below the atmospheric pressure appears to deviate
                        considerably from that above the atmosphere—perhaps it may arise from the
                        circum stance that the experiments below atmospheric pressure have been made
                        with different apparatus, having errors of a different kind from those made
                        at high pressures above the atmosphere.</p>
                    <p>From these equations we easily deduce the following formulae in a shape
                        convenient for calculation.</p>

                    <p>55. The formulae thus given are in such perfect accor dance with our best
                        experimental knowledge, that we can not withhold our assent from the
                        correctness of the principles from which they have been deduced. At the same
                        time, we desiderate very much a better series of experiments than we yet
                        possess, as the range of doubtful temperature above 212° is far wider than
                        the present perfect state of experimental science, and our improved means of
                        observing, can at all warrant. The discrepancies between the experiments
                        above and below 212° show, that the two series should if possible be
                        performed with identical apparatus.</p>
                    <p>The formulae we have obtained have been founded on the <hi rend="italic"
                        >hypothesis, that bodies expand nearly equal proportions of bulk in equal
                        intervals of true temperature; and we have found that the elastic force of
                        steam increases in equal proportions, from equal increments of temperature,
                        reckoned in true intervals from the bottom of the scale.</hi></p>
                    <p>Our formula should, however, be capable of being reduced into a form closely
                        resembling those which have preceded it, in so far as these have represented
                        approximately the experiments they were made to represent; thus the formula
                        of Laplace and his followers is of the form F <hi rend="italic">— Q m t</hi>

                    <p>So, in like manner, we should obtain from Equation T the following; <hi

                    <p>— log. C — log. (1.11401) log. F = 0 which is easily presented in a form
                        absolutely the same.</p>
                    <p>In like manner, it may be presented at once in the form adopted by Dr Thomas
                        Young and all his followers, viz.</p>
                    <p>for, if we take our formula S <hi rend="subscript"> 9</hi></p>
                    <p>Log. F=7.71307 (log. <hi rend="italic">t—</hi> 2.587711) we get, resuming the
                        natural number,</p>

                        rend="subscript"> Ss</hi>.</p>

                    <p>Or, if we take formula T <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>, we get <hi
                        rend="subscript"> F =</hi> /£±W*’ T <hi rend="subscript"> s</hi>.</p>
                    <p>V 333 <hi rend="italic">J</hi><hi rend="italic superscript"> 3</hi></p>
                    <p>We thus find, that the old formulae have all approximated in a greater or
                        less degree to the representation of<pb break="no"
                        facs="ht:chi.28490924&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=679" xml:id="kp-eb0720-0679-0599"
                        /> the very hypothesis on which ours has now been formed. They thus add
                        greatly to the probability of its truth.</p>
                    <p>We do not, however, mean to assert, that the zero of the mercurial
                        thermometer is absolutely at 175° or 121° below the present 0. or that the
                        progression of the temperatures has been fixed accurately for mercury or for
                        vapour. On the contrary, we have seen that the discrepancies of the results
                        obtained by different physical experimenters are great, and do not admit of
                        obtaining unchangeable numerical indices of progression, either of the
                        temperatures or the corresponding elastic force. The existence of these two
                        progressions, and their character, has, we think, been established, and our
                        research has the effect of confirming, the profound views of Dr Dalton,
                        which have, we think, been ill understood and insufficiently
                        appreciated.</p>

                    <head>SECTION IV. ON THE CONSTITUTIONAL CALORIC OF STEAM, ITS DENSITY AND VOLUME
                        AT DIFFERENT TEMPERATURES, AND ITS GENERATION AND CONDENSATION.</head>
                    <p>57. Having now ascertained the force that may he given to steam by heating
                        water in a confined space, so that we can always obtain any force we desire
                        by raising it to the proper temperature, we have next to enquire what
                        quantity of heat is necessary to produce steam of that temperature and
                        force. The answer to this question is, to determine the quantity of fuel
                        necessary to generate steam of a given power, and direct the economic
                        application of that power.</p>
                    <p>The quantity of caloric necessary to transform a given quantity of water into
                        steam of the same temperature, is called the <hi rend="italic">caloric of
                        elasticity</hi> of that substance. The quantity of heat which it will
                        contain at any given temperature is called its <hi rend="italic"
                        >capacity</hi> for heat; and the relation which subsists between the
                        quantity of heat which some well known body, such as water or air, gives out
                        or ac quires, in a given change of temperature, and that which any other
                        substance will give out or acquire in the same circumstances, is called the
                        <hi rend="italic">specific caloric</hi> of that sub stance.</p>
                    <p>58. Of the quantity of the caloric of elasticity of any sub stance, of its
                        capacity for containing heat, and of its specific caloric, the <hi
                        rend="italic">thermometer</hi> gives us no information. An instrument for
                        doing so may be called, as a distinction, the <hi rend="italic"
                        >calorimeter.</hi> Thus the thermometer measures the in tensity of heat—the
                        calorimeter its quantity.</p>
                    <p>If in three several vessels there be contained, at the temperature of 32°, a
                        pound weight of three different fluids, water in one, mercury in the second,
                        and oil in the third; and if the heat of an alcohol lamp be applied, first
                        of all to the mercury, then to the water, and next to the oil, a thermometer
                        being inserted in each, it will re quire much longer time to heat the water
                        to 212° of the thermometer than the mercury, twenty-five times as much
                        alcohol being burnt in the process; whereas the oil will be wanned to the
                        same temperature on the thermo meter, by half the quantity of calorie which
                        is necessary to heat the water to 212°. Therefore, the capacity of water for
                        heat is said to be twenty-five times as great as that of mercury, and twice
                        as great as the capacity of oil; and the specific heats of these substances,
                        in relation to water, are thus represented:</p>
                    <p>Water, 1.000; oil, 0.520; mercury, 0.040 nearly.</p>
                    <p>If, instead of taking equal weights of these substances, wo had filled equal
                        vessels with them, and then applied the quantity of water necessary to heat
                        them to equal temperatures, we should have had the capacities and specific
                        heat of equal volumes, instead of equal masses as formerly; and it would
                        have been found, that the quantity of alcohol required to heat them to the
                        same temperature, was only half as much for the mercury as the water, and
                        greater for the water than the oil, in the proportion of 20 to 9; showing
                        that the capacity of water was still the greatest, and that the specific
                        caloric, in equal volumes of these substances, are nearly</p>
                    <p>Water, 1.000; oil, 0.450; mercury, 0.550.</p>
                    <p>The capacities for heat, and the specific caloric of different substances,
                        may be determined by cooling as well as heating them. An ounce of ice thrown
                        upon a pound of mercury will cool it or an equal weight of oil much more
                        than water; and, in general, the quantity of ice, or of cold water, or of
                        cold air, or any other fluid required to cool a body, will exactly
                        correspond to the quantity of caloric required to heat it to the same degree
                        of temperature. A calorimeter measures the quantity of ice which must be
                        melted in cooling different substances, and is de scribed in our article
                        “<hi rend="smallcaps">Ηεατ.”</hi> The following are the results of such of
                        the most valuable experiments upon this subject as are appropriate to our

                        of each at given temperatures, there is another condition of heat still more
                        striking, and of which the thermometer gives no indication. It is this: that
                        the same substance, at different times, may contain different quantities of
                        caloric, and yet the thermometer in both cases give the same indication of
                        temperature. Ice at 32°, which is in the process of melting, and while its
                        bulk is diminishing by one-tenth part, receives as much caloric as would
                        raise its temperature, when melted, to 172°; and after having received it
                        all, remains still at the same temperature as before, indicating 32° on the
                        thermo meter. In like manner, when the particles of the water have acquired
                        so much sensible heat os to raise its temperature to 212°, it may receive as
                        much more heat as would have raised its temperature 950° or 960°, if it had
                        continued to be shown by the thermometer; but the water now assuming the
                        state of steam, the thermometer indicates no accession, but remains in the
                        water or in the steam still at the temperature of 212°. In these two

                    <p>60. The determination of the latent heat of ordinary steam is a problem of
                        considerable practical difficulty. It may be obtained rudely by very simple
                        contrivances. If a lamp, which burns with tolerable uniformity, be applied
                        to a vessel containing cold water, at the temperature of 32°, so long as to
                        heat it to 212°, the boiling point, and if the lamp be then weighed and the
                        consumption of oil ascertained by the loss of weight; and if the lamp be
                        still applied to the boiling water so as to keep it constantly in ebullition
                        until the whole has been converted into steam; the steam passing off at the
                        same temperature as the water, it will be found, when the whole water has
                        been boiled away, or converted into steam, that 6 times as much oil has been
                        consumed, or that 6 times as much heat has been employed in the conversion
                        of the water into steam as was required formerly to heat the water from 32°
                        to 212°, or to give it 180° of temperature; so that 6 times 180° or 1080°,
                        will appear to have been absorbed or carried off in the steam of 212°—that
                        is, the latent heat of steam is 1080°.</p>
                    <p>Otherwise, the same determination may be obtained, if the steam, when passing
                        off from the boiling water, be led carefully in a pipe to a vessel of cold
                        water, so as to take from it the heat which it has thus carried off; if the
                        water to which the heat of the steam is given out be at a temperature of 32°
                        and of 6 times the quantity of the water from which the steam was formed,
                        the whole of it will be heated by the caloric of the steam to 212°, showing
                        that the quantity of caloric of the steam amounts to what gives 180° to 6
                        times the quantity of water; giving, as formerly, 6 times 180° or 1080° as
                        the amount of the latent heat of the steam.</p>
                    <p>It is to Mr Watt that we owe the earliest determination of the latent heat of
                        steam. Dr Black endeavoured to ascertain this point by the first of the
                        methods we have pointed out, by comparing the time of raising the
                        temperature of water a certain number of degrees, with the time of boiling
                        it off a certain number of degrees; but his result was not correct, being
                        only 800° Mr Watt’s result for the latent heat of steam was 1006° 79.</p>
                    <p>Mr Southern’s experiments were made in 1803; and he was assisted in them by
                        Mr William Creighton, and communicated them to Mr Watt for an appendix to
                        this article. He obtained the number 950°. The thermometers employ ed in his
                        experiments were made and graduated with the greatest care, the tubes having
                        been accurately measured as to the proportional capacity of their different
                        parts.</p>
                    <p>A similar series of experiments was afterwards made by M. Schmidt, who
                        determined the heat latent in steam to be about 5.33 times that necessary to
                        heat water from 32° to 212° = 5.33 times 180° or 960 nearly.</p>
                    <p>Count Rumford determined the latent heat of steam by condensing it in a
                        calorimeter formed by pushing a long spiral steam pipe through a vessel of
                        cold water, by which he obtained 1040.8 as the latent heat of steam of
                        water.</p>
                    <p>M. Despretz in the <hi rend="italic">Annales de Chimie et Physique,</hi>
                        gives 955.8° as the result of his experiments on the latent heat of
                        steam.</p>
                    <p>Lavoisier and Laplace make the latent heat of steam 1000. <hi
                        rend="superscript"> o</hi></p>
                    <p>From the experiments of Gay Lussac and of MM. Clement and Desormes, the
                        number 990° is generally used by the French to represent the latent heat of
                        steam. The diversity of the results obtained from experiments made by so
                        many excellent experimenters, with so much precaution, is remarkable—to
                        eliminate from them the precise truth with certainty is not within our
                        present resources of analysis. There is high probability in favour of the
                        numbers 990. or 1000., as representing nearly enough the latent heat of
                        steam, being 5.555 times the caloric of boiling water, its whole caloric
                        reckoned from 32° being 6.666 times that of boiling water.</p>
                    <p>61. A doctrine of great simplicity is now pretty gene rally held as
                        expressing with an accuracy quite within the limits of experimental
                        precision, the result of our knowledge of the heat latent in steam. It is
                        found that in steam of great elasticity and of corresponding high
                        temperature, the heat latent is in quantity less; and that, on the contrary,
                        when steam is of lower elastic force and of lower temperature that at 212°,
                        its latent heat is greater than at 212°. And it appears that we are
                        warranted in the conclusion first suggested by Mr Watt and afterwards by Dr
                        Dalton, that the whole amount of caloric in a given quantity of elastic
                        vapour remains the same at all temperatures and under all pressures. When
                        the volume of the vapour is great the greater is its capacity and the less
                        its temperature; while, by compressing it into smaller space, its elasticity
                        is encreased and its temperature raised. The doctrine is thus expressed, <hi
                        rend="italic">that the sum of the sensible and latent heat of vapour is a
                        constant quantity.</hi> M. Despretz has extended this to the vapours of
                        several other fluids.</p>
                    <p>There is another expression for the law of the constitutional heat of the
                        vapour, which is, in the language of the Atomic Theory, <hi rend="italic"
                        >that every atom of a fluid in the state of vapour possesses, under every
                        degree of elasticity and pressure, the same quantity of caloric.</hi> This
                        doctrine leads to very important consequences both of a theoretical and
                        practical nature.</p>
                    <p>It follows immediately from this doctrine, that if a quantity of vapour have
                        once been formed by adding to the liquid the quantity of caloric necessary
                        to the constitution of the vapour, the same particles of matter surrounded
                        by the same spheres of caloric may pass through all gradations of density,
                        and through all gradations of tempera ture, without either parting with
                        caloric or obtaining fresh supplies. Vapour of the temperature of 212°, ns
                        it rises from water boiling in the open air, may he collected in a vessel
                        and compressed by the force of 30 inches of mercury into half, its bulk, it
                        will become steam of a higher temperature,, viz., 250° from the increased
                        quantity of caloric in the diminished volume, and in this case the latent
                        heat will only be 970° instead of 1000°. If corn pressed still further into
                        again one half of that bulk, the temperature will rise to 292°, and leave
                        only 920° latent. Compressed still further into half of the lastmentioned
                        space, that is into <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> / <hi rend="subscript">
                        8</hi> of its original bulk, the temperature is raised to 339°, leaving only
                        873° latent; and another step would raise the temperature to 392°, leaving
                        only 820° latent; less than seven steps more would bring the steam into less
                        than its original bulk of water, with a temperature of between 900° and
                        1000° of sensible heat, and<pb break="no"

                        /> an amount of latent heat not much greater than its original proportion of
                        sensible heat, or 212°. In this case, we should have steam as heavy as water
                        and as hot as flame.</p>
                    <p>If, on the contrary, this process were reversed, and the steam produced at
                        212° under the pressure of an atmo sphere permitted to expand in vacuo to
                        double its bulk, a portion of the sensible heat would become absorbed into
                        the spheres of caloric around the atoms of water, increasing the latent heat
                        by 32°, and diminishing the sensible heat to 180°. The bulk being again
                        doubled, and the steam expanded to four times its original bulk, the
                        temperature would sink to 150°, and three more repetitions of the <hi
                        rend="italic">expansion</hi> would give a vapour of 71° temperature, and
                        1141° of latent heat.</p>
                    <p>This expansion and contraction of the steam, accompanied by diminished
                        temperature, is exactly what would exist if our atmosphere, instead of
                        oxygen and nitrogen, were wholly composed of vapour of water. Suppose the
                        temperature of the ocean to be 1000 , an atmosphere of vapour would be
                        raised of 2000 times the weight of the present atmosphere: the under part of
                        this atmosphere, compressed by the superincumbent weight, would be of great
                        density, but in ascending, the diminished pressure would be attended with
                        diminished temperature, until at last a cloud of white ice would be seen
                        floating on the surface. Must not the sun, from his intense heat, be a body
                        of this nature, having an atmosphere of enormous depth, on the summit of
                        which the beautifully crystalline and sparkling crust is continually
                        preserved by its diminished temperature in a state of renewed whiteness?</p>
                    <p>62. The specific gravity, density, and volume occupied by steam at different
                        temperatures, have been correctly determined by experiment; and it has been
                        ascertained that the expansion of vapour follows the law of the expansion of
                        other gases by heat; viz., the law of Dalton and Gay Lussac, that all gases
                        expand from 1. to 1.375 in bulk, by 180° of temperature, or <hi
                        rend="superscript"> 1</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"> 480</hi> for each degree
                        of Fahrenheit; and, secondly, that steam obeys the law of Boyle and
                        Mariotte, contracting in volume proportionally to pressure. It is first of
                        all necessary to know what bulk a given quantity of water converted into
                        steam will occupy at a given pressure, and the application of these laws
                        will determine the specific gravity, density, and volume at all other
                        pressures and temperatures.</p>
                    <p>63. The experiments of Gay Lussac upon this subject are simple, elegant, and
                        satisfactory. His apparatus is as follows :—A chauffer, F, contains burning
                        fuel, by which heat is communicated to B C, a bath of mercury. A spherule A,
                        of thin glass, hermetically closed, contains a given weight of water. G is a
                        glass tube of considerable diameter, filled with pure dry mercury, and
                        inserted in the bath, after which the spherule, A, containing the water, is
                        allowed to ascend to the top of the mercury, and is then broken by
                        concussion, so that a given quantity of water is thus placed in the
                        Torricellian vacuum at the top of the mercury. By the fuel in F heat is then
                        communicated upwards, by the fluids, to the whole apparatus, and to the
                        water in the summit of the tube G; and the mercury descends until the whole
                        of the water is converted into steam, after which it ceases to descend in
                        the same rapid proportion to the increase of tempera ture. This change shows
                        that the whole of the water is evaporated, and the heat must again be
                        allowed gradually to diminish, until the depression of the mercury
                        corresponds to the temperature indicated in our table of Elastic</p>
                    <p>Force. The capacity of the tube, G, is shown by divisions on its surface
                        previously fixed, and the height of the mercurial column by a graduated rule
                        and vernier <hi rend="italic">r</hi> r, supported on the edge of the bath.
                        The thermometers, A <hi rend="italic">h,</hi> indicate the temperature of
                        the fluids.</p>
                    <p>By means of this apparatus, Gay Lussac has determined the specific gravity of
                        steam, to be .625, air being 1000.; that is to say, steam from boiling water
                        is lighter than common air in the proportion of 5. to 8.</p>
                    <p>64. Dr Dalton’s recent experiments make the weight of a cubic foot of air at
                        60° = 535.68 grains; therefore a cubic foot of common steam weighs 334.8
                        grains at 60°, under a pressure of 30 inches of mercury; but as this
                        pressure would convert it into water, the true weight will be found, by the
                        law of Mariotte, thus:</p>
                    <p>30 in.: .065:: 334.8: 7254</p>
                    <p>the true weight, in grains, of a cubic foot of steam at, 60°, and under the
                        former pressure due to its own elasticity in vacuo; but if we wish to know
                        the weight of a cubic foot of steam at 212°, we must use the Iaw of Gay
                        Lussac and Dalton, thus:</p>
                    <p><hi rend="superscript"> (212°-60°) or 152°</hi> ∕ <hi rend="subscript">
                        480</hi> + 1: 1:: 334.8: 254.3</p>
                    <p>254.3 grains is, therefore, the weight of a cubic foot of steam, as it passes
                        off from water boiling in the air at 212°.</p>
                    <p>But the weight of one cubic inch of water at 60° is 253 grains; therefore,
                        the weight of a cubic inch of water at 60° is almost exactly equal to one
                        cubic foot, or 1728 cubic inches, of steam.</p>
                    <p>Hence we find, that the particles of water, when they form steam, are so much
                        repelled by their spheres of ca 1oric, as to be kept at twelve times their
                        original distance from each other; that, in this gaseous state, water is
                        1728 times rarer than when liquid; and that one gallon of wa ter, with the
                        requisite supply of caloric, will make 1728 gallons of steam.</p>
                    <p>65. The source from which caloric is obtained for the conversion of water
                        into steam, is either the heat of the sun, the central heat of the earth, or
                        of artificial fires. It is upon the intensity and quantity of this heat that
                        the elastic force, temperature, density, and volume of the steam obtained
                        for any particular purpose must depend; and it is therefore an important
                        point to determine how it is to be obtained.</p>
                    <p>The most important and common sources of heat for the production of steam,
                        are the combustion of coal, char coal, wood, resin, and oil. Many
                        experiments have been made upon the quantities of caloric given out during
                        their combustion; but the results vary much with the methods of applying the
                        heat. The six following are some of the results of Dr Dalton’s experiments;
                        the rest are selected from the best authorities:</p>
                    <p>One lb. of Hydrogen, burnt with 7 lbs. oxygen, produces 8 lbs. of water, and
                        raises 250 lbs. of water 180°.</p>

                        economical manner; and hence the quantity of fuel to heat any other

                        by the common arithmetical rules of proportion.</p>
                    <p>The quantity of water at 212°, which will be converted into steam, may be
                        found, by dividing the number of pounds of water in the table by 5.55. Thus,
                        from the table—</p>
                    <p>1 lb. of Newcastle coal gives 180° to 55.5 lbs. of water. Therefore, 1 lb. of
                        Newcastle coal converts into steam, } <hi rend="superscript"> 55.5</hi> /
                        <hi rend="subscript"> 5.5</hi> = 10lbs. of water</p>
                    <p>This is to be taken as the effect that may be produced if there be no
                        material loss of heat; and in the Cornish engines I find that even 10.5 lbs.
                        are actually accomplished.</p>
                    <p>In general, however, for the purposes of ordinary manufactures, in
                        Lancashire, Staffordshire, and the vicinity of London, it appears that not
                        more than 6.6 lbs. of water are converted into steam by one pound of coal;
                        so that not more than 33.8 lbs. of water are heated with ordinary boilers
                        from 32° to 212°. The following table may be taken as the numbers usually
                        given to represent the actual state of practice. But a late investigation by
                        Mr Parkes shows, that in the best constructions of boilers now used in
                        Cornwall, Warwickshire, and elsewhere, these effects are nearly doubled:</p>
                    <p>1 lb. of the best coal is generally required to heat</p>
                    <p>33.3 lbs. of water from 32° to 212°.</p>
                    <p>1 lb 6.6 lbs. of water at 212° into steam.</p>
                    <p>and 1 lb 5.5 lbs. of water at 32° into steam.</p>
                    <p>2 lbs. nearly one cubic foot of water from 32° to 212</p>
                    <p>11 lbs. nearly one cubic foot of water at 212° into steam.</p>
                    <p>13 lbs. nearly one cubic foot of water at 32° into steam.</p>
                    <p>Now, as a gallon contains ten pounds of water, it follows that</p>
                    <p>1 lb. of coal will raise 3½ gallons of water from 32° to the boiling
                        point.</p>
                    <p>5 lbs. of coal will convert 3⅓ gallons of water at 212° into steam.</p>
                    <p>6 lbs. of coal will convert 3⅓ gallons of water at 32° into steam.</p>
                    <p>We have given these approximate numbers for practical use, in the application
                        of steam to some of the ordinary purposes and processes of art and domestic
                        use, upon which we are about to enter; and they are such as may, with very
                        ordinary care, be safely calculated on. But for a full exposition of the
                        processes, and principles, and mechanical arrangements connected with the
                        best methods of generating steam from fuel, we must refer to the article "
                        <hi rend="smallcaps">Steam-Engine</hi>” where the generation and
                        condensation of steam find their most important uses.</p>
                    <p>It may perhaps be proper to remark, that a boiler, which is there called a
                        boiler of one, two, or three horses’ power, is one which is capable of
                        raising one, two, or three cubic feet of water into steam in an hour.

                    <p>66. One of the most important applications of steam in the economy of fuel,
                        is its employment as a vehicle for Transferring to a distance, and
                        distributing uniformly, the heat of a fire for the purpose of warming an
                        apartment or building. Its great efficiency for this purpose arises from the
                        largeness of its capacity for caloric, because, as it holds a quantity of
                        caloric equal to 1000 degrees, it will communicate as much heat as a mass of
                        red hot iron; and it will have this advantage over the iron, that it can
                        carry this heat to a distance without a similar loss; because, the heat
                        being latent, will not be given out until it arrive at its destination and
                        become condensed, when the whole of its 1000° will be usefully applied.</p>
                    <p>The manner in which warming by steam is to be effected, is this. At a
                        convenient part of the building, and as low as possible, there is to be
                        placed a close steam boiler of the ordinary construction. From this boiler a
                        small steam pipe is to be carried to the part of the building which is to be
                        warmed. This small pipe should be pretty thick, and carefully rolled round
                        with a fillet of flannel to a quarter of an inch thick, and the boiler
                        should be wholly covered with bricks and plastered over to keep it warm.
                        This smaller steam pipe should have an area of one square inch for every six
                        gallons of water that the boiler can boil off in an hour. Pipes of a larger
                        size are to be laid round the room above the floor, or under the floor if
                        apertures be left to allow a free circulation of warmed air to enter the
                        room; but the best method we have seen is, to make the surbase, which passes
                        round the room of thin iron plate or copper having the external figure of
                        the surbase, and sufficiently strong to withstand the pressure of the steam,
                        which strong tin plate or copper of 1½ lb. to the foot will sufficiently
                        effect, if the surbase be not more than about 4 inches square. Into these
                        larger pipes the steam is to be conducted, and in them the steam will be
                        condensed into water, and will give 1000° of heat to the colder air of the
                        room which is in contact with the outside of these pipes. In doing so the
                        steam being condensed into water, small pipes of lead or tin must be
                        provided, for the purpose of bringing back this condensed water into the
                        boiler; and, in order that they may act well, care is to be taken that a
                        gentle slope, of about an inch in 20 feet, be given to all the pipes. The
                        condensed water being thus conducted back to the bottom of the boiler, it
                        will there be replenished with heat, and in the form of steam will again
                        carry up its supply of 1000° to the apartment, again to be given off as
                        formerly to the room, and then returning once more to the boiler, a
                        continual circulation of the same particles of water, giving out in each
                        circuit a quantity of heat equal to red hot iron, is uniformly and gently
                        imparted to and diffused equally over the apartment. The pipe which brings
                        the steam from the boiler may be called the feeding pipe, the pipes which
                        give off the heat the radiating pipes, and the pipes which lead back the
                        water to the boiler the return pipes. We have already given dimensions for
                        the feed pipe. The return pipes need not be more than <hi rend="superscript"
                        >1</hi>∕<hi rend="subscript">12</hi> of the diameter of the feed pipe, but
                        an increase of size could do little harm, and may have the effect of
                        preventing accidental obstruction: the boiler will require to have a pint of
                        water added now and then to supply accidental waste; and a safety-valve on
                        the boiler is indispensable. A self-regulating feeder, such as that
                        mentioned in the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Steam-Engine</hi> among the
                        apparatus of boilers, is also to be recomended where it can be readily
                        attained, It is necessary, however, to give directions at greater length for
                        the dimensions of the warming or radiating pipes, as it is upon their proper
                        construction and arrangement that the efficiency of the apparatus entirely
                        depends; and the apparatus has frequently failed from the want of proper
                        precaution. The radiating pipes in the room are generally too small. It is
                        their extent of surface, and the free circulation of air round them, which
                        determines how much of the heat will be given out, and how rapidly. From
                        very accurate experiments I am induced to conclude, that a room containing
                        500 cubic feet of air, and exposing 400 feet of surface, may be maintained
                        at a temperature of 20° above that of the air without—that is to say, at 60°
                        in the inside of the room when the atmosphere is at 40 without—for a space
                        of twelve hours, by the evaporation of 2 gallons of water, and at the
                        expense of about three pounds of coal of the value of one farthing. But this
                        supposes that there is no ventilation, and that the air of the room is never
                        changed; whereas, the presence of one individual would render it necessary
                        to introduce nearly 400 cubic feet of external air every hour. Now, the heat
                        of 20° given to 400 cubic feet of air would require the evaporation of 3
                        gallons of water; and, therefore, the evaporation of 3 gallons of water
                        would be required for such a room, and 3 gallons for every person in it, if
                        properly ventilated, and for every 2 gallons there should be at least one
                        square foot of radiating surface; so that such a room, occupied by one
                        person, would require a surface of warming pipe equal to 2½ square feet, and
                        so on for every such room and occupant, for a space of 12 hours in the
                        day.</p>
                    <p>Thus, the evaporation of 1 gallon per day for every 400 feet of surface, with
                        a difference of temperature of 20 from the external air, and 1½ gallons per
                        day for each person, and 1 square foot of radiating surface, is a standard
                        from which we easily calculate.</p>
                    <p>A room 30 feet long, 20 feet wide, and 10 feet high, has a surface of 2200
                        feet, which would require 5½ gallons; six people would require 9 gallons;
                        therefore, 14½ gallons of water and 7¼ feet of radiating surface will heat
                        the well-ventilated room 12 hours for 6 persons at an expense of 25 lbs. of
                        coal, or about threepence per day; or a whole house, occupied by 6 persons,
                        may be warmed, if 30 feet high, 30 feet wide, and 30 feet deep, at tenpence
                        aday, the price of coals being twenty shillings aton.</p>
                    <p>It is scarcely necessary to add, that the radiating pipes may be best
                        constructed of thin copper, and ought to be roughened and blackened on the
                        outside.</p>
                    <p>In the same way the calculation may be made for any other room, building, and
                        number of occupants.</p>

                    <p>The arrangement of steam in the apartment to be heated is of some
                        consequence. It is, we have already stated, sufficiently out of the way in
                        the surbase, but, in that case, much heat passes out into the walls and
                        wood. It may stand on the hearth like a stove, and consist<pb break="no"

                        steam, and allowing air to ascend by the sides and through the intervening
                        spaces, so as to be made warm, and the outer surface radiating directly on
                        the surface exposed. It may be tubular, and coiled in a large quantity in a
                        small box fitted up externally in the appearance of a cabinet or pedestal in
                        the apartment, thus: (Figs. 25 and 26); the feed pipe commencing at the top
                        of the coils, and the return pipe passing off from the bottom. As the
                        conducting power of tin is nearly equal to that of iron, a quantity of tin
                        pipe will suffice, and be more economical than iron or copper. This coil may
                        be placed in a cabi net or pedestal of the form of Fig. 26, and the warm air
                        will have free egress through the wire work of the panel.</p>
                    <p>The next diagram (Fig. 27,) shows an arrangement of copper steam-vessels, by
                        which an extensive surface is very efficiently exposed to the air, the
                        condensed water being drawn off at the bottom.</p>
                    <p>There is one case in which warming by steam may be employed with especial
                        advantage, and where it is frequently neglected—where the power of steam is
                        already employed to drive machinery. Let the engine employed be what is
                        called high-pressure, or non-condensing, in which the steam escapes from the
                        engine and is passed off into the air; and, instead of the common plan, let
                        the steam from the engine be conveyed in pipes through the apartments to be
                        warmed, and let the diameter of the pipe gradually increase towards the end
                        of its circuit, and finally terminate in a hot-water pipe, which may also
                        circulate in the building and there will be given out the whole original
                        heat of the steam after having done its work in the steam engine, and that
                        as effectually as if there had been no steam-engine at all, and the whole
                        power of the engine will thus be clear saving. This will be the case to a
                        still greater extent if the steam-engine work expansively, and may further
                        be increased if the pipes be so formed as to constitute an aerial condenser.

                    <p>67. The principles which regulate this application of steam are similar to
                        those mentioned already in Art. 66, and steam possesses the same advantages
                        in the distribution of heat for this purpose, which it does in the cases
                        already mentioned. The warmth thus distributed is freed from those risks of
                        injury to the vitality of the plants, which accompany the old method of
                        warming by hot air flues, in which a contaminated and unwholesomely dry air
                        and unequable temperature were inevitably produced, and an occasional
                        annoyance from smoke. The warmth given out by the steam is of uniform
                        intensity throughout the whole length of the glass; it occupies very small
                        space —one furnace and chimney is all that is required for any extent of
                        range of glasshouses, as the steam may be conveyed to any usual distance in
                        well swathed pipes without sensible loss. The saving thus effected by the
                        concentration of the fire, and by its equable distribution, has been found
                        to produce an economy of more than one-third of the fuel commonly used. At
                        Sion House, the seat of the Duke of Northumberland, there are nearly a
                        thousand feet in length of glasshouses heated by one such apparatus. The
                        boiler and chimney may also be placed at a convenient distance from the
                        houses—a circumstance which contributes much to the beauty of this
                        arrangement.</p>
                    <p>Those who wish to study the details of this subject are referred to Mr
                        Loudon’s Horticultural Works, and to the article “<hi rend="smallcaps"

                    <p>Our first subject of enquiry, is into the amount of heat requisite to sustain
                        the glass at a given temperature higher than that of the external air; if we
                        take the temperature of the atmosphere at 35°, and that of the hot house at
                        65°, giving 30° of difference, we shall have a case approaching near to that
                        of a glasshouse in winter. In order to determine this question, which can
                        only be as certained by experiment, the author has examined a case upon a
                        large scale, which may furnish a standard of comparison.</p>

                    <p>The large palm house of the Botanic Garden of Edin burgh is an octagonal
                        structure, 60 feet in diameter, and 45 feet high. Excepting stone pillars at
                        the angles, and between the windows, of about three feet wide, the whole
                        building is glass, presenting a surface of almost exactly 5000 square feet
                        of glass. The quantity of fuel required in a cold atmosphere, having a mean
                        of 35°, is 1344 pounds for 24 hours; being at the rate of 269 lbs. of coal
                        for every 1000 feet of glass in a day, or 11.2 pounds an hour for 1000 feet,
                        or .0112 of a pound per hour for each foot.</p>
                    <p>To confirm this observation, it was thought proper to examine another house
                        of different dimensions. The eastern wing of the great range of houses is
                        warmed by a fire, which consumes half that quantity of coals, of about half
                        the value, being dross of a bad quality; so that its consumption is about ¼
                        of the other in real value, being about 672 lbs. of dross, equivalent to 336
                        lbs. of good coal in 24 hours. Now, the exposed glass of this wing amounts
                        to about 1376 square feet, being at the rate of 243 lbs. to 1000 feet—a
                        result which is sufficiently near to the other, to allow us to assume 250 or
                        260 lbs. of fuel in 24 hours for each thousand feet, as a standard of
                        tolerable accuracy in such cases. It may be useful to add, that these houses
                        are in tolerably sheltered situations, and that the glass faces in every
                        direction, so as to be acted on with tolerably uniformity.</p>
                    <p>Hence we have the following results:</p>
                    <p>Temperature of the air 35°—temperature of the hot house 65°.</p>
                    <p>Heat sustained 24 hours, by 250 lbs. of good coal, for 1000 square feet of
                        glass.</p>
                    <p>Heat sustained 1 hour, by 10.4 lbs. of good coal for 1000 feet of glass.</p>
                    <p>Heat sustained 1 hour, by 0.0104 lbs. of good coal, for one foot of
                        glass.</p>
                    <p>To find what amount of steam will be required to warm such a house, we have
                        only to apply the calculations of Art. 66; 10.4 lbs. of good coal will
                        convert seven gallons of water into steam; therefore, a boiler of one
                        horse’s power is necessary to evaporate a sufficient quantity of water for
                        the supply of steam for each 1000 feet of glass; that is to say, for the
                        palm-house alone, a boiler of five horses’ power would be required to
                        furnish steam; and this supposes the hot water of the condensed steam to be
                        returned into the boiler immediately; and if this were not the case, six
                        horses’ power would be the size of boiler ordered for this purpose:
                        hence—</p>
                    <p>To warm a hothouse by steam, there is required the boiler of a steam-engine,
                        reckoned at one horse’s power for every thousand feet of glass.</p>
                    <p>The method of distributing the heat through the rooms of the hothouse, is not
                        a matter of so nice calculation as in a common apartment. There is much
                        greater convenience for this purpose in a greenhouse than a common room, on
                        account of the necessary vacuities under the ranges and beds. In general, a
                        single circuit of steam-pipe four inches in diameter, round the apartment,
                        with a re turn pipe of equal dimensions laid parallel to it, is
                        sufficient.</p>
                    <p>It is, however, of great importance to provide a remedy for one of the
                        practical inconveniences of steam. When the fire is not very carefully
                        tended, ns during the night, the steam in the boiler falls below the proper
                        point, and the supply instantly ceases. This is remedied by the following
                        method. Cast iron boxes, a foot square and five or six feet deep, are filled
                        with stones, and ranged round the forcing rooms—a pipe passing into each of
                        them communicates a supply of steam to them, and the stones they contain.
                        The caloric entering first of all with rapidity into the stones, is
                        afterwards given out gradually by them to the house; and the advantage of
                        this arrangement is, that even if neglect or accident were to occasion a tem
                        porary cessation of the supply, this heat would still continue to be given
                        out from the matter of the boxes for several hours until the defect might be
                        remedied. These boxes of stones perform the same function for caloric that a
                        flywheel does for mechanical power—absorbing it when in excess, and giving
                        ft out again when deficient.</p>
                    <p>It is a valuable hint to economy, which Mr Macnab has put in execution in his
                        houses at the Botanical Gar den, that the boiler flues should be extended to
                        the green house after they have left the boiler; the remaining heat is thus
                        given out to the hothouse, and the last degree of saving accomplished. With
                        this arrangement a smaller boiler will suffice, but it will not always be
                        convenient; neither can a greater length than about 30 feet of flue be
                        advantageously used in this way.</p>

                    <p>68. We have already observed how well the peculiarities of steam enables us
                        to make use of it as a vehicle for the collection, transference, and
                        distribution of heat. In addition to the facility with which it may be
                        carried to a distance, and the uniformity of temperature resulting from it,
                        we have this further adaptation to the purposes now under consideration,
                        that the temperature can at no time become so great ns to produce injury, or
                        deteriorate the substances to which it is applied. Hence it follows that
                        thickened liquids, strong solutions, and any porous solid matter impregnated
                        with fluid may be evaporated, and wholly separated from the fluid, without
                        incurring the danger and suffering the deterioration resulting from direct
                        application of the fire. And, further, by the proper application of steam,
                        as a conductor of heat, liquids may be warmed, evaporated, and even boiled
                        in vessels of wood, which is in some cases, as in brewing and delicate
                        distributions, a matter of much importance.</p>
                    <p>When any mixture or solution of a solid in water is to be evaporated by
                        steam, it may be done in some of the following ways.</p>
                    <p>(1.) The vessel containing the solution may have two bottoms, the interval
                        between them being filled with water and steam, and the solution resting on
                        the upper one, the fire is applied to the under one; thus the steam and
                        water intervening between the solution and the fire, the latter is
                        protected, as well as the vessel itself, from being burnt when the process
                        has nearly attained the necessary degree of dryness; and the process of
                        communicating the heat from the fire to the water takes place in the
                        following manner; the fire generates in the water bubbles of steam, which
                        ascend from the lower to the higher bottom of the vessel, which is in
                        contact with the solution and acquires its temperature, and, giving off
                        their heat to the upper bottom, are condensed, and fall down again to the
                        lower bottom to acquire the accession necessary to rise, once more, in steam
                        to the top. This plan has been successfully used in making salt; and it is
                        necessary to have a safety and an atmospheric valve attached to the space
                        between the lower and upper bottoms. The quantity of heat required for the
                        purpose of evaporating the water of the mixture is neither increased
                        sensibly, nor diminished by the intervention of the steam between the
                        bottoms; the number of gallons of water to be evaporated from the solution
                        will determine the quantity of heat by Art. 66.</p>
                    <p>(2.) A second method of producing evaporation is to introduce among the
                        mixture a steam pipe, so as to wind amongst it either in the form of a
                        helix, like a corkscrew or worm of a still, or to perform such a circuit as
                        shall expose a large quantity of surface, with tolerable uniformity, to the
                        fluid for the absorption of heat from the steam. Copper is the best material
                        for the tubes, and wooden tanks lined with lead or tin will contain the
                        mixture. The fuel<pb break="no"
                        facs="ht:chi.28490924&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=687" xml:id="kp-eb0720-0687-0607"
                        /> required for evaporation will be 5 lbs. for every 31 gallons of water to
                        be evaporated, and the steam boiler must have one horse’s power for every 6
                        gallons to be evaporated in an hour.</p>
                    <p>(3.) A third method is the invention of Mr Goodlet of Leith. The substance to
                        be evaporated is forced by means of a pump into a long copper pipe, which
                        enters a close steam boiler, and after winding through it so frequently as
                        to expose a sufficient surface for a sufficient length of time to acquire
                        the necessary supply of heat from the boiler, again passes out from the
                        boiler and discharges its heated contents into an appropriate reservoir,
                        again, if necessary, to be passed once more through the same process by the
                        force pump. In this case the substance is brought to the steam boiler for
                        evaporation instead of having the steam brought to it, and thus any loss of
                        heat during the transit of the steam is prevented.</p>
                    <p>A steam kiln for drying grain has been used with great success by the same
                        person. The grain is spread out on the iron floor of a large room—this floor
                        is perfo rated with a midtitude of small openings, or formed of a very fine
                        grating; immediately under the floor steam pipes of 6 inches diameter lie
                        parallel to each other at small intervals apart, and radiate heat directly
                        to the floor and the grain, and also to the surrounding air, which in this
                        hot state ascends through the grain; numerous large ventilators being
                        provided for the escape of the vapour thus impregnated with moisture, after
                        it has ascended through the grain. This method has been found effectual, and
                        13 attended with less risk of injury than the ordinary one.</p>
                    <p>In the processes of drying and printing cloths and fabrics of various kinds,
                        rapid and complete drying is of much importance. This is effected
                        principally in what is called a drying frame: this consists of a dozen of
                        tin cylinders, a foot in diameter and 6 or 8 feet long; these cylinders are
                        closed completely by two hemispherical ends, and are placed upon an axis in
                        a frame, so as to revolve in contact with each other. Steam is conducted
                        into all these cylinders by a pipe passing through the axis, which is
                        hollow, and the joint is made steam-tight by a stuffing box similar to that
                        of the cover of a steam-engine cylinder. A piece of cloth dripping from the
                        dye-vat is passed through the frame once and is then perfectly dry. Of
                        course, the quantity of steam required for this process is proportional to
                        the number of pounds of water to be evaporated from each piece, that is, to
                        the difference between the weight <hi rend="italic">of a</hi> piece when wet
                        and when dry. The number of lbs. being ascertained, the fuel and power of
                        the boiler are found from article 66.</p>
                    <p>In the manufacture of paper the process of drying by steam is beautifully
                        exhibited. The wet pulp, laid out on the web of wire cloth, is gradually
                        strained as it approaches the large hollow cylinders, around which it winds
                        for half a minute and then comes off perfectly dry finished paper, ready for
                        use. This process is minutely described in the article “<hi rend="smallcaps"
                        >Paper</hi>” of this Encyclopedia.</p>

                    <p>69. To heat water rapidly, and in considerable quantity, by means of a fire
                        placed at some distance, is a problem frequently proposed; and steam for
                        such a case is an excellent vehicle for the heat. Let there be placed in a
                        steam boiler 10 gallons of water, and heated into steam; these 10 gallons
                        conveyed to a reservoir or bath of water at a distance, by a small lead
                        pipe, will heat nearly 55 gallons of water from 32° to the boiling point, or
                        165 gallons from 40° to 100°, the usual temperature of a warm bath. A bath
                        of the ordinary construction will require about 160 gallons, and the said 10
                        gallons will require 18 lbs.</p>
                    <p>of coal, value sixpence. Besides this, the sides of the bath, if made hollow,
                        may be warmed by the introduction of steam between the lining and the
                        outside, at the same time that the water is warmed; and the apartment may
                        further be heated with steam pipes from the same apparatus.</p>
                    <p>The most effectual method of communicating the heat of steam to water is to
                        pass the open end of the steam pipe from the boiler directly into the water
                        to be heated, so as at once to mix with it. The mouth of the pipe, properly
                        regulated by a stopcock, should enter at the bottom, and be directed from
                        one end of the bath along one side towards the other, and thus the impetus
                        of the steam on entering will communicate to the water a circulation highly
                        conductive toan equable distribution of heat.</p>
                    <p>A very simple apparatus of this kind may be placed in the same apartment with
                        the bath itself. A boiler 4 feet long and 2 feet deep, with a fire covering
                        a square of 18 inches, will heat such a bath in three quarters of an hour. A
                        copper boiler will be most effective, and the steam pipe should first be
                        matted with bandages of flannel, and then stitched with canvass painted,
                        from the boiler to where it enters the bath.</p>
                    <p>In establishments where there are many baths, a reser voir at the top of the
                        building may be kept constantly filled with water ready to descend into the
                        baths, the reservoir being supplied with heat from the steam pipe of a
                        boiler placed in the outer buildings, or some other suitable place. It is to
                        be recollected that the boiler used must be what is called a one, two, or
                        three horse power boiler, according as one hundred, two hundred, or three
                        hundred gallons per hour are wanted; and so on for every additional hundred
                        gallons of water at 100° of temperature—one horse power of boiler for one
                        hundred gallons.</p>
                    <p>The same process may be used for heating and even for boiling a liquid or
                        solution, in which no injury will result from adding the steam of this
                        condensed water to the liquid. In a dye-work, or other work where much
                        boiling and many solutions are used, steam boiling in this manner is a
                        process of great convenience and value. The vessels containing dyes of
                        various kinds, including leys and solutions of various substances, in which
                        cloths, yarns, wools, and various materials are to be boiled, are ranged
                        around a spacious apartment. Around this apartment, attached to the wall,
                        circulates a steam pipe of two inches diameter, from which smaller branch
                        pipes go off to each of the boilers from the nearest point, and pass down to
                        the bottom of their respective vessels. The exit of the steam is governed by
                        a stopcock under the hand of the operator; and by this means he can easily,
                        by allowing a smaller or greater supply of steam to enter the liquid,
                        produce a uniform and gentle simmer or excite an instantaneous and
                        tumultuous ebullition. Two great advantages give this method much
                        superiority over the common mode of boiling by the direct action of the
                        fire. The condensed steam supplies to the solution exactly as much water as
                        is lost by evaporation, so that it remains of the same strength through a
                        protracted process, and there is no injury sustained by. allowing the
                        substances immersed to settle down and rest at the bottom.</p>
                    <p>Where it is not allowable for the caloriferous steam to be condensed in
                        contact with the liquid to be warmed or boiled, we must resort to the method
                        of heating by sur face; that is to say, the steam must be conveyed through
                        the mass of liquid by a pipe, or other conductor best fitted to give out the
                        heat or retain the water. A very thin pipe of the purest soft copper is best
                        for this purpose; 2 inches in diameter and <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> /
                        <hi rend="subscript"> 20</hi> to <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> / <hi

                        dimensions, and a square foot of surface for every 10 gallons of water to be
                        boiled per hour will be required. For some purposes, it will be enough to
                        wind the pipe in a spiral<pb break="no"
                        facs="ht:chi.28490924&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=688" xml:id="kp-eb0720-0688-0608"
                        /> round the inside of the vessel to be heated; but if the vessel be large,
                        numerous pipes must pass through the liquid. For boiling 1000 gallons per
                        hour, 200 feet of copper pipe 2 inches in diameter are required.</p>
                    <p>In distillation by steam, the same method of communicating heat to the liquid
                        to be distilled is employed as al ready described in boiling. But the
                        vapours of other liquids, having less specific caloric than water, a smaller
                        quantity of steam from the boiler will be required to evaporate than to
                        evaporate an equal quantity of water; thus the heat of one gallon of water
                        will evaporate and cause to be distilled 2 gallons of alcohol, 3 of
                        sulphuric ether, and 4 of turpentine. It is a curious phenomenon, of which
                        distillers should avail themselves in carrying off the vapour in
                        distillation, that although alcohol floats on water, and ether on alcohol,
                        nevertheless the vapour of water floats above vapour of alcohol, and vapour
                        of alcohol above vapour of ether.</p>

                    <p>Ordered, that a book intituled A New Digestor, or Engine for softening Bones,
                        &amp;c., written by Denys Papin, Doctor of Physick, and Fellow of this
                        Society, be printed and published. <hi rend="smallcaps">Chr. Wren.</hi></p>
                    <p>This work on the New Digester was accordingly published in 1681; “Containing
                        the description of its make and use in these particulars, viz., Cookery,
                        Voyages at Sea, Confectionary, Making of Drinks, Chymistry and Dyeing, with
                        an Account of the Price a good big Engine will cost, and of the profit it
                        will afford.”</p>
                    <p>The following list will show the extent to which the learned doctor had
                        proceeded in applying steam to the improvement of the dietetic art. It is
                        copied from the Index to the work. “ (1.) How to know the quantity of
                        pressure in the Digestor. (2.) How to know the degree of heat. (3.) How meat
                        may be kept upon the fire three times as long as is necessary to make it

                    <p>This catalogue of uses of steam we shall shortly run over, as the modern uses
                        of steam for cookery are principally applications of Dr Papin’s methods, and
                        as valuable economization in the preparation of food on a large scale has
                        resulted from them, especially in the extraction of highly nutritious food
                        from bones. A digester on the principle of Dr Papin is used in every modern
                        kitchen.</p>
                    <p>“Description of the Digester and how to use it safely.”</p>
                    <p>“A A is a brass (or copper) cylinder, hollow within, shut at the bottom and
                        open at the top. B is another cylinder inverted upon it. C C are two
                        appendices or ears cast to the cylinder A A, as the trunnions of a piece of
                        ordnance. D D are two pieces of iron put upon the appendices at one end, and
                        the iron bar E E at the other. F F are two screws, which serve to press both
                        the cylinders A A, B B, against one another. G is another hollow cylinder,
                        made of glass, pewter, or some other materials, fitted to receive those
                        things that are to be included in the cylinders A A, and B B, with water all
                        round it.</p>
                    <p>“To use this engine with convenience and ease, it ought to be fitted in a
                        furnace built on purpose for it, and should go on ns far as the appendices C
                        C; so the fire being underneath, and the screws well fastened, and a piece
                        of moistened paper laid between the cylinders at the joint <hi rend="italic"

                        please without danger of wasting it by the ex halation of the volatile
                        parts.</p>
                    <p>“To know the quantity of the inward pressure, you must have a little pipe
                        open at both ends as H H: this being soldered to a hole in the cover B B, is
                        to be stopped at the top with a little valve P, exactly ground to it. This
                        must be kept down with an iron rod I M, one end of which must be put. into
                        an iron staple M, fastened to the bar E E, and the other end kept down by a
                        weight N to be hung upon it nearer or further from the valve according as
                        you would keep it less or more strong, after the manner of an ordinary Roman
                        balance, or steelyard.</p>
                    <p>“To know the degree of heat, I hang a weight to a thread about 3 feet long,
                        and I let fall a drop of water into a little cavity made for that purpose at
                        the top of it, and I tell how many times the hanging weight will move to and
                        fro before the drop of water is quite evaporated.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic">“Experiment.</hi> Having filled my pot with a piece of a
                        breast of mutton, and weighed five ounces of coals, I lighted my fire, and
                        by blowing gave such a heat that a drop of water would evaporate in 4
                        seconds, the inward pressure being about 10 times stronger than the
                        atmosphere: I let the fire go out of itself, and then the mutton was very
                        well done, <hi rend="italic">the bones soft</hi> and the juice a strong
                        jelly. So that, having had occasion to boil mutton several times since, I
                        have always observed the same rule, and never have missed to have it in the
                        same condition, which I take to be best of all.”</p>
                    <p>Beef required 7 ounces of coal and the same heat, and the beef was very well
                        boiled, although there were more parts of the bones not quite softened.
                        Lamb, rabbits, and pigeons, mackerel, pike, and eel, were subjected to the
                        same process; whence the doctor infers that the bones of young beasts
                        require almost as much fire as those of old ones to be boiled, that rabbit
                        bones are harder than those of mutton, that tough old rabbits may be made as
                        good as tender young ones by this means, that pigeons may be best boiled
                        with a heat that ovapo rates a drop of water in 5 seconds, that mackerel

                        fish being good and firm, and the bones so soft as not to be felt in eating;
                        and he particularly recommends, as an excellent dish cooked in this manner,
                        cod fish and green peas.</p>
                    <p>The most important of Papin’s experiments are those on the extraction of
                        gelatine from bones, as now done on a large scale in France and in this
                        country, as also the manufacture of essence of meat, soups, &amp;.,
                        especially suitable for long sea voyages.</p>
                    <p>“I took,” says he, “beef bones that had never been boiled, but kept dry a
                        long time, and of the hardest part of the leg; these being put into a little
                        glass pot with water, I included in the engine, together with another little
                        glass pot full with bones and water too, but in this the bones were ribs and
                        had been boiled already. Havingprest the fire till the drop of water would
                        dry away in three seconds, and ten pressures, I took off the fire; and the
                        vessels being cooled, I found very good jelly in both my pots; but that
                        which had been made out of ribs had a kind of a reddish colour, which I
                        believe might proceed from the medullary part, the other jelly was without
                        colour like hartshorn jelly; and I may say, that having seasoned it with
                        sugar and juice of lemon, I did eat it with as much pleasure, and found it
                        as stomachical, as if it had been jelly of hartshorn. Mutton bones are
                        better than beef bones; and he infers (1.) that one pound of beef bones
                        afford about two lbs. of jelly; (2.) that it is the cement (gelatine) that
                        unites the parts of the bones, which is dis solved in the water to make it a
                        jelly, since after that, the bones remain brittler; (3.) that few glutinous
                        parts are sufficient to congeal much water, for I found that when the jelly
                        was dried, <hi rend="italic">I</hi> had very little glue[-ten?] remaining;
                        (4.) I used it to glue a broken glass, which did since that time hold very
                        well, and can be washed as well as if it had never been broken; (5.) it is
                        heavier than water, and sinks to the bottom; (6.) hartshorn produces five
                        times its weight of jelly.</p>
                    <p>“From all these experiments, I think it very likely, that if people would be
                        persuaded to lay by bones, gristles, tendons, feet, and other parts of
                        animals that are solid enough to be kept without salt, whereof people throw
                        away more than would be necessary to supply all the ships that England hath
                        at sea, the ships might always be furnished with better and cheaper victuals
                        than they used to have. And I may say, that such victuals would take up less
                        room too, because they have a great deal more nourishment in them in
                        proportion to their weight. They would also be more wholesome than salt
                        meat. Vege tahles, such as dried peas, may also be cooked by the steam of
                        salt water without becoming salt.”</p>
                    <p>We have entered thus fully upon the work of Doctor Denys Papin, and the
                        properties of his digester for cooking, and extracting jellies by
                        high-pressure steam, because it contains nearly all that is at present
                        practised in the preparation of food by steam.</p>
                    <p>If to what has been already stated, we add, that if the steam of salt water
                        be collected in a vessel kept cold on the outside, the condensed water will
                        not be impregnated with salt, and may be used as food, the importance of
                        steam in the economical and menial capacity of cook, will be sufficiently
                        apparent. The supply of water to the crew of a steam vessel may be obtained
                        in this manner, and an apparatus for thus procuring fresh water from the
                        condensation of steam from salt water, has been used with advantage in
                        ordinary ships.</p>
                    <p>Fig. 29 contains the steam-cooking apparatus used in modern kitchens; <hi
                        rend="italic">a a</hi> is a portion of the kitchen fireplace In one of the
                        divisions of it, <hi rend="italic">b,</hi> is placed a steam boiler,
                        furnished with the usual apparatus of feeding pipes, gauge cocks, &amp;c.
                        From this boiler a steam pipe, <hi rend="italic">c c,</hi> is led along the
                        back of the cooking table <hi rend="italic">d d,</hi> and at certain
                        intervals, branch pipes, furnished each with a stopcock, project across the
                        table at right angles to the main pipe. The extremities of these branch
                        pipes are conical, and made accurately to fit into conical sockets inserted
                        into the cooking pans, one of which, <hi rend="italic">e</hi>, is seen in
                        its place on the table. These pans have each a double bottom, the lower one
                        close, the upper one perforated; between the bottoms the socket before
                        mentioned, through which the steam enters, is inserted. The manner of using
                        this apparatus is simple. The article to be cooked is laid in its place on
                        the perforated bottom of the pan, the lid is applied, and the pan is joined
                        to one or other of the branch pipes, by its socket receiving the conical end
                        of the pipe; the stopcock is now turned, and the matter in the pan is
                        subjected to the action of the steam. Each pan has a crane in front, to
                        allow of the condensed steam being drawn off.</p>
                    <p>The remaining part of the apparatus is the hot closet, <hi rend="italic"
                        >ff.</hi> This consists of a steam-tight iron box, containing shelves,
                        inserted in another iron box of dimensions so much greater as to allow of a
                        considerable vacuity being between them; into this vacuity the steam from
                        the boiler is permitted to flow, and give out its heat to the articles
                        placed in the closet to receive it.</p>

                        rend="italic">a a</hi> is a steam boiler, furnished with man hole,
                        safety-valve, gauge-cocks, supply pipe, and regulating float; <hi

                        casks or other vessels in which the food is held. These vessels are hung on
                        pivots, between the uprights, (of which one is seen in the drawing,) in such
                        a manner as to throw the centre of gravity a little below the points of
                        support; and each vessel has a false bottom pierced with many holes, and
                        fixed a few inches above the true bottom. When the contents of a vessel arc
                        to be discharged, the superintendent lays hold of the handle, seen in the
                        front, and, by a little force, turns the vessel round its axis, until its
                        front lip rest on the front bar of the gauntree, which is placed so low as
                        again to throw the centre of gravity of the vessel below the points of
                        support; the contents may then be emptied into a close barrow, or other
                        suitable vessel, or into a trough extending along the front of the
                        gauntree.</p>
                    <p>The manner of connecting the vessels with the steam pipe remains to be
                        noticed. From the main pipe <hi rend="italic">c,</hi> branches are carried
                        through the front bar of the framing opposite to the centre of every vessel,
                        of which there may be many, although two only are represented. Fig. A
                        exhibits a section of the main pipe, the branch pipe, and a part of the
                        bottom of the vessel. The branch pipe <hi rend="italic">d</hi> terminates in
                        a conical socket, and into this the plug fixed on the vessel <hi
                        rend="italic">c</hi> is fitted. When the vessel is in a vertical position,
                        the connexion between it and the boiler is complete, but when, in being
                        emptied, the vessel is overturned, the plug is withdrawn from the socket,
                        and the communition cut off. When the vessel is again restored to its
                        vertical position, the parts again fit each other without trouble or care on
                        the part of the attendant. The branch pipe is moreover furnished with a
                        stopcock, the handle of which is wrought by a rod from either an eccentric
                        or a crank fixed to one of the pivots of the vessel. When the vessel is
                        overturned and the plug withdrawn, the eccentric shuts the stopcock, and
                        prevents the steam from escaping, and reopens it when the vessel regains its
                        vertical position.</p>
