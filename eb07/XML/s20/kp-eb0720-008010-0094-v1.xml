                    Grotius “the glory of England,” was born at Salvington, in Sussex, in the year
                    1584. He was educated at the free school at Chichester, whence he was sent to
                    Hart Hall, in the university of Oxford, where he staid four years. In 1612, he
                    entered himself at Clifford’s Inn, in order to study the law; and about two
                    years afterwards removed to the Inner Temple, where he soon acquired great
                    reputation by his learning. He had already published several of his works; and
                    this year he wrote verses in Latin, in Greek, and in English. In 1614, he
                    published his Titles of Honour; and in 1616 his Notes on Sir John Fortescue’s
                    book, <hi rend="italic">De Laudibus Legum Anglia.</hi> In 1618, he published his
                    History of Tythes, which gave great offence to the clergy, and was animadverted
                    upon by several writers; and for this book he was called before the High
                    Commission Court, and obliged to make a public acknowledgment of his sorrow for
                    having published it. In 1621, being sent for by the parliament, though he was
                    not then a member of that house, and giving his opinion very strongly in favour
                    of their privileges, in opposition to the court, he was committed to the custody
                    of the sheriff of London, but was set at liberty after five weeks’ confinement.
                    In 1623, he was chosen burgess for Lancaster; but amidst all the divisions of
                    the nation, he kept himself neutral, prosecuting his studies with such
                    application, that though he was the next year chosen reader of Lyon’s Inn, he
                    refused to perform that office. In 1625, he was chosen burgess for Great Bedwin,
                    in Wiltshire, to serve in the first parliament of Charles I., in which he
                    declared himself warmly against the Duke of Buckingham; and on his Grace’s being
                    impeached by the House of Commons, he was appointed one of the managers of the
                    articles against him. In 1627 and 1628, he opposed the court party with great
                    vigour. The parliament being prorogued to the 20th of January 1629, Mr Selden
                    retired to the Earl of Kent's house at Wrest, in Bedfordshire, where he finished
                    his <hi rend="italic">Marmora Arundeliana.</hi> The parliament being met, he,
                    among others, again distinguished himself by his zeal against the court; when
                    the king dissolving the parliament, ordered several of the members to be brought
                    before the King’s Bench bar, and committed to the Tower. Among these was Mr
                    Selden, who insisting on the benefit of the laws, and refusing to make his
                    submission, was removed to the King’s Bench prison. Being here in danger of his
                    life on account of the plague then raging in Southwark, he petitioned the lord
                    high treasurer, at the end of Trinity term, to intercede with his majesty that
                    he might be removed to the Gate-house, Westminster, which was granted. But in
                    Michaelmas term following, the judges objecting to the lord treasurer’s warrant,
                    by which he had been removed to the Gate-house, an order was made for conveying
                    him back to the King’s Bench, whence he was released in the latter end of the
                    same year; but fifteen years afterwards the parliament ordered him five thousand
                    pounds for the losses he had sustained on this occasion. He was afterwards
                    committed, with several other gentlemen, for dispersing a libel; but the author,
                    who was abroad, being discovered, they were at length set at liberty. In 1634, a
                    dispute having arisen between the English and Dutch concerning the
                    herring-fishery on the British coast, he was prevailed upon by Archbishop Laud
                    to draw up his <hi rend="italic">Mare clausum,</hi> in answer to Grotius’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Mare Liberum;</hi> which greatly recommended him to the favour of
                    the court. In 1640, he was chosen member for the university of Oxford; when he
                    again opposed the court, though he might, by compliance, have raised himself to
                    very considerable posts. In 1643, he was appointed one of the lay members to sit
                    in the assembly of divines at Westminster, and was the same year appointed
                    keeper of the records in the Tower. Whilst he attended his duty in the assembly,
                    a warm debate arose respecting the distance of Jericho from Jerusalem. The party
                    which contended for the shortest distance urged, as a proof of their opinion
                    being well founded, that fishes were carried from the one city to the other, and
                    sold in the market. Their adversaries were ready to yield to the force of this
                    conclusive argument, when Selden, who despised both parties, as well as the
                    frivolousness of their dispute, exclaimed, “Perhaps the fishes were salted.”
                    This unexpected remark left the victory doubtful, and renewed the debate; and
                    our author, who was sick of such trifling, soon found employment more suited to
                    his genius; for, in the year 1645, he was made one of the commissioners of the
                    admiralty. The same year he was unanimously elected master of Trinity College,
                    Cambridge, but declined accepting. He died in 1654, and was interred in the
                    Temple-church, where a monument is erected to his memory. Dr Wilkes observes,
                    that he was a man of uncommon gravity and greatness of soul, averse to flattery,
                    liberal to scholars, charitable to the poor; and though he had great latitude in
                    his principles with regard to eccle<pb break="no"

                    />siastical power, yet he had a sincere regard for the Church of England. He
                    wrote many learned works besides those already mentioned, the principal of which
                    are, 1. De Jure Naturali et Gentium, juxta Disciplinam Hebraeorum; 2. De Nuptiis
                    et Divorciis; S. De Anno Civili veterum Hebraeorum; 4. De Nummis; 5. De Diis
                    Syris; 6. Uxor Hebraica; 7. Jani Anglorum Facies altera. All his works were
                    printed together in 1726, in three vols, folio.</p>
