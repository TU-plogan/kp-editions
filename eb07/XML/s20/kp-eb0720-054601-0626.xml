                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra

                <p><label type="entry">SPINOZA, <hi rend="smallcaps">Benedict</hi></label>, was born
                    at Amsterdam the 24th November 1632. His father was a Jew of Portugal, and by
                    profession a merchant. After being taught Latin by a physician, the son applied
                    himself for many years to the study of theology, and afterwards devoted himself
                    entirely to philosophy. He began very early to be dissatisfied with the Jewish
                    religion; and as his temper was open, he did not conceal his doubts from the
                    synagogue. The Jews, it is said, offered to tolerate his infidelity, and even
                    promised him a pension of a thousand dollars per annum, if he would remain in
                    their society, and continue outwardly to practise their ceremonies. But if this
                    offer was really made, he rejected it, perhaps from his aversion to hypocrisy,
                    or rather be cause he could not endure the restraint which it would have
                    imposed. He also refused being constituted heir to an independent fortune, to
                    the prejudice of the natural claimants; and he learned the art of polishing
                    glass for spectacles, that he might be enabled to maintain himself by the labour
                    of his own hands.</p>
                <p>His retreat from the synagogue was hastened by an alarming incident. As he was
                    returning home one evening from the theatre, he was stabbed by a Jew: the wound
                    was slight, but the attempt naturally led Spinoza to conclude that the Jews had
                    formed the design of assassinating him. After leaving the synagogue he
                    professedly became a Chris tian, and frequented the churches of the Lutherans
                    and Calvinists. He now devoted himself more than ever to his favourite
                    philosophical speculations; and finding himself frequently interrupted by the
                    visits of his friends, he left Amsterdam, and settled at the Hague, where he
                    often continued for three months together without ever stirring from his
                    lodging. During his residence in that city, his hostess, who was a Lutheran,
                    asked him one day if she could be saved while she continued in her religion?
                    “Yes,” replied</p>
                <p>Spinoza, “provided you join to your religion a peaceable and virtuous life.” From
                    this answer, it has been concluded, that he was a Christian in appearance only,
                    while in reality he regarded all religions as indifferent. But this conclusion
                    would be too severe, even if the woman had been a Mahommedan. His “Tractatus
                    theologicopoliticus”(Hamb. 1670, 4to.) is a better proof of his insincerity than
                    a thou sand such conclusions; for this book contains all those doc trines in
                    embryo which were afterwards unfolded in his posthumous works, and which are
                    generally considered as a system of atheism. His fame, which had now spread far
                    and wide, obliged him sometimes to interrupt his philosophical reve ries.
                    Learned men visited him from all quarters. While the prince of Condé commanded
                    the French army in Utrecht, he intreated Spinoza to visit him; and though he was
                    ab sent when the philosopher arrived, he immediately retum ed and spent a
                    considerable time with him in conversation. The elector Palatine offered to make
                    Spinoza professor of philosophy at Heidelberg; but this offer he thought it
                    expedient to decline. He died of consumption at the Hague on the 21st February
                    1677, at the age of forty-five. His life was a perpetual contradiction to his
                    opinions. He was temperate, liberal, and remarkably disinterested; he was
                    sociable, affable, and friendly. His conversation was agreeable and instructive,
                    and never deviated from the strictest propriety.</p>
                <p>Soon after his death appeared a thick volume entitled “B.d.S. Opera Posthuma.”
                    [Arastelodami] 1677, 4to. A collective edition of his works has been published
                    in the course of the present century: “Benedicti de Spinoza Opera quae supersunt
                    omnia. Iterum edenda curavit, praefationes, vitam auctoris, nec non notitias
                    quae ad historiam<pb break="no" facs="ht:chi.28490924&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=627"

                    8vo. Spinoza has generally been considered as the author of a tract entitled
                    “Lucii Antistii Constantis de Jure Ecclesiasticoum liber singularis.”
                    Alethopoli, 1666, 8vo. It has also been ascribed to Meyer, his friend and
                    physician; but Leibnitz believed the author to have been Van den Hoof, who wrote
                    “L'Intérêt de la Hollande,” and various other works.<note anchored="true"
