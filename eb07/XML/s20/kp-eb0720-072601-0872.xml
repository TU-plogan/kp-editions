                <p><label type="entry">STILLINGFLEET, <hi rend="smallcaps">Edward</hi></label>,
                    bishop of Worcester, was the son of Samuel Stillingfleet, gentleman, and was
                    born at Cranborn in Dorsetshire in 1635. He was educated at St John’s College,
                    Cambridge; and having received holy orders, was, in 1657, presented to the
                    rectory of Sutton in Nottinghamshire. By publishing his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Origines Sacra,</hi> one of the ablest defences of revealed religion that has
                    ever been written, he soon acquired such reputation, that he was appointed
                    preacher of the Rolls Chapel; and in January 1665 was presented to the rectory
                    of St Andrews, Holborn. He was afterwards chosen lecturer at the Temple, and
                    appointed chaplain in ordinary to King Charles II. In 1668 he took the degree of
                    D.D.; and was soon after engaged in a dispute with those of the Romish religion,
                    by publishing his discourse concerning the idolatry and fanaticism of the church
                    of Rome, which discourse he afterwards defended against several antagonists. In
                    1680 he preached at Guildhall chapel a sermon on Phil. iii. 26, which he
                    published under the title of “The Mischief of Separation ;” and this being
                    immediately attacked by several writers, he in 1683 published his
                    Unreasonableness of Separation. In 1685 appeared his <hi rend="italic">Origines
                    Britannica,</hi> or the Antiquities of the British Churches, in folio. During
                    the reign of King James II. he wrote several tracts against popery, and was
                    prolocutor of the convocation, as he had likewise been under Charles II. After
                    the revolution he was advanced to the bishopric of Worcester, and was engaged in
                    a dispute with the Socinians, and also with Mr Locke; in which last contest he
                    is generally thought to have been unsuccessful. He died at Westminster in 1699,
                    and was interred in the cathedral of Worcester, where a monument was erected to
                    his memory by his son. Dr Stillingfleet wrote other works besides those here
                    mentioned, which, with the above, have been reprinted in 6 vols. folio.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Stillingfleet,</hi><hi rend="italic">Benjamin,</hi> an
                    ingenious naturalist, born in 1702, was the bishop’s grandson. His father,
                    Edward Stillingfleet, M.D., was fellow of St John’s College, Cambridge, and
                    Gresham professor of physic: but marrying in 1692, he lost his lucrative offices
                    and his father’s favour; a misfortune that affected both himself and his
                    posterity. Having however entered the church, he obtained, by his father’s
                    means, the living of Newington-Butts, which he immediately exchanged for those
                    of Wood-Norton and Swanton in Norfolk. He died in 1708. Benjamin, his only son,
                    was educated at Norwich school, which he left in 1720, with the character of an
                    excellent scholar. He then went to Trinity College in Cambridge, at the request
                    of Dr Bentley, the master, who had been private tutor to his father, domestic
                    chaplain to his grandfather, and much indebted to die family. Here he was a
                    candidate for a fellowship, but was rejected by the master’s influence. This was
                    a severe and unexpected disappointment, and but little alleviated afterwards by
                    Bentley’s apology, that it was a pity that a gentleman of Mr Stillingfleet’s
                    parts should be buried within the walls of a college.</p>
                <p>Perhaps, however, this ingratitude of Dr Bentley was not of any real disservice
                    to Mr Stillingfleet. By being thrown into the world, he formed many honourable
                    and valuable connections. He dedicated some translations of Linnaeus to the late
                    Lord Lyttelton, partly, he says, from motives of private respect and honour.
                    Lord Barrington gave him, in a very polite manner, the place of master of the
                    barracks at Kensington; a favour to which Mr Stillingfleet, in the dedication of
                    his Calendar of Flora to that nobleman, alludes with the greatest politeness, as
                    well as the warmest gratitude. His Calendar of Flora was formed at Stratton in
                    Norfolk in the year 1755, at the hospitable seat of his very worthy and
                    ingenious friend Mr Marsham, who had made several observations of that kind, and
                    had communicated to the public his curious observations on the growth of trees.
                    But it was to Mr Wyndham of Felbrig in Norfolk that he appears to have had the
                    greatest obligation: he travelled abroad with him, spent much of his time at his
                    house, and was appointed one of his executors (Mr Garrick being another), with a
                    considerable addition to an annuity which that gentleman had settled upon him in
                    his lifetime.</p>
                <p>Mr Stillingfleet’s genius seems, if we may judge from his works, to have led him
                    principally to the study of natural history; which he prosecuted as an ingenious
                    philosopher, an useful citizen, and a good man. In this walk of learning he
                    mentions as his friends, Dr Watson, Dr Solander, Mr Hudson, Mr Price of Foxley,
                    and some others; to whom may be added the ingenious Mr Pennant. Nor can we omit
                    the flattering mention which Mr Gray makes of him in one of his letters, dated
                    from London in 1761: “I have lately made an acquaintance with this philosopher,
                    who lives in a garret here in the winter, that he may support some near
                    relations who depend upon him. He is always employed, consequently (according to
                    my old maxim) always happy, always cheerful, and seems to me a very worthy,
                    honest man. His present scheme is to send some persons, properly qualified, to
                    reside a year or two in Attica, to make themselves acquainted with the climate,
                    productions, and natural history of the country, that we may understand
                    Aristotle, Theophrastus, &amp;c. who have been heathen Greek to us for so many
                    ages; and this he has got proposed to Lord Bute, no unlikely person to put it in
                    execution, as he is himself a botanist.”</p>
                <p>Mr Stillingfleet published a volume of Miscellaneous Tracts, which is in much
                    esteem, and does great honour to his head and heart. They are chiefly
                    translations of some essays in the <hi rend="italic">Amaenitates Academica,</hi>
                    published by Linnaeus, interspersed with some observations and additions of his
                    own. In this volume he shows also a taste for classical learning, and entertains
                    us with some elegant poetical effusions of his own. But his Essay on
                    Conversation, published in the first volume of Dodsley’s Collection of Poems,
                    entitles him to a respectable station among our English poets. This poem is
                    addressed to Mr Wyndham, with all that warmth of friendship which distinguishes
                    Mr Stillingfleet. As it is chiefly didactic, it does not admit of so many
                    ornaments as some compositions of other kinds. However, it contains much good
                    sense, shows a considerable knowledge of mankind, and has several passages that,
                    in point of harmony and easy versification, would not disgrace the writings of
                    our most admired poets. Here more than once Mr Stillingfleet shows himself still
                    sore for Dr Bentley’s cruel treatment of him; and towards the beautiful and
                    moral close of it, where it is supposed he gives us a sketch of himself, seems
                    to hint at a mortification of a more delicate nature, which he is said to have
                    suffered from the other sex. To these disappointments it was perhaps owing that
                    Mr Stillingfleet neither married nor went into orders. His London residence was
                    in lodgings in Piccadilly, where he died in 1771, at the age of sixty-nine,
                    leaving several valuable papers behind him. He was buried in St James’s church,
                    without the slightest monument to his memory,</p>
