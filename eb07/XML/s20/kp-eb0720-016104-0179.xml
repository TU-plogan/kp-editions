                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra
                    space around the <gi>pb</gi> tag. Where a word is hyphenated at a <gi>pb</gi>,

                    topography, the fourth and last barrier erected by the Romans against the
                    incursions of the North Britons.</p>
                <p>We learn from several hints in the Roman historians, that the country between the
                    walls of Hadrian and Antoninus continued to be a scene of perpetual war and
                    contention between the Romans and Britons, from the beginning of the reign of
                    Commodus to the arrival of the Emperor Septimius Severus in Britain, in the year
                    206. This last emperor having subdued the Maentae, and repulsed the Caledonians,
                    determined to erect a stronger and more impenetrable barrier than any of the
                    former, against their future incursions.</p>
                <p>Though neither Dio nor Herodian make any mention of a wall built by Severus in
                    Britain for the protection of the Roman province, yet we have abundant evidence
                    from other writers of equal authority that he really built such a wall. “He
                    fortified Britain,” says Spartian, “with a wall drawn cross the island from sea
                    to sea, which is the greatest glory of his reign. After the wall was finished,
                    he retired to the next station (York), not only a conqueror, but the founder of
                    an eternal peace.” To the same purpose Aurelius Victor and Orosius, to say
                    nothing of Eutropius and Cassiodorus: “Having repelled the enemy in Britain,
                    he-fortified the country, which was suited to that purpose, with a wall drawn
                    cross the island from sea to sea.” “Severus drew a great ditch, and built a
                    strong wall, fortified with several turrets, from sea to sea, to protect that
                    part of the island which he had recovered from the yet unconquered nations.” As
                    the residence of the Emperor Severus in Britain was not quite four years, it is
                    probable that the two last of them were employed in building this wall;
                    according to which account, it was begun in the year 209, and finished in the
                    year 211.</p>
                <p>This wall of Severus was built nearly on the same track with Hadrian’s rampart,
                    at the distance only of a few paces north. The length of this wall, from
                    Cousin’s House, near the mouth of the river Tyne on the east, to Boulness on the
                    Solway Frith on the west, has been found, from two actual mensurations, to be a
                    little more than sixty-eight English miles, and a little less than seventy-four
                    Roman miles. To the north of the wall was a broad and deep ditch, the original
                    dimensions of which cannot now be ascertained, only it seems to have been larger
                    than that of Hadrian. The wall itself, which stood on the south brink of the
                    ditch, was built of freestone; and where the foundation was not good, it is
                    built on piles of oak. The interstices between the two faces of this wall arc
                    filled with broad thin stones, placed not perpendicularly, but obliquely on
                    their edges; and the running mortar or cement was then poured upon them, which,
                    by its great strength and tenacity, bound the whole together, and made it firm
                    as a rock. But though these materials are sufficiently known, it is not easy to
                    guess where they were procured, for many parts of the wall are at a great
                    distance from any quarry of freestone; and though stone of another kind was
                    within reach, yet it does not appear to have been anywhere used. The height of
                    this wall was twelve feet besides the parapet, and its breadth eight feet,
                    according to Bede, who lived only at a small distance from the east end of it,
                    and in whose time it was in many places almost quite entire. Such was the wall
                    erected by the command and under the direction of the Emperor Se verus in the
                    north of England; and, considering the length, breadth, height, and solidity, it
                    was certainly a work of great magnificence and prodigious labour. But the wall
                    itself was but a part, and not the most extraordinary part, of this work. The
                    great number and different kinds of fortresses which were built along the line
                    of it for its defence, and the military ways with which it was attended, are
                    still more worthy of our admiration, and come now to be described.</p>
                <p>The fortresses which were erected along the line of Severus’s wall for its
                    defence were of three different kinds, and three different degrees of strength;
                    and were called by three different Latin words, which may be translated <hi
                    rend="italic">stations, castles,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">turrets.</hi> Of
                    each of these in their order.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">stationes,</hi> stations, were so called from their
                    stability, and the stated residence of garrisons. They were also called <hi
                    rend="italic">castra,</hi> which has been converted into <hi rend="italic"
                    >chestres,</hi> a name which many of them still bear. These were by far the
                    largest, strongest, and most magnificent of the fortresses which were built upon
                    the wall, and were designed for the head-quarters of the cohorts of troops which
                    were placed there in garrison, and whence detachments were sent into the
                    adjoining castles and turrets. These stations, as appears from the vestiges of
                    them which are still visible, were not all exactly of the same figure nor of the
                    same dimensions; some of them being exactly squares, and others oblong, and
                    some, again, a little larger than others. These variations were no doubt
                    occasioned by the difference of situation, and other circumstances. The stations
                    were for-tified with deep ditches and strong walls, the wall itself coin-<pb
                    break="no" facs="ht:chi.28490924&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=180"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0720-0180-0162"/> ciding with and forming the north wall of each
                    station. Within the stations were lodgings for the officers and soldiers in
                    garrison; the smallest of them being sufficient to contain a cohort, or six
                    hundred men. Without the walls of each station was a town, inhabited by
                    labourers, artificers, and others, both Romans and Britons, who chose to dwell
                    under the protection of these fortresses. The number of the stations upon the
                    wall was eighteen; and if they had been placed at equal distances, the interval
                    between every two of them would have been four miles and a few paces. But the
                    intervention of rivers, marshes, and mountains, the conveniency of situations
                    for strength, prospect, and water, and many other circumstances to us unknown,
                    determined them to place these stations at unequal distances. The situation
                    which was always chosen by the Romans, both here and everywhere else in Britain
                    where they could obtain it, was the gentle declivity of a hill, near a river,
                    and facing the meridian sun. Such was the situation of the far greatest part of
                    the stations on this wall. In general, we may observe, that the stations stood
                    thickest near the two ends and in the middle, probably because the danger of
                    invasion was greatest in these places. But the reader will form a clearer idea
                    of the number of these stations, their Latin and English names, their situation
                    and distance from one another, by inspecting the following table, than we can
                    give with equal brevity in any other way. The first column contains the number
                    of the station, reckoning from east to west; the second contains its Latin, and
                    the third its English name; and the three last its distance from the next
                    station to the west of it, in miles, furlongs, and chains.</p>

                <p>The <hi rend="italic">castella,</hi> or castles, were the second kind of
                    fortifications which were built along the line of this wall for its defence.
                    These castles were neither so large nor so strong as the stations, but much more
                    numerous, being no fewer than eighty-one. The shape and dimensions of the
                    castles, as appears from the foundations of many of them which are stiil
                    visible, were exact squares of sixty-six feet every way. They were fortified on
                    every side with thick and lofty walls, but without any ditch, except on the
                    north side, on which the wall itself, raised much above its usual height, with
                    the ditch attending it, formed the fortification. The castles were situated in
                    the intervals between the stations, at the distance of about seven furlongs from
                    each other, though particular circumstances sometimes occasioned a little
                    variation. In these castles guards were constantly kept, by a competent number
                    of men detached from the nearest stations.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">turres,</hi> or turrets, were the third and last kind of
                    for tifications on the wall. These were still much smaller than the castles, and
                    formed only a square of about twelve feet, standing out of the wall, on its
                    south side. Being so small, they are more entirely ruined than the stations and
                    castles, which makes it difficult to discover their exact number. They stood in
                    the intervals between the castles; and from the faint vestiges of a few of them,
                    it is conjectured that there were four of them between every two castles, at the
                    distance of about three hundred yards from one another. According to this
                    conjecture, the number of the turrets amounted to three hundred and twenty-four.
                    They were designed for watch-towers and places for sentinels, who, being within
                    hearing of one another, could convey an alarm or piece of intelligence to all
                    parts of the wall in a very little time.</p>
                <p>Such were the stations, castles, and turrets, on the wall of Severus; and a very
                    considerable body of troops was constantly quartered in them for its defence.
                    The usual complement allowed for this service was as follows:</p>
                <p>1. Twelve cohorts of foot, consisting of 600 men each..7,200</p>
                <p>2. One cohort of mariners in the station at Boulness... 600</p>
                <p>3. One detachment of Moors, probably equal to a co hort 600</p>
                <p>4. Four alae or wings of horse, consisting, at the lowest computation, of 400
                    each 1,600</p>
                <p>10,000</p>
                <p>For the conveniency of marching these troops from one part of the wall to
                    another, with the greater ease and expedition, on any service, it was attended
                    with two military ways, paved with square stones, in the most solid and
                    beautiful manner. One of these ways was smaller, and the other larger. The
                    smaller military way run close along the south side of the wall, from turret to
                    turret, and castle to castle, for the use of the soldiers in relieving their
                    guards and sentinels, and such services. The larger way did not keep so near the
                    wall, nor touch at the turrets or castles, but pursued the most direct course
                    from one station to another, and was designed for the convenience of marching
                    larger bodies of troops.</p>
                <p>It is to be regretted that we cannot gratify the reader’s curiosity, by informing
                    him by what particular bodies of Roman troops the several parts of this great
                    work were executed, as we were enabled to do from inscriptions with regard to
                    the wall of Antoninus Pius. For though it is probable that there were stones
                    with inscriptions of the same kind, mentioning the several bodies of troops, and
                    the quantity of work performed by each of them, originally inserted in the face
                    of this wall, yet none of them are now to be found. There have indeed been
                    discovered, in or near the ruins of this wall, a great number of small square
                    stones, with very short, and generally imperfect, inscriptions upon them,
                    mentioning particular legions, cohorts, and centuries, but without directly
                    asserting that they had built any part of the wall, or naming any number of
                    paces. Of these inscriptions the reader may sec no fewer than twenty-nine among
                    the Northumberland and Cumberland inscriptions in Horsley’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Britannia Romana.</hi> As the stones on which these inscriptions are cut are of
                    the same shape and size with the other facing-stones of this wall, it is almost
                    certain that they have been originally placed in the face of it. It is equally
                    certain, from the uniformity of these inscriptions, that they were all intended
                    to intimate some one thing, and nothing so probable as that the adjacent wall
                    was built by the troops mentioned in them. This was perhaps so well understood,
                    that it was not thought necessary to be expressed; and the distance of these
                    inscriptions from one another showed the quantity of work performed. If this was
                    really the case, we know in general that this great work was executed by the
                    second and sixth legions, these being the only legions mentioned in these
                    inscriptions.<pb break="no" facs="ht:chi.28490924&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=181"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0720-0181-0163"/> Now, if this prodigious wall, with all its
                    appendages of ditches, stations, castles, turrets, and military ways, was
                    executed in the space of two years by two legions only, which, when most
                    complete, required no less than 12,000 men, how greatly must we admire the
                    skill, the industry, and excellent discipline of the Roman soldiers, who were
                    not only the valiant guardians of the empire in times of war, but its most
                    active and useful members in times of peace?</p>
                <p>This wall of Severus, and its fortresses, proved an impenetrable barrier to the
                    Roman territories for nearly two hundred years. But about the beginning of the
                    fifth century, the Roman empire being assaulted on all sides, and the bulk of
                    their forces withdrawn from Britain, the Maeatae and Caledonians, now called
                    Scots and Picts, became more daring; and some of them breaking through the wall,
                    and others sailing round the ends of it, they carried their ravages into the
                    very heart of provincial Britain. These invaders were indeed several times
                    repulsed after this, by the Roman legions sent to the relief of the Britons. The
                    last of these legions, under the command of Gallio of Ravenna, having, with the
                    assistance of the Britons, thoroughly repaired the breaches of Severus’s wall
                    and its fortresses, and exhorted the Britons to make a brave defence, took their
                    final farewell of Britain. It soon appeared that the strongest walls and
                    ramparts are no security to an undisciplined and dastardly rabble, as the
                    unhappy Britons then were. The Scots and Picts met with little resistance in
                    breaking through the wall, while the towns and castles were tamely abandoned to
                    their destructive rage. In many places they levelled it with the ground, that it
                    might prove no obstruction to their future inroads. From this time no attempts
                    were ever made to repair this noble work. Its beauty and grandeur procured it no
                    respect in the dark and tasteless ages which succeeded. It became the common
                    quarry, for more than a thousand years, out of which all the towns and villages
                    around were built; and is now so entirely ruined, that the penetrating eyes of
                    the most poring and patient antiquary can hardly trace its vanishing
                    foundations.</p>
