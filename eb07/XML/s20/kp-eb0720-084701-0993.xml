                <p><label type="entry">SURREY</label>, an inland English county, on the banks of the
                    Thames, by which, on its northern side, it is separated from Middlesex. On the
                    west it is bounded by Berkshire and Hampshire, on the south by Sussex, and on
                    the east by Kent. Its shape is an oblong, of moderate regularity, except on its
                    northern side, where considerable indentations are formed by the curvatures of
                    the Thames. Its length from east to west is about thirty-seven miles, and its
                    breadth from north to south about twenty-five. The area is 758 square miles, or
                    485,120 statute acres.</p>
                <p>The population of this county at the four decennial periods of enumeration was
                    found to be as follows; viz. in 1801 it amounted to 269,043, in 1811 to 323,851,
                    in 1821 to 398,658, and in 1831 to 485,700.</p>

                <p>The face of the country exhibits great varieties. On the north, by the banks of
                    the Thames, from Lambeth to Egham, the richness of the highly improved country,
                    the abundance of trees, the verdure of the meadows, the undulation of the hills,
                    with the numerous elegant private houses, all display the most pleasing marks of
                    taste, wealth, and comfort. The centre of the county is a range of chalk hills,
                    much covered with thick underwood, intermixed with arable fields badly
                    cultivated, and utterly destitute of water. The south part, at the foot of this
                    range of hills, is a flat clayey country, nearly impassable in the winter, but
                    covered with some of the best and largest oak trees that are to be found in the
                    island. The north-western part exhibits a considerable tract of the most sterile
                    black heaths, while on the south-west, near Farnham, is some of the most
                    productive land in England.</p>
                <p>The productions of agriculture are various, and, at a distance from the capital,
                    scarcely differ from those of other districts in similar circumstances. A
                    greater proportion of clover and of sanfoin is cultivated on the hills, where
                    there arc no natural meadows, than in most other parts of the kingdom. Woad is
                    also very extensively raised in the same districts. It is commonly sown along
                    with turnips intended for feeding sheep, which will not touch woad. It is
                    generally harvested before the corn-crops are ready for the sickle. Near London,
                    the garden-ground extends over several thousand acres. The growing of plants,
                    for the use of the druggists and perfumers, engages much attention; and those
                    gardens supply peppermint, lavender, wormwood, chamomile, aniseed, liquorice,
                    poppy, and other similar articles. Hops are extensively cultivated near Farnham,
                    and are sold for higher prices than those of any other districts.</p>
                <p>No minerals are now raised in the county; for though iron is known to exist, and
                    was formerly worked with charcoal, the improvements in chemistry have fixed that
                    operation to the coal-districts. The fossil riches are valuable, especially
                    fullers’ earth, which is of the best quality, and in abundance, and supplies the
                    cloth manufacturers both in the west and north of England. Limestone is
                    plentiful; and that, as well as chalk, is converted into lime, upon a great
                    scale, for the use of the builders of the metropolis. The quarries of Merstham
                    produce an excellent fire-stone; and the sand near Dorking and Ryegate is in
                    great request for making glass, hour-glasses, and other purposes.</p>
                <p>The manufactures are various and extensive; but, being almost exclusively near
                    the metropolis, may more properly be considered as belonging to London than to
                    the county of Surrey. The principal of these are breweries and distilleries on a
                    magnificent scale. The tanners, rope and sail-makers, glass-makers, starch and
                    hair-powder makers, and the preparers of vinegar and raisin wines, carry on
                    large trades. A few miles farther from London, chiefly on the banks of the river
                    Wandle, the calico-printers and bleachers have large establishments.</p>
                <p>All the rivers of this county empty themselves into the Thames. The only
                    navigable river, besides that fine stream which bounds it, is the Wey, on which
                    barges pass above Guildford into the Basingstoke Canal. The Mole is a beautiful
                    small stream, celebrated for sinking into the ground, and at some few miles
                    lower again emerging. The Wandle runs a short course, but is of great value,
                    from the vast quantity of mill-machinery which it keeps in motion, and the
                    employment which it thus affords to several thousand persons. It rises in one
                    spring near Croydon, turns a large mill within a few yards of its source, and
                    runs nine miles before it joins the Thames. The Medway rises in Surrey, but is a
                    very small stream till it enters the county of Kent. The Loddon, a small river
                    on the western border, is chiefly valuable for the supply of water which it
                    affords to the Basingstoke Canal. That canal was one of the first executed in
                    this part of the kingdom, having been finished in 1796. The Croydon Canal only
                    reaches that town from the Thames; and the little success attending it has
                    prevented its being carried farther, as was originally intended. The Surrey
                    Canal runs parallel to the Thames; but, by avoiding the sinuosities of that
                    river, and the whole of the metropolis, is expected to be beneficial to the
                    inhabitants on the upper banks, by conveying coals and other heavy commodities
                    to them, from ships, at a cheap rate. Its entrance, from the Thames below London
                    Bridge, has a fine basin, capable of containing 100 sail of square-rigged

                    Merstham to the Thames; but the project has not repaid those who have advanced
                    the capital a sufficient interest to recommend any further attempts. Several
                    railroads which will pass through the county have been projected, and acts of
                    the legislature for some of them have been obtained: only one of them has yet
                    made much progress, namely, the London and Southampton. Some obstacles long
                    delayed that intended to proceed to Brighton, and the same is the case with the
                    one projected from London to Dover.</p>
                <p>Among the Roman antiquities of this county are the Ermine Way, which traversed
                    it, and the remains of which may still be traced near Dorking. The piles are
                    still standing in the river Thames at Walton, which were placed there by the
                    ancient Britons, to impede the passage of Julius Caesar. The vestiges of the
                    encampments of the Romans may be distinctly traced at Bottlehill, at Waltonhill,
                    and some other spots. Among the antiquities of later date, are the Palace of
                    Lambeth, belonging to the see of Canterbury; that of Farnham, belonging to the
                    see of Winchester; the remains <hi rend="italic">of</hi> the Abbey at Croydon,
                    the Castle of Guildford, Waverley Abbey, and some other Saxon edifices. The
                    meadow of Runnymead, St Anne’s Hill, the seat of the late Mr Fox, the park of
                    Richmond, and the terrace there, with the palace and gardens of Kew, are all
                    objects that excite a high degree of interest. It is difficult to determine
                    which of the towns is the capital of the county. The principal prison is in the
                    borough of Southwark, and the quarter-sessions are held there; but the lent
                    assizes are held at Kingston-on-Thames, and the summer assizes alternately at
                    Croydon and at Guildford.</p>
                <p>The titles derived from this county are those of the Duke of Richmond, the Earls
                    of Surrey, Guildford, and Onslow, and Baron Abinger. The county is formed into
                    the eastern and western division to elect two members for each. The election for
                    the east division is held at Croydon; and the other polling places are Ryegate,
                    Camberwell, and Kingston. The western election is held at Guildford; and the
                    other polling places are Dorking and Chertsey. The boroughs of Gatton and
                    Haselmere, which formerly returned two members each, have been disfranchised;
                    and Ryegate, which chose two, now elects but one member. Lambeth has been
                    erected into a borough, and returns two members; as do the ancient boroughs of
                    Southwark and Guildford.</p>
                <p>The number of seats belonging to noblemen and gentlemen in this county is so
                    great as to forbid the noticing of even all those which in any other county
                    would be deemed highly worthy of notice. The most remarkable are, her majesty’s
                    palace of Kew; Claremont, king of Belgium; Clandon Place, earl of Onslow; Pepper
                    Harrow, Lord Middleton; Oatlands, Lord Francis Egerton; Painshill, Lord
                    Carhampton; Ockham Park, earl of Lovelace; Addington Palace, archbishop of
                    Canterbury; Rooksnist, C. H. Turner, Esq.; Nonsuch Park, S. Farmer, Esq.;
                    Gatton, Lord Monson; Nork House, Lord Arden; Betchworth, Right Honourable H.
                    Goulbourne; Norbury Park, Joseph Dennison, Esq.</p>
