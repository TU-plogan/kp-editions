                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra

                <p><label type="entry">SERINAGUR</label>, a principality or province of Northern
                    Hindustan, situated chiefly between the 30th and 32st degrees of north latitude,
                    and between the 77th and 79th of east longitude. It is divided from Thibet by
                    the great mountain-wall of the Himalaya that bounds Hindustan on the north; it
                    has the great plain of the Ganges on the south; on the east the rivers Dauli,
                    Alcananda, and Ramgunga form its limits; and on the west it is bounded by the
                    stream of the Jumna. It is estimated to be a hundred and forty miles in length
                    by sixty in breadth, and to contain an area of nine thousand square miles. It
                    contains two geographical divisions, namely, Gurwal proper, which occupies the
                    whole of the lower ranges of hills and the sources of the Ganges, comprehending
                    the hilly and mountainous region from which that river springs. In former times
                    this principality also included Kumaon. In 1814 the Ghoorkhas possessed the
                    whole country extending northward to the dependencies of China. Since their
                    expulsion a new division has been effected, by which it has been separated into
                    two distinct portions; the British government having retained the Deyrah Doon,
                    the passes of the Ganges, and the Jumna, at either extremity of that valley, as
                    also all the country to the eastward of the Alcananda and Bhagirathi, which
                    last-mentioned tract has been annexed to Kumaon, and the remainder restored to
                    the expatriated rajah. The territories to the eastward are therefore at present
                    bounded by the Alcananda, from Radraprayag until its conjunction with the
                    Bhagirathi, and thence to the plains by the united streams of the Ganges, and
                    above Radraprayag, where the Alcananda receives the Mandakeri by the latter
                    river. All the territories to the east of that line have been permanently
                    annexed to Kumaon.</p>
                <p>The whole face of this country towards Lalldong southward forms one vast
                    assemblage of steep and lofty hills, of the rudest forms, and jumbled together
                    in all directions. They are sometimes disposed, with an appearance of
                    regularity, in parallel chains of no great extent, and shut in at their
                    termination by narrow ridges running across the valleys at right angles. The
                    summits are sharp and narrow, rising abruptly; and the distance between each
                    range being very short, the valleys are in consequence so confined that it would
                    be difficult in many of them to find room for an encampment of a thousand men.
                    The aspect of these mountainous regions is very different. There are many of the
                    ridges stony and naked, affording no shelter for birds or wild animals, while
                    others are covered with trees, and always green, being covered with a luxuriant
                    carpeting of shrubs and fragrant flowers. The eastern parts of the country to
                    the Ganges consist of lower ranges of hills, extending eastward to an undefined
                    extent, and covered with extensive forests of oak, holly, horse-chestnut, fir,
                    and beds of strawberries, equalling in flavour those in Europe. Over this
                    extensive and mostly desert country inhabitants are very thinly scattered, a
                    great proportion of it being left in the undisturbed possession of the wild
                    animals, such as the elephant, which is, however, greatly inferior in size and
                    quality to the Chittagong elephant, on which account it is seldom domesticated;
                    the tiger, the leopard, and generally all the other animals which are found to
                    range among the tropical forests. The country is chiefly watered by the Ganges,
                    and its head streams the Bhagirathi and Alcananda, by the junction of which it
                    is formed at Devaprayaga. The latter is a considerable river, and is joined by
                    &gt;ts tributaries the Mandakini, the Pinden, the Mandaioki, the Birke, and the
                    Dauli; while the Bhagirathi is joined by the Bilhang. Some of these rivers bring
                    a large accession of water to the main stream; and they have most of them their
                    remote sources in the Himalaya Mountains. None of these streams being fordable,
                    and, besides, descending with all the violence of mountain-torrents, and their
                    channel being too much encumbered with rocks and stones to ad mit the use of
                    boats, they are crossed by rope and platform bridges at the most convenient
                    points of communication; while the roads are merely footpaths running along the
                    slope of a mountain in the direction of the principal streams and water-courses,
                    and being only practicable in many places for hill-porters. (See the article <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Hindustan.)</hi> Sheep and goats are also trained to traverse
                    the difficult road, and to act as beasts of burden. They arc loaded with small
                    bags, containing twelve pounds of grain each, and are despatched in flocks of
                    from 150 to 200, under the charge of two or three shepherds with their dogs. A
                    steady old well-trained ram is extremely serviceable in carrying goods in these
                    mountainous countries, particularly grain, which forms a principal article of
                    commerce. From the higher region salt is brought back.</p>
                <p>In 1796, while Serinagur or Gurwal included Kumaon, and was an independent
                    principality, the revenues amounted to five lacs of rupees per annum, which sum
                    was made up of the duties on imports and exports, the land-rents, the working of
                    mines and washing of gold. The other sources of revenue arose from a tax on the
                    importation of rock-salt and borax from Bootan; of musk in pods, chow-ries,
                    hawks, and male and female slaves from the countries bordering on Bhadrinath; of
                    cotton cloths of all descriptions from the province of Oude; and of salt from
                    Lahore.</p>
                <p>Gold is found among the sands of most of the mountain-streams. The principal
                    places where it is gathered are Carnaprayaga, Pacenkoonda, Devaprayaga,
                    Rickercase, and Lakherighaut. There are in the mountains mines of copper, which
                    in 1816 were let out for one year at 1850 rupees. Prior to the Ghoorkha invasion
                    these mines were said to yield 52,000 rupees. During the confusion consequent on
                    that event some of them have been choked up with rubbish; and to recover them
                    from their present condition would require more capital than any native ever
                    possesses. At Nagpoor and Dhunpoor, to the north and northeast of Serinagur, are
                    two copper-mines, which are said to produce fifty per cent. At Dessouly, a
                    considerable distance to the east, there is a lead-mine; and iron is produced in
                    many parts of the country. Near Jarachi Ghaut, in the eastern quarter of the
                    province, there is a quarry of very fine marble.</p>
                <p>The ancient name of this province was Gurwal; and while it was an independent
                    state the rajah’s forces were estimated at 5000 men, armed with matchlocks, bows
                    and arrows, and swords and shields, but without discipline. In 1791 the
                    Nepaulese made an attempt to reduce this country, but met with such unexpected
                    resistance, that they desisted from the attempt. From this date, however, the
                    Serinagur rajah became tributary to the Ghoorkhali dynasty. In 1803 an army of
                    10,000 men marched to complete the conquest, and a battle took place, which
                    decided the contest between the Serinagur and Nepaul rajahs in favour of the
                    latter.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Serinagur,</hi> a town of Hindustan, in the province of
                    Serinagur, of which it is the capital. It is situated in the centre of a valley
                    watered by the river Alcananda, which extends a mile and a half to the eastward,
                    and the same distance to the westward, of the town. It is of an elliptical form,
                    being in length about three quarters of a mile, and much less in breadth. The
                    houses are built of rough stone and mud, generally raised to a second floor, and
                    covered with slate. They are remarkably crowded together; and the streets are so
                    narrow as scarcely to leave room for two persons to pass. The house of the
                    former rajahs is in the middle of the town, and is the largest, being raised to
                    a fourth story, and built of a coarse granite. The town is now in a ruinous
                    condition, having been reduced to poverty and insignificance by a variety of
                    causes; by the invasion of the Nepaulese at the end of the year 1803, the
                    earthquake which took place in the same year, the encroachments annually<pb
                    break="no" facs="ht:chi.28490924&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=134"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0720-0134-0120"/> made by the Alcananda, and, finally, by the
                    oppressive government under its Ghoorkhali rulers. The inhabitants are chiefly
                    Hindus, the number of Mahommedan families not exceeding sixty or seventy, and
                    most of these being petty shopkeepers. The Hindu inhabitants are chiefly the
                    descendants of emigrants from the Doab and province of Oude. Serinagur is the
                    seat of an inconsiderable trade, the most profitable branch of which consists of
                    a traffic in silver and specie, which is carried on to a considerable amount by
                    the leading persons in the town, who are agents of the great banking-houses at
                    Najibabad and in the Doab, and who are employed in the sale of merchandise and
                    coins. The other articles of trade are the produce of the hills, consisting of
                    coarse hempen cloth, hemp, lead, copper, drugs, gums, wool, and a sort of
                    flannel made of wool. From Bootan are imported cow-tails, musk, saffron, borax,
                    salt, drugs of different kinds, and a few shawls that are sent circuitously from
                    Cashmere. Hawks are also brought from the hills. The articles received in
                    exchange are coarse cotton and woollen cloths, silk, spices, Lahore salt, sugar,
                    and tobacco. The air of Serinagur is unfavourable to strangers, on which account
                    many of the merchants forsake it during the rainy season. Long. 79. 18. E. Lat.
