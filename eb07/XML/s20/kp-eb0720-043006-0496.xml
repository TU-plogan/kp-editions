                <p><label type="entry">SNEEZING</label>, a convulsive motion of the muscles of the
                    breast, by which the air is expelled from the nose with much vehemence and
                    noise. It is caused by the irritation of the upper membrane of the nose, excited
                    by acrid substances floating in the air, or by medicines called <hi
                    rend="italic">sternutatory.</hi></p>
                <p>This irritation is occasioned either externally, by strong smells, or by dust
                    floating in the air, and taken in by inspiration; or by sharp pungent medicines,
                    as cresses and other sternutatories, which vellicate the membrane of the nose;
                    or internally, by the acrimony of the lympha or mucus, which naturally moistens
                    that membrane. The matter cast forth in sneezing comes primarily from the nose
                    and throat, the pituitary membrane continually exuding a mucus; and,
                    secondarily, from the breast, the trachea, and the bronchia of the lungs.</p>
                <p>The practice of saluting the person who sneezed existed in Africa, among nations
                    unknown to the Greeks and Romans. The accounts we have of Monomotapa inform
                    us,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Strada, Prol.
                    Acad.</p></note> that when the prince sneezes, all his subjects in the capital
                    are advertised of it, that they may offer up prayers for his safety. The author
                    of the <hi rend="italic">Conquest of Peru</hi> assures us, that the cacique of
                    Guachoia having sneezed in presence of the Spaniards, the Indians of his train
                    fell prostrate before him, stretched forth their hands, and displayed to him the
                    accustomed marks of respect, while they invoked the sun to enlighten him, to
                    defend him, and to be his constant guard.</p>
                <p>Every body knows that the Romans saluted each other on these occasions: and Pliny
                    relates,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>’ Plin. Hist.
                    Nat. lib. ii. cap. 2.</p></note> that Tiberius exacted these signs of homage
                    when drawn in his chariot. Superstition, whose influence can debase every thing,
                    had degraded this custom for several ages, by attaching favourable or
                    unfavourable omens to sneezing, according to the hour of the day or night,
                    according to the signs of the zodiac, according as a work was more or less
                    advanced, or according as one had sneezed to the right or to the left.<note

                <p>Polydore Virgil pretends, that in the time of Gregory the Great, there reigned in
                    Italy an epidemic distemper, which carried off by sneezing all those who were
                    seized by it; and that this pontiff ordered prayers to be made against it,
                    accompanied by certain signs of the cross. But besides that there are very few
                    cases in which sneezing can be considered as dangerous, and that it is
                    frequently a favourable symptom,<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>• Hippocrates. Halleri Phys.</p></note> it is evident, that
                    we ought not to date from the sixth century the origin of a custom which loses
                    itself in the obscurity of antiquity. Avicenna and Cardan aver that it is a sort
                    of convulsion, which gives occasion to dread an epilepsy, and that this disease
                    is endeavoured to be warded off by prayers. Clement of Alexandria considers it
                    as a mark of intemperance and effeminacy, which ought to be proscribed; and he
                    inveighs bitterly against those who endeavour to procure sneezing by external
                    aid. Montaigne, on the contrary, explains this fact in a tone rather cynical. It
                    is singular enough, that so many ridiculous, contradictory, and superstitious
                    opinions, have not abolished those customary civilities which are still
                    preserved equally among high and low; and which only the Anabaptists and Quakers
                    have rejected, because they have renounced salutations in every case.</p>
                <p>Among the Greeks sneezing was almost always a good omen. It excited mirks of
                    tenderness, of respect, and at-<pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:chi.28490924&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=497" xml:id="kp-eb0720-0497-0431"/>
                    tachment. The genius of Socrates informed him by sneezing, when it was necessary
                    to perform any action. The young Parthenis, hurried on by her passion, resolved
                    to write to Sarpedon an avowal of her love; she sneezes in the most tender and
                    impassioned part of her letter: this is sufficient for her; this incident
                    supplies the place of an answer, and persuades her that Sarpedon is her lover.
                    Penelope, harassed by the vexatious courtship of her suitors, begins to curse
                    them all, and to pour forth vows for the return of Ulysses. Her son Telemachus
                    interrupts her by a loud sneeze. She instantly exults with joy, and regards this
                    sign as an assurance of the approaching return of her husband. Xenophon was
                    haranguing his troops; a soldier sneezed in the moment when he was exhorting
                    them to embrace a dangerous but necessary resolution. The whole army, moved by
                    this presage, determined to pursue the project of their general; and Xenophon
                    ordered sacrifices to Jupiter the preserver.</p>
                <p>This religious reverence for sneezing, so ancient, and so universal even in the
                    times of Homer, always excited the curiosity of the Greek philosophers, and of
                    the rabbins. These last have spread a tradition, that, after the creation of the
                    world, God made a general law to this purport, that every living man should
                    sneeze but once in his life, and that at the same instant he should render up
                    his soul into the hand of his Creator, without any preceding indisposition.
                    Jacob obtained an exemption from the common law, and the favour of being
                    informed of his last hour. He sneezed and did not die; and this sign of death
                    was changed into a sign of life. Notice of this was sent to all the princes of
                    the earth; and they ordained that in future sneezing should be accompanied with
                    forms of blessing, and vows for the persons who sneezed.</p>
                <p>Aristotle likewise remounts to the sources of natural religion. He observes, that
                    the brain is the origin of the nerves, of our sentiments, our sensations, the
                    seat of the soul, the image of the Divinity; that upon all these accounts, the
                    substance of the brain has ever been held in honour; that the first men swore by
                    their head; that they durst not touch nor eat the brains of any animal; that it
                    was even a sacred word which they dared not to pronounce. Filled with these
                    ideas, it is not wonderful that they extended their reverence even to sneezing.
                    Such is the opinion of the most ancient and sagacious philosophers of
                    Greece.</p>
                <p>According to mythology, the first sign of life Prometheus’s artificial man gave
                    was by sternutation. This supposed creator is said to have stolen a portion of
                    the solar rays; and filling with them a phial, which he had made on purpose,
                    sealed it up hermetically. He instantly flies back to his favourite automaton,
                    and opening the phial, holds it close to the statue; the rays still retaining
                    all their activity, insinuate themselves through the pores, and set the
                    fictitious man a-sneezing. Prometheus, transported with the success of his
                    machine, offers up a fervent prayer, with wishes for the preservation of so
                    singular a being. His automaton observed him, and, remembering his ejaculations,
                    was very careful, on the like occasions, to offer these wishes in behalf of his
                    descendants, who perpetuated it from father to son in all their colonies.</p>
