                    type="authorial"><p>' Mr. Campbell, the latest editor of Shakspeare’s dramatic
                    works, observes that “the poet’s name has been variously written Shax-peare,
                    Shackspeare, Shakspeare, and Shakspere; ’ to which varieties might be added
                    Shagspere, from the Worcester Marriage License, published in 1836. But the fact
                    is, that by combining with all the differences in spelling the first syllable,
                    all those in spelling the second, more than twenty-five distinct varieties of
                    the name may be expanded (like an algebraic series), for the choice of the
                    curious in mis-spelling. Above all things, those varieties which arise from the
                    intercalation of the middle <hi rend="italic">e</hi> (that is, the <hi
                    rend="italic">e</hi> immediately before the final syllable <hi rend="italic"
                    >spear),</hi> can never be overlooked by those who remember, at the opening of
                    the Duncriad, the note upon this very question about the orthography of
                    Shakspeare’s name, as also upon the other great question about the title of the
                    immortal Satire, Whether it ought not to have been the Dunceiade, seeing that
                    Dunce, its great author and progenitor, cannot possibly dispense with the letter
                    <hi rend="italic">c</hi>. Meantime we must remark, that the first three of Mr
                    Campbell’s variations are mere caprices of the press; as is Shagspere; or, more
                    probably, this last euphonious variety arose out of the gross clownish
                    pronunciation of the two hiccuping “<hi rend="italic">marksmen"</hi> who rode
                    over to "Worcester for the license; and one cannot forbear laughing at the
                    bishop’s secretary for having been so misled by two varlets, professedly
                    incapable of signing their own names. The same drunken villains had cut down the
                    bride’s name <hi rend="italic">Hathaway</hi> into <hi rend="italic"
                    >Hathwey.</hi> Finally, to treat the matter with seriousness. Sir Frederick
                    Madden has shown, in his recent letter to the Society of Antiquaries, that the
                    poet himself in all probability wrote the name uniformly <hi rend="italic"
                    >Shakspere.</hi> Orthography, both of proper names, of appellatives, and of
                    words universally, was very unsettled up to a period long subsequent to that of
                    Shakspeare. Still it must usually have happened that names written variously and
                    laxly by others, woud be written uniformly by the owners; especially by those
                    owners who had occasion to sign their names frequently, and by literary people,
                    whose attention was often, as well as consciously, directed to the proprieties
                    of spelling. <hi rend="italic">Shakspeare</hi> is now too familiar to the eye
                    for any alteration to be attempted; but it is pretty certain that Sir Frederick
                    Madden is right in stating the poet s own signature to have been uniformly <hi
                    rend="italic">Shakspere.</hi> It is so written twice in the course of his will,
                    and it is so written on a blank leaf of Florio’s English translation of
                    Montaigne’s Essays; a book recently discovered, and sold, on account of its
                    autograph, for a hundred guineas.</p></note><hi rend="smallcaps">William
                    Shakespeare</hi>, the protagonist on the great arena of modern poetry, and the
                    glory of the human intellect, was born at Stratford-upon-Avon, in the county of
                    Warwick, in the year 1564, and upon some day, not precisely ascertained, in the
                    month of April. It is certain that he was baptized on the 25th; and from that
                    fact, combined with some shadow of a tradition, Malone has inferred that he was
                    born on the 23d. There is doubtless, on the one hand, no absolute necessity
                    deducible from law or custom, as either operated in those times, which obliges
                    us to adopt such a conclusion; for children might be baptized, and were baptized
                    at various distances from their birth: yet, on the other hand, the 23d is as
                    likely to have been the day as any other; and more likely than any earlier day,
                    upon two arguments. First, because there was probably a tradition floating in
                    the seventeenth century, that Shakspeare died upon his birth-day: now it is
                    beyond a doubt that he died upon the 23d of April. Secondly, because it is a
                    reasonable presumption, that no parents, living in a simple community, tenderly
                    alive to the pieties of household duty, and in an age still clinging
                    reverentially to the ceremonial ordinances of religion, would much delay the
                    adoption of their child into the great family of Christ. Considering the extreme
                    frailty of an infant’s life during its two earliest years, to delay would often
                    be to disinherit the child of its Christian privileges; privileges not the less
                    eloquent to the feelings from being profoundly mysterious, and, in the English
                    church, forced not only upon the attention, but even upon the eye, of the most
                    thoughtless. According to the discipline of the English church, the unbaptized
                    are buried with “maimed rites,” shorn of their obsequies, and sternly denied
                    that “sweet and solemn farewell” by which otherwise the church expresses her
                    final charity with all men; and not only so, but they are even <hi rend="italic"
                    >locally</hi> separated and sequestrated. Ground the most hallowed, and populous
                    with Christian burials of households,</p>
                <p>That died in peace with one another,</p>
                <p>Father, sister, son, and brother.</p>
                <p>opens to receive the vilest malefactor; by which the church symbolically
                    expresses her maternal willingness to gather back into her fold those even of
                    her flock who have strayed from her by the most memorable aberrations; and yet,
                    with all this indulgence she banishes to unhallowed ground the innocent bodies
                    of the unbaptized. To them and to suicides she turns a face of wrath. With this
                    gloomy fact offered to the very external senses, it is difficult to suppose
                    that, any parents would risk their own reproaches by putting the fulfilment of
                    so grave a duty on the hazard of a convulsion fit. The case of royal children is
                    different; their baptisms, it is true, were often delayed for weeks; but the
                    household chaplains of the palace were always at hand, night and day, to baptize
                    them in the very agonies of death.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>’ But, as a proof that, even in the case of royal
                    christenings, it was not thought pious to “tempt God," as it were, by delav,
                    Edward V I. the only son of Henry VIII. was born on the 12th day of October in
                    the year 1537. And there was a delay on account of the sponsors since the birth
                    was not in London. Yet how little that delay was made, may be seen by this fact:
                    The birth took place in the dead of the night, the day was Friday; and yet, in
                    spite of all delay, the christening was most pompously celebrated on the
                    succeeding Monday. And Prince Arthur, the elder brother of Henry VIII. was
                    christened on the very next Sunday succeeding to his birth, notwithstanding an
                    inevitable delay, occasioned by the distance of Lord Oxford, his godfather, and
                    the excessive rains, which prevented the earl being reached by couriers, or
                    himself reaching Winchester, without extraordinary exertions.</p></note> We must
                    presume, therefore, that William Shakspeare was born on some day very little
                    anterior to that of his baptism; and the more so because the season of the year
                    was lovely and genial, the 23d of April in 1564 corresponding in fact with what
                    we now call the 3d of May, so that, whether the child was to be carried abroad,
                    or the clergyman to be summoned, no hindrance would arise from the weather. One
                    only argument has sometimes struck us for supposing that the 22d might be the
                    day, and not the 23d; which is, that Shakspeare’s sole grand-daughter, Lady
                    Barnard, was married on the 22d of April 1626, ten years exactly from the poet’s
                    death; and the reason for choosing this day <hi rend="italic">might</hi> have
                    had a reference to her illustrious grandfather’s birthday; which, there is good
                    reason for thinking, would be celebrated as a festival in the family for
                    generations. Still this choice <hi rend="italic">may</hi> have been an accident,
                    or governed merely by reason of convenience. And, on the whole, it is as well
                    perhaps to acquiesce in the old belief, that Shakspeare was born and died on the
                    23d of April. We cannot do wrong if we drink to his memory on both 22d and
                    23d.</p>
                <p>On a first review of the circumstances, we have reason to feel no little
                    perplexity in finding the materials for a life of this transcendent writer so
                    meagre and so few; and amongst them the larger part of doubtful authority. All
                    the energy of curiosity directed upon this subject, through a period of one
                    hundred and fifty years (for so long it is since Betterton the actor began to
                    make researches) has availed us little or nothing. Neither the local traditions
                    of his provincial birth-place, though sharing with London through half<pb

                    nor the recollections of that brilliant literary circle with whom he lived in
                    the metropolis, have yielded much more than such an outline of his history as is
                    oftentimes to be gathered from the penurious records of a grave-stone. That he
                    lived, and that he died, and that he was “a little lower than the angels —these
                    make up pretty nearly the amount of our undisputed report. It may be doubted
                    indeed whether at this day we are as accurately acquainted with the life of
                    Shakspeare as with that of Chaucer, though divided from each other by an
                    interval of two centuries, and (what should have been more effectual towards
                    oblivion) by the wars of the two roses. And yet the traditional memory of a
                    rural and a sylvan region, such as Warwickshire at that time was, is usually
                    exact as well as tenacious; and, with respect to Shakspeare in particular, we
                    may presume it to have been full and circumstantial through the generation
                    succeeding to his own, not only from the curiosity, and perhaps something of a
                    scandalous interest, which would pursue the motions of one living so large a
                    part of his life at a distance from his wife, but also from the final reverence
                    and honour which would settle upon the memory of a poet so pre-eminently
                    successful; of one who, in a space of five-and-twenty years, after running a
                    bright career in the capital city of his native land, and challenging notice
                    from the throne, had retired with an ample fortune, created by his personal
                    efforts, and by labours purely intellectual.</p>
                <p>How are we to account, then, for that deluge, as if from Lethe, which has swept
                    away so entirely the traditional memorials of one so illustrious? Such is the
                    fatality of error which overclouds every question connected with Shakspeare,
                    that two of his principal critics, Steevens and Malone, have endeavoured to
                    solve the difficulty by cutting it with a falsehood. They deny in effect that he
                    <hi rend="italic">was</hi> illustrious in the century succeeding to his own,
                    however much he has since become so. We shall first produce their statements in
                    their own words, and we shall then briefly review them.</p>
                <p>Steevens delivers <hi rend="italic">his</hi> opinion in the following terms :—
                    “How little Shakspeare was once read, may be understood from Tate, who, in his
                    dedication to the altered play of King Lear, speaks of the original as an
                    obscure piece, recommended to his notice by a friend; and the author of the
                    Tatler, having occasion to quote a few lines out of Macbeth, was content to
                    receive them from Davenant’s alteration of that celebrated drama, in which
                    almost every original beauty is either awkwardly disguised or arbitrarily
                    omitted.” Another critic, who cites this passage from Steevens, pursues the
                    hypothesis as follows :—“In fifty years after his death, Dryden mentions that he
                    was then become <hi rend="italic">a little obsolete.</hi> In the beginning of
                    the last century, Lord Shaftesbury complains of his <hi rend="italic">rude
                    unpolished style, and his antiquated phrase and wit.</hi> It is certain that,
                    for nearly a hundred years after his death, partly owing to the immediate
                    revolution and rebellion, and partly to the licentious taste encouraged in
                    Charles IL’s time, and perhaps partly to the incorrect state of his works, he
                    was <hi rend="smallcaps">almost</hi> ENTIRELY <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Neglected.”</hi> This critic then goes on to quote with approbation the opinion
                    of Malone,—“that if he had been read, admired, studied, and imitated, in the
                    same degree as he is now, the enthusiasm of some one or other of his admirers in
                    the last age would have induced him to make some inquiries concerning the
                    history of his theatrical career, and the anecdotes of his private life.” After
                    which this enlightened writer re-affirms and clenches the judgment he has quoted
                    by saying,—“His admirers, however, <hi rend="italic">if he had admirers in that
                    age,</hi> possessed no portion of such enthusiasm.”</p>
                <p>It may perhaps be an instructive lesson to young readers, if we now show them, by
                    a short sifting of these confident dogmatists, how easy it is for a careless or
                    a half-read man to circulate the most absolute falsehoods under the semblance of
                    truth; falsehoods which impose upon himself as much as they do upon others. We
                    believe that not one word or illustration is uttered in the sentences cited from
                    these three critics, which is not <hi rend="italic">virtually</hi> in the very
                    teeth of the truth.</p>
                <p>To begin with Mr Nahum Tate:—This poor grub of lite-ratme, if he did really speak
                    of Lear as “an <hi rend="italic">obscure</hi> piece, recommended to his notice
                    by a friend,” of which we must be allowed to doubt, was then uttering a
                    conscious falsehood. It happens that Lear was one of the few Shakspearian dramas
                    which had kept the stage unaltered. But it is easy to see a mercenary motive in
                    such an artifice as this. Mr Nahum Tate is not of a class of whom it can be safe
                    to say that they are “well known they and their desperate tricks are essentially
                    obscure, and good reason he has to exult in the felicity of such obscurity; for
                    else this same vilest of travesties, Mr Nahum’s Lear, would consecrate his name
                    to everlasting scorn. For himself, he belonged to the age of Dryden rather than
                    of Pope: he “flourished,” if we can use such a phrase of one who was always
                    withering, about the era of the Revolution; and his Lear, we believe, was
                    arranged in the year 1682. But the family to which he belongs is abundantly
                    recorded in the Dunciad; and his own name will be found amongst its catalogues
                    of heroes.</p>
                <p>With respect to <hi rend="italic">the author of the Tntler,</hi> a very different
                    explanation is requisite. Steevens means the render to understand Addison; but
                    it does not follow that the particular paper in question was from his pen.
                    Nothing, however, could be more natural than to quote from the common form of
                    the play as then in possession of the stage. It was <hi rend="italic"
                    >there,</hi> beyond a doubt, that a fine gentleman living upon town, and not
                    professing any deep scholastic knowledge of literature (a light in which we are
                    always to regard the writers of the Spectator, Guardian, &amp;c.), would be
                    likely to have learned anything he quoted from Macbeth. This we say generally of
                    the writers in those periodical papers; but, with reference to Addison in
                    particular, it is time to correct the popular notion of his literary character,
                    or at least to mark it by severer lines of distinction. It is already pretty
                    well known, that Addison had no very intimate acquaintance with the literature
                    of his own country. It is known also, that he did not think such an acquaintance
                    any ways essential to the character of an elegant scholar and <hi rend="italic"
                    >litterateur.</hi> Quite enough he found it, and more than enough for the time
                    he had to spare, if he could maintain a tolerable familiarity with the foremost
                    Latin poets, and a very slender one indeed with the Grecian. <hi rend="italic"
                    >How</hi> slender, we can see in his “Travels.” Of modern authors, none as yet
                    had been published with notes, commentaries, or critical collations of the text;
                    and, accordingly, Addison looked upon all of them, except those few who
                    professed themselves followers in the retinue and equipage of the ancients, as
                    creatures of a lower race. Boileau, as a mere imitator and propagator of Horace,
                    he read, and probably little else, amongst the French classics. Hence it arose
                    that he took upon himself to speak sneeringly of Tasso. To this, which was a
                    bold act for his timid mind, he was emboldened by the countenance of Boileau. Of
                    the elder Italian authors, such as Ariosto, and, <hi rend="italic">a
                    fortiori,</hi> Dante, he knew absolutely nothing. Passing to our own literature,
                    it is certain that Addison was profoundly ignorant of Chaucer and of Spenser.
                    Milton only,—and why? simply because he was a brilliant scholar, and stands like
                    a bridge between the Christian literature and the Pagan,—Addison had read and
                    esteemed. There was also in the very constitution of Milton’s mind, in the
                    majestic regularity and planetary solemnity of its <hi rend="italic">epic</hi>
                    movements, something which he could understand and appreciate: as to the
                    meteoric and incalculable eccentricities of the <hi rend="italic">dramatic</hi>
                    mind, as it dis-<pb break="no" facs="ht:chi.28490924&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=189"

                    amongst the Titans of 1590-1630, they confounded and overwhelmed him.</p>
                <p>In particular, with regard to Shakspeare, we shall now proclaim a discovery which
                    we made some twenty years ago. We, like others, from seeing frequent references
                    to Shakspeare in the Spectator, had acquiesced in the common belief, that,
                    although Addison was no doubt profoundly unlearned in Shakspeare’« language, and
                    thoroughly unable to do him justice (and this we might well assume, since his
                    great rival Pope, who had expressly studied Shakspeare, was, after all, so
                    memorably deficient in the appropriate knowledge),—yet, that of course he had a
                    vague popular knowledge of the mighty poet’s cardinal dramas. Accident only led
                    us into a discovery of our mistake. Twice or thrice we had observed, that if
                    Shakspeare were quoted, that paper turned out not to be Addison’s; and at
                    length, by express examination, we ascertained the curious fact, that Addison
                    has never in one instance quoted or made any reference to Shakspeare. But was
                    this, as Steevens most disingenuously pretends, to be taken as an exponent of
                    the public feeling towards Shakspeare? Was Addison’s neglect representative of a
                    general neglect? If so, whence came Rowe’s edition. Pope’s, Theobald’s, Sir
                    Thomas Hanmer’s, Bishop Warburton’s, all upon the heels of one another? With
                    such facts staring him in the face, how shameless must be that critic who could,
                    in support of such a thesis, refer to <hi rend="italic">“the author of the
                    Tatler,”</hi> contemporary with all these editors. The truth is, Addison was
                    well aware of Shakspeare’s hold on the popular mind; too well aware of it. The
                    feeble constitution of the poetic faculty, as existing in himself, forbade his
                    sympathising with Shakspeare; the proportions were too colossal for his delicate
                    vision; and yet, as one who sought popularity himself, he durst not shock what
                    perhaps he viewed as a national prejudice. Those who have happened, like
                    ourselves, to see the effect of passionate music and “deep-inwoven harmonics”
                    upon the feeling of an idiot,<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>A great modem poet refers to this very ease of music
                    entering “the mouldy chambers of the dull idiot’s brain but in support of what
                    seems to us a baseless hypothesis.</p></note> may conceive what we mean. Such
                    music does not utterly revolt the idiot; on the contrary, it has a strange but a
                    horrid fascination for him: it alarms, irritates, disturbs, makes him profoundly
                    unhappy; and chiefly by unlocking imperfect glimpses of thoughts and slumbering
                    instincts, which it is for his peace to have entirely obscured, because for him
                    they can be revealed only partially, and with the sad effect of throwing a
                    baleful gleam upon his blighted condition. Do we mean, then, to compare Addison
                    with an idiot? Not generally, by any means. Nobody can more sincerely admire him
                    where he was a man of real genius, viz. in his delineations of character and
                    manners, or in the exquisite delicacies of his humour. But assuredly Addison, as
                    a poet, was amongst the sons of the feeble; and between the authors of Cato and
                    of King Lear there was a gulf never to be bridged over.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>• Probably Addison’s fear of the national
                    feeling was a good deal strengthened by his awe of Milton and of Dryden, both of
                    whom had expressed a homage towards Shakspeare which language cannot transcend.
                    Amongst his political friends also were many intense admirers of
                    Shakspeare.</p></note></p>
                <p>But Dryden, we are told, pronounced Shakspeare already in <hi rend="italic"
                    >his</hi> day “<hi rend="italic">a little obsolete.”</hi> Here now we have
                    wilful, deliberate falsehood. <hi rend="italic">Obsolete,</hi> in Dryden’s
                    meaning, does not imply that he was so with regard to his popularity (the
                    question then at issue), but with regard to his diction and choice of words. To
                    cite Dryden as a witness for any purpose against Shakspeare,—Dryden, who of all
                    men had the most ransacked wit and exhausted language in celebrating the
                    supremacy of Shakspeare’s genius, does indeed require as much shamelessness in
                    feeling as mendacity in principle.</p>
                <p>But then Lord Shaftesbury, who may be taken as half way between Dryden and Pope
                    (Dryden died in 1700, Pope was then twelve years old, and Lord S. wrote chiefly,
                    we believe, between 1700 and 1710), “complains,” it seems, “of his rude
                    unpolished style, and his antiquated phrase and wit.” What if he does? Let the
                    whole truth be told, and then we shall see how much stress is to be laid upon
                    such a judgment. The second Lord Shaftesbury, the author of the Characteristics
                    was the grandson of that famous political agitator, the Chancellor Shaftesbury,
                    who passed his whole life in storms of his own creation. The second Lord
                    Shaftesbury was a man of crazy constitution, querulous from ill health, and had
                    received an eccentric education from his eccentric grandfather. He was practised
                    daily in <hi rend="italic">talking</hi> Latin, to which afterwards he added a
                    competent study of the Greek; and finally he became unusually learned for his
                    rank, but the most absolute and undistinguishing pedant that perhaps literature
                    has to show. He sneers continually at the regular built academic pedant; but he
                    himself, though no academic, was essentially the very impersonation of pedantry.
                    No thought however beautiful, no image however magnificent, could conciliate his
                    praise as long as it was clothed in English; but present him with the most
                    trivial common-places in Greek, and he unaffectedly fancied them divine;
                    mistaking the pleasurable sense of his own power in a difficult and rare
                    accomplishment for some peculiar force or beauty in the passage. Such was the
                    outline of his literary taste. And was it upon Shakspeare only, or upon him
                    chiefly, that he lavished his pedantry? Far from it. He attacked Milton with no
                    less fervour; he attacked Dryden with a thousand times more. Jeremy Taylor he
                    quoted only to ridicule; and even Locke, the confidential friend of his
                    grandfather, he never alludes to without a sneer. As to Shakspeare, so far from
                    Lord Shaftesbury’s censures arguing his deficient reputation, the very fact of
                    his noticing him at all proves his enormous popularity; for upon system he
                    noticed those only who ruled the public taste. The insipidity of his objections
                    to Shakspeare may be judged from this, that he comments in a spirit of absolute
                    puerility upon the name <hi rend="italic">Desdemona,</hi> as though
                    intentionally formed from the Greek word for <hi rend="italic"
                    >superstition.</hi> In fact, he had evidently read little beyond the list of
                    names in Shakspeare; yet there is proof enough that the irresistible beauty of
                    what little he <hi rend="italic">had</hi> read was too much for all his
                    pedantry, and startled him exceedingly; for ever afterwards he speaks of
                    Shakspeare as one who, with a little aid from Grecian sources, really had
                    something great and promising about him. As to modem authors, neither this Lord
                    Shaftesbury nor Addison read anything for the latter years of their life but
                    Bayle’s Dictionary. And most of the little scintillations of erudition which may
                    be found in the notes to the Characteristics, and in the Essays of Addison, are
                    derived, almost without exception, and uniformly without acknowledgment, from
                    Bayle.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>’ He who is weak
                    enough to kick and spurn his own native literature, even if it were done with
                    more knowledge than is shown by Lord Shaftesbury, will usually be kicked and
                    spurned in his turn; and accordingly it has been often remarked, that the
                    Characteristics are unjustly neglected in our days. For Lord Shaftesbury, with
                    all his pedantry, was a man of great talents. Leibnitz had the sagacityto see
                    this through the mists of a translation.</p></note></p>
                <p>Finally, with regard to the sweeping assertion, that “for nearly a hundred years
                    after his death Shakspeare was almost entirely neglected,” we shall meet this
                    scandalous falsehood by a rapid view of his fortunes during the century in
                    question. The tradition has always been, that Shakspeare was honoured by the
                    especial notice of Queen Elizabeth, as well as by that of James I. At one time
                    we were disposed to question the truth of this tradition; but that was for want
                    of<pb break="no" facs="ht:chi.28490924&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=190"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0720-0190-0172"/> having read attentively the lines of Ben Jonson
                    to the memory of Shakspeare, those generous lines which have so absurdly been
                    taxed with faint praise. Jonson could make no mistake on this point: he, as one
                    of Shakspeare’s familiar companions, must have witnessed at the very time, and
                    accompanied with friendly sympathy, every motion of royal favour towards
                    Shakspeare. Now he, in words which leave no room for doubt, exclaims</p>
                <p>Sweet swan of Avon, what a sight it were To see thee in our waters yet
                    appear;</p>
                <p>And make those flights upon the banks of Thames <hi rend="italic">That to did
                    take Eliza and our James.</hi></p>
                <p>These princes, then, <hi rend="italic">were</hi> taken, were fascinated, with
                    some of Shakspeare’s dramas. In Elizabeth the approbation would probably be
                    sincere. In James we can readily suppose it to have been assumed; for he was a
                    pedant in a different sense from Lord Shaftesbury; not from undervaluing modern
                    poetry, but from caring little or nothing for any poetry, although he wrote
                    about its mechanic rules. Still the royal <hi rend="italic">imprimatur</hi>
                    would be influential and serviceable no less when offered hypocritically than in
                    full sincerity. Next let us consider, at the very moment of Shakspeare’s death,
                    who were the leaders of the British youth, the <hi rend="italic">principes
                    juventutis,</hi> in the two fields, equally important to a great poet’s fame, of
                    rank and of genius? The Prince of Wales and John Milton; the first being then
                    about sixteen years old, the other about eight. Now these two great powers, as
                    we may call them, these presiding stars over all that was English in thought and
                    action, were both impassioned admirers of Shakspeare. Each of them counts for
                    many thousands. The Prince of Wales<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Perhaps the most bitter political enemy of Charles I. will
                    have the candour to allow that, for a prince of those times, he was truly and
                    eminently accomplished. His knowledge of the arts was considerable; and, as a
                    patron of art, he stands foremost amongst all British sovereigns to this hour.
                    He said truly of himself, and wisely as to the principle, that he understood
                    English law as well as a gentleman ought to understand it; meaning that an
                    attorney’s minute knowledge of forms and technical niceties was illiberal.
                    Speaking of him as an author, we must remember that the <hi rend="italic">Eikon

                    supposing the king’s claim negatived, still, in his controversy with Henderson,
                    in his negotiations at the Isle of Wight and elsewhere, he discovered a power of
                    argument, a learning, and a strength of memory, which are truly admirable;
                    whilst the whole of his accomplishments are recommended by a modesty and a
                    humility as rare as they are unaffected."</p></note> ' had learned to appreciate
                    Shakspeare, not originally from reading him, but from witnessing the court
                    representations of his plays at Whitehall. Afterwards we know that he made
                    Shakspeare his closet companion, for he was reproached with doing so by Milton.
                    And we know also, from the just criticism pronounced upon the character and
                    diction of Caliban by one of Charles’s confidential counsellors, Lord Falkland,
                    that the king’s admiration of Shakspeare had impressed a determination upon the
                    court reading. As to Milton, by double prejudices, puritanical and classical,
                    his mind had been preoccupied against the full impressions of Shakspeare. And we
                    know that there is such a thing as keeping the sympathies of love and admiration
                    in a dormant state, or state of abeyance; an effort of self-conquest realized in
                    more cases than one by the ancient fathers, both Greek and Latin, with regard to
                    the profane classics. Intellectually they admired, and would not belie their
                    admiration; but they did not give their hearts cordially, they did not abandon
                    themselves to their natural impulses. They averted their eyes and weaned their
                    attention from the dazzling object. Such, probably, was Milton’s state of
                    feeling towards Shakspeare after 1642, when the theatres were suppressed, and
                    the fanatical fervour in its noontide heat. Yet even then he did not belie his
                    reverence intellectually for Shakspeare; and in his younger days we know that he
                    had spoken more enthusiastically of Shakspeare than he ever did again of any
                    uninspired author. Not only did he address a sonnet to his memory, in which he
                    declares that kings would wish to die, if by dying they could obtain such a
                    monument in the hearts of men; but he also speaks of him in his <hi
                    rend="italic">Il Penseroso</hi> as the tutelary genius of the English stage. In
                    this transmission of the torch (λαμπαδoφoϑια) Dryden succeeds to Milton; he was
                    born nearly thirty years later; about thirty years they were contemporaries; and
                    by thirty years, or nearly, Dryden survived his great leader. Dryden, in fact,
                    lived out the seventeenth century. And we have now arrived within nine years of
                    the era when the critical editions started in hot succession to one another. The
                    names we have mentioned were the great influential names of the century. But of
                    inferior homage there was no end. How came Betterton the actor, how came
                    Devenant, how came Rowe, or Pope, by their intense (if not always sound)
                    admiration for Shakspeare, unless they had found it fuming upwards like incense
                    to the Pagan deities in ancient times from altars erected at every turning upon
                    all the paths of men?</p>
                <p>But it is objected that inferior dramatists were sometimes preferred to
                    Shakspeare; and again, that vile travesties of Shakspeare were preferred to the
                    authentic dramas. As to the first argument, let it be remembered, that if the
                    saints of the chapel are always in the same honour, because <hi rend="italic"
                    >there</hi> men are simply discharging a duty, which once due will be due for
                    ever; the saints of the theatre, on the other hand, must bend to the local
                    genius, and to the very reasons for having a theatre at all. Men go thither for
                    amusement: this is the paramount purpose; and even acknowledged merit or
                    absolute superiority must give way to it. Does a man at Paris expect to see
                    Molière reproduced in proportion to his admitted precedency in the French drama?
                    On the contrary, that very precedency argues such a familiarization with his
                    works, that those who are in quest of relaxation will reasonably prefer any
                    recent drama to that which, having lost all its novelty, has lost much of its
                    excitement. We speak of ordinary minds; but in cases of <hi rend="italic"
                    >public</hi> entertainments, deriving part of their power from scenery and stage
                    pomp, novelty is for all minds an essential condition of attraction. Moreover,
                    in some departments of the comic, Beaumont and Fletcher, when writing in
                    combination, really had a freedom and breadth of manner which excels the comedy
                    of Shakspeare. As to the altered Shakspeare as taking precedency of the genuine
                    Shakspeare, no argument can be so frivolous. The public were never allowed a
                    choice; the great majority of an audience even now cannot be expected to carry
                    the real Shakspeare in their mind, so as to pursue a comparison between that and
                    the alteration. Their comparisons must be exclusively amongst what they have
                    opportunities of seeing; that is, between the various pieces presented to them
                    by the managers of theatres. Further than this it is impossible for them to
                    extend their office of judging and collating; and the degenerate taste which
                    substituted the caprices of Davenant, the rants of Dryden, or the filth of Tate,
                    for the jewellery of Shakspeare, cannot with any justice be charged upon the
                    public, not one in a thousand of whom was furnished with any means of comparing,
                    but exclusively upon those (viz. theatrical managers) who had the very amplest.
                    Yet even in excuse for <hi rend="italic">them</hi> much may be said. The very
                    length of some plays compelled them to make alterations. The best of
                    Shakspeare’s dramas, King Lear, is the least fitted for representation; and,
                    even for the vilest alteration, it ought in candour to be considered that
                    possession is nine points of the law. He who would not have introduced, was
                    often obliged to retain.</p>
                <p>Finally, it is urged, that the small number of editions through which Shakspeare
                    passed in the seventeenth century, furnishes a separate argument, and a
                    conclusive one, against his popularity. We answer, that, considering the<pb

                    xml:id="kp-eb0720-0191-0173"/> bulk of his plays collectively, the editions were
                    <hi rend="italic">not few:</hi> compared with any known case, the copies sold of
                    Shakspeare were quite as many as could be expected under the circumstances. Ten
                    or fifteen times as much consideration went to the purchase of one great folio
                    like Shakspeare, as would attend the purchase of a little volume like Waller or
                    Donne. Without reviews, or newspapers, or advertisements to diffuse the
                    knowledge of books, the progress of literature was necessarily slow, and its
                    expansion narrow. But this is a topic which has always been treated unfairly,
                    not with regard to Shakspeare only, but to Milton, as well as many others. The
                    truth is, we have not facts enough to guide us; for the number of editions often
                    tells nothing accurately as to the number of copies. With respect to Shakspeare
                    it is certain, that, had his masterpieces been gathered into small volumes,
                    Shakspeare would have had a most extensive sale. As it was, there can be no
                    doubt, that from his own generation, throughout the seventeenth century, and
                    until the eighteenth began to accommodate, not any greater popularity in <hi
                    rend="italic">him,</hi> but a greater taste for reading in the public, his fame
                    never ceased to be viewed as a national trophy of honour; and the most
                    illustrious men of the seventeenth century were no whit less fervent in their
                    admiration than those of the eighteenth and the nineteenth, either as respected
                    its strength and sincerity, or as respected its open profession.<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The necessity of compression
                    obliges us to omit many arguments and references by which we could demonstrate
                    the fact, that Shakspeare’s reputation was always in a progressive state;
                    allowing only for the interruption of about seventeen years, which this poet, in
                    common with all others, sustained, not so much from the state of war (which did
                    not fully occupy four of those years), as from the triumph of a gloomy
                    fanaticism. Deduct the twenty-three years of the seventeenth century which had
                    elapsed before the first folio appeared, to this space add seventeen years of
                    fanatical madness, during fourteen of which <hi rend="italic">all</hi> dramatic
                    entertainments were suppressed, the remainder is sixty years. And surely the
                    sale of four editions of a vast folio in that space of time was an expression of
                    an abiding interest. <hi rend="italic">No other poet, except Spenser, continual
                    to sell throughout the century.</hi> Besides, in arguing the case of a <hi
                    rend="italic">dramatic</hi> poet, we must bear in mind, that although readers of
                    learned books might be diffused over the face of the land, the readers of poetry
                    would be chiefly concentred in the metropolis; and such persons would have no
                    need to buy what they heard at the theatres. But then comes the question,
                    whether Shakspeare kept possession of the theatres. And we are really humiliated
                    by the gross want of sense which has been shown, by Malone chiefly, but also by
                    many others, in discussing this question. From the Restoration to 1682, says
                    Malone, no more than four plays of Shakspeare’s were performed by a principal
                    company in London- “Such was the lamentable taste of those times, that the plays
                    of Fletcher, Jonson, and Shlrley, were much oftener exhibited than those of our
                    author." What cant is this! If that taste were “lamentable," what are we to
                    think of our own times, when plays a thousand times below those of Fletcher, or
                    even of Shirley, continually displace Shakspeare? Shakspeare would himself have
                    exulted in finding that he gave way only to dramatists so excellent. And, as we
                    have before observed, both then and now, it is the very familiarity with
                    Shakspeare which often banishes him from audiences honestly in quest of
                    relaxation and amusement. Novelty is the very soul of such relaxation; but in
                    our closets, when we are <hi rend="italic">not</hi> unbending, when our minds
                    are in a state of tension from intellectual cravings, then it is that we resort
                    to Shakspeare; and oftentimes those who honour him most, like ourselves, are the
                    most impatient of seeing his divine scenes disfigured by unequal representation
                    (good, perhaps, in a single personation, bad in all the rest); or to hear his
                    divine thoughts mangled in the recitation; or (which is worst of alD to hear
                    them dishonoured and defeated by imperfect apprehension in the audience, or by
                    defective sympathy. Meantime, if one theatre played only four of Shakspeare’s
                    dramas, another played at least seven. But the grossest folly of Malone is, in
                    fancying the numerous alterations so many insults to Shakspeare, whereas they
                    expressed as much homage to his memory as if the unaltered dramas had been
                    retained. The substance <hi rend="italic">was</hi> retained. The changes were
                    merely concessions to the changing views of scenical propriety; sometimes, no
                    doubt, made with a simple view to the revolution effected by Davenant at the
                    restoration, in bringing <hi rend="italic">scene,</hi> (in the painter’s sense)
                    upon the stage; sometimes also with a view to the altered fashions of the
                    audience during the suspensions of the action, or perhaps to the introduction of
                    <hi rend="italic">after·pieces,</hi> by which, of course, the time was abridged
                    for the main performance. A volume might be written upon this subject. Meantime
                    let us never be told, that a poet was losing, or bad lost his ground, who found
                    in his lowest depression, amongst his almost idolatrous supporters, a great king
                    distracted by civil wars, a mighty republican poet distracted by puritanical
                    fanaticism, the greatest successor by far of that great poet, a papist and a
                    bigoted royalist, and finally, the leading actor of the century, who gave and
                    reflected the ruling impulses of his age.</p></note> lt is therefore a false
                    notion, that the general sympathy with the merits of Shakspeare ever beat with a
                    languid or intermitting pulse. Undoubtedly, in times when the functions of
                    critical journals and of newspapers were not at hand to diffuse or to strengthen
                    the impressions which emanated from the capital, all opinions must have
                    travelled slowly into the provinces. But even then, whilst the perfect organs of
                    communication were wanting, indirect substitutes were supplied by the
                    necessities of the times, or by the instincts of political zeal. Two channels
                    especially lay open between the great central organ of the national mind, and
                    the remotest provinces. Parliaments were occasionally summoned (for the judges’
                    circuits were too brief to produce much effect); and during their longest
                    suspensions, the nobility, with large retinues, continually resorted to the
                    court. But an intercourse more constant and more comprehensive was maintained
                    through the agency of the two universities. Already, in the time of James I.,
                    the growing importance of the gentry, and the consequent birth of a new interest
                    in political questions, had begun to express itself at Oxford, and still more so
                    at Cambridge. Academic persons stationed themselves as sentinels at London, for
                    the purpose of watching the court and the course of public affairs. These
                    persons wrote letters, like those of the celebrated Joseph Mede, which we find
                    in Ellis’s Historical Collections, reporting to their fellow-collegians all the
                    novelties of public life as they arose, or personally carried down such reports,
                    and thus conducted the general feelings at the centre into lesser centres, from
                    which again they were diffused into the ten thousand parishes of England; for
                    (with a very few exceptions in favour of poor benefices, Welch or Cumbrian),
                    every parish priest must unavoidably have spent his three years at one or other
                    of the English universities. And by this mode of diffusion it is that we can
                    explain the strength with which Shakspeare’s thoughts and diction impressed
                    themselves from a very early period upon the national literature, and even more
                    generally upon the national thinking and conversation.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>One of the profoundest tests by which we can
                    measure the congeniality of an author with the national genius and temper, is
                    the degree in which his thoughts or his phrases interweave themselves with our
                    daily conversation, and pass into the currency of the language. <hi

                    than in the observance,” “palmy state,” “my poverty and not my will consents,’
                    and so forth, without end. This reinforcement of the general language, by aids
                    from the mintage of Shakspeare, had already commenced in the seventeenth
                    century.</p></note></p>
                <p>The question therefore revolves upon us in threefold difficulty, How, having
                    stepped thus prematurely into this inheritance of fame, leaping, as it were,
                    thus abruptly into the favour alike of princes and the enemies of princes, had
                    it become possible that in his native place (honoured still more in the final
                    testimonies of his preference when founding a family mansion), such a man’s

                    themselves by gracious manners, could so soon and so utterly have been
                    obliterated?</p>
                <p>Malone, with childish irreflection, ascribes the loss of such memorials to the
                    want of enthusiasm in his admirers. Local researches into private history had
                    not then commenced. Such a taste, often petty enough in its management was the
                    growth of after-ages. Else how came Spenser’s life and fortunes to be so utterly
                    overwhelmed in oblivion? No poet of a high order could be more popular.</p>
                <p>The answer we believe to be this: Twenty-six years after Shakspeare’s death
                    commenced the great parliamentary war: this it was, and the local feuds arising
                    to divide family from family, brother from brother, upon which we must charge
                    the extinction of traditions and memorials, doubtless abundant up to that era.
                    The parliamentary contest it will be said, did not last above three years; the
                    king’s standard having been first raised at Nottingham in August 1642, and the
                    battle of Naseby (which terminated the open warfare) having been fought in June
                    1645. Or even if we extend its duration to the surrender of the last garrison,
                    that war terminated in the spring of 1646. And the brief explosions of
                    insurrection or of Scottish invasion which occurred on subsequent occasions were
                    all locally confined; and none came near to Warwickshire, except the battle of
                    Worcester, more than five years after. This is true; but a short war will do
                    much to efface recent and merely personal memorials. And the following
                    circumstances of the war were even more important than the general fact.</p>
                <p>First of all, the very mansion founded by Shakspeare became the military
                    head-quarters for the queen in 1644, when marching from the eastern coast of
                    England to join the king in Oxford; and one such special visitation would be
                    likely to do more serious mischief in the way of extinction, than many years of
                    general warfare. Secondly, as a fact perhaps, equally important Birmingham, the
                    chief town of Warwickshire, and the adjacent district the seat of our hardware
                    manufactures, was the very focus of disaffection towards the royal cause. Not
                    only, therefore, would this whole region suffer more from internal and
                    spontaneous agitation, but it would be the more frequently traversed
                    vindictively from without and harassed by flying parties from Oxford, or others
                    of the king’s garrisons. Thirdly, even apart from the political aspects of
                    Warwickshire, this county happens to be the central one of England, as regards
                    the roads between the north and south; and Birmingham has long been the great
                    central axis,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>In fact,
                    by way of representing to himself the system or scheme of the English roads, the
                    reader has only to imagine one great letter X, or a St Andrew’s cross, laid down
                    from north to south, and decussating at Birmingham. Even Coventry, which makes a
                    slight variation for one or two roads, and so far disturbs this decussation, by
                    shifting it eastwards, is still in Warwickshire.</p></note> in which all the

                    therefore, of local position, much more when united with that avowed inveteracy
                    of malignant feeling, which was bitter enough to rouse a re-action of bitterness
                    in the mind of Lord Clarendon, would go far to account for the wreck of many
                    memorials relating to Shakspeare, as well as for the subversion of that quiet
                    and security for humble life, in which the traditional memory finds its best <hi
                    rend="italic">nidus.</hi> Thus we obtain one solution, and perhaps the main one,
                    of the otherwise mysterious oblivion which had swept away all traces of the
                    mighty poet by the time when those quiet days revolved upon England, in which
                    again the solitary agent of learned research might roam in security from house
                    to house, gleaning those personal remembrances which, even in the fury of civil
                    strife, might long have lingered by the chimney corner. But the fierce furnace
                    of war had probably, by its <hi rend="italic">local</hi> ravages, scorched this
                    field of natural tradition, and thinned the gleaner’s inheritance by three parts
                    out of four. This, we repeat may be one part of the solution to this difficult
                    problem.</p>
                <p>And if another is still demanded, possibly it may be found in the fact hostile to
                    the perfect consecration of Shakspeare’s memory, that after all he was a player.
                    Many a coarse-minded country gentleman, or village pastor, who would have held
                    his town glorified by the distinction of having sent forth a great judge or an
                    eminent bishop, might disdain to cherish the personal recollections which
                    surrounded one whom custom regarded as little above a mountebank, and the
                    illiberal law as a vagabond. The same degrading appreciation attached both to
                    the actor in plays and to their author. The contemptuous appellation of “play
                    book,” served as readily to degrade the mighty volume which contained Lear and
                    Hamlet, as that of “play-actor,” or “player-man,” has always served with the
                    illiberal or the fanatical to dishonour the persons of Roscius or of Garrick, of
                    Talma or of Siddons. Nobody, indeed, was better aware of this than the
                    noble-minded Shakspeare; and feelingly he has breathed forth in his sonnets this
                    conscious oppression under which he lay of public opinion, unfavourable by a
                    double title to his own pretensions; for, being both dramatic author and
                    dramatic performer, he found himself heir to a two-fold opprobrium, and at an
                    era of English society when the weight of that opprobrium was heaviest. In
                    reality, there was at this period a collision of forces acting in opposite
                    directions upon the estimation of the stage and scenical art and therefore of
                    all the ministers in its equipage. Puritanism frowned upon these pursuits, as
                    ruinous to public morals; on the oilier hand, loyalty could not but tolerate
                    what was patronized by the sovereign; and it happened that Elizabeth, James, and
                    Charles I., were all alike lovers and promoters of theatrical amusements, which
                    were indeed more indispensable to the relief of court ceremony, and the monotony
                    of aulic pomp, than in any other region of life. This royal support, and the
                    consciousness that any brilliant success in these arts implied an unusual share
                    of natural endowments, did something in mitigation of a scorn which must else
                    have been intolerable to all generous natures.</p>
                <p>But whatever prejudice might thus operate against the perfect sanctity of
                    Shakspeare’s posthumous reputation, it is certain that the splendour of his
                    worldly success must have done much to obliterate that effect; his admirable
                    colloquial talents a good deal, and his gracious affability still more. The
                    wonder therefore w ill still remain, that Betterton, in less than a century from
                    his death, should have been able to glean so little. And for the solution of
                    this wonder we must throw ourselves chiefly upon the explanations we have made
                    as to the parliamentary war, and the local ravages of its progress in the very
                    district of the very town, and the very house.</p>
                <p>If further arguments are still wanted to explain this mysterious abolition, we
                    may refer the reader to the following succession of disastrous events, by which
                    it should seem that a perfect malice of misfortune pursued the vestiges of the
                    mighty poet’s steps. In 1613, the Globe theatre, with which he had been so long
                    connected, was burned to the ground. Soon afterwards a great fire occurred in
                    Stratford; and next (without counting upon the fire of London, just fifty years
                    after his death, which, however, would consume many an important record from
                    periods far more remote), the house of Ben Jonson, in which probably, as Mr
                    Campbell suggests, might be parts of his correspondence, was also burned.
                    Finally, there was an old tradition that Lady Barnard, the sole grand-daughter
                    of Shakspeare, had carried off many of his papers from Stratford; and these
                    papers have never since been traced.</p>
                <p>In many of the elder lives it has been asserted, that John Shakspeare, the father
                    of the poet, was a butcher,<pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:chi.28490924&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=193" xml:id="kp-eb0720-0193-0175"/>
                    and in others that he was a woolstapler. It is now settled beyond dispute that
                    he was a glover. This was his professed occupation in Stratford, though it is
                    certain that, with this leading trade, from which he took his denomination, he
                    combined some collateral pursuits; and it is possible enough that, as openings
                    offered, he may have meddled with many. In that age, and in a provincial town,
                    nothing like the exquisite subdivision of labour was attempted which we now see
                    realized in the great cities of Christendom. And one trade is often found to
                    play into another with so much reciprocal advantage, that even in our own days
                    we do not much wonder at an enterprising man, in country places, who combines
                    several in his own person. Accordingly John Shakspeare is known to have united
                    with his town calling the rural and miscellaneous occupations of a farmer.</p>
                <p>Meantime his avowed business stood upon a very different footing from the same
                    trade as it is exercised in modem times. Gloves were in that age an article of
                    dress more costly by much, and more elaborately decorated, than in our own. They
                    were a customary present from some cities to the judges of assize, and to other
                    official persons; a custom of ancient standing, and in some places, we believe,
                    still subsisting; and in such cases it is reasonable to suppose that the gloves
                    must originally have been more valuable than the trivial modern article of the
                    same name. So also, perhaps, in their origin, of the gloves given at funerals.
                    In reality, whenever the simplicity of an age makes it difficult to renew the
                    parts of a wardrobe except in capital towns of difficult access, prudence
                    suggests that such wares should be manufactured of more durable materials; and,
                    being so, they become obviously susceptible of more lavish ornament. But it will
                    not follow, from this essential difference in the gloves of Shakspeare’s age,
                    that the glover’s occupation was more lucrative. Doubtless he sold more costly
                    gloves, and upon each pair had a larger profit; but for that very reason he sold
                    fewer. Two or three gentlemen “of worship” in the neighbourhood might
                    occasionally require a pair of gloves, but it is very doubtful whether any
                    inhabitant of Stratford would ever call for so mere a luxury.</p>
                <p>The practical result, at all events, of John Shakspeare’s various pursuits does
                    not appear permanently to have met the demands of his establishment; and in his
                    maturer years there are indications still surviving that he was under a cloud of
                    embarrassment. He certainly lost at one time his social position in the town of
                    Stratford; but there is a strong presumption, in <hi rend="italic">our</hi>
                    construction of the case, that he finally retrieved it; and for this retrieval
                    of a station which he had forfeited by personal misfortunes or neglect, he was
                    altogether indebted to the filial piety of his immortal son.</p>
                <p>Meantime the earlier years of the elder Shakspeare wore the aspect of rising
                    prosperity, however unsound might be the basis on which it rested. There can be
                    little doubt that William Shakspeare, from his birth up to his tenth or perhaps
                    his eleventh year, lived in careless plenty, and saw nothing in his father’s
                    house but that style of liberal housekeeping which has ever distinguished the
                    upper yeomanry and the rural gentry of England. Probable enough it is that the
                    resources for meeting this liberality were not strictly commensurate with the
                    family income, but were sometimes allowed to entrench, by means of loans or
                    mortgages, upon capital funds. The stress upon the family finances was perhaps
                    at times severe; and that it was borne at all, must be imputed to the large and
                    even splendid portion which John Shakspeare received with his wife.</p>
                <p>This lady, for such she really was in an eminent sense, by birth as well as by
                    connections, bore the beautiful name of Mary Arden, a name derived from the
                    ancient forest district<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>And probably so called by some remote ancestor who had emigrated from the
                    forest of Ardennes, in the Netherlands, and <hi rend="italic">now</hi> for ever
                    memorable to English ears from its proximity to Waterloo.</p></note> of the
                    county; and doubtless she merits a more elaborate notice than our slender
                    materials will furnish. To have been <hi rend="italic">the mother of
                    Shakspeare,—</hi> how august a title to the reverence of infinite generations,
                    and of centuries beyond the vision of prophecy. A plausible hypothesis has been
                    started in modern times, that the facial structure, and that the intellectual
                    conformation, may be deduced more frequently from the corresponding
                    characteristics in the mother than in the father. It is certain that no very
                    great man has ever existed, but that his greatness has been rehearsed and
                    predicted in one or other of his parents. And it cannot be denied, that in the
                    most eminent men, where we have had the means of pursuing the investigation, the
                    mother has more frequently been repeated and reproduced than the father. We have
                    known cases where the mother has furnished all the intellect, and the father all
                    the moral sensibility; upon which assumption, the wonder ceases that Cicero,
                    Lord Chesterfield, and other brilliant men, who took the utmost pains with their
                    sons, should have failed so conspicuously; for possibly the mothers had been
                    women of excessive and even exemplary stupidity. In the case of Shakspeare, each
                    parent, if we had any means of recovering their characteristics, could not fail
                    to furnish a study of the most profound interest; and with regard to his mother
                    in particular, if the modern hypothesis be true, and if we are indeed to deduce
                    from <hi rend="italic">her</hi> the stupendous intellect of her son, in that
                    case she must have been a benefactress to her husband’s family beyond the
                    promises of fairyland or the dreams of romance; for it is certain that to her
                    chiefly this family was also indebted for their worldly comfort.</p>
                <p>Mary Arden was the youngest daughter and the heiress of Robert Arden of
                    Wilmecote, Esq. in the county of Warwick. The family of Arden was even then of
                    great antiquity. About one century and a quarter before the birth of William
                    Shakspeare, a person bearing the same name as his maternal grandfather had been
                    returned by the commissioners in their list of the Warwickshire gentry; he was
                    there styled Robert Arden, Esq. of Bromich. This was in 1433, or the l’2th year
                    of Henry VI. In Henry VII.'s reign, the Ardens received a grant of lands from
                    the crown; and in 1568, four years after the birth of William Shakspeare, Edward
                    Arden, of the same family, was sheriff of the county. Mary Arden was therefore a
                    young lady of excellent descent and connections, and an heiress of considcrable
                    wealth. She brought to her husband, as her marriage portion, the landed estate
                    of As-bics, which, upon any just valuation, must be considered as a handsome
                    dowry for a woman of her station. As this point has been contested, and as it
                    goes a great way towards determining the exact social position of the poet’s
                    parents, let us be excused for sifting it a little more narrowly than might else
                    seem warranted by the proportions of our present life. Every question which it
                    can be reasonable to raise at all, it must be reasonable to treat with at least
                    so much of minute research as may justify the conclusions which it is made to
                    support.</p>
                <p>The estate of Asbies contained fifty acres of arable land, six of meadow, and a
                    right of commonage. What may we assume to have been the value of its fee-simple?
                    Malone, who allows the total fortune of Mary Arden to have been L.110. 13s. 4d,
                    is sure that the value of Asbies could not have been more than one hundred
                    pounds. But why? Because, says he, the “average” rent of land at that time was
                    no more than three shillings per acre. This we deny; but<pb break="no"

                    upon that assumption, the total yearly rent of fifty-six acres would be exactly
                    eight guineas.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Let not
                    the reader impute to us the gross anachronism of making an estimate for
                    Shakspeare’s days in a coin which did not exist until a century, within a couple
                    of years, after Shakspeare’s birth, and did not settle to the value of
                    twenty-one shillings until a century after his death-The nerve of such an
                    anachronism would lie in putting the estimate into a mouth of that age. And this
                    is precisely the blunder into which the foolish forger of Vortigern, Ac. has
                    fallen. He does not indeed directly mention guineas; but indirectly and
                    virtually he does, by repeatedly giving us accounts imputed to Shakspearian
                    contemporaries, in which the sum-total amounts to L.5. 5s.; or to L.26. 5s.; or,
                    again, to L.17. 17s. 6d. A man is careful to subscribe L.14. 14s. and so forth.
                    But how could such amounts have arisen unless under a secret reference to
                    guineas, which were not in existence until Charles II.’s reign; and, moreover,
                    to guineas at their final settlement by law into twenty-one shillings each,
                    which did not take place until George I.’s reign.</p></note> And therefore, in
                    assigning the value of Ashies at one hundred pounds, it appears that Malone must
                    have estimated the land at no more than twelve years’ purchase, which would
                    carry the value to L.100. 16s. “Even at this estimate,” as the latest

                    Arden’s portion was a larger one than was usually given to a landed gentleman’s
                    daughter.” But this writer objects to Malone’s principle of valuation. “We
                    find,” says he, “that John Shakspeare also farmed the meadow of Tugton,
                    containing sixteen acres, at the rate of eleven shillings per acre. Now what
                    proof has Mr Malone adduced that the acres of Asbies were not as valuable as
                    those of Tugton? And if they were so, the former estate must have been worth
                    between three and four hundred pounds.” In the main drift of his objections we
                    concur with Mr Campbell. But as they are liable to some criticism, let us clear
                    the ground of all plausible cavils, and then see what will be the result.
                    Malone, had he been alive, would probably have answered, that Tugton was a farm
                    specially privileged by nature; and that if any man contended for so unusual a
                    rent as eleven shillings an acre for land not known to him, the <hi
                    rend="italic">onus probandi</hi> would lie upon <hi rend="italic">him</hi>. Be
                    it so; eleven shillings is certainly above the ordinary level of rent, but three
                    shillings is below it. We contend, that for tolerably good land, situated
                    advantageously, that is, with a ready access to good markets and good fairs,
                    such as those of Coventry, Birmingham, Gloucester, Worcester, Shrewsbury,
                    &amp;c., one noble might be assumed as the annual rent; and that in such
                    situations twenty years’ purchase was not a valuation, even in Elizabeth’s
                    reign, very unusual. Let us, however, assume the rent at only five shillings,
                    and land at sixteen years’ purchase: upon this basis, the rent would be L.14,
                    and the value of the feesimple L.224. Now, if it were required to equate that
                    sum with its present value, a very operose<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    and, after all, merely tentative in the results, to assign the true value in

                    calculation might be requisite. But contenting ourselves with the gross method
                    of making such equations between 1560 and the current century, that is,
                    multiplying by five, we shall find the capital value of the estate to be eleven
                    hundred and twenty pounds, whilst the annual rent would be exactly seventy. But
                    if the estate had been sold, and the purchasemoney lent upon mortgage (the only
                    safe mode of investing money at that time), the annual interest would have
                    reached L.28, equal to L.140 of modern money; for mortgages in Elizabeth’s age
                    readily produced ten per cent.</p>
                <p>A woman who should bring at this day an annual income of L.140 to a provincial
                    tradesman, living in a sort of <hi rend="italic">rus in urbe,</hi> according to
                    the simple fashions of rustic life, would assuredly be considered as an
                    excellent match. And there can be little doubt that Mary Arden’s dowry it was
                    which, for some ten or a dozen years succeeding to his marriage, raised her
                    husband to so much social consideration in Strat ford. In 1550 John Shakspeare
                    is supposed to have first settled in Stratford, having migrated from some other
                    part of Warwickshire. In 1557 he married Mary Arden; in 1565, the year
                    subsequent to the birth of his son William, his third child, he was elected one
                    of the aldermen; and in the year 1568 he became first magistrate of the town, by
                    the title of high bailiff. This year we may assume to have been that in which
                    the prosperity of this family reached its zenith; for in this year it was, over
                    and above the presumptions furnished by his civic honours, that he obtained a
                    grant of arms from Clarencieux of the Heralds’ College. On this occasion he
                    declared himself worth five hundred pounds derived from his ancestors. And we
                    really cannot understand the right by which critics, living nearly three
                    centuries from his time, undertake to know his affairs better than himself, and
                    to tax him with either inaccuracy or falsehood. No man would be at leisure to
                    court heraldic honours when he knew himself to be embarrassed, or apprehended
                    that he soon might be so. A man whose anxieties had been fixed at all upon his
                    daily livelihood would, by this chase after the aerial honours of heraldry, have
                    made himself a butt for ridicule such as no fortitude could enable him to
                    sustain.</p>
                <p>In 1568, therefore, when his son William would be moving through his fifth year,
                    John Shakspeare (now honoured by the designation of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Master)</hi> would be found at times in the society of the neighbouring gentry.
                    Ten years in advance of this period he was already in difficulties. But there is
                    no proof that these difficulties had then reached a point of degradation, or of
                    memorable distress. The sole positive indications of his decaying condition are,
                    that in 1578 he received an exemption from the small weekly assessment levied
                    upon the aldermen of Stratford for the relief of the poor; and that in the
                    following year, 1579, he is found enrolled amongst the defaulters in the payment
                    of taxes. The latter fact undoubtedly goes to prove that, like every man who is
                    falling back in the world, he was occasionally in arrears. Paying taxes is not
                    like the honours awarded or the processions regulated by Clarendeux; no man is
                    ambitious of precedency there; and if a laggard pace in that duty is to be
                    received as evidence of pauperism, nine tenths of the English people might
                    occasionally be classed as paupers. With respect to his liberation from the
                    weekly assessment, that may bear a construction different from the one which it
                    has received. This payment, which could never have been regarded as a burthen,
                    not amounting to five pounds annually of our present money, may have been held
                    up as an exponent of wealth and consideration; and John Shakspeare may have been
                    required to resign it as an honourable distinction, not suitable to the
                    circumstances of an embarrassed man. Finally, the fact of his being indebted to
                    Robert Sadler, a baker, in the sum of five pounds, and his being under the
                    necessity of bringing a friend as security for the payment, proves nothing at<pb

                    xml:id="kp-eb0720-0195-0177"/> all. There is not a town in Europe in which
                    opulent men cannot be found that are backward in the payment of their debts. And
                    the probability is, that Master Sadler acted like most people who, when they
                    suppose a man to be going down in the world, feel their respect for him sensibly
                    decaying, and think it wise to trample him under foot, provided only in that act
                    of trampling they can squeeze out of him their own individual debt. Like that
                    terrific chorus in Spohr’s oratorio of St Paul, “<hi rend="italic">stone him to
                    death"</hi> is the cry of the selfish and the illiberal amongst creditors, alike
                    towards the just and the unjust amongst debtors.</p>
                <p>It was the wise and beautiful prayer of Agar, “Give me neither poverty nor riches
                    ;” and, doubtless, for quiet, for peace, and the <hi rend="italic">latentis
                    semita vitae,</hi> that is the happiest dispensation. But, perhaps, with a view
                    to a school of discipline and of moral fortitude, it might be a more salutary
                    prayer, “Give me riches <hi rend="italic">and</hi> poverty, and afterwards
                    neither.” For the transitional state between riches and poverty will teach a
                    lesson both as to the baseness and the goodness of human nature, and will
                    impress that lesson with a searching force, such as no borrowed experience ever
                    can approach. Most probable it is that Shakspeare drew some of his powerful
                    scenes in the Timon of Athens, those which exhibit the vileness of ingratitude
                    and the impassioned frenzy of misanthropy, from his personal recollections
                    connected with the case of his own father. Possibly, though a cloud of 270 years
                    now veils it, this very Master Sadler, who was so urgent for his five pounds,
                    and who so little apprehended that he should be called over the coals for it in
                    the Encyclopaedia Britannica, may have sate for the portrait of that Lucullus
                    who says of Timon—</p>
                <p>Alas, good lord! a noble gentleman 'tis, if he would not keep so good a house.
                    Many a tune and often I have dined with him, and told him on’t; and come again
                    to supper to him, of purpose to have him spend less: and yet he would embrace no
                    counsel, take no warning by my coming. Every man has his fault, and honesty is
                    his; I have told him on't, but I could never get him from it.</p>
                <p>For certain years, perhaps, John Shakspeare moved on in darkness and sorrow:</p>
                <p>His familiars from his buried fortunes Slunk all away; left their false vows with
                    him,</p>
                <p>Like empty purses pick'd: and his poor self,</p>
                <p>A dedicated beggar to the air,</p>
                <p>With his disease of all-shunn’d poverty,</p>
                <p>Walk'd, like contempt, alone.</p>
                <p>We, however, at this day are chiefly interested in the case as it bears upon the
                    education and youthful happiness of the poet. Now if we suppose that from 1568,
                    the high noon of the family prosperity, to 1578, the first year of their mature
                    embarrassments, one half the interval was passed in stationary sunshine, and the
                    latter half in the gradual twilight of declension, it will follow that the young
                    William had completed his tenth year before he heard the first signals of
                    distress; and for so long a period his education would probably be conducted on
                    as liberal a scale as the resources of Stratford would allow. Through this
                    earliest section of his life he would undoubtedly rank as a gentleman’s son,
                    possibly as the leader of his class, in Stratford. But what rank he held through
                    the next ten years, or, more generally, what was the standing in society of
                    Shakspeare until he had created a new station for himself by his own exertions
                    in the metropolis, is a question yet unsettled, but which has been debated as
                    keenly as if it had some great dependencies. Upon this we shall observe, that
                    could we by possibility be called to settle beforehand what rank were best for
                    favouring the development of intellectual powers, the question might wear a face
                    of deep practical importance; but when the question is simply as to a matter of
                    fact, what <hi rend="italic">was</hi> the rank held by a man whose intellectual
                    development bas long ago been completed, this becomes a mere question of
                    curiosity. The tree has fallen; it is confessedly the noblest of all the forest;
                    and we must therefore conclude that the soil in which it flourished was either
                    the best possible, or, if not so, that any thing bad in its properties had been
                    disarmed and neutralized by the vital forces of the plant, or by the benignity
                    of nature. If any future Shakspeare were likely to arise, it might be a problem
                    of great interest to agitate, whether the condition of a poor man or of a
                    gentleman were best fitted to nurse and stimulate his faculties. But for the
                    actual Shakspeare, since what he was he was, and since nothing greater can be
                    imagined, it is now become a matter of little moment whether his course lay for
                    fifteen or twenty years through the humilities of absolute poverty, or through
                    the chequered paths of gentry lying in the shade. Whatever <hi rend="italic"
                    >was,</hi> must, in this case at least, have been the best, since it terminated
                    in producing Shakspeare; and thus far we must all be optimists.</p>
                <p>Yet still, it will be urged, the curiosity is not illiberal which would seek to
                    ascertain the precise career through which Shakspeare ran. This we readily
                    concede; and we are anxious ourselves to contribute any thing in our power to
                    the settlement of a point so obscure. What we have wished to protest against is
                    the spirit of partisanship in which this question has too generally been
                    discussed. For, whilst some with a foolish affectation of plebeian sympathies
                    overwhelm us with the insipid commonplaces about birth and ancient descent, as
                    honours containing nothing meritorious, and rush eagerly into an ostentatious
                    exhibition of all the circumstances which favour the notion of a humble station
                    and humble connections; others, with equal forgetfulness of true dignity, plead
                    with the intemperance and partiality of a legal advocate for the pretensions of
                    Shakspeare to the hereditary rank of gentleman. Both parties violate the majesty
                    of the subject. When we are seeking for the sources of the Euphrates or the St
                    Lawrence, we look for no proportions to the mighty volume of waters in that
                    particular summit amongst the chain of mountains which embosoms its earliest
                    fountains, nor are we shocked at the obscurity of these fountains. Pursuing the
                    career of Mahommed, or of any man who has memorably impressed his own mind or
                    agency upon the revolutions of mankind, we feel solicitude about the
                    circumstances which might surround his cradle to be altogether unseasonable and
                    impertinent. Whether he were born in a hovel or a palace, whether he passed his
                    infancy in squalid poverty, or hedged around by the glittering spears of
                    body-guards, as mere questions of fact may be interesting; but, in the light of
                    either accessories or counteragencies to the native majesty of the subject, are
                    trivial and below all philosophic valuation. So with regard to the creator of
                    Lear and Hamlet, of Othello and Macbeth; to him from whose golden urns the
                    nations beyond the far Atlantic, the multitude of the isles, and the generations
                    unborn in Australian climes, even to the realms of the rising sun (the ἀvατoλαι
                    ἡελιoio), must in every age draw perennial streams of intellectual life, we feel
                    that the little accidents of birth and social condition are so unspeakably below
                    the grandeur of the theme, are so irrelevant and disproportioned to the real
                    interest at issue, so incommensurable with any of its relations, that a
                    biographer of Shakspeare at once denounces himself as below his subject if he
                    can entertain such a question as seriously affecting the glory of the poet. In
                    some legends of saints, we find that they were born with a lambent circle or
                    golden aureola about their heads. This angelic coronet shed light alike upon the
                    chambers of a cottage or a palace, upon the gloomy limits of a dungeon or the
                    vast expansion of a cathedral; but the cottage, the palace, the dungeon, the
                    cathedral, were all equally incapable of adding one ray of colour or one pencil
                    of light to the supernatural halo.</p>
                <p>Having therefore thus pointedly guarded ourselves from misconstruction, and
                    consenting to entertain the question<pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:chi.28490924&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=196" xml:id="kp-eb0720-0196-0178"/>
                    as one in which we, the worshippers of Shakspeare, have an interest of
                    curiosity, but in which he, the object of our worship, has no interest of glory,
                    we proceed to state what appears to us the result of the scanty facts surviving
                    when collated with each other.</p>
                <p>By his mother’s side, Shakspeare was an authentic gentleman. By his father’s he
                    would have stood in a more dubious position; but the effect of municipal honours
                    to raise and illustrate an equivocal rank has always been acknowledged under the
                    popular tendencies of our English political system. From the sort of lead,
                    therefore, which John Shakspeare took at one time amongst his fellow-townsmen,
                    and from his rank of first magistrate, we may presume that, about the year 1568,
                    he had placed himself at the head of the Stratford community. Afterwards he
                    continued for some years to descend from this altitude; and the question is, at
                    what point this gradual degradation may be supposed to have settled. Now we
                    shall avow it as our opinion, that the composition of society in Stratford was
                    such that, even had the Shakspeare family maintained their superiority, the main
                    body of their daily associates must still have been found amongst persons below
                    the rank of gentry. The poet must inevitably have mixed chiefly with mechanics
                    and humble tradesmen, for such people composed perhaps the total community. But
                    had there even been a gentry in Stratford, since they would have marked the
                    distinctions of their rank chiefly by greater reserve of manners, it is probable
                    that, after all, Shakspeare, with his enormity of delight in exhibitions of
                    human nature, would have mostly cultivated that class of society in which the
                    feelings are more elementary and simple, in which the thoughts speak a plainer
                    language, and in which the restraints of factitious or conventional decorum are
                    exchanged for the restraints of mere sexual decency. It is a noticeable fact to
                    all who have looked upon human life with an eye of strict attention, that the
                    abstract image of womanhood, in its loveliness, its delicacy, and its modesty,
                    nowhere makes itself more impressive or more advantageously felt than in the
                    humblest cottages, because it is there brought into immediate juxtaposition with
                    the grossness of manners and the careless license of language incident to the
                    fathers and brothers of the house. And this is more especially true in a nation
                    of unaffected sexual gallantry,<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Never was the <hi rend="italic">case quam videri</hi> in any
                    point more strongly discriminated than in this very point of gallantry to the
                    female sex, as between England and France. In France, the verbal homage to women
                    is so excessive as to betray its real purpose, viz. that it is a mask for secret
                    contempt. In England, little is <hi rend="italic">said</hi>; but, in the mean
                    time, we allow our sovereign ruler to be a woman; which in France is impossible.
                    Even that fact is of some importance, but less so than what follows. In every
                    country whatsoever, if any principle has a deep root in the moral feelings of
                    the people, we may rely upon its showing itself, by a thousand evidences,
                    amongst the very lowest ranks, and in their daily intercourse, and their <hi
                    rend="italic">undress</hi> manners. Now in England there is, and always has
                    been, a manly feeling, most widely diffused, of unwillingness to see labours of
                    a coarse order, or requiring muscular exertions, thrown upon women. Pauperism,
                    amongst other evil effects, has sometimes locally disturbed this predominating
                    sentiment of Englishmen; but never at any time with such depth as to kill the
                    root of the old hereditary manliness. Sometimes at this day a gentleman, either
                    from carelessness, or from over-ruling force of convenience, or from real defect
                    of gallantry, will allow a female servant to carry his portmanteau for him;
                    though, after all, that spectacle is a rare one. And everywhere women of all
                    ages engage in the pleasant, nay elegant, labours of the hay field; but in Great
                    Britain women are never suffered to mow, which is a most athletic and exhausting
                    labour, nor to load a cart, nor to drive a plough or hold it. In France, on the
                    other hand, before the Revolution (at which period the pseudo-homage, the
                    lip-honour, was far more ostentatiously professed towards the female sex than at
                    present), a Frenchman of credit, and vouching for his statement by the whole
                    weight of his name and personal responsibility (SI. Simond, now an American
                    citizen), records the following abominable scene as one of no uncommon
                    occurrence: A woman was in some provinces yoked side by side with an ass to the
                    plough or the harrow; and M. Simond protests that it excited no horror to see
                    the driver distributing his lashes impartially between the woman and her brute
                    yoke-fellow. So much for the wordy pomps of French gallantry. In England, we
                    trust, and we believe, that any man, caught in such a situation, and in such an
                    abuse of his power (supposing the case Otherwise a possible one), would be
                    killed on the spot.</p></note> such as the English and the Gothic races in
                    general; since, under the immunity which their women enjoy from all servile
                    labours of a coarse or out-of-doors order, by as much lower as they descend in
                    the scale of rank, by so much more do they benefit under the force of contrast
                    with the men of their own level. A young man of that class, however noble in
                    appearance, is somewhat degraded in the eyes of women, by the necessity which
                    his indigence imposes of working under a master; but a beautiful young woman, in
                    the very poorest family, unless she enters upon a life of domestic servitude (in
                    which case her labours are light, suited to her sex, and withdrawn from the
                    public eye), so long in fact as she stays under her father’s roof, is as
                    perfectly her own mistress and <hi rend="italic">sui juris</hi> as the daughter
                    of an earl. This personal dignity, brought into stronger relief by the mercenary
                    employments of her male connections, and the feminine gentleness of her voice
                    and manners, exhibited under the same advantages of contrast, oftentimes combine
                    to make a young cottage beauty as fascinating an object as any woman of any
                    station.</p>
                <p>Hence we may in part account for the great event of Shakspeare’s early manhood,
                    his premature marriage. It has always been known, or at least traditionally
                    received for a fact, that Shakspeare had married whilst yet a boy; and that his
                    wife was unaccountably older than himself. In the very earliest biographical
                    sketch of the poet, compiled by Rowe, from materials collected by Betterton the
                    actor, it was stated (and that statement is now ascertained to have been
                    correct), that he had married Anne Hathaway, “the daughter of a substantial
                    yeoman.” Further than this nothing was known. But in September 1836 was
                    published a very remarkable document, which gives the assurance of law to the
                    time and fact of this event, yet still, unless collated with another record,
                    does nothing to lessen the mystery which had previously surrounded its
                    circumstances. This document consists of two parts: the first, and principal,
                    according to the logic of the case, though second according to the arrangement,
                    being a <hi rend="italic">license</hi> for the marriage of William Shakspeare
                    with Anne Hathaway, under the condition “of <hi rend="italic">once</hi> asking
                    of the bannes of matrimony,” that is, in effect, dispensing with two out of the
                    three customary askings; the second or subordinate part of the document being a
                    <hi rend="italic">bond</hi> entered into by two sureties, viz. Fulke Sandells
                    and John Rychardson, both described as <hi rend="italic">agricoes</hi> or
                    yeomen, and both marksmen (that is, incapable of writing, and therefore
                    subscribing by means of <hi rend="italic">marks),</hi> for the payment of forty
                    pounds sterling, in the event of Shakspeare, yet a minor, and incapable of
                    binding himself, failing to fulfil the conditions of the license. In the bond,
                    drawn up in Latin, there is no mention of Shakspeare’s name; but in the license,
                    which is altogether English, <hi rend="italic">his</hi> name, of course, stands
                    foremost; and as it may gratify the reader to see the very words and orthography
                    of the original, we here extract the <hi rend="italic">operative</hi> part of
                    this document, prefacing only, that the license is attached by way of
                    explanation to the bond. “The condition of this obligation is suche, that if
                    hcrafter there shall not appere any lawfull lett or impediment, by reason of any
                    precontract, &amp;c., but that Willm. Shag-spere, one thone ptic” [on the one
                    party), “and Anne Hathwey of Stratford, in the diocess of Worcester, maiden, may
                    lawfully solemnize matrimony together; and in the<pb break="no"

                    same afterwards remaine and continew like man and wiffe. And, moreover, if the
                    said Willm. Shagspere do not proceed to solemnization of mariadg with the said
                    Anne Hath-wey, without the consent of hir frinds ;—then the said obligation”
                    [viz. to pay forty pounds] “to be voyd and of none effect, or els to stand &amp;
                    abide in full force and vertue.”</p>
                <p>What are we to think of this document? Trepidation and anxiety are written upon
                    its face. The parties are not to be married by a special license; not even by an
                    ordinary license; in that case no proclamation of banns, no public asking at
                    all, would have been requisite. Economical scruples are consulted; and yet the
                    regular movement of the marriage “through the bell-ropes”<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Amongst people of humble rank in England, who
                    only were ever asked in church, until the new-fangled systems of marriage came
                    up within the lost ten or fifteen years, during the currency of the three
                    Sundays on which the banns were proclaimed by the clergyman from the reading
                    desk, the young couple elect were said jocosely to be “hanging in the bell-ropes
                    alluding perhaps to the joyous peal contingent on the final completion of the
                    marriage.</p></note> is disturbed. Economy, which retards the marriage, is here
                    evidently in collision with some opposite principle which precipitates it. How
                    is all this to be explained? Much light is afforded by the date when illustrated
                    by another document. The bond bears date on the 28th day of November in the 25th
                    year of our lady the queen, that is, in 1582. Now the baptism of Shakspeare’s
                    eldest child, Susanna, is registered on the 26th of May in the year following.
                    Suppose, therefore, that his marriage was solemnized on the 1st day of December;
                    it was barely possible that it could be earlier, considering that the sureties,
                    drinking, perhaps, at Worcester throughout the 28th of November, would require
                    the 29th, in so dreary a season, for their return to Stratford; after which some
                    preparation might be requisite to the bride, since the marriage was <hi
                    rend="italic">not</hi> celebrated at Stratford. Next suppose the birth of Miss
                    Susanna to have occurred, like her father’s, two days before her baptism, viz.
                    on the 24th of May. From December the 1st to May the 24th, both days
                    inclusively, are 175 days; which, divided by seven, gives precisely twenty-five
                    weeks, that is to say, six months short by one week. Oh, fie, Miss Susanna, you
                    came rather before you were wanted.</p>
                <p>Mr Campbpll’s comment upon the affair is, that “<hi rend="italic">if</hi> this
                    was the case,” viz. if the baptism were really solemnized on the 26th of May,
                    “the poet’s first child would <hi rend="italic">appear</hi> to have been born
                    only six months and eleven days after the bond was entered into.” And he then
                    concludes that, on this assumption, “Miss Susanna Shakspeare came into the world
                    a little prematurely.” But this is to doubt where there never was any ground for
                    doubting; the baptism was <hi rend="italic">certainly</hi> on the 26th of May;
                    and, in the next place, the calculation of six months and eleven days is
                    sustained by substituting lunar months for calendar, and then only by supposing
                    the marriage to have been celebrated on the very day of subscribing the bond in
                    Worcester, and the baptism to have been coincident with the birth; of which
                    suppositions the latter is improbable, and the former, considering the situation
                    of Worcester, impossible.</p>
                <p>Strange it is, that, whilst all biographers have worked with so much zeal upon
                    the most barren dates or most baseless traditions in the great poet’s life,
                    realising in a manner the chimeras of Laputa, and endeavouring “to extract
                    sunbeams from cucumbers,” such a story with regard to such an event, no fiction
                    of village scandal, hut involved in legal documents, a story so significant and
                    so eloquent to the intelligent, should formerly have been dismissed without
                    notice of any kind, and even now, after the discovery of 1836, with nothing
                    beyond a slight conjectural insinuation. For our parts, we should have been the
                    last amongst the biographers to unearth any forgotten scandal, or, after so vast
                    a lapse of time, and when the grave had shut out all but charitable thoughts, to
                    point any moral censures at a simple case of natural frailty, youthful
                    precipitancy of passion, of all trespasses the most venial, where the final
                    intentions are honourable. But in this case there seems to have been something
                    more in motion than passion or the ardour of youth. “I like not,” says Parson
                    Evans (alluding to Falstaff in masquerade), “I like not when a woman has a great
                    peard; I spy a great peard under her muffler.” Neither do we like the spectacle
                    of a mature young woman, five years past her majority, wearing the semblance of
                    having been led astray by a boy who had still two years and a half to run of his
                    minority. Shakspeare himself, looking back on this part of his youthful history
                    from his maturest years, breathes forth pathetic counsels against the errors
                    into which his own inexperience had been ensnared. The disparity of years
                    between himself and his wife he notices in a beautiful scene of the Twelfth
                    Night. The Duke Orsino, observing the sensibility which the pretended Cesario
                    had betrayed on hearing some touching old snatches of a love strain, swears that
                    his beardless page must have felt the passion of love, which the other admits.
                    Upon this the dialogue proceeds thus; <hi rend="italic">Duke.</hi> What kind of
                    woman is’t?</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Viola.</hi> Of your complexion.</p>

                <p>For, boy, however we do praise ourselves,</p>
                <p>Our fancies are more giddy and unfirm,</p>
                <p>More longing, wavering, sooner lost and worn,</p>
                <p>Than women’s are.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Viola.</hi> I think it well, my lord.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Duke</hi> Then <hi rend="italic">let thy love be younger than
                    thyself,</hi><hi rend="italic">Or thy affection cannot hold the bent;</hi></p>
                <p>For women are as roses, whose fair flower,</p>
                <p>Being once display’d, doth fall that very hour.</p>
                <p>These counsels were uttered nearly twenty years after the event in his own life
                    to which they probably look back; for this play is supposed to have been written
                    in Shakspeare’s thirty-eighth year. And we may read an earnestness in pressing
                    the point as to the <hi rend="italic">inverted</hi> disparity of years, which
                    indicates pretty clearly an appeal to the lessons of his personal experience.
                    But his other indiscretion, in having yielded so far to passion and opportunity
                    as to crop by prelibation, and befbre they were hallowed, those flowers of
                    paradise which belonged to hie marriage-day; this he adverts to with even more
                    solemnity of sorrow, and with more pointed energy of moral reproof, in the very
                    last drama which is supposed to have proceeded from his pen, and therefore with
                    the force and sanctity of testamentary counsel. The Tempest is all but
                    ascertained to have been composed in 1611, that is, about five years before the
                    poet’s death; and indeed could not have been composed much earlier; for the very
                    incident which suggested the basis of the plot, and of the local scene, viz. the
                    shipwreck of Sir George Somers on the Bermudas (which were in consequence
                    denominated the Somers’ Islands), did not occur until the year 1609. In the
                    opening of the fourth act, Prospero formally betrothes his daughter to
                    Ferdinand; and in doing so he pays the prince a well-merited compliment of
                    having “worthily purchas’d” this rich jewel, by the patience with which, for her
                    sake, he had supported harsh usage, and other painful circumstances of his
                    trial. But, he adds solemnly,</p>
                <p>If thou dost break her virgin knot before All sanctimonious ceremonies may With
                    full and holy rite be minister’d;<pb break="no"

                    in that case what would follow?</p>
                <p>No sweet aspersion shall the heavens let fell,</p>
                <p>To make this contract grow; <hi rend="italic">but barren hate,</hi><hi

                <p>As Hymen’s lamps shall light you.</p>
                <p>The young prince assures him in reply, that no strength of opportunity,
                    concurring with the uttermost temptation, not the murkiest den,</p>
                <p>The most opportune place, the strong'st suggestion Our worser genius can———</p>
                <p>should ever prevail to lay asleep his jealousy of self-control, so as to take any
                    advantage of Miranda’s innocence. And he adds an argument for this abstinence,
                    by way of reminding Prospero, that not honour only, but even prudential care of
                    his own happiness, is interested in the observance of his promise. Any
                    unhallowed anticipation would, as he insinuates, take away</p>
                <p>The edge of that day’s celebration,</p>
                <p>When I shall think, or Pboebus’ steeds are founder'd.</p>
                <p>Or night kept chain’d below; that is, when even the winged hours would seem to
                    move too slowly. Even thus Prospero is not quite satisfied: during his
                    subsequent dialogue with Ariel, we are to suppose that Ferdinand, in conversing
                    apart with Miranda, betrays more impassioned ardour than the wise magician
                    altogether approves. The prince’s caresses have not been unobserved; and thus
                    Prospero renews his warning:</p>
                <p>Look thou be true: do not give dalliance</p>
                <p>Too much the rein: the strongest oaths are straw</p>
                <p>To the fire i' the blood: be more abstemious,</p>
                <p>Or else—good night your vow.</p>
                <p>The royal lover re-assures him of his loyalty to his engagements; and again the
                    wise father, so honourably jealous for his daughter, professes himself satisfied
                    with the prince’s pledges.</p>
                <p>Now in all these emphatic warnings, uttering the language “of that sad wisdom
                    folly leaves behind,” who can avoid reading, as in subtile hieroglyphics, the
                    secret record of Shakspeare’s own nuptial disappointments? We, indeed, that is,
                    universal posterity through every age, have reason to rejoice in these
                    disappointments; for to them, past all doubt, we are indebted for Shakspeare’s
                    subsequent migration to London, and his public occupation, which, giving him a
                    deep pecuniary interest in the productions of his pen, such as no other literary
                    application of his powers could have approached in that day, were eventually the
                    means of drawing forth those divine works which have survived their author for
                    our everlasting benefit.</p>
                <p>Our own reading and deciphering of the whole case is as follows. The Shakspeares
                    were a handsome family, both father and sons. This we assume upon the following
                    grounds: First, on the presumption arising out of John Shakspeare’s having won
                    the favour of a young heiress higher in rank than himself; secondly, on the
                    presumption involved in the fact of three amongst his four sons having gone upon
                    the stage, to which the most obvious (and perhaps in those days a <hi
                    rend="italic">sine qua non)</hi> recommendation would be a good person and a
                    pleasing countenance; thirdly, on the direct evidence of Aubrey, who assures us
                    that William Shakspeare was a handsome and a well-shaped man; fourthly, on the
                    implicit evidence of the Stratford monument, which exhibits a man of good figure
                    and noble countenance; fifthly, on the confirmation of this evidence by the
                    Chandos portrait, which exhibits noble features, illustrated by the utmost
                    sweetness of expression; sixthly, on the selection of theatrical parts, which it
                    is known that Shakspeare personated, most of them being such as required some
                    dignity of form, viz. kings, the athletic (though aged) follower of an athletic
                    young man, and supernatural beings. On these grounds, direct or circumstantial,
                    we believe ourselves warranted in assuming that William Shakspeare was a
                    handsome and even noble-looking boy. Miss Anne Hathaway had herself probably
                    some personal attractions; and, if an indigent girl, who looked for no pecuniary
                    advantages, would probably have been early sought in marriage. But as the
                    daughter of “a substantial yeoman," who would expect some fortune in his
                    daughter’s suitors, she had, to speak coarsely, a little outlived her market.
                    Time she had none to lose. William Shakspeare pleased her eye; and the
                    gentleness of his nature made him an apt subject for female blandishments,
                    possibly for female arts. Without imputing, however, to this Anne Hathaway any
                    thing so hateful as a settled plot for ensnaring him, it was easy enough for a
                    mature woman, armed with such inevitable advantages of experience and of
                    self-possession, to draw onward a blushing novice; and, without directly
                    creating opportunities, to place him in the way of turning to account such as
                    naturally offered. Young boys are generally flattered by the condescending
                    notice of grown-up women; and perhaps Shakspeare’s own lines upon a similar
                    situation, to a young boy adorned with the same natural gifts as himself, may
                    give us the key to the result:</p>
                <p>Gentle thou art, and therefore to be won;</p>
                <p>Beauteous thou art, therefore to be assail’d;</p>
                <p>And, when a woman woos, what woman’s son Will sourly leave her till he have
                    prevail’d?</p>
                <p>Once, indeed, entangled in such a pursuit, any person of manly feelings would be
                    sensible that he had no retreat: <hi rend="italic">that</hi> would be—to insult
                    a woman, grievously to wound her sexual pride, and to insure her lasting scorn
                    and hatred. These were consequences which the gentle-minded Shakspeare could not
                    face: he pursued his good fortunes, half perhaps in heedlessness, half in
                    desperation, until he was roused by the clamorous displeasure of her family upon
                    first discovering the situation of their kinswoman. For such a situation there
                    could be but one atonement, and that was hurried forward by both parties;
                    whilst, out of delicacy towards the bride, the wedding was not celebrated in
                    Stratford (where the register contains no notice of such an event); nor, as
                    Malone imagined, in Weston-upon-Avon, that being in the diocese of Gloucester;
                    but in some parish, as yet undiscovered, in the diocese of Worcester.</p>
                <p>But now arose a serious question as to the future maintenance of the young
                    people. John Shakspeare was depressed in his circumstances, and he had other
                    children besides William, viz. three sons and a daughter. The elder lives have
                    represented him as burdened with ten; but this was an error, arising out of the
                    confusion between John Shakspeare the glover and John Shakspeare a shoemaker.
                    This error has been thus far of use, that, by exposing the fact of two John
                    Shakspeares (not kinsmen) residing in Stratford-upon-Avon, it has satisfactorily
                    proved the name to be amongst those which are locally indigenous to
                    Warwickshire. Meantime it is now ascertained that John Shakspeare the glover had
                    only eight children, viz. four daughters and four sons. The order of their
                    succession was this: Joan, Margaret, WILLIAM, Gilbert, a second Joan, Anne,
                    Richard, and Edmund. Three of the daughters, viz. the two eldest of the family,
                    Joan and Margaret, together with Anne, died in childhood: all the rest attained
                    mature ages, and of these William was the eldest. This might give him some
                    advantage in his father’s regard; but in a question of pecuniary provision
                    precedency amongst the children of an insolvent is nearly nominal. For the
                    present John Shakspeare could do little tor his son; and, under these
                    circumstances, perhaps the father of Anne Hathaway would come forward to assist
                    the new-married couple. This condition<pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:chi.28490924&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=199" xml:id="kp-eb0720-0199-0181"/>
                    of dependency would furnish matter for painful feelings and irritating words:
                    the youthful husband, whose mind would be expanding as rapidly as the leaves and
                    blossoms of spring-time in polar latitudes, would soon come to appreciate the
                    sort of wiles by which he had been caught. The female mind is quick, and almost
                    gifted with the power of witchcraft, to decipher what is passing in the thoughts
                    of familiar companions. Silent and forbearing as William Shakspeare might be,
                    Anne, his staid wife, would read his secret reproaches; ill would she dissemble
                    her wrath, and the less so from the consciousness of having deserved them. It is
                    no uncommon case for women to feel anger in connection with one subject, and to
                    express it in connection with another; which other, perhaps (except as a
                    serviceable mask), would have been a matter of indifference to their feelings.
                    Anne would therefore reply to those inevitable reproaches which her own sense
                    must presume to be lurking in her husband’s heart, by others equally stinging,
                    on his inability to support his family, and on his obligations to her father’s
                    purse. Shakspeare, we may be sure, would be ruminating every hour on the means
                    of his deliverance from so painful a dependency; and at length, after four
                    years’ conjugal discord, he would resolve upon that plan of solitary emigration
                    to the metropolis, which, at the same time that it released him from the
                    humiliation of domestic feuds, succeeded so splendidly for his worldly
                    prosperity, and with a train of consequences so vast for all future ages.</p>
                <p>Such, we are persuaded, was the real course of Shakspeare’s transition from
                    school-boy pursuits to his public career: and upon the known temperament of
                    Shakspeare, his genial disposition to enjoy life without, disturbing his
                    enjoyment by fretting anxieties, we build the conclusion, that had his friends
                    furnished him with ampler funds, and had his marriage been well assorted or
                    happy, we—the world of posterity—should have lost the whole benefit and delight
                    which we have since reaped from his matchless faculties. The motives which drove
                    him <hi rend="italic">from</hi> Stratford are clear enough; but what motives
                    determined his course <hi rend="italic">to</hi> London, and especially to the
                    stage, still remains to be explained. Stratford-upon-Avon, lying in the high
                    rood from London through Oxford to Birmingham (or more generally to the north),
                    had been continually visited by some of the best comedians during Shakspeare’s
                    childhood. One or two of the most respectable metropolitan actors were natives
                    of Stratford. These would be well known to the elder Shakspeare. But, apart from
                    that accident, it is notorious that mere legal necessity and usage would compel
                    all companies of actors, upon coming into any town, to seek, in the first place,
                    from the chief magistrate, a license for opening a theatre, and next, over and
                    above this public sanction, to seek his personal favour and patronage. As an
                    alderman, therefore, but still more whilst clothed with the official powers of
                    chief magistrate, the poet’s father would have opportunities of doing essential
                    services to many persons connected with the London stage. The conversation of
                    comedians acquainted with books, fresh from the keen and sparkling circles of
                    the metropolis, and filled with racy anecdotes of the court, as well as of
                    public life generally, could not but have been fascinating, by comparison with
                    the stagnant society of Stratford. Hospitalities on a liberal scale would be
                    offered to these men: not impossibly this fact might be one principal key to
                    those dilapidations which the family estate had suffered. These actors, on <hi
                    rend="italic">their</hi> part, would retain a grateful sense of the kindness
                    they had received, and would seek to repay it to John Shakspeare, now that he
                    was depressed in his fortunes, as opportunities might offer. His eldest son,
                    growing up a handsome young man, and beyond all doubt from his earliest days of
                    most splendid colloquial powers (for assuredly of <hi rend="italic">him</hi> it
                    may be taken for granted, Nec licuit populis parvum te, Nile, videre), would be
                    often reproached in a friendly way for burying himself in a country life. These
                    overtures, prompted alike by gratitude to the father, and a real selfish
                    interest in the talents of the son, would at length take a definite shape; and,
                    upon some clear understanding as to the terms of such an arrangement, William
                    Shakspeare would at length (about 1586, according to the received account, that
                    is, in the fifth year of his married life, and the twenty-third or twenty-fourth
                    of his age), unaccompanied by wife or children, translate himself to London.
                    Later than 1586 it could not well be; for already in 1589 it has been recently
                    ascertained that he held a share in the property of a leading theatre.</p>
                <p>We must here stop to notice, and the reader will allow us to notice with summary
                    indignation, the slanderous and idle tale which represents Shakspeare as having
                    fled to London in the character of a criminal, from the persecutions of Sir
                    Thomas Lucy of Charlecot. This tale has long been propagated under two separate
                    impulses: chiefly, perhaps, under the vulgar love of pointed and glaring
                    contrasts; the splendour of the man was in this instance brought into a sort of
                    epigrammatic antithesis with the humility of his fortunes; secondly, under a
                    baser impulse, the malicious pleasure of seeing a great man degraded.
                    Accordingly, as in the case of Milton,<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>In a little memoir of Milton, which the author of this
                    article drew up some years ago for a public society, and which is printed in an
                    abridged shape, he took occasion to remark, that Dr Johnson, who was meanly
                    anxious to revive this slander against Milton, as well as some others, had
                    supposed Milton himself to have this flagellation in bis mind, and indirectly to
                    confess it, in one of his Latin poems, where, speaking of Cambridge, and
                    declaring that he has no longer any pleasure in the thoughts of revisiting that
                    university, he says,</p><p>“Nec duri libet usque minos perferre
                    magistri,</p><p>Caeteraque ingenio non subeunda meo.”</p><p>This last line the
                    malicious critic would translate—“And other things insufferable to a man of my
                    temper.” But, as we then observed, <hi rend="italic">ingenium</hi> is properly
                    expressive of the <hi rend="italic">intellectual</hi> constitution, whilst it is
                    the <hi rend="italic">moral</hi> constitution that suffers degradation from
                    personal chastisement—the sense of honour, of personal dignity, of justice,
                    &amp;c. <hi rend="italic">Indoles</hi> is the proper term for this latter idea;
                    and in using the word <hi rend="italic">ingenium</hi>, there cannot be a doubt
                    that Milton alluded to the dry scholastic disputations, which were shocking and
                    odious to his fine poetical genius. If, therefore, the vile story is still to be
                    kept up in order to dishonour a great man, at any rate let it not in future be
                    pretended that any countenance to such a slander can be drawn from the
                    confessions of the poet himself.</p></note> it has been affirmed that Shakspeare
                    had suffered corporal chastisement, in fact (we abhor to utter such words), that
                    he had been judicially whipped. Now, first of all, let us mark the inconsistency
                    of this tale: the poet was whipped, that is, he was punished most
                    disproportionately, and yet he fled to avoid punishment. Next, we are informed
                    that his offence was deer-stealing, and from the park of Sir Thomas Lucy. And it
                    has been well ascertained that Sir Thomas had no deer, and had no park.
                    Moreover, deer-stealing was regarded by our ancestors exactly as poaching is
                    regarded by us. Deer ran wild in all the great forests; and no offence was
                    looked upon as so venial, none so compatible with a noble Robin-Hood style of
                    character, as this very trespass upon what were regarded as <hi rend="italic"
                    >ferae natures,</hi> and not at all as domestic property. But had it been
                    otherwise, a trespass was not punishable with whipping; nor had Sir Thomas Lucy
                    the power to irritate a whole community like Stratford-upon-Avon, by branding
                    with permanent disgrace a young man so closely connected with three at least of
                    the best families in the neighbourhood. Besides, had Shakspeare suffered any
                    dishonour of that kind, the scandal would infallibly have pursued him at his
                    very heels to Lon-<pb break="no" facs="ht:chi.28490924&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=200"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0720-0200-0182"/> don; and in that case Greene, who has left on
                    record, in a posthumous work of 1592, his malicious feelings towards Shakspeare,
                    could not have failed to notice it. For, be it remembered, that a judicial
                    flagellation contains a twofold ignominy: flagellation is ignominious in its own
                    nature, even though unjustly inflicted, and by a ruffian; secondly, any judicial
                    punishment is ignominious, even though not wearing a shade of personal
                    degradation. Now a judicial flagellation includes both features of dishonour.
                    And is it to be imagined that an enemy, searching with the diligence of malice
                    for matter against Shakspeare, should have failed, six years after the event, to
                    hear of that very memorable disgrace which had exiled him from Stratford, and
                    was the very occasion of his first resorting to London; or that a leading
                    company of players in the metropolis, <hi rend="italic">one of whom,</hi> and a
                    chief one, <hi rend="italic">was his own townsman,</hi> should cheerfully adopt
                    into their society, as an honoured partner, a young man yet flagrant from the
                    lash of the executioner or the beadle?</p>
                <p>This tale is fabulous, and rotten to its core; yet even this does less dishonour
                    to Shakspeare’s memory than the sequel attached to it. A sort of scurrilous
                    rondeau, consisting of nine lines, so loathsome in its brutal stupidity, and so
                    vulgar in its expression, that we shall not pollute our pages by transcribing
                    it, has been imputed to Shakspeare ever since the days of the credulous Rowe.
                    The total point of this idiot’s drivel consists in calling Sir Thomas “an asse
                    and well it justifies the poet’s own remark, “Let there be gall enough in thy
                    ink, no matter though thou write with a goose pen.” Our own belief is, that
                    these lines were a production of Charles II.’s reign, and applied to a Sir
                    Thomas Lucy, not very far removed, if at all, from the age of him who first
                    picked up the precious filth: the phrase “parliament <hi rend="italic"
                    >member!'</hi> we believe to be quite unknown in the colloquial use of Queen
                    Elizabeth’s reign.</p>
                <p>But, that we may rid ourselves once and for ever of this outrageous calumny upon
                    Shakspeare’s memory, we shall pursue the story to its final stage. Even Malone
                    has been thoughtless enough to accredit this closing chapter, which contains, in
                    fact, such a superfetation of folly as the annals of human dulness do not
                    exceed. Let us recapitulate the points of the story. A baronet, who has no deer
                    and no park, is supposed to persecute a poet for stealing these aerial deer out
                    of this aerial park, both lying in <hi rend="italic">nephelococcygia.</hi> The
                    poet sleeps upon this wrong for eighteen years; but at length, hearing that his
                    persecutor is dead and buried, he conceives bloody thoughts of revenge. And this
                    revenge he purposes to execute by picking a hole in his dead enemy’s
                    coat-of-arms. Is this coat-of-arms, then, Sir Thomas Lucy’s? Why, no: Malone
                    admits that it is not. For the poet, suddenly recollecting that this ridicule
                    would settle upon the son of his enemy, selects another coat-of-arras, with
                    which his dead enemy never had any connection, and he spends his thunder and
                    lightning upon this irrelevant object; and, after all, the ridicule itself lies
                    in a Welchman’s mispronouncing one single heraldic term—a Welchman who
                    mispronounces all words. The last act of the poet’s malice recalls to us a sort
                    of jest-book story of an Irishman, the vulgarity of which the reader will pardon
                    in consideration of its relevancy. The Irishman having lost a pair of silk
                    stockings, mentions to a friend that he has taken steps for recovering them by
                    an advertisement, offering a reward to the finder. His friend objects that the
                    costs of advertising, and the reward, would eat out the full value of the silk
                    stockings. But to this the Irishman replies, with a knowing air, that he is not
                    so green as to have overlooked <hi rend="italic">that;</hi> and that, to keep
                    down the reward, he had advertised the stockings as worsted. Not at all less
                    flagrant is the bull ascribed to Shakspeare, when he is made to punish a dead
                    man by personalities meant for his exclusive ear, through his coat-of-arms, but
                    at the same time, with the express purpose of blunting and defeating the edge of
                    his own scurrility, is made to substitute for the real arms some others which
                    had no more relation to the dead enemy than they had to the poet himself. This
                    is the very sublime of folly, beyond which human dotage cannot advance.</p>
                <p>It is painful, indeed, and dishonourable to human nature, that whenever men of
                    vulgar habits and of poor education wish to impress us with a feeling of respect
                    for a man’s talents, they are sure to cite, by way of evidence, some gross
                    instance of malignity. Power, in their minds, is best illustrated by malice or
                    by the infliction of pain. To this unwelcome fact we have some evidence in the
                    wretched tale which we have just dismissed; and there is another of the same
                    description to be found in all lives of Shakspeare, which we will expose to the
                    contempt of the reader whilst we are in this field of discussion, that we may
                    not afterwards have to resume so disgusting a subject.</p>
                <p>This poet, who was a model of gracious benignity in his manners, and of whom,
                    amidst our general ignorance, thus much is perfectly established, that the term
                    <hi rend="italic">gentle</hi> was almost as generally and by prescriptive right
                    associated with his name as the affix of <hi rend="italic">venerable</hi> with
                    Bede, or <hi rend="italic">judicious</hi> with Hooker, is alleged to have
                    insulted a friend by an imaginary epitaph beginning “<hi rend="italic">Ten in
                    the Hundred,”</hi> and supposing him to be damned, yet without wit enough (which
                    surely the Stratford bellman could have furnished) for devising any, even
                    fanciful, reason for such a supposition; upon which the comment of some foolish
                    critic is, “The <hi rend="italic">sharpness of the satire</hi> is said to have
                    stung the man so much that he never forgave it.” We have heard of the sting in
                    the tail atoning for the brainless head; but in this doggerel the tail is surely
                    as stingless as the head is brainless. For, 1 <hi rend="italic">st</hi>, <hi
                    rend="italic">Ten in the Hundred</hi> could be no reproach in Shakspeare’s time,
                    any more than to call a man <hi rend="italic">Three-and-α-half-per-cent.</hi> in
                    this present year 1838; except, indeed, amongst those foolish persons who built
                    their morality upon the Jewish ceremonial law. Shakspeare himself took ten per
                    cent. 2<hi rend="italic">dly,</hi> It happens that John Combe, so far from being
                    the object of the poet’s scurrility, or viewing the poet as an object of
                    implacable resentment, was a Stratford friend; that one of his family was
                    affectionately remembered in Shakspeare’s will by the bequest of his sword; and
                    that John Combe himself recorded his perfect charity with Shakspeare by leaving
                    him a legacy of L.5 sterling. And in this lies the key to the whole story. For,
                    <hi rend="italic">idly,</hi> the four lines were written and printed before
                    Shakspeare was born. The name Combe is a common one; and some stupid fellow, who
                    had seen the name in Shakspeare’s will, and happened also to have seen the lines
                    in a collection of epigrams, chose to connect the cases by attributing an
                    identity to the two John Combes, though at war with chronology.</p>
                <p>Finally, there is another specimen of doggerel attributed to Shakspeare, which is
                    not equally unworthy of him, because not equally malignant, but otherwise
                    equally below his intellect, no less than his scholarship; we mean the
                    inscription on his grave-stone. This, as a sort of <hi rend="italic">siste
                    viator</hi> appeal to future sextons, is worthy of the grave-digger or the
                    parish-clerk, who was probably its author. Or it may have been an antique
                    formula, like the vulgar record of ownership in books—</p>
                <p>Anthony Timothy Dolthead’s bock,</p>
                <p>God give him grace therein to look.</p>
                <p>Thus far the matter is of little importance; and it might have been supposed that
                    malignity itself could hardly have imputed such trash to Shakspeare. But when we
                    find, even in this short compass, scarcely wider than the posy of a ring, room
                    found for traducing the poet’s memory, it becomes important to say, that the
                    leading sentiment, the<pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:chi.28490924&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=201" xml:id="kp-eb0720-0201-0183"/>
                    horror expressed at any disturbance offered to his bones, is not one to which
                    Shakspeare could have attached the slightest weight; far less could have
                    outraged the sanctities of place and subject, by affixing to any sentiment
                    whatever (and, according to the fiction of the case, his farewell sentiment) the
                    sanction of a curse.</p>
                <p>Filial veneration and piety towards the memory of this great man have led us into
                    a digression that might have been unseasonable in any cause less weighty than
                    one having for its object to deliver his honoured name from a load of the most
                    brutal malignity. Never more, we hope and venture to believe, will any
                    thoughtless biographer impute to Shakspeare the asinine doggerel with which the
                    uncritical blundering of his earliest biographer has caused his name to be
                    dishonoured. We now resume the thread of our biography. The stream of history is
                    centuries in working itself clear of any calumny with which it has once been
                    polluted.</p>
                <p>Most readers will be aware of an old story, according to which Shakspeare gained
                    his livelihood for some time after coming to London by holding the horses of
                    those who rode to the play. This legend is as idle as any one of those which we
                    have just exposed. No custom ever existed of riding on horseback to the play.
                    Gentlemen, who rode valuable horses, would assuredly not expose them
                    systematically to the injury of standing exposed to cold for two or even four
                    hours; and persons of inferior rank would not ride on horseback in the town.
                    Besides, had such a custom ever existed, stables (or sheds at least) would soon
                    have arisen to meet the public wants; and in some of the dramatic sketches of
                    the day, which noticed every fashion as it arose, this would not have been
                    overlooked. The story is traced originally to Sir William Davenant. Betterton
                    the actor, who professed to have received it from him, passed it onwards to
                    Rowe, he to Pope, Pope to Bishop Newton the editor of Milton, and Newton to Dr
                    Johnson. This pedigree of the fable, however, adds nothing to its credit, and
                    multiplies the chances of some mistake. Another fable, not much less absurd,
                    represents Shakspeare as having from the very first been borne upon the
                    establishment of the theatre, and so far contradicts the other fable, but
                    originally in the very humble character of <hi rend="italic">call-boy</hi> or
                    deputy prompter, whose business it was to summon each performer according to his
                    order of coming upon the stage. This story, however, quite as much as the other,
                    is irreconcileable with the discovery recently made by Mr Collier, that in 1589
                    Shakspeare was a shareholder in the important property of a principal London
                    theatre. It seems destined that all the undoubted facts of Shakspeare’s life
                    should come to us through the channel of legal documents, which are better
                    evidence even than imperial medals; whilst, on the other hand, all the fabulous
                    anecdotes, not having an attorney’s seal to them, seem to have been the fictions
                    of the wonder-maker. The plain presumption from the record of Shakspeare’s
                    situation in 1589, coupled with the fact that his first arrival in London was
                    possibly not until 1587, but according to the earliest account not before 1586,
                    a space of time which leaves but little room for any remarkable changes of
                    situation, seems to be, that, either in requital of services done to the players
                    by the poet’s family, or in consideration of money advanced by his
                    father-in-law, or on account of Shakspeare’s personal accomplishments as an
                    actor, and as an adapter of dramatic works to the stage; for one of these
                    reasons, or for all of them united, William Shakspeare, about the 23d year of
                    his age, was adopted into the partnership of a respectable his trionic company,
                    possessing a first-rate theatre in the metropolis. If 1586 were the year in
                    which he came up to London, it seems probable enough that his immediate motive
                    to that step was the increasing distress of his father; for in that year John
                    Shakspeare resigned the office of alderman. There is, however, a bare
                    possibility that Shakspeare might have gone to London about the time when he
                    completed his twenty-first year, that is, in the spring of 1585, but not
                    earlier. Nearly two years after the birth of his eldest daughter Susanna, his
                    wife lay in for a second and a <hi rend="italic">last</hi> time; but she then
                    brought her husband twins, a son and a daughter. These children were baptized in
                    February of the year 1585; so that Shakspeare’s whole family of three children
                    were born and baptized two months before he completed his majority. The twins
                    were bap-tized by the names of Hamnct and Judith, those being the names of two
                    amongst their sponsors, viz. Mr Sadler and his wife. Hamnet, which is a
                    remarkable name in itself, becomes still more so from its resemblance to the
                    immortal name of Hamlet<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>And singular enough it is, as well as interesting, that Shakspeare had so
                    entirely superseded to his own ear and memory the name Hamnct by the dramatic
                    name of Hamlet, that in writing his will, he actually mis-spells the name of his
                    friend Sadler, and calls him Hamlet. His son, however, who should have
                    familiarized the true name to his ear, had then been dead for twenty
                    years.</p></note> the Dane; it was, however, the real baptismal name of Mr
                    Sadler, a friend of Shakspeare’s, about fourteen years older than himself.
                    Shakspeare’s son must then have been most interesting to his heart, both as a
                    twin child and as his only boy. He died in 1596, when he was about eleven years
                    old. Both daughters survived their father; both married; both left issue, and
                    thus gave a chance for continuing the succession from the great poet. But all
                    the four grandchildren died without offspring.</p>
                <p>Of Shakspeare personally, at least of Shakspeare the man, as distinguished from
                    the author, there remains little more to record. Already in 1592, Greene, in his
                    posthumous Groat's-worth of Wit, had expressed the earliest vocation of
                    Shakspeare in the following sentence:—“There is an upstart crow, beautified with
                    our feathers; in his own conceit the only <hi rend="italic">Shakscene</hi> in a
                    country !” This alludes to Shakspeare’s office of re-casting, and even
                    re-composing, dramatic works, so as to fit them for representation; and Master
                    Greene, it is probable, had suffered in his self-estimation, or in his purse, by
                    the alterations in some piece of his own which the duty of Shakspeare to the
                    general interests of the theatre had obliged him to make. In 1591 it has been
                    supposed that Shakspeare wrote his first drama, the Two Gentlemen of Verona; the
                    least characteristically marked of all his plays, and, with the exception of
                    Love’s Labour’s Lost, the least interesting.</p>
                <p>From this year, 1591 to that of 1611, are just twenty years, within which space
                    lie the whole dramatic creations of Shakspeare, averaging nearly one for every
                    six months. In 1611 was written the Tempest, which is supposed to have been the
                    last of all Shakspeare’s works. Even on that account, as Mr Campbell feelingly
                    observes, it has “a sort of sacredness ;” and it is a most remarkable fact, and
                    one calculated to make a man superstitious, that in this play the great
                    enchanter Prospero, in whom, “<hi rend="italic">as if conscious,”</hi> says Mr
                    Campbell, “<hi rend="italic">that this would be his last work,</hi> the poet has
                    been <hi rend="italic">inspired to typify himself as a</hi> wise, potent, and
                    <hi rend="italic">benevolent magician,”</hi> of whom, indeed, as of Shakspeare
                    himself, it may be said, that “within that circle” (the circle of his own art)
                    “none durst tread but he,” solemnly and for ever renounces his mysterious
                    functions, symbolically breaks his enchanter’s wand, and declares that he will
                    bury his books, his science, and his secrets</p>
                <p>Deeper than did ever plummet sound.</p>
                <p>Nay, it is even ominous, that in this play, and from the<pb break="no"

                    voice of Prospero, issues that magnificent prophecy of the total destruction
                    which should one day swallow up</p>
                <p>The solemn temples, the great globe itself,</p>
                <p>Yea all which it inherit.</p>
                <p>And this prophecy is followed immediately by a most profound ejaculation,
                    gathering into one pathetic abstraction the total philosophy of life:</p>
                <p>We are such stuff</p>
                <p>As dreams are mode of; and our little life Is rounded by a sleep; that is, in
                    effect, our life is a little tract of feverish vigils, surrounded and islanded
                    by a shoreless ocean of sleep— sleep before birth, sleep after death.</p>
                <p>These remarkable passages were probably not undesigned; but if we suppose them to
                    have been thrown off without conscious notice of their tendencies, then,
                    according to the superstition of the ancient Grecians, they would have been
                    regarded as prefiguring words, prompted by the secret genius that accompanies
                    every man, such as insure along with them their own accomplishment. With or
                    without intention, however, it is believed that Shakspeare wrote nothing more
                    after this exquisite romantic drama. with respect to the remainder of his
                    personal history, Dr Drake and others have supposed, that during the twenty
                    years from 1591 to 1611, he visited Stratford often, and latterly once a
                    year.</p>
                <p>In 1589 he had possessed some share in a theatre; in 1596 he had a considerable
                    share. Through Lord Southampton, as a surviving friend of Lord Essex, who was
                    viewed as the martyr to his Scottish politics, there can be no doubt that
                    Shakspeare had acquired the favour of James I.; and accordingly, on the 29th of
                    May 1603, about two months after the king’s accession to the throne of England,
                    a patent was granted to the company of players who possessed the Globe theatre;
                    in which patent Shakspeare’s name stands second. This patent raised the company
                    to the rank of his majesty’s servants, whereas previously they arc supposed to
                    have been simply the servants of the Lord Chamberlain. Perhaps it was in
                    grateful acknowledgment of this royal favour that Shakspeare afterwards, in
                    1606, paid that sublime compliment to the house of Stuart which is involved in
                    the vision shown to Macbeth. This vision is managed with exquisite skill: it was
                    impossible to display the whole series of princes from Macbeth to James I.; but
                    he beholds the posterity of Banquo, one “gold-bound brow” succeeding to another,

                    without tedium the long succession to the very person of James I. by the
                    symbolic image of the two crowns united on one head.</p>
                <p>About the beginning of the century Shakspeare had become rich enough to purchase
                    the best house in Stratford, called <hi rend="italic">The Great House,</hi>
                    which name he altered to <hi rend="italic">New Place;</hi> and in 1602 he bought
                    107 acres adjacent to this house for a sum (L.320) corresponding to about 1500
                    guineas of modern money. Malone thinks that he purchased the house as early as
                    1597; and it is certain that about that time he was able to assist his father in
                    obtaining a renewed grant of arms from the Heralds’ College, and therefore, of
                    course, to re-establish his father’s fortunes. Ten years of well-directed
                    industry, viz. from 1591 to 1601, and the prosperity of the theatre in which he
                    was a proprietor, had raised him to affluence; and after another ten years,
                    improved with the same success, he was able to retire with an income of L.300,
                    or (according to the customary computations) in modem money of L.1500, per
                    annum. Shakspeare was in fact the first man of letters, Pope the second, and Sir
                    Walter Scott the third, who, in Great Britain, has ever realized a large fortune
                    by literature; or in Christendom, if we except Voltaire, and two dubious cases
                    in Italy. The four or five latter years of his life Shakspeare passed in
                    dignified ease, in profound meditation, we may be sure, and in universal
                    respect, at his native town of Stratford; and there he died, on the 23d of April
                    1616.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>“I have heard that
                    Mr Shakspeare was a natural wit, without any art at all. Hee frequented the

                    supplied the stage with two plays every year, and for itt had an allowance so

                    in Stratford. The doctor died in November 1635, aged sixty; his wife, at the age
                    of sixty-six, on July 11, 1640. They had one child, a daughter, named Elizabeth,
                    born in 1608, married April 22, 1626, to Thomas Nashe, Esq. left a widow in
                    1647, and subsequently remarried to Sir John Barnard; but this Lady Barnard, the
                    sole grand-daughter of the poet, had no children by either marriage. The other
                    daughter Judith, on February 10, 1616 (about ten weeks before her father’s
                    death) married Mr Thomas Quiney of Stratford, by whom she had three sons,
                    Shakspeare, Richard, and Thomas. Judith was about thirty-one years old at the
                    time of her marriage; and living just forty-six years afterwards, she died in
                    February 1662, at the age of seventy-seven. Her three sons died without issue;
                    and thus, in the direct lineal descent, it is certain that no representative has

                <p>After this review of Shakspeare’s life, it becomes our duty to take a summary
                    survey of his works, of his intellectual powers, and of his station in

                    openly proclaiming itself, as by the silent homage recorded in the endless
                    multiplication of what he has bequeathed us; not so much by his own compatriots,

                    eminent for wit or learning, than were ever before congregated upon any inquest

                    competition; but even Homer, “with his tail on" (as the Scottish Highlanders say
                    of their chieftains when belted by their ceremonial retinues), musters nothing
                    like the force which <hi rend="italic">already</hi> follows Shakspeare; and be

                    equipage of Shakspeare is advancing in an accelerated ratio. There is, in fact,
                    a great delusion current upon this subject. Innumerable references to Homer, and
                    brief critical remarks on this or that pretension of Homer, this or that scene,
                    this or that passage, he scattered over literature ancient and modern; but the
                    express works dedicated to the separate service of Homer are, after all, not
                    many. In Greek we have only the large Commentary of Eustathius, and the Scholia
                    of Didymus, &amp;c.; in French little or nothing before the prose translation of
                    the seventeenth century, which Pope esteemed “elegant,” and the skirmishings of
                    Madame Dacier, La Motte, &amp;c.; in English, besides the various translations
                    and their prefaces(which, by the way, began as early as 1556), nothing of much
                    importance until the elaborate preface of Pope to the Iliad, and his elaborate
                    postscript to the Odyssey—nothing certainly before that, and very little indeed
                    since that, except Wood’s Essay on the Life and Genius of Homer. On the other
                    hand, of the books written in illustration or investigation of Shakspeare, a
                    very considerable library might be formed in England, and another in
                    Germany.</p></note> or modern, Pagan or Christian. It was a most witty saying
                    with respect to a piratical and knavish publisher, who made a trade of insulting
                    the memories of deceased authors by forged writings, that he was “among the new
                    terrors of death.” But in the gravest sense it may be affirmed of Shakspeare,
                    that he is among the modern luxuries of life; that life, in fact, is a new
                    thing, and one more to be coveted, since Shakspeare has extended the domains of
                    human consciousness, and pushed its dark frontiers into regions not so much as
                    dimly descried or even suspected before his timc, far less illuminated (as now
                    they are) by beauty and tropical luxuriance of life. For instance,—a single
                    instance, indeed one which in itself is a world of new revelation,—the possible
                    beauty of the female character had not been seen as in a dream before Shakspeare
                    called into perfect life the radiant shapes of Desdemona, of Imogene, of
                    Hermione, of Perdita, of Ophelia, of Miranda, and many others. The Una of
                    Spenser, earlier by ten or fifteen years than most of these, was an idealized
                    portrait of female innocence and virgin purity, but too shadowy and unreal for a
                    dramatic reality. And as to the Grecian classics, let not the reader imagine for
                    an instant that any prototype in this field of Shakspearian power can be looked
                    for there. The <hi rend="italic">Antigone</hi> and the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Electra</hi> of the tragic poets are the two leading female characters that
                    classical antiquity offers to our respect, but assuredly not to our impassioned
                    love, as disciplined and exalted in the school of Shakspeare. They challenge our
                    admiration, severe, and even stern, as impersonations of filial duty, cleaving
                    to the steps of a desolate and afflicted old man; or of sisterly affection,
                    maintaining the rights of a brother under circumstances of peril, of desertion,
                    and consequently of perfect self-reliance. lphigenia, again, though not
                    dramatically coming before us in her own person, but according to the beautiful
                    report of a spectator, presents us with a fine statuesque model of heroic
                    fortitude, and of one whose young heart, even in the very agonies of her cruel
                    immolation, refused to forget, by a single indecorous gesture, or so much as a
                    moment’s neglect of her own princely descent, and that she herself was “a lady
                    in the land.” These are fine marble groups, but they are not the warm breathing
                    realities of Shakspeare; there is “no speculation” in their cold marble eyes;
                    the breath of life is not in their nostrils; the fine pulses of womanly
                    sensibilities are not throbbing in their bosoms. And besides this immeasurable
                    difference between the cold moony reflexes of life, as exhibited by the power of
                    Grecian art, and the true sunny life of Shakspeare, it must be observed that the
                    Antigones, &amp;c. of the antique put forward but one single trait of character,
                    like the aloe with its single blossom: this solitary feature is presented to us
                    as an abstraction, and as an insulated quality; whereas in Shakspeare all is
                    presented in the <hi rend="italic">concrete;</hi> that is to say, not brought
                    forward in relief, as by some effort of an anatomical artist; but embodied and
                    imbedded, so to speak, as by the force of a creative nature, in the complex
                    system of a human life; a life in which all the elements move and play
                    simultaneously, and with something more than mere simultaneity or co-existence,
                    acting and re-acting each upon the other, nay, even acting by each other and
                    through each other. In Shakspeare’s characters is felt for ever a real <hi
                    rend="italic">organic</hi> life, where each is for the whole and in the whole,
                    and where the whole is for each and in each. They only are real
                    incarnations.</p>
                <p>The Greek poets could not exhibit any approximations to <hi rend="italic"
                    >female</hi> character, without violating the truth of Grecian life, and
                    shocking the feelings of the audience. The drama with the Greeks, as with us,
                    though much less than with us, was a picture of human life; and that which could
                    not occur in life could not wisely be exhibited on the stage. Now, in ancient
                    Greece, women were secluded from the society of men. The conventual
                    sequestration of the γυvαιχωvίτις, or female apartment<note anchored="true"

                    chambers, but a suite which is partitioned off (as in palaces), not a single

                    threshold against the ingress of males, had been transplanted from Asia into
                    Greece thousands of years perhaps before either convents or Mahommed existed.
                    Thus barred from all open social intercourse, women could not develope or
                    express any character by word or action. Even to <hi rend="italic">have</hi> a
                    character, violated, to a Grecian mind, the ideal portrait of feminine
                    excellence; whence, perhaps, partly the too generic, too little individualized,
                    style of Grecian beauty. But prominently to <hi rend="italic">express</hi> a
                    character was impossible under the common tenor of Grecian life, unless when
                    high tragical catastrophes transcended the decorums of that tenor, or for a
                    brief interval raised the curtain which veiled it. Hence the subordinate part
                    which women play upon the Greek stage in all but some half dozen cases. In the
                    paramount tragedy on that stage, the model tragedy, the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Oedipus Tgrannus</hi> of Sophocles, there is virtually no woman at all; for
                    Jocasta is a party to the story merely as the dead Laius or the self-murdered
                    Sphinx was a party, viz. by her contributions to the fatalities of the event,
                    not by any thing she does or says spontaneously. In fact, the<pb break="no"

                    Greek poet, if a wise poet, could not address himself genially to a task in
                    which he must begin by shocking the sensibilities of his countrymen. And hence
                    followed, not only the dearth of female characters in the Grecian drama, but
                    also a second result still more favourable to the sense of a new power evolved
                    by Shakspeare. Whenever the common law of Grecian life did give way, it was, as
                    we have observed, to the suspending force of some great convulsion or tragical
                    catastrophe. This for a moment (like an earthquake in a nunnery) would set at
                    liberty even the timid, fluttering Grecian women, those doves of the dove-cot,
                    and would call some of them into action. But which? Precisely those of energetic
                    and masculine minds; the timid and feminine would but shrink the more from
                    public gaze and from tumult. Thus it happened, that such female characters as
                    <hi rend="italic">were</hi> exhibited in Greece, could not but be the harsh and
                    the severe. If a gentle Ismene appeared for a moment in contest with some
                    energetic sister Antigone (and chiefly, perhaps, by way of drawing out the
                    fiercer character of that sister), she was soon dismissed as unfit for scenical
                    effect. So that not only were female characters few, but, moreover, of these few
                    the majority were but repetitions of masculine qualities in female persons.
                    Female agency being seldom summoned on the stage except when it had received a
                    sort of special dispensation from its sexual character, by some terrific
                    convulsions of the house or the city, naturally it assumed the style of action
                    suited to these circumstances. And hence it arose, that not woman as she
                    differed from man, but woman as she resembled man—woman, in short, seen under
                    circumstances so dreadful as to abolish the effect of sexual distinction, was
                    the woman of the Greek tragedy.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>And hence, by parity of reason, under the opposite
                    circumstances, under the circumstances which, instead of abolishing, most
                    emphatically drew forth the sexual distinctions, viz. in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >comic</hi> aspects of social intercourse, the reason that we see no women on
                    the Greek stage; the Greek comedy, unless when it affects the extravagant fun of
                    farce, rejects women.</p></note> And hence generally arose for Shakspeare the w
                    ider field, and the more astonishing by its perfect novelty, when he first
                    introduced female characters, not as mere varieties or echoes of masculine
                    characters, a Medea or Clytemnestra, or a vindictive Hecuba, the mere tigress of
                    the tragic tiger, but female characters that had the appropriate beauty of
                    female nature; woman no longer grand, terrific, and repulsive, but woman “after
                    her kind”—the other hemisphere of the dramatic world; woman running through the
                    vast gamut of womanly loveliness; woman as emancipated, exalted, ennobled, under
                    a new law of Christian morality; woman the sister and co-equal of man, no longer
                    his slave, his prisoner, and sometimes his rebel. “It is a far cry to Loch Awe
                    and from the Athenian stage to the stage of Shakspeare, it may be said, is a
                    prodigious interval. True; but prodigious as it is, there is really nothing
                    between them. The Roman stage, at least the tragic stage, as is well known, was
                    put out, as by an extinguisher, by the cruel amphitheatre, just as a candle is
                    made pale and ridiculous by daylight. Those who were fresh from the real murders
                    of the bloody amphitheatre regarded with contempt the mimic murders of the
                    stage. Stimulation too coarse and' too intense had its usual effect in making
                    the sensibilities callous. Christian emperors arose at length, who abolished the
                    amphitheatre in its bloodier features. But by that time the genius of the tragic
                    muse had long slept the sleep of death. And that muse had no resurrection until
                    the age of Shakspeare. So that, notwithstanding a gulf of nineteen centuries and
                    upwards separates Shakspeare from Euripides, the last of the surviving Greek
                    tragedians, the one is still the nearest successor of the other, just as
                    Connaught and the islands in Clew Bay are next neighbours to America, although
                    three thousand watery columns, each of a cubic mile in dimensions, divide them
                    from each other.</p>
                <p>A second reason, which lends an emphasis of novelty and effective power to
                    Shakspeare’s female world, is a peculiar fact of contrast which exists between
                    that and his corresponding world of men. Let us explain. The purpose and the
                    intention of the Grecian stage was not primarily to develope human <hi
                    rend="italic">character,</hi> whether in men or in women; human <hi
                    rend="italic">fates</hi> were its object; great tragic situations under the
                    mighty control of a vast cloudy destiny, dimly descried at intervals, and
                    brooding over human life by mysterious agencies, and for mysterious ends. Man,
                    no longer the representative of an august <hi rend="italic">will,</hi> man the
                    passion-puppet of fate, could not with any effect display what we call a
                    character, which is a distinction between man and man, emanating originally from
                    the will, and expressing its determinations, moving under the large variety of
                    human impulses. The will is the central pivot of character; and this was
                    obliterated, thwarted, cancelled, by the dark fatalism which brooded over the
                    Grecian stage. That explanation will sufficiently clear up the reason why marked
                    or complex variety of character was slighted by the great principles of the
                    Greek tragedy. And every scholar who has studied that grand drama of Greece with
                    feeling,—that drama, so magnificent, so regal, so stately,—and who has
                    thoughtfully investigated its principles, and its difference from the English
                    drama, will acknowledge that powerful and elaborate character, character, for
                    instance, that could employ the fiftieth part of that, profound analysis which
                    has been applied to Hamlet, to Falstaff, to Lear, to Othello, and applied by Mrs
                    Jamieson so admirably to the full development of the Shakspearian heroines,
                    would have been as much wasted, nay, would have been defeated, and interrupted
                    the blind agencies of fate, just in the same way as it would injure the shadowy
                    grandeur of a ghost to individualize it too much. Milton’s angels are slightly
                    touched, superficially touched, with differences of character; but they are such
                    differences, so simple and general, as are just sufficient to rescue them from
                    the reproach applied to Virgil’s “<hi rend="italic">fortemque Gyan, fortemque
                    Cloanthem</hi> just sufficient to make them knowable apart. Pliny speaks of
                    painters who painted in one or two colours; and, as respects the angelic
                    charactere, Milton does so; he is <hi rend="italic">monochromatic.</hi> So, and
                    for reasons resting upon the same ultimate philosophy, were the mighty
                    architects of the Greek tragedy. They also were monochromatic; they also, as to
                    the characters of their persons, painted in one colour. And so far there might
                    have been the same novelty in Shakspeare’s men as in his women. There <hi
                    rend="italic">might</hi> have been; but the reason why there is <hi
                    rend="italic">not,</hi> must be sought in the fact, that History, the muse of
                    History, had there even been no such muse as Melpomene, would have forced us
                    into an acquaintance with human character. History, as the representative of
                    actual life, of real man, gives us powerful delineations of character in its
                    chief agents, that is, in men; and therefore it is that Shakspeare, the absolute
                    creator of female character, was but the mightiest of all painters with regard
                    to male character. Take a single instance. The Antony of Shakspeare, immortal
                    for its execution, is found, after all, as regards the primary conception, in
                    history: Shakspeare’s delineation is but the expansion of the germ already
                    pre-existing, by way of scattered fragments, in Cicero’s Philippics, in Cicero’s
                    Letters, in Appian, &amp;c. But Cleopatra, equally fine, is a pure creation of
                    art: the situation and the scenic circumstances belong to history, but the
                    character belongs to Shakspeare.</p>

                    mighty changeable planet, that lovely satellite of man, Shakspeare stands not
                    the first only, not the original only, but is yet the sole authentic oracle of
                    truth. Woman, therefore, the beauty of the female mind, <hi rend="italic"

                    thought, however, by some readers, that Aeschylus, in his fine phantom of

                    we are sure that our excellent readers would wish) to show every courtesy and
                    attention to this apparition of Darius. It has the advantage of being royal, an
                    advantage which it shares with the ghost of the royal Dane. Yet how different,
                    how removed by a total world, from that or any of Shakspeare’s ghosts! Take that
                    of Banquo, for instance: how shadowy, how unreal, yet how real! Darius is a mere
                    state ghost—a diplomatic ghost. But Banquo—he exists only for Macbeth; the
                    guests do not see him, yet bow solemn, how real, how heart-searching he
                    is.</p></note> no Roman, could have conceived a ghost. That shadowy conception,
                    the protesting apparition, the awful projection of the human conscience, belongs
                    to the Christian mind: and in all Christendom, who, let us ask, who, who but
                    Shakspeare has found the power for effectually working this mysterious mode of
                    being? In summoning back to earth “the majesty of buried Denmark,” how like an
                    awful necromancer does Shakspeare appear! All the pomps and grandeurs which
                    religion, which the grave, which the popular superstition had gathered about the
                    subject of apparitions, are here converted to his purpose, and bend to one awful
                    effect. The wormy grave brought into antagonism with the scenting of the early
                    dawn; the trumpet of resurrection suggested, and again as an antagonist idea to
                    the crowing of the cock (a bird ennobled in the Christian mythus by the part he
                    is made to play at the Crucifixion); its starting “as a guilty thing” placed in
                    opposition to its majestic expression of offended dignity when struck at by the
                    partisans of the sentinels; its awful allusions to the secrets of its
                    prison-house; its ubiquity, contrasted with its local presence; its aerial
                    substance, yet clothed in palpable armour; the heart-shaking solemnity of its
                    language, and the appropriate scenery of its haunt, viz. the ramparts of a
                    capital fortress, with no witnesses but a few gentlemen mounting guard at the
                    dead of night,—what a mist, what a <hi rend="italic">mirage</hi> of vapour, is
                    here accumulated, through which the dreadful being in the centre looms upon us
                    in far larger proportions than could have happened had it been insulated and
                    left naked of this circumstantial pomp! In the <hi rend="italic">Tempest,</hi>

                    ethereal to what is most animal! A phantom of air, an abstraction of the dawn
                    and of vesper sun-lights, a bodiless sylph on the one hand; on the other a gross
                    carnal monster, like the Miltonic Asmodai, “the fleshliest incubus” among the
                    fiends, and yet so far ennobled into interest by his intellectual power, and by
                    the grandeur of misanthropy!<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Caliban has not yet been thoroughly fathomed. For all
                    Shakspeare’s great creations are like works of nature, subjects of unexhaustible
                    study. It was this character of whom Charles I. and some of his ministers
                    expressed such fervent admiration; and, among other circumstances, most justly
                    they admired the new language almost with which he is endowed, for the purpose
                    of expressing his fiendish and yet carnal thoughts of hatred to his master.
                    Caliban is evidently not meant for scorn, but for abomination mixed with fear
                    and partial respect. He is purposely brought into contrast with the drunken
                    Trinculo and Stephano, with an advantageous result. He is much more intellectual
                    than either, uses a more elevated language, not disfigured by vulgarisms, and is
                    not liable to the low passion for plunder as they are. He is mortal, doubtless,
                    as his “dam” (for Shakspeare will not call her mother) Sycorax. But he inherits
                    from her such qualities of power as a witch could be supposed to bequeath. He
                    trembles indeed before Prospero; but that is. as we are to understand, through
                    the moral superiority of Prospero in Christian wisdom; tor when he finds himself
                    in the presence of dissolute and unprincipled men, he rises at once into the
                    dignity of intellectual power.</p></note> ’ In the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Midsummer-Night’s Dream,</hi> again, we have the old traditional fairy, a
                    lovely mode of preternatural life, remodified by Shakspeare’s eternal talisman.
                    Oberon and Titania remind us at first glance of Ariel: they approach, but how
                    far they recede: they are like—“like, but, oh, how different !” And in no other
                    exhibition of this dreamy population of the moonlight forests and forest-lawns,
                    are the circumstantial proprieties of fairy life so exquisitely imagined,
                    sustained, or expressed. The dialogue between Oberon and Titania is, of itself,
                    and taken separately from its connection, one of the most delightful poetic
                    scones that literature affords. The witches in Macbeth are another variety of
                    supernatural life, in which Shakspeare’s power to enchant and to disenchant are
                    alike portentous. The circumstances of the blasted heath, the army at a
                    distance, the withered attire of the mysterious hags, and the choral litanies of
                    their fiendish Sabbath, are as finely imagined in their kind as those which
                    herald and which surround the ghost in Hamlet. There we see the <hi
                    rend="italic">positive</hi> of Shakspeare’s superior power. But now turn and
                    look to the <hi rend="italic">negative.</hi> At a time when the trials of
                    witches, the royal book on demonology, and popular superstition (all so far
                    useful, as they prepared a basis of undoubting faith for the poet’s serious use
                    of such agencies) had degraded and polluted the ideas of these mysterious beings
                    by many mean associations, Shakspeare does not fear to employ them in high
                    tragedy (a tragedy moreover which, though not the very greatest of his efforts
                    as an intellectual whole, nor as a struggle of passion, is <hi rend="italic"
                    >among</hi> the greatest in any view, and positively <hi rend="italic">the</hi>
                    greatest far scenical grandeur, and in that respect makes the nearest approach
                    of all English tragedies to the Grecian modeD; he does not fear to introduce,
                    for the same appalling effect as that for which Aeschylus introduced the
                    Eumenides, a triad of old women, concerning whom an English wit has remarked
                    this grotesque peculiarity in the popular creed of that day,—that although
                    potent over winds and storms, in league with powers of darkness, they yet stood
                    in awe of the constable,—yet relying on his own supreme power to disenchant as
                    well as to enchant, to create and to uncreate, he mixes these women and their
                    dark machineries with the power of armies, with the agencies of kings, and the
                    fortunes of martial kingdoms. Such was the sovereignty of this poet, so mighty
                    its compass!</p>
                <p>A third fund of Shakspeare’s peculiar power lies in his teeming fertility of fine
                    thoughts and sentiments. From his works alone might be gathered a golden
                    bead-roll of thoughts the deepest, subtilest, most pathetic, and yet most
                    catholic and universally intelligible; the most characteristic, also, and
                    appropriate to the particular person, the situation, and the casc, yet, at the
                    same time, applicable to the circumstances of every human being, under all the
                    accidents of life, and all vicissitudes of fortune. But this subject offers so
                    vast a field of observation, it being so eminently the prerogative of Shakspeare
                    to have thought more finely and more extensively than all other poets combined,
                    that we cannot wrong the dignity of such a theme by doing more, in our narrow
                    limits, than simply noticing it as one of the emblazonries upon Shakspeare’s
                    shield.</p>
                <p>Fourthly, we shall indicate (and, as in the last case, <hi rend="italic"
                    >barely</hi> indicate, without attempting in so vast a field to offer any
                    inadequate illustrations) one mode of Shakspeare’s dramatic excellence which
                    hitherto has not attracted any special or separate notice. We allude to the
                    forms of life, and natural human passion, as apparent in the structure of his
                    dialogue. Among the many defects and infirmities of the<pb break="no"

                    French and of the Italian drama, indeed we may say of the Greek, the dialogue
                    proceeds always by independent speeches, replying indeed to each other, but
                    never modified in its several openings by the momentary effect of its several
                    terminal forms immediately preceding. Now, in Shakspeare, who first set an
                    example of that most important innovation, in all his impassioned dialogues,
                    each reply or rejoinder seems the mere rebound of the previous speech. Every
                    form of natural interruption, breaking through the restraints of ceremony under
                    the impulses of tempestuous passion; every form of hasty interrogative, ardent
                    reiteration when a question has been evaded; every form of scornful repetition
                    of the hostile words; every impatient continuation of the hostile statement; in
                    short, all modes and formulae by which anger, hurry, fretfulness, scorn,
                    impatience, or excitement under any movement whatever, can disturb or modify or
                    dislocate the formal bookish style of commencement,—these are as rife in
                    Shakspeare’s dialogue as in life itself; and how much vivacity, how profound a
                    verisimilitude, they add to the scenic effect as an imitation of human passion
                    and real life, we need not say. A volume might be written illustrating the vast
                    varieties of Shakspeare’s art and power in this one field of improvement;
                    another volume might be dedicated to the exposure of the lifeless and unnatural
                    result from the opposite practice in the foreign stages of France and Italy. And
                    we may truly say, that were Shakspeare distinguished from them by this single
                    feature of nature and propriety, he would on that account alone have merited a
                    great immortality. (w. w. w.)</p>
                <p>The dramatic works of Shakspeare generally acknowledged to be genuine consist of
                    thirty-five pieces. The following is the chronological order in which they are
                    supposed to have been written, according to Mr Malone as given in his second
                    edition of Shakspeare, and by Mr George Chalmers in his Supplemental Apology for
                    the Believers in the Shakspeare Papers.</p>

                    as not being Shakspeare’s.</p>
                <p>The first edition of the Works was published in 1623, in a folio volume entitled
                    Mr William Shakspeare’s Comedies, Histories, and Tragedies. The second edition
                    was published in 1632, the third in 1664, and the fourth in 1685, all in folio;
                    but the edition of 1623 is considered the most authentic. Rowe published an
                    edition in seven vols. 8vo in 1709. Editions were published by Pope, in six
                    vols. 4to, in 1725; by Warburton, in eight vols. 8vo, in 1747; by Dr Johnson, in
                    eight vols. 8vo, in 1765; by Stevens, in four vols.8vo, in 1766; by Malone, in
                    ten vols. Hvo, in 1789; by Alexander Chalmers, in nine vols. 8vo, in 1811; by
                    Johnson and Stevens, revised by Isaac Reed, in twenty-one vols. 8vo, in 1813;
                    and the Plays and Poems, with notes by Malone, were edited by James Boswell, and
                    published in twenty-one vols. 8vo, in 1821. Besides these, numerous editions
                    have been published from time to time.</p>
