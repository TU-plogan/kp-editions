                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra

                <p><label type="entry">SEVILLE</label>, the largest, the richest, and most populous
                    of the four kingdoms or provinces of Andalusia, in Spain. Its extent is 752
                    square miles, and its population amounts to 970,087 souls. It is bounded on the
                    east by Granada and Cordova, on the north by Estremadura, on the west by
                    Portugal, and on the south by the Mediterranean Sea.</p>
                <p>The principal river of this province is the Guadalquivir, which, rising in the
                    southern part of New Castille, passes through the whole of the province. This
                    river is navigable for small ships up to the centre of the capital, and much
                    higher for boats and small craft. Below Seville the Guadalquivir is divided into
                    three branches, forming large islands between them, after passing which it
                    unites and enters the ocean at St Lucar.</p>
                <p>A great portion of this province is very mountainous. Next to the mountains of
                    Ronda, the loftiest and most picturesque are the Trocha, to the westward of
                    Algesiras, and those on which the city of Medina is situated, and a part of the
                    Sierra Morena. Although these mountains are for the most part uninhabited and
                    uncultivated, yet they afford excellent pasture for sheep during the winter
                    season, when all is bare in the north of Spain. In the valleys is found the most
                    extensive plains of the richest alluvial land, which, though frequently so burnt
                    up by the heat of the summer sun as to display no traces of vegetation, yet,
                    after two or three days of autumnal rain, produce the very richest pasture. As
                    no hay is made in any part of Andalusia, the greatest distress is experienced by
                    the farmers in keeping their cattle through the summer months, and at that
                    period they feed mostly on broken straw, and become very lean; but after the
                    autumnal rains the verdure is abundant, and the cattle become fat. Though the
                    province of Seville does not grow corn sufficient for its own consumption, yet
                    considerable quantities of wheat and barley are produced. The former grain is
                    generally sown after a fallow, which may be made by about three ploughings in
                    the summer months. Where they have manure, as is the case near the large towns,
                    the increase is very great; and where they have not, the fallow alone will
                    produce a very fair crop. The rotation of crops is little attended to. Clover
                    and turnips are not cultivated. The harvest generally takes place in the latter
                    end of June or beginning of July, when the weather is invariably fine. As soon
                    as the wheat is cut, it is thrashed in the field where it is grown. This is done
                    by piling the sheaves on a floor of round pebbles in the open air; and a number
                    of unbroken mares, with a long rein held by a driver, are galloped in a circle
                    over the sheaves. By this operation, from the dry state of the com, it is
                    easily<pb break="no" facs="ht:chi.28490924&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=182"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0720-0182-0164"/> separated, and the straw is broken into small
                    fragments.</p>
                <p>They then wait till the wind rises, when the breeze performs the operation of
                    separating the grain from the chaff and broken straw. The former is sent to the
                    granary in a kind of rush paniers on the backs of asses, and the latter is made
                    into a clumsy stack in the field, and kept there for food in the dry season. The
                    barley sown in the spring is most rapid in its growth: sometimes in less than
                    twelve weeks from the period of its being sown, it is cut, thrashed, and fit for
                    the market. But grain is not the most important branch of rural economy in this
                    province. Oil, the substitute for butter in warm climates, is the chief
                    dependence of the Andalusian farmer, and the cultivation of it is more congenial
                    to the indolent habits of the natives. The trees only require planting, and will
                    then yield their produce for ages, with but little attention on the part of the
                    proprietors. The oil, though an important article, and the chief source of the
                    wealth of the province, is not made with much attention either to its
                    cleanliness or its sweetness. The oils of Spain are inferior to those of France
                    and Italy, though the olives from which they are made are decidedly superior.
                    Wines are made to a considerable extent in this province, but not sufficient for
                    its consumption.</p>
                <p>Few articles of husbandry are of more universal attention than garlic, which
                    grows in prodigious quantities, and forms in all the markets of Andalusia the
                    most prominent object. The capsicum, or pimento, is also much in demand, and is
                    used in almost every culinary preparation. Instead of hedges formed by thorn
                    bushes, the enclosures are secured by die aloe plant, which makes excellent
                    fences, and, by their sharp points, are a security against all cattle. Instead
                    of orchards of apples and pears, nothing is seen but oranges, lemons,
                    pomegranates, and other fruits of a southern climate.</p>
                <p>One production, not alimentary, is of vast importance, and is sedulously
                    cultivated, the Spanish broom or esparto, which is made into a variety of
                    articles for domestic uses.</p>
                <p>The breed of horses in Andalusia has at all times been very highly esteemed; they
                    have in them a considerable mixture of the Arabian breed. As cows are not kept
                    for the purposes of the dairy, they are rather neglected, and the breed is by no
                    means good. The sheep are numerous; those of the merino kind are migratory, and
                    belong rather to the whole kingdom of Spain than to this particular province.
                    There are, however, large flocks on the mountains; but as their propagation is
                    left in a great measure to nature, neither their flesh nor their wool is very
                    good.</p>
                <p>Some of the largest estates in the province belong to convents, cathedrals, or
                    municipal corporations: they are frequently let to tenants, who pay rent in a
                    portion of the produce. The richer inhabitants in all parts of the peninsula
                    prefer mules to horses for drawing their carriages; and they are used by the
                    corps of artillery in the military service, where they can be procured, in
                    preference to horscs.</p>
                <p>Besides its agricultural riches, this province is stored with mineral wealth to a
                    great degree. It is well known that the Romans drew from this district, then
                    called Betica, a great portion of their silver; and it continued equally
                    productive during the power of the Arabian race; but the discovery of America,
                    an event contemporaneous with the final extinction of the Moorish government,
                    rendered the industry applied to mining less productive, and in consequence it
                    has greatly diminished. There are, however, mines of silver, copper, mercury,
                    lead, and iron, still worked. The commerce and manufactures of this province are
                    almost wholly confined to the cities of Cadiz and Seville. The inhabitants are
                    estimated at 746,221. It possesses the laws and privileges of Castille. The
                    captain-general resides at Puerto Maria, but there is a royal audienza at
                    Seville.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Seville</hi>, a city of Spain, the capital of the province
                    of the same name, and formerly the capital of the ancient kingdom of Aragon. Its
                    origin is unknown; but, un der the Roman government, it was a place of
                    considerable note under the narae Hispalis. It enjoys a most delightful climate,
                    and is surrounded by a fruitful country. It contains about 100,000 inhabitants,
                    exclusive of the suburb Triana, divided from it by the river. The population of
                    the latter is about 15,000.</p>
                <p>Seville abounds with ancient buildings, both Roman and Moorish, and with numerous
                    modem structures of great extent and magnificence. The golden tower, on the
                    banks of the river, is said to have been the work of Julius Csesar. It is in
                    perfect repair, and, before Cadiz rose to its present importance, the gold and
                    silver transmitted from America was landed here, and deposited in this tower, on
                    account of its strength and security. The aqueduct which supplies the city with
                    spring-water is the work of the same people. It is still in perfect repair, and
                    now, after the lapse of ages, serves the purpose for which it was originally
                    constructed. In the vicinity of the city, at the ancient town of Italica, the
                    birthplace of the Emperor Trajan, are the remains of an ancient amphitheatre,
                    which, though partly in ruins, is sufficiently perfect to show its plan and
                    extent; and from the rows of benches for spectators, which remain, it may be
                    calculated that it would seat about ten thousand persons. Its dilapidated
                    condition is the result of an earthquake, and has not been occasioned by the
                    regular decay of time.</p>
                <p>The chief building of the Moorish period that remains is the alcazar or palace:
                    the date of its origin is not ascertained. A considerable part was added by
                    Peter the Cruel, between the years 1353 and 1364. In the addition, the Arabian
                    style of building is so closely imitated, that it is impossible to determine
                    which part was built first. Though the exterior is mean, like all the Arabian
                    buildings, yet the inside is beautifully filled up with noble staircases, marble
                    halls, and courts with fountains of pure and cool water. Before the French
                    entered Andalusia, the central junta occupied the palace after their dispersion.
                    Joseph Bonaparte held his court in it.</p>
                <p>Some of the houses of this city, belonging to individuals, have the most entire
                    specimens of the exquisite stucco workmanship with which the rich Moors adorned
                    the interior of their houses. In some of the most obscure streets of the city
                    are found houses with the exterior appearance of a prison, with no windows
                    towards the town, and only an entrance through massy doors studded or plated
                    with iron; but the visiter, on entering, is surprised with the view of arcades
                    surrounded with marble courts and sparkling fountains, and the whole adorned
                    with that durable kind of stucco, in the composition of which the Moors so
                    greatly excelled.</p>
                <p>The buildings erected in Seville since the extirpation of the Moors are
                    materially different in their style of architecture. One of these is the
                    cathedral, with its tower, the Giraldo, 360 feet in height. The length of this
                    church is 398, and the breadth 290; but its choir and principal altar being in
                    the centre, they take off very considerably from the effect of its dimensions.
                    The different specimens of architecture which in successive periods have
                    prevailed in Spain, may all be seen in this extraordinary church. The tower, and
                    a part called the orange court. <hi rend="italic">Patio de las Narangas,</hi>
                    was built about the year 1000, by the Moors, and in their peculiar style;
                    another part, built 200 years later, is in the Gothic taste, which was then
                    introduced into Spain; whilst the part which completed it, and which was
                    finished about the year 1520, is in a style denominated by Spanish artists <hi
                    rend="italic">plarareca,</hi> or the imitation of the silver ornaments of a
                    Catholic church. Though this last fashion is a most gross perversion of taste,
                    yet the contrast with the Gothic is not unpleasing; and, viewed as a whole, the
                    cathedral is perhaps one of the grandest of all the modern edifices in the
                    Peninsula.</p>
                <p>La Lonja, or the Exchange, for it was designed, though<pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:chi.28490924&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=183" xml:id="kp-eb0720-0183-0165"/>
                    never used, for that purpose, was completed in 1598, and is a most extensive and
                    chaste building, now used as a depository for state-papers, in which are
                    collected all the original despatches from America at the period of its
                    discovery, and the library of the son of Columbus. The college of the Jesuits,
                    since converted into the inquisition, is a most beautiful pile of building, with
                    a handsome church, a hall of judgment, and various cells for the reception of
                    prisoners.</p>
                <p>This city abounds in convents, monasteries, and other religious establishments,
                    most of them richly endowed; and their chapels are the repositories of the
                    finest specimens of the art of painting, at the period which produced better
                    artists in Spain than in any other part of Europe. The works of the native
                    artists Murillo, Velasquez, Zubaran, Spanioletti, Morales, Cano, and others, as
                    well as of Titian, Rubens, Michel Angelo, and other foreigners, are preserved in
                    the cathedral, and in several of the other churches, chapels, and convents.</p>
                <p>There is a university, though the building is gloomy and tasteless, and the
                    professors neither enlightened or learned; the number of pupils is very
                    considerable, and most of them are destined for the ecclesiastical profession.
                    It is said that two thirds of the houses in this city are either the property of
                    the cathedral or other ecclesiastical bodies, who receive the rents of them in
                    some cases weekly, and in others monthly.</p>
                <p>In this city the edifices belonging to the government are numerous and extensive.
                    The mint is one of them, in which the whole process of coining money is
                    conducted. There is a foundery for cannon, a manufactory for muskets, swords,
                    and other military accoutrements; but the largest establishment is the
                    manufactory of tobacco, which, being a royal monopoly, can be sold only by the
                    crown, either in the form of snuff, or in cigars or smaller particles for
                    smoking.</p>
                <p>The manufactures of this city are not great in proportion to the whole number of
                    the population. But a large proportion of the inhabitants are ecclesiastics; and
                    a much larger portion are paupers, who have no inducement to work, because they
                    can obtain bare necessaries by going the rounds of different convents, where
                    food is gratuitously bestowed on them, or by receiving from the episcopal palace
                    a share of the alms which are daily dispensed. There are, however, fifteen
                    hundred looms employed in making silk goods of various descriptions. Very little
                    silk is raised in the vicinity of the city, it being principally drawn from
                    Valencia and Murcia, where mulberry-trees abound. There are some manufactories
                    of cloths, serges, hats, stockings, and other more minute articles-There is a
                    very extensive establishment for currying leather, and every part of the
                    process, from the first currying to the conversion into boots, shoes, saddles,
                    bridles, gloves, and other articles, is carried on upon a large scale. The bark
                    of the cork-trees is used for tanning, which, though not so strong as the common
                    oak-bark, is yet in larger quantities found to be equally efficacious.</p>
                <p>The foreign trade of Seville is but small, the harbour of Cadiz being more
                    commodious for large vessels. The principal exports are, oil, goat and kid
                    skins, quicksilver, liquorice, shumac, cork, and olives. The imports are almost
                    wholly made through Cadiz.</p>
                <p>The streets of Seville are in general so narrow as to forbid the passage of
                    carriages through most of them; and some, in which frequently the best houses
                    are to be found, are so close, that a person standing in the middle and
                    extending both arms may touch the walls on the opposite sides. There is,
                    however, what compensates for this, a fine public walk on the banks of the
                    Guadalquivir, where all that is fashionable of the city may be seen enjoying the
                    cool of the evening. This city was the birthplace of the Emperors Trajan,
                    Adrian, and Theodosius; of Juan de la Cueva, of Diego Velasquez de Silva, and of
                    Francis de Herrara. It is situated in long. 5.18. W. and lot. 37. 24. N.</p>
