                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">The</hi> term <hi rend="italic">Surgery,</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">Chirurgery,</hi> from <hi rend="italic">χειg, the hand,</hi> and
                    <hi rend="italic">εϑγοv, work,</hi> originally signified, as its derivation
                    implies, the manual procedure, by means of instruments or not, directed towards
                    the repair of injury and the cure of disease; in contradistinction to the
                    practice of <hi rend="italic">medicine,</hi> denoting the treatment of disease
                    by the administration of drugs, or other substances supposed to be of a sanative
                    tendency. Such a meagre description applied but too justly to surgery in its
                    infancy, and still more after its separation from its twin-sister medicine, in
                    the twelfth century. When its practice was denounced by the Council of Tours as
                    derogatory to the dignity of the sacred office of the priesthood, and beneath
                    the attention of all men of learning, the term chirurgery, in its most literal
                    interpretation, was quite sufficient to comprehend the duties of the degraded
                    and uninformed surgeon, who had become a mere mechanic, attached to and
                    completely dependent on the learned and philosophic physician. But the matured
                    progress of the healing art has, fortunately for science and humanity, rendered
                    such a definition of surgery in these days utterly untenable. Its complete
                    separation from medicine would now be attended with the utmost difficulty; nor
                    is it desirable that the attempt should be made, because its success, however
                    partial and imperfect, would be most hurtful to both. They are now, and it is to
                    be hoped will ever remain, one and inseparable. Their principles are the same
                    throughout, and the exercise of their different branches requires the same
                    fundamental knowledge; but their details are so numerous and intricate as to
                    render it most difficult, if not impossible, for any one individual to cultivate
                    all with equal success. The consequence has been, that while the theory and
                    principles of physic and surgery remain united, as constituting one and the same
                    science, the practical parts are now frequently separated into distinct
                    professions, each person adopting that department most congenial to his
                    pursuits, and for the management of which he conceives himself best qualified.
                    The separation however is not that of acquirements, but merely of practice. It
                    should never be forgotten, that the physician, before he can be either
                    accomplished or successful in his profession, must be intimate with the
                    principles, if not with the practice of surgery. And most certainly no one can
                    ever lay just claim even to the title of surgeon, far less hope for eminence or
                    success, unless he be equally qualified to assume both the appellation and the
                    employment of the physician.</p>
                <p>Many and laboured have been the attempts to define surgery according to its
                    present state, so as to prevent interference with the department of physic. This
                    example we will not follow. The arrangement as to what is medical, and what
                    surgical, must in a great measure depend on custom, not on fixed and permanent
                    rules. The paths of the practical surgeon and physician are distinct, but in
                    their course they must often cross each other; and these collisions, 60 far from
                    being avoided, ought rather to be sought, as probable sources of mutual benefit,
                    so long as those enlightened feelings are entertained, and that honourable
                    conduct pursued, which ought ever to distinguish the followers of a liberal,
                    useful, and learned profession.</p>
                <p>The limits allotted to this article not permitting us to enter into the details
                    of surgery, we must content ourselves with a sketch of its history, and with
                    some account of its improved condition as it is at present practised.</p>
                <p>That surgery is as old as man himself, that it was coeval with his fallen state,
                    there can be little doubt. The fall entailed the frequent reception of injuries
                    by external violence; and to assuage their pain and remove their inconvenience,
                    the ingenuity and contrivance of the sufferer were powerfully excited. Thus it
                    would seem, that as to antiquity of origin, surgery must take precedence of
                    medicine. And after wars and dissensions began to prevail, and wounds and
                    injuries became both more frequent and more deadly, it is most probable that to
                    these the practitioners of the healing art alone directed their attention,
                    before the nature of disease began to be understood, or its cure was supposed to
                    be within the reach of human means.</p>
                <p>As to the state of surgery among the early Egyptians, we know but little, except
                    that it was customary, in the time of. Joseph, to embalm the dead; a process
                    which appertains closely to both medicine and surgery. There are some grounds,
                    however, for suspecting that they were more conversant with surgery than is
                    generally supposed; for it is said that on “the ruined walls of the renowned
                    temples of ancient Thebes, basso-relievos have been found, displaying surgical
                    operations, and instruments not far different from some in use in modern times.”
                    Their medical practice, entirely founded on incantation and astrology, was
                    sufficiently simple. They divided the body into thirty-six parts, believing in
                    an equal number of demons, to whom those parts were intrusted, and to invoke
                    whose aid in sickness was the principal duty of the physician, each spirit being
                    called upon to cure his own peculiar portion.</p>
                <p>Among the Jews, the operation of circumcision was performed, no doubt skilfully
                    and dexterously, though with rude implements, by the priesthood, an order which,
                    for many ages, and in many climes, conjoined the cure of the body with that of
                    the soul.</p>
                <p>The earliest notice of this art is from the ancient Greeks, who, it is probable,
                    had derived their medical traditions from the Egyptians. They considered
                    medicine to be of divine origin; and its first professors, as they inform us,
                    were no less personages than gods and sons of gods.</p>
                <p>Medicine and surgery, at their origin, were conjoined; and both continued to be
                    practised indiscriminately, until separated by the Arabian school. Their
                    complete estrangement occurred, as we have already stated, about the middle of
                    the twelfth century. At first, surgery chiefly occupied the attention of the
                    ancient leech, as the more certain and more obviously useful branch of his
                    profession; but ultimately it became very secondary to medicine when dignified
                    by philosophy and priestcraft.</p>
                <p>Chiron the Centaur, born in Thessaly, is presumed to have been the father of
                    surgery, celebrated for skilfully applying soothing herbs to wounds and bruises.
                    But his fame is somewhat endangered by that of Aesculapius, the son of Apollo,
                    by some held to be the pupil of Chiron, by others, his predecessor and superior.
                    Aesculapius is supposed to have been deified, on account of his skill, about
                    fifty years before the Trojan war. His very existence however has been
                    questioned. Apollo was the original god of physic among the early Greeks; but he
                    appears to have resigned in favour of Aesculapius, whose temples became the
                    depositories of medical and surgical knowledge; more particularly those of
                    Epidaurus, Cnidos, Cos, and Pergamus.</p>
                <p>Certain it is, according to the testimony of Celsus, that Aesculapius is the most
                    ancient authority in surgery. His immediate descendants, two sons, Podalirius
                    and Machaon, have been immortalized by Homer. They followed Agamemnon to the
                    Trojan war, and there their services were so highly valued as to secure them a
                    not unconspicuous niche among the heroes of the Iliad. Of the two, Machaon seems
                    to have beep the more distinguished. When he is wounded by Paris, the whole army
                    is represented as interested in<pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:chi.28490924&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=967" xml:id="kp-eb0720-0967-0821"/>
                    his recovery. Even the stern Achilles inquires anxiously after “the wounded
                    offspring of the healing god and the valiant Nestor, to whose care he is
                    intrusted, is exhorted to unwonted exertion in his behalf; “for a leech who,
                    like him, knows how to cut out darts, and relieve the smarting of wounds by
                    soothing unguents, is to armies more in value than many other heroes.”
                    Podalirius enjoys the distinction of being reputed the first of phlebotomists,
                    and probably the most successful, from his time to this; having opened a vein in
                    either arm of the king of Caria’s daughter, who had been severely injured by a
                    fall from the house-top, having, after her recovery, been rewarded with the hand
                    of the fair princess, and having been presented by her munificent father with
                    the Chersonese as her dowry. As to medicine, they seem to have been either
                    ignorant, or in no great repute; for, on the breaking out of pestilence in the
                    Grecian camp, Homer neglects them entirely, and applies at once to Apollo. And
                    even their surgical attainments, for which they are celebrated by him, seem to
                    have extended no farther than to the simple extraction of darts and other
                    offensive weapons, the checking of haemorrhage by styptics or pressure, and the
                    application of lenitive salves. The poet takes notice of his warriors sustaining
                    fracture of the bones; but in such emergencies he adopts the same course as in
                    the pestilence, and invokes the aid of the nonprofessional deities; from which
                    circumstance we may infer, that in those days surgery had made but little
                    advancement.</p>
                <p>For upwards of 600 years after the Trojan war. there are scarcely any accounts of
                    medicine and surgery. They seem to have remained strangely stationary during the
                    whole of that period. Their practice was confined to the Asclepiades, or reputed
                    descendants of Aesculapius; whose lore was orally communicated from father to
                    son in that family, until they received an extraordinary impulse from the great
                    Hippocrates, himself a branch of the family, and said to have been the fifteenth
                    in lineal descent from the deified founder. The Asclepiades, in the course of
                    their monopoly, established three schools of medicine, at Rhodes, at Cnidos, and
                    at Cos. The last gave Hippocrates to the world, and thus attained a proud and
                    enduring pre-eminence.</p>
                <p>Pythagoras was the first who brought philosophy to bear upon the practice of the
                    healing art, and led the way in raising it to the dignity of a science.
                    Democritus, the happy sage, likewise turned his attention to medicine as a
                    branch of general philosophy, and pursued it zealously. He lived in terms of
                    friendship with Hippocrates, by whom he was held in great respect. By Pythagoras
                    a school at Crotona was founded, about the time of Tarquinius Superbus,
                    espousing doctrines somewhat different from those of Cos and Cnidos. It produced
                    Damocedes, a contemporary of Pythagoras, who seems to have practised in Athens,
                    an honoured and successful surgeon. By Polycrates, king of Samos, he was
                    presented with two talents of gold for having cured him of a troublesome
                    distemper. He was afterwards taken captive by the Persians. Their king, Darius,
                    was intrusted to his care for a dislocated ancle, as well as the queen, Atossa,
                    for a cancer of the breast; and he was soon loaded with honour and wealth on
                    account of his wonderful cures, performed after the Egyptian physicians,
                    previously in attendance, had signally failed.</p>
                <p>But we cannot suppose such men as Damocedes and the Asclepiades to have attained
                    any great proficiency in surgery; for the touch of a dead body was interdicted
                    as a profanation both by Jew and Greek, and consequently they must have been
                    almost entirely ignorant of anatomy. They may have understood something of the
                    skeleton, from their practice amongst fractures and dislocations; and they may
                    have formed some general idea of the viscera, from researches in comparative
                    anatomy, and from instruction by the Egyptians, whose practice in embalming
                    afforded ampler scope for observation. But the minute structure of the human
                    body must have been to them a profound mystery. And, knowing that anatomy is,
                    was, and ever must be, the foundation of true surgical knowledge, we cannot
                    evade the conviction that surgery, though occasionally successful and honoured
                    in ancient times, must have been nothing more than a rude, imperfect, and
                    uncertain art. The practice of its professors seems to have been extremely
                    limited, consisting of little more than the binding up of wounds, and the
                    staunching of haemorrhage by styptics and the cautery; the extraction of darts
                    and other missiles from the wounds which they had inflicted; phlebotomy, both
                    general and local; and cupping by scarification. Whether they practised the
                    capital operations or not, we are not informed; but it is probable that their
                    comparative ignorance of anatomy effectually deterred them from any extensive
                    division of the soft parts, as extremely hazardous and uncertain.</p>
                <p>Hippocrates, born in the 80th Olympiad, upwards of 400 years before the Christian
                    era, did more for medicine and surgery than all who had preceded him; and indeed
                    few of those who have succeeded him have been of equal service to the
                    profession. He soon freed medicine in a great measure from the absurdities with
                    which ignorance and superstition had invested it; and through a long, honoured,
                    and glorious life he set a splendid example of persevering industry,
                    philosophical research, and high moral worth. His fame soon raised the Coan
                    school far above its rivals. Though his anatomical knowledge seems little better
                    than a blending of ingenuity with error, yet he appears to have had some
                    indistinct notions of the circulation of the blood; but Dr Pitcairne, in his
                    “Solutio Problematis de Inventoribus,” has sufficiently evinced that he was very
                    far from anticipating the great discovery of Harvey. With all his deficiencies,
                    and notwithstanding all the disadvantages under which he laboured, so correct
                    was his observation, and so faithful his chronicling of disease, that many of
                    his descriptions may be fairly inserted in our modern nosologies. Though his
                    attention was chiefly directed towards the improvement and promotion of physic,
                    now begirt with philosophy, and studied as a science, and though his practice
                    was principally confined to the treatment of internal disease, yet he was not
                    wholly inattentive to surgery. And his practice seems to have been tolerably
                    bold and decisive; for, in regard to external disease, it was with him a maxim,
                    that “when medicine failed, recourse should be had to the knife, and when the
                    knife was unsuccessful, to fire ;” a substance of which all the ancient doctors
                    seem to have been particularly fond, from Prometheus downwards. Hippocrates
                    employed it not only in a variety of diseases, but in various forms. Sometimes
                    he applied red-hot irons to the part; sometimes he raised a conflagration on it,
                    and of it, by a piece of wood dipped in boiling oil, or by burning a roll of
                    flax after the manner of the modem moxa. He also made use of tents and issues,
                    as more gentle means of counter-irritation. He seems to have performed the
                    capital operations with boldness and success, excepting lithotomy, the practice
                    of which appears to have been confined to a few who made it their exclusive
                    study. He however recommends the removal of calculus, large and firmly lodged in
                    the kidney, by incision; adding, probably in apology for the daring of the
                    procedure, that otherwise there are no hopes of a cure, and that the disease
                    must prove fatal. He reduced dislocations, and set fractures, but clumsily and
                    cruelly; extracted the foetus with forceps when necessary; and both used and
                    abused the trepan, employing it not only in depression and other accidents of
                    the cranium, but also in cases of headach, and other affections to which the
                    operation was inapplicable. In cases of empyema and hydrothorax, after
                    ascertaining by percussion that fluid was present in the cavity of the chest, he
                    did not hesitate to make an incision between the ribs; and having allowed part
                    of the fluid to escape, he placed a tent in the wound, and by withdrawing it
                    regularly once a day, the whole was ulti-<pb break="no"

                    mately evacuated. He seems to have been perfectly acquainted with tetanus and
                    spontaneous gangrene; observing, that even minute wounds of tendinous parts, as
                    the fingers and toes, sometimes produce convulsions which terminate fatally; and
                    that black spots on the feet frequently increase to extensive gangrene and
                    incurable mortifications. Some of his practices have been long and justly
                    exploded, some have been successfully continued, and others have, after disuse,
                    been revived as modern inventions. For example, his method of ascertaining the
                    presence or absence of fluid in the chest was by percussion, and applying the
                    ear to the part, thus anticipating the use of the modern stethoscope. One of his
                    modes of counter-irritation, we have seen, was by burning flax on the part, as
                    in the modern moxa; and he strongly recommends the production of eschars on the
                    back and breast in the earlier stages of pulmonary disease, thus anticipating
                    the supposed valuable discoveries of a celebrated modern charlatan. His writings
                    are elegant, and well repay a careful perusal. By them he made posterity his
                    debtor; his contemporaries were not insensible to his merits, and endeavoured to
                    reward them during his life. The inhabitants of Argos voted him a statue of
                    gold; he was more than once crowned by the Athenians, and, though a stranger,
                    was initiated into the most sacred mysteries of their religion, the highest
                    distinction which they could confer; alter his death, universal and almost
                    divine honours were paid to his memory; temples were erected to him, and his
                    altars covered with offerings.</p>
                <p>We have already seen that surgery had long been stationary before the time of
                    Hippocrates; and it made but little advancement during many succeeding
                    generations. The Asclepiades had confined the knowledge of medicine among
                    themselves; Hippocrates, however, gave oral instructions in anatomy and the art
                    of healing, and thus disclosed its mysteries to the world. But few of his
                    disciples seem to have profited much by his liberality. One of them, his kinsman
                    Ctesias, we are told, acquired considerable renown for his skill; and having
                    been taken prisoner by Artaxerxes Mnemon, in a battle fought against his brother
                    Cyrus, was successful in curing him of a severe wound, and thus obtained favour
                    with his captor. Plato began to flourish about this time; but though he was
                    connected with medicine, we cannot lay claim to him as eminent in surgery; and
                    he was more famous for his philosophy than his physic. Perhaps the most
                    distinguished in surgery, among the more immediate successors of Hippocrates,
                    was Diodes Carystus. He devoted more attention to anatomy than any of his
                    predecessors, was curious in bandaging wounds of the head, and invented the
                    bellulon, an instrument for extracting darts. Carrying his surgery into the
                    practice of medicine, he was not very happy in the result; from observing that
                    external wounds, abscesses, and inflammations were attended with fever, he
                    supposed that general fever was uniformly occasioned by one or more of these
                    causes operating internally. He followed Hippocrates in practice, and, like him,
                    cultivated his profession, “not for lucre or vain-glory, but from real love of
                    the medical art, and a pure spirit of humanity.” Praxagoras of Cos was the last
                    of the Asclepiades who succeeded in leaving a name behind him. As a surgeon he
                    is reported to have been bold in the extreme, incising the fauces freely, and
                    excising portions of the soft palate, in bad cases of cynanche; and making
                    incisions into the bowels to remove obstructions, when milder measures failed.
                    Aristotle, the celebrated preceptor of Alexander the Great, although not
                    strictly in the medical profession, was the promulgator of doctrines which for a
                    long time had a powerful effect on medicine. While he followed out the general
                    principles of the healing art, and was curious in anatomical research, he seems
                    to have disdained to meddle with the practical details, and among the rest those
                    of surgery.</p>
                <p>On the dismemberment of the vast empire of Macedonia after the death of Alexander
                    the Great, learning took up its chief abode at Alexandria, under the protection
                    of Ptolemy Soter. And here it was that popular prejudice first gave way, and
                    permitted the examination of dead bodies, the greatest possible boon to the
                    medical profession, inasmuch as it removed what had hitherto been the most
                    serious obstacle to its advancement, ignorance of human anatomy. Heropbilus and
                    Erasistratus, the two great heads of the Egyptian medical school, were the first
                    who had an opportunity of practising human dissection, the bodies of criminals
                    having been given to them for that purpose; and they consequently not only
                    corrected many errors, but made numerous and important discoveries, in anatomy;
                    thus imparting a fresh stimulus, and affording a new and more solid basis to
                    both medicine and surgery. By some they have been accused of carrying their
                    enthusiasm in this inquiry to such an extent as to "open the bodies of living
                    criminals for the furtherance of their physiological views ;" but this is
                    probably a mere exaggeration, originating in the horror with which human
                    dissection was at first regarded; a horror which unfortunately is not even in
                    our day altogether extinguished, notwithstanding the recent legislative
                    enactments in favour of anatomical research. But we find even these privileged
                    men falling into most palpable mistakes; for example, Heropbilus plainly
                    confounds the tendons and ligaments with the nerves. Yet the fact that the names
                    which he gave to many parts still remain in use, will of itself remind posterity
                    how much they are indebted to him for his anatomical labours. He was likewise
                    one of the greatest surgeons of ancient times, and, as well as Erasistratus,
                    acquired as much fame for brilliant cures as for anatomical knowledge. The
                    surgical practice of the latter was characterized by peculiar boldness and
                    decision, and strongly marked with the failing of his time and school, a love of
                    multiplying and inventing murderous implements, mid the relentless use of them.
                    “In schirrosities and tumours of the liver, he did not scruple to make an ample
                    division of the integuments, and try applications to that viscus itself. He
                    followed the same practice in diseases of the spleen, which he regarded as of
                    little consequence in the animal economy.” And perhaps he was right in his
                    supposition, though not in his practice. In cases of retention of urine, he made
                    use of the particular catheter which hing bore his name. Xenophon of Cos, said
                    to have been a follower of Erasistratus, seems to have been among the first who
                    arrested haemorrhage from a member, by encircling it tightly with a ligature.
                    Mantius, a pupil of Heropbilus, wrote a treatise on surgical dressings, which he
                    rendered complicated in the extreme. Another, Andreas of Carystus, wrote on the
                    union of fractured bones, and invented several ponderous machines for reducing
                    luxations of the femur. Indeed the surgeons of the Alexandrian school were all
                    distinguished by the nicety and complexity of their dressings and bandagings, of
                    which they invented a great variety. Among them, as in the time of Hippocrates.
                    lithotomy was practised by particular individuals, who devoted themselves
                    exclusively to that operation; and we are told that one of them, Ammonius,
                    employed an instrument. by means of which he broke down stones in the bladder,
                    plainly anticipating Civiale, and furnishing a marked example to the present age
                    of the truth of Solomon’s apophthegm, that “there is nothing new under the
                    sun.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>A curious
                    illustration of this is given by Dr James Johnson, in the narrative of his visit
                    to Pompeii. “The Dillator or Speculum, for which Mr Weiss of the Strand obtained
                    so much repute a few years ages, has its exact prototype in the Bourbon Museum
                    at Naples. The coincidence in such an ingenious contrivance would be absolutely
                    miraculous; but unfortunately there is a key to the similitude, which
                    de-</p></note> * It is not improbable that some of their other practices might

                    striking examples of this sometimes unpalatable truth; but unfortunately the
                    greater part of the writings of the Alexandrian school perished in the
                    conflagration of the famous national library in the time of Julius Caesar; a
                    calamity fraught with immense loss to the healing art, as well as to almost
                    every other branch of knowledge.</p>
                <p>The arts and sciences followed the scat of empire in its transfer to Europe under
                    Julius Caesar, and Rome became the grand centre of intellectual illumination.
                    Notwithstanding the shrewd sense displayed by the ancient Romans in most
                    matters, it is strange, yet true, that for centuries all ranks of society, from
                    the mere plebeian rabble to the censor, had entertained an abhorrence of all
                    practitioners of medicine and surgery, and trusted for cures to spells and
                    incantations. Indeed public edicts were issued, “discouraging all countenance to
                    the professed exercise of physic, and recommending faith in traditionary
                    prescriptions and religious rites." Cato the censor managed the sick of his own
                    family according to the terms of this edict, and gravely wrote down the words of
                    incantation for curing dislocation or fracture. For nearly the first 600 years
                    of its existence, Rome, accordingly, had no regular practitioner of medicine.
                    The first we read of was Archagathus, a Greek, from the Alexandrian school, who
                    practised in Rome, chiefly as a surgeon, during the consulates of Lucius
                    Aemilius and Marcus Livius. At first his surgical skill obtained for him no
                    inconsiderable fame, but the ancient prejudice soon revived in full vigour. An
                    enraged populace —perhaps not without some reason, for he seems to have been
                    particularly fond of the knife and cautery—compelled hint not only to suspend
                    his practice, but, changing his original title of “healer of wounds” to that of
                    “executioner,” caused him to be banished from the Roman capital. Afterwards,
                    however, a native of Bithynia, assuming the name of Asclepiades, established
                    himself in tolerable repute by virtue of insinuating manners, shrewd common
                    sense, and the performance of several fortunate cures “tuto, cito, et jucunde.”
                    But with him we have little concern, for his sagacity soon taught him that it
                    was essential to his welfare to avoid the unpopular practice of surgical
                    operations, and accordingly he confined himself entirely to the apparently less
                    hurtful administration of medicine. The only important traces of his surgical
                    practice are, that in ascites he practised and recommended discharge of the
                    accumulated fluid by minute punctures of the abdominal parietes; and that for
                    quinsy, which term probably comprehended many of the various acute diseases of
                    the throat now known and distinguished, he not only employed bold blood-letting,
                    local and general, by the lancet and by cupping, but also had recourse to
                    scarification of the fauces, and even attempted laryngotomy. By novel and
                    successful cures in his medical practice, and frequent indulgence in skillful
                    quackery, he obtained great personal reputation, and so far overcame popular
                    prejudice as to establish a tolerably fair field in Rome for future
                    practitioners. He was the contemporary of Caesar, and the personal friend of
                    Cicero. The latter is eloquent in his praise, and through him seems to have
                    formed a high estimate of the medical character. “Nothing,” says he, “brings men
                    nearer to the gods, than by giving health to their fellow-creatures.” It would
                    thus seem that, in his time at least, the ancient grudge against the doctors had
                    abated in Rome. Among the disciples and immediate followers of Asclepiades was
                    Cassius, described as Iatro-Sophista, who left behind him several works on
                    anatomical and surgical subjects. In one of the latter he distinctly accounts
                    for wounds on one side of the head producing paralysis on the other, from the
                    decussation of the nerves; a tolerable proof that he was not only a good
                    anatomist for the time, but also an observant practitioner.</p>
                <p>Rome itself did not produce a single medical practitioner of any reputation
                    before the age of Aulus Cornelius Celsus, although he himself chooses to be
                    complimentary to some of his immediate predecessors, “Tryphon, Euelpistus, and
                    Meges, the most learned of them all.” Celsus, the contemporary of Horace,
                    Virgil, and Ovid, likened to Hippocrates for the quantity of his sound practical
                    information, and to Cicero for the elegance of his style, lived in the reigns of
                    Tiberius, Caligula, Claudius, and Nero, in the beginning of the first century of
                    Christianity, upwards of 150 years before Galen.<note anchored="true"

                    Hippocrates and Asclepiades, more particularly the latter, and gives a complete
                    and excellent digest of all the true medical and surgical knowledge of his
                    times, although it is not certain that he himself either practised medicine or
                    operated in surgery. “Of his surgical operations and remarks, many are yet far
                    from being obsolete, and impress us with a high idea of his ingenuity and
                    judgment. His mode of performing lithotomy (on the gripe) has been in recent
                    times warmly defended by Heister, especially as applicable to children. He
                    describes the operation for cataract by depression, and the method of forming an
                    artificial pupil. The whole of his account of injuries of the head is admirable,
                    and evinces wonderful tact and discrimination. His rules for distinguishing
                    fracture, and for the application of the trepan, have been highly eulogized; nor
                    is what he says about contrecoups less accurate. He is the first who has
                    remarked that there may be rupture of a vessel within the cranium without
                    fracture or depression.” And he is the first who recommended the application of
                    ligatures to a wounded artery, with the view of arresting its haemorrhage, after
                    pressure has failed. He improved amputation, an operation then not much in use;
                    and recommended its adoption in cases of gangrene from external causes. He is
                    minute in his details as to the treatment of fracture and dislocation; his
                    description of carbuncle is good, and its treatment similar to that now pursued,
                    namely, free application of the strongest escharotics to the gangrened part. He
                    describes several species of hernia, and gives directions for their reduction.
                    “It would be endless however to particularise. Whoever wishes to know the exact
                    state of surgical knowledge in the world at the time of the Caesars, may turn to
                    the pages of Celsus, with the hopes of a gratification which will not be
                    disappointed.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>He
                    relates an interesting anecdote of Hippocrates, illustrative of his abuse of the
                    trepan. “Knowing and skilful as he was, he once mistook a fracture of the skull
                    for a natural suture; and was afterwards so ingenuous as to confess his mistake,
                    and leave it on record." To this be adds, “This was acting like a truly great
                    man: little geniuses, conscious to themselves that they have nothing to spare,
                    cannot bear the least diminution of their prerogative, nor suffer themselves to
                    depart from any opinion which they have embraced, how false and pernicious
                    soever that opinion may be; while the man of real ability is always ready to
                    make a frank acknowledgement of his errors, especially in a profession where it
                    is of importance to posterity to read the truth a moral which cannot be too
                    often forced upon the attention of the present generation.</p></note></p>

                    who made use of blisters, using cantharides fur that purpose. Dissection in his
                    time was prohibited under the severest penalties: his anatomical knowledge was
                    therefore neither profound nor exact; “nevertheless he had the sound penetration
                    to regard anatomy as the only legitimate basis on which either medical or
                    surgical science could rest.” Heliodorus, the celebrated physician of the
                    emperor Trajan, has left some excellent observations on injuries of the head;
                    and Antyllus, almost a contemporary, was a zealous and successful surgeon. He
                    boldly recommends bronchotomy in cases of threatened suffocation induced by
                    disease of the throat; and, in inflammatory affections of emergency, advises
                    arteriotomy in preference to venesection, showing that excessive loss of blood
                    thereby need not be dreaded, it being readily prevented by dividing the artery
                    completely across. He also alludes to the operation for cataract by extraction,
                    which he however recommends very cautiously, and only when the cataract is
                    small. He obtained the radical cure of hydrocele by free incision of the parts.
                    Rufus the Ephesian, who seems also to have lived in the time of Trajan, was a
                    zealous anatomist and surgeon, and has left a treatise on diseases of the
                    kidneys and bladder. About the commencement of the second century, Archigenes
                    the Syrian settled in Rome, and distinguished himself both in medicine and
                    surgery. His writings, which were chiefly confined to the latter subject, are
                    unfortunately lost. Between Celsus and Galen, however, we meet with no great
                    Roman writer on medicine or surgery. These were among the last of the liberal
                    arts that were encouraged by the Romans; and the proud patricians refusing to
                    educate any of their family to such a profession, the medical practitioners of
                    Rome were at first importations from Greece and Alexandria, and afterwards
                    sell-educated slaves and freedmen.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    Ward of Gresham College published an answer in 1727: Middleton published the
                    first part of a defence in 1728, and Ward having rejoined in the course of the
                    same year, his antagonist prepared a second part, of which Dr Heberden printed a
                    few copies in 1761, eleven years after the author’s death.</p></note></p>
                <p>Claudius Galenus was born at Pergamus, in Asia Minor, in the 131st year of the
                    Christian era. After studying at Smyrna and Corinth, he completed his medical
                    education at Alexandria, and ultimately settled in Rome, where he soon obtained
                    a great reputation, both as a successful practitioner, and as a public lecturer
                    on anatomy. Professional jealousy of his talents, however, drove him from Rome,
                    to which he did not return until recalled by Marcus Aurelius. Shortly afterwards
                    he was appointed physician to the young emperor Commodus, with whom, as well as
                    with the public, he rose to great favour, A man of great erudition, brilliant
                    genius, and indomitable industry, he produced works which exerted a most
                    powerful and extensive influence over medical practice. He has the merit of
                    rescuing medical inquiry from the chaos in which he found it, and restoring it
                    to the paths of light and nature. His fame indeed was so great as to prove, in
                    one sense, detrimental to the advancement of the medical profession, inasmuch as
                    his opinions were received as oracular in the schools of all the civilized
                    countries for no less a period than 1300 years, thus seriously retarding further
                    investigation. His works were both numerous and elaborate; but unfortunately he
                    seems to have been debarred from the study of the groundwork of his profession,
                    human anatomy. His dissections appear to have been limited to the simiae and
                    other mammiferous animals, as most resembling the human structure, though on one
                    occa sion “he felicitates himself on the opportunities he had enjoyed of
                    examining two skeletons preserved in Alexandria, and recommends all anxious to
                    obtain a thorough knowledge of osteology to repair to that city." In his early
                    years; he practised surgery at Pergamus with marked success; but in Rome he
                    seems to have confined himself almost entirely to medicine, excepting the
                    occasional performance of phlebotomy: probably the valorous Romans had not yet
                    lost their hatred and dread of the terrible operations of surgery. Like others,
                    however, he was still so much of a general practitioner, as to practise pharmacy
                    as well as medicine, with a little of surgery; and he himself informs us, that
                    he had a drug-shop in the Via Sacra. “He established two general principles as
                    the basis of all surgery—synthesis, or the reunion of parts—diaeresis, or their
                    complete division, as by amputation or extirpation. In four cases he detected
                    luxation of the femur backwards, a variety not mentioned by Hippocrates; and
                    records two instances of spontaneous luxation of the same bone. He also treats
                    of more than one species of hernia. But although in his writings we meet with a
                    few bold chirurgical attempts, as in the application of the trepan to the
                    sternum in a ease of empyema, yet it must be confessed that by far the greatest
                    part of his surgery seems to have been confined to fomentations, ointments, and
                    plasters, for external affections, together with the art of bandaging, a love
                    for which he necessarily acquired at the Alexandrian schools; and the employment
                    of complicated machinery in fracture and dislocations.” His researches were not
                    limited to medical science, but comprehended literature and philosophy.<note

                    classical readers to a most important collection published under the title of

                    Aretaeus, Dioscorides, and Galen. Dioscorides was edited by Sprengel, and the

                <p>The early Christians unfortunately appear to have injured medicine and surgery,
                    by attributing to martyrs and their relics the power of healing wounds and
                    curing diseases; “acknowledging the active interference of demons and blessed
                    spirits in the affairs of men, and leaving true philosophy in total
                    abandonment." A Cimmerian gloom was then fast overspreading the world, by which
                    science and art were destined to be long obscured; and shortly after the time of
                    Galen, we accordingly find the medical along with the other sciences encompassed
                    by the dark clouds of ignorance and barbarism. One or two names however occur
                    worthy of notice, but more from having preserved than advanced medical
                    knowledge. Oribasius, a pupil of Zeno, lived in the time of the emperor Julian,
                    whose friendship he enjoyed, and became a celebrated practitioner, as well as of
                    great importance in the state. His works are principally compilations, though
                    judicious and useful. His surgery is marked with timidity, discouraging
                    operations, except in most extreme cases, and is chiefly confined to unguents
                    and embrocations. He abstracted blood locally, by making deep and extensive
                    scarifications, or rather incisions, with the knife; a proceeding somewhat
                    resembling the important modern improvement in the treatment of erysipelas, but
                    adopted under different circumstances, and with other objects in view.</p>
                <p>During the fifth century the west was repeatedly invaded by the Huns, Goths,
                    Alans, and Lombards. Science greatly suffered in consequence; and no name worthy
                    of remembrance is to be found, until, nearly two centuries after Oribasius,
                    appeared Aëtius, a native of Amida, and a pupil of the<pb break="no"

                    Alexandrian school. “His surgical writings are copious and valuable. His
                    opinions were guided by experience, and his methods of management and cure are
                    characterised by much caution and discrimination. We find a variety of surgical
                    queries and suggestions which had escaped Celsus and Galen, as well as the
                    description of several diseases which have been omitted by Paulus Aegineta. He
                    recommended and practised scarification of the legs in anasarca, and made free
                    use of both the actual and potential cauteries; he cut out haemorrhoidal
                    tumours; operated for aneurism; tried to dissolve urinary calculi by the
                    administration of internal remedies; and has given a series of interesting
                    chapters on inflammation of the intestines followed by abscess, on encysted
                    tumours, on the varieties of hernia, on diseases of the testicle and castration,
                    on the pricks of the nerves and tendons, and in fact on almost every important
                    branch of surgical knowledge. If, mixed up with these, we find some things which
                    the matured experience of ages has abolished, it is less to be marvelled at,
                    than that surgery was already enriched with so many valuable facts and
                    observations.” He makes no reference to the reduction of fractures and
                    dislocations, whence it has been plausibly inferred, “that in all likelihood
                    quacks were at that time in complete possession of this branch of practice.
                    Better were it for society that it was quite out of their hands now !” He seems
                    to have been the first to open up a field of medical inquiry, which has since
                    been so successfully cultivated,—the nature and composition of urinary calculi.
                    He appears also to have turned much of his attention to diseases of the eye, and
                    is the first who speaks of the dracunculus or Guinea-worm. Alexander of Trallis,
                    a famous physician in the time of Justinian, about the middle of the sixth
                    century, was an author of more originality than either Oribasiusor Aëtius. He
                    wrote on diseases of the eye, and on fractures; but both treatises have been
                    lost, which is the more to be regretted, as, with this exception, he confined
                    himself entirely to internal disease. The celebrated Paulus Aegineta, also of
                    the Alexandrian school, lived about the middle of the seventh century, and made
                    both large and valuable contributions to surgery. He frequently performed the
                    operations which he describes, and abandoned the labours of the mere theorist,
                    for the more valuable results of practical observation and experience. “His
                    sixth book has been considered by many, and not without reason, as the best body
                    of surgical knowledge, previous to the revival of letters.” He recommended
                    bleeding from the immediate neighbourhood of the part affected, in preference to
                    general blood-letting, because more effectual; and, for the like reason, opened
                    the temporal artery in cases of very severe ophthalmia. He had recourse to
                    copious venesection, with the view of accelerating painful descent of calculus
                    in the ureter. He opened internal abscesses by caustics, and defined the points
                    at which he thought it advisable to perform paracentesis in the different
                    alleged species of ascites. In lithotomy, having first endeavoured to ascertain
                    the situation of the calculus by the rectum, he made his incision, not in the
                    centre of the perineum, as recommended by Celsus, but to one side of the raphe,
                    as is now practised. Of the impropriety of extensive incision of the bladder he
                    seems to have been well aware, directing that the external wound should be much
                    freer than the internal, and that the latter should be in extent merely
                    sufficient to admit of the passage of the stone. While Celsus limited the
                    operation to patients between nine and fourteen years of age, he sanctions its
                    performance after the age of puberty, but admits that the chances of success
                    increase with the youth of the patient. He described more than one variety of
                    aneurism, pointing out those cases in which he thought it advisable to attempt a
                    cure by operation; and extended this to the aneurisms of the head and joints,
                    excepting only those of the groin, arm-pit, and neck, instead of confining it to
                    the tumours of the arm alone, as had been done by Aëtius. All aneurisms,
                    excepting aneurism by anastomosis, which he clearly and accurately
                    distinguished, he conceived to originate in rupture of the coats of the artery.
                    He performed extirpation of the mamma by crucial incision, and practised both
                    laryngotomy and tracheotomy. He is the first who seems to have performed the
                    latter operation as a means of carrying on respiration during occlusion of the
                    larynx, but naturally enough falls into the error of transverse instead of
                    longitudinal incision. He describes different species of hernia, and did not
                    hesitate to operate when the tumour became strangulated. He is also the first
                    who treats of fracture of the patella. He was pre-eminent as an accoucheur, and
                    was the originator of the obstetric operation of embryotomy.<note

                    “seat of learning was transferred, for a time, from beneath the shadow of the
                    cross to the empire of the crescent; from the classic shores of Italy and
                    Greece, to the warlike followers of Mahomet, and the fiery descendants of
                    Ishmael.” Many valuable manuscripts, rescued from the savage destruction of the
                    Alexandrian library, were carefully transcribed, or translated into the Syriac
                    or Arabic languages, and dispersed in various directions. The first Arabic
                    translation was made about the year 683, by Maserjawaihus, a native of Syria;
                    but the most eminent in this labour was Honain, called, by way of eminence, “the
                    translator,” a Christian, born at Hira in 764. Towards the end of the eighth
                    century, a college was founded at Bagdat by the Caliph Almanzor; and there
                    medicine obtained a permanent footing, under the fostering care of the far-famed
                    Caliph Haroun al Raschid. Public hospitals and laboratories were founded by him
                    for the benefit of students, who are said to have amounted at one time to no
                    fewer than six thousand, consisting chiefly of Christians banished on account of
                    their religion; and the Caliph Almamon surpassed even his predecessors in
                    munificent patronage, extended to every department of art and science, and in
                    unwearied exertions to restore and propagate the various branches of learning.
                    By supplication he prevailed upon the Grecian emperors to send him many works in
                    philosophy; and, employing the best interpreters that he could find, ordered all
                    these books to be translated, and encouraged the industrious study of them by
                    his own personal example. The medical sch∞l at Jondisabour, the<pb break="no"

                    capital of Chorassan, established by Sapores the First as early as the end of
                    the third century, had by this time risen to great celebrity; and from it
                    Rhazes, Hally Abbas, and Avicenna derived their medical education. Mesue lived
                    during the caliphate of Haroun al Raschid, in the end of the eighth century, and
                    Serapion during that of Almamon, about a century later; both eminent medical men
                    in their time, but both pure physicians. The first Arabian worthy in the
                    surgical department was the celebrated Rhazes, who presided over an hospital at
                    Bagdat in the end of the ninth and beginning of the tenth centuries. His works
                    are not remarkable for anatomical knowledge, which is not surprising, since the
                    study of anatomy was strictly forbidden by the Mahommedan religion, and
                    consequently the Arabians had to rest contented with the writings of the Greeks
                    on that subject. “One of their religious prejudices against dissection was, that
                    the soul did not instantly forsake the body, but lingered in some particular
                    portion of it for some time after apparent dissolution, so that the
                    dismemberment of it might be a species of hideous martyrdom a very sufficient
                    reason why a professor of such a belief should strenuously object to the
                    anatomization of himself and his friends. Rhazes is the first who has described
                    spina ventosa and spina bifida. Of the real nature of the latter, however, he
                    does not seem to have had any clear idea. Regarding cancer, he advised that the
                    knife should never be used except when the disease was limited, and the whole
                    tumour could be completely removed; condemning the opposite procedure as cruel
                    and unavailing; an opinion which after-experience has shown to be most just and
                    true. In bites from rabid animals, he first cauterized the wotmds, and then
                    prescribed emetics to expel the “black bile ;” an evacuation considered most
                    essential to the cure. His account of hernia is better than any to be found in
                    the Greek writers. His works on surgery, however, are little more than
                    compilations from Hippocrates, Oribasius, Aëtius, and Paulus. His confidence in
                    oculism does not seem to have been great; for, having in his old age become
                    blind from cataract, he could not, though urged, be prevailed upon to undergo an
                    operation for its removal. In his time lithotomy, and some other operations,
                    seem to have been entirely in the hands of juggling impostors. Hally Abbas,
                    surnamed the Magician, on account of the extent of his knowledge and
                    acquirements, lived in the end of the tenth century. His great work, the
                    Al-meleky, written about the year 980, is, in its anatomical and physiological
                    department, a mere transcript from the Greeks; and his surgery possesses but few
                    peculiarities. “From the idea that caustics were efficacious when a redundancy
                    of the humours flowed to a particular part, he recommended their application for
                    the cure of hydrocele. In the management of dropsical affections his attention
                    was always directed to the remote causes; and he preferred puncturing in the
                    linea alba, a little below the umbilicus, for the relief of ascites.” Avicenna,
                    who divides with Rhazes the honour of having first introduced chemistry into
                    physic, flourished later than the two preceding Arabians. He was termed, in his
                    day, the Prince of Physicians, and seems to have been regarded as almost
                    miraculous for the extent and variety of his knowledge. He was born in 980, and
                    died in 1036, without a rival, either in the medical profession, or in general
                    science. In his great medical work, the Canon, the surgical department is not
                    altogether forgotten, but holds a second place to physic; indeed, before the
                    appearance of Albucasis, surgery seems to have been all but extinct amongst the
                    Arabians. He has distinguished between closure of the pupil and cataract, and in
                    operating for the latter recommends depression; extraction he considers a very
                    dangerous experiment. It is probable that to him we owe the first use of the
                    flexible catheter. His works are said to have remained the oracles of medical
                    knowledge for nearly six hundred years. Albucasis, who died in 1122, exerted
                    himself more than his predecessors in behalf of surgery, which, by his own
                    account, he found in a most deplorable condition; and he is chiefly
                    distinguished as a surgical writer. Cauteries and caustics seem to have been his
                    favourite remedies; and he becomes enraptured when speaking of the “divine and
                    secret virtues” of fire surgically employed. The actual cautery he looked upon
                    with veneration, and describes more than fifty affections in which his
                    experience had found it beneficial. He is minute in his directions for its
                    application, and forbids its use, “except by persons acquainted with the anatomy
                    of the frame, and the position of the <hi rend="italic">nerves, tendons, veins,
                    and arteries</hi> from which latter circumstance some idea may be formed of the
                    extent to which he himself was in the habit of roasting his unfortunate
                    patients. He checked arterial haemorrhage by his favourite method of
                    cauterization, but also employed styptics, as well as complete division of the
                    vessel, and ligature. He is supposed to have been the first to remark, that it
                    is by the formation of a coagulum in the orifice of an artery that its calibre
                    is closed and haemorrhage arrested. He has described a particular instrument of
                    his own for the cure of fistula lachrymalis, and the needle used by the surgeons
                    of Irak for cataract. He speaks of operating for the relief of hydrocephalus,
                    but the success of the practice does not seem to have been greater then than in
                    its revival in our own time; for he confesses that he knew of but one successful
                    case, and therefore does not recommend the operation. He seems to have been
                    conversant with the mode of removing tumours by ligature when the knife is
                    inexpedient; he advises amputation in gangrene of the extremities; and is the
                    first who has described the mode of extracting calculus by incision in the
                    female. His method of lithotomy resembled that practised by Paulus Aegineta;
                    and, like him, he seems to have been bold in puncturing and excising the
                    tonsils, removing the uvula when obstinately relaxed, and extracting polypous
                    tumours from the fauces. He mentions bronchocele as occurring most frequently
                    among women; but, fond of the knife and cautery as he was, he does not seem to
                    have employed either for the removal of that tumour; indeed he telle us of “an
                    ignorant operator who,” in attempting extirpation of a bronchocele, “by wounding
                    the arteries of the neck, killed the patient upon the spot." He invented the
                    probang, for dislodging foreign bodies from the gullet; and in wounds of the
                    intestines practised union of the divided parts by suture more than once with
                    success. Though thus bold in his operations, and, like all the Arabians, too
                    fond of the employment of instruments, he was not however without judgment and
                    caution. For example, he condemns tracheotomy as worse than useless when the
                    inflammatory affection of the windpipe is acute, and has extended to the
                    bronchi; an opinion which is acknowledged as true, though unfortunately not
                    always followed in the present day. And he exceeds even Rhazes in his dislike to
                    operative interference with cancerous tumours, declaring that he never either
                    cured, or saw cured, a single instance of that disease; a conclusion too nearly
                    consistent with the history of that most implacable malady in all succeeding
                    ages. His remarks on abscesses are most judicious; directing particular
                    attention to their situation, and recommending their being early opened, whether
                    “matured” or not, when in the neighbourhood of joints or other important parts,
                    which would be injured by their continuance; a rule of practice which, if more
                    faithfully followed, would materially diminish the number of diseased joints and
                    bones. He also advised what has since been so much insisted on by Mr Abernethy,
                    that when the abscess is very large, its contents should be evacuated by
                    degrees. He is the only one among the ancient writers on surgery who has
                    described the instruments used in each particular operation. Avenzoar, a Spanish
                    Arab, practised physic with distinction, about the beginning<pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:chi.28490924&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=973" xml:id="kp-eb0720-0973-0827"/>
                    of the twelfth century, at Seville in Andalusia. He describes inflammation and
                    abscess of the mediastinum, from which he had himself suffered; and mentions a
                    case of abscess of the kidney, from which fourteen pints of matter were
                    evacuated. He speaks of bronchotomy as expedient in dangerous cases of
                    inflammation of the tonsils: and in stricture of the gullet proposes three modes
                    of treatment; the occasional passage of a tin or silver tube; the use of a milk
                    bath, that nutritious particles may be taken up by the pores on the skin; and
                    the injection of nutritious fluids by the rectum. He also details cases of
                    “rupture, fracture of the hipbone, wounds of the arteries and veins, tumours,
                    and other varieties of surgical disease, which he appears to have understood
                    well, and treated with discretion.” He does not complain, like Rhazes, that
                    lithotomy was in the hands of mountebanks, but tells us that the Arabians then
                    reckoned such operations “filthy and abominable, and unfit for any man of
                    character to perform and held that “no religious man, according to the law,
                    ought so much as to view the genitals.” The brightest name in the history of
                    Arabian philosophy is that of Averrhoes, the pupil of Avenzoar, born at Cordova
                    about the middle of the twelfth century, and said to have died in the year 1206.
                    But be cultivated the study of medicine only as a branch of general philosophy,
                    and surgery he seems to have altogether neglected.</p>
                <p>Such were the Arabians. Of these, Albucasis was the most famous in surgery, as
                    Celsus had been among the Romans, and Paulus Aegineta among the Greeks. But even
                    he could not escape the unfortunate failing of the Saracenic school; endless
                    invention of manifold and complicated instruments, attaching far too much
                    importance to the mechanical part of their profession, and mistaking the
                    inspiration of terror and infliction of cruelty for energetic and judicious
                    surgery. In order, for example, to arrest haemorrhage from a wounded surface, if
                    time pressed and assistants were scarce, it was not uncommon to dip the part
                    into boiling pitch, a liquid which was then dignified with the appellation of a
                    styptic. They however systematically divided physic, surgery, and pharmacy into
                    three distinct professions; and so, by commencing the division of labour, may be
                    considered as having done something not unimportant towards the ultimate
                    advancement of medical knowledge. “The last traces of their intellectual
                    illumination appeared among the Spanish Moors in the thirteenth century, when
                    the Christian arms having become more and more powerful, they were compelled to
                    substitute the field for the study—the sword for the pen— and, before an
                    overwhelming opposition, were at length driven from a region whose fields they
                    had tilled, and whose olives they had gathered, for a thousand years. With the
                    decline of the Saracenic school, the daylight of science went down over the
                    nations; and an intellectual darkness, which endured for three hundred years,
                    enveloped the general face of society. All the fountains of science were dried
                    up, and the world seemed retrograding into the unillumined chaos of
                    ignorance.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Moir’s

                <p>A knowledge of the Greek and Arabian systems of medicine was introduced into
                    Italy, at Salerno, in the beginning of the eleventh century; and this school
                    soon rose to celebrity as a seat of medical learning. In the time of the
                    Crusades, Salerno was a place of great resort for warriors of all nations
                    passing between Europe and Palestine; and by these wanderers, on their return,
                    the light of medical science was thence slowly conveyed over Europe. It obtained
                    the privileges of a university; but the medical school of Salerno did not long
                    retain its high reputation. In modern times, it is chiefly remembered on account
                    of the <hi rend="italic">Regimen Sanitatis Salernitanum,</hi> a singular
                    production, of which more than one hundred and sixty editions are known to have
                    been published. Though written in the name of the <hi rend="italic">Schola
                    Salernitana,</hi> it has generally been ascribed to Joannes de Milano. The
                    English king to whom it is addressed is supposed to have been Robert of
                    Normandy, whose claims to the English crown were recognised by some of his
                    contemporaries. The poem opens with these lines:</p>

                <p>In the twelfth century, the Jews practised medicine, not only among their own
                    tribes, but also among the Moors and Christians; and though, like all others of
                    this age, merely treading in the beaten track of the Greeks and Arabians, yet,
                    from their superiority in such learning, they came to be reputed the most
                    skilful practitioners. About the middle of that century, as bus already been
                    stated, surgery was completely separated from physic, by the edict of the
                    Council of Tours prohibiting the clergy,<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>The early clergy claimed the practice of medicine as their
                    peculiar privilege, and, using it chiefly as a means of personal power and gain,
                    disgraced it by ignorance, charlatanry, and imposture. It was to check this that
                    the Roman council assembled by Pope Innocent II. In 1139, threatened with the
                    severest penalties those monks and canons who applied to the practice of
                    medicine, "neglecting the sacred objects of their own profession, and holding
                    out the delusive hope of health in exchange for ungodly lucre.” But even this,
                    though followed by the more peremptory edict at Tours in 1163, where Alexander
                    III. presided, did not make them altogether forego what they found so convenient
                    and profitable. It was necessary to repeat the edict in 1179 and 1216; but
                    notwithstanding, the monks continued stiil to practise physic, and it was
                    chiefly by their evil influence that the school of Salerno was brought to

                    in Christian Europe, from in any way causing the effusion of blood, at least as
                    a means of curing bodily ailment. Surgery was in consequence abandoned to the
                    uneducated laity, and sunk to a deplorable state of prostration; it became a
                    mere matter of plasters and unguents; and if any thing happened to be written on
                    the subject, it was but a bad compilation from the Arabians.<note

                    the more remarkable events in connection with it during its temporary abasement.
                    In the year 1271, the foundation of the College of Surgeons at Paris was laid by
                    Pitard, a surgeon of eminence in those days, and whose enthusiasm effected
                    something towards raising his humbled profession. About the same time lived
                    Gulielmus de Sa-liceto, <hi rend="italic">a</hi> professor at Verona, said to
                    have been “a powerful man” in both surgery and medicine. He seems to have
                    earnestly dissuaded men from the copying and study of books in preference to
                    practical experience, and he himself set a better example. In our own country
                    Gilbertus Anglicanus is the first name connected with surgery; but he seems to
                    have been little more than a compiler from the Arabians. He lived about the
                    beginning of the fourteenth century; and shortly after him appeared John of
                    Gaddes-den, author of the <hi rend="italic">Rosa Anglica,</hi> and said to have
                    been an erudite and ingenious man, as well as a skilful practi-<pb break="no"

                    tioner. About the middle of the fourteenth century, Guy de Chauliac practised
                    with renown at Avignon, and is “accounted one of the revivers of the languishing
                    art.” In his <hi rend="italic">chirurgia,</hi> a history of the state of surgery
                    in bis day,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Some idea
                    may be formed of the languishing state of surgery at this time, from his
                    division of the surgeons into the following five sects. The first applied
                    cataplasms indiscriminately to every description of ulcer and wound. The second
                    in similar cases employed wine only. The third used emollient ointments and
                    plasters. The fourth, chiefly military surgeons, promiscuously employed oils,
                    wool, potions, and charms. The fifth, “consisting of ignorant practitioners and
                    silly women, had recourse upon all occasions to the saints, praised each other’s
                    writings perpetually, and followed each other in one undeviating track, like
                    cranes.”</p></note> we find the first mention of the Caesarean operation.
                    Contemporary with him was John of Ardern, an English surgeon. He wrote with
                    simplicity and honesty, and may be regarded as a reviver of surgery in that
                    country. In his practice he was peculiarly successful in the treatment of
                    fistula in ano, and thereby acquired a great reputation. Valesco de Taranta, a
                    Portuguese, practised at Montpellier, and wrote on surgery in the beginning of
                    the fifteenth century. He was the first who proposed the cure of cancer by the
                    application of arsenic. About the middle of the same century, lithotomy, the
                    practice of which had hitherto been confined to itinerant and ill-informed
                    operators, was restored to the regular profession by Germain Colot, a French
                    surgeon, high in favour with Louis the Eleventh. He first contrived to witness
                    the operation by the itinerants, then practised it on the dead body, and at last
                    performed it successfully on a condemned criminal who happened to be afflicted
                    with stone, and who con-sented to undergo the operation on condition of being
                    pardoned if he survived. His success, in having thus doubly saved life, obtained
                    for Colot much renown; and lithotomy ever after continued a regular part of
                    surgical practice.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>In

                    Laurence Colot. a descendant of Germain.</p></note> The fifteenth century
                    contains other two events important to surgery; the discovery of the art of
                    printing, about the year 1450, which gave a new impulse to science and
                    literature, by rendering the accumulated stores of knowledge more accessible;
                    and the importation of the venereal disease from America, by the first
                    discoverers of that continent, giving the <hi rend="italic">small</hi> pox as if
                    in exchange, about the year 1492.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>The first author who clearly describes the venereal disease
                    is Marcellus Cuman as, who wrote in 1495. It was not till 1530 that Fracastorius
                    wrote his celebrated poem <hi rend="italic">De Morbo Galilco,</hi> in reference
                    to which it has been said that the chaste and classic elegance of its language
                    was worthy of the best days of imperial Rome, and the mellifluence of its
                    versification hardly surpassed by the bard of Mantua himself. By G, Torella,
                    physician to Pope Alexander the Sixth, we are informed that the insane abuse of
                    mercury as a means of cure was not quite a universal practice on the outbreak of
                    the disease; for, in describing some particular forms of mercurial ointment, he
                    himself states that “they destroyed on infinite number of people, who in this
                    case did not die, but were downright killed; and these bold empirics must give
                    an account, if not in this, in the next world, of their practice, and be drowned
                    in the pit of repentance.” It is but very lately that the “pit of repentance"
                    ceased to be useful under very similar circumstances.</p></note> In this century
                    also the Turks captured Constantinople, thus overthrowing the last remains of
                    the eastern empire; and by the multitude of Christians who fled from that city
                    many manuscripts of the Greek medical writers were brought to Italy, and their
                    contents thence slowly disseminated over Europe.</p>
                <p>Hitherto surgery can scarcely lay claim to an actual revival. Occasional attempts
                    had been made to raise it from its low position, but all proved abortive. At
                    length, however, in the beginning of the sixteenth century, the practitioners of
                    the healing art were happily convinced that the observation of nature was
                    superior to compilation from the ancients, whether Arabian, Roman, or Greek;
                    they consequently ceased to tread blindly and servilely in the footsteps of
                    their predecessors, and a new era arose to the profession. About the same time
                    Vesalius gave birth to anatomy, properly so called;<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>A little later in the century, Fallopius
                    taught anatomy at Pisa, and Eustachius at Rome, and to their efforts, as well as
                    to those of Vesalius, the advancement of that science is much indebted.
                    Fallopius died in 1563; Eustachius in 1574.</p></note> illuminated by which
                    science, surgery became a worthy object of pursuit to men of talents and
                    education, and under their cultivation it was gradually raised to an enlightened
                    and liberal profession.</p>
                <p>The most conspicuous name in this new era of surgery is that of Ambrose Paré, a
                    Frenchman. In this country surgery was then sadly depressed, having retrograded
                    since the time of John of Ardern. Its list of practitioners comprised barbers,
                    farriers, sow-gelders, cobblers, and tinkers; and it is not matter of surprise
                    that from among these no name has been banded down as worthy of remembrance. The
                    combination of the practice of surgery with the more harmless manipulations of
                    the barber, was not confined however to this island, but existed also in France,
                    and continued in both countries for upwards of 200 years. The great Paré does
                    not reject the appellation of barber-surgeon, as applied to himself; nor does he
                    seem to think that there is any thing derogatory in the title. He was surgeon
                    successively to Henry the Second, Francis the Second, Charles the Ninth, and
                    Henry the Third, of France; and followed the French armies in all their
                    campaigns down to the battle of Moncontour in 1569. His consequent experience of
                    gunshot and other wounds, on the field of battle, naturally directed his
                    attention to the subject of haemorrhage; and it is to him that we owe the
                    revival and improvement of the method of arresting bleeding from arteries by
                    ligature, and discontinuance of the cauteries and styptics, which, to the
                    disgrace of surgery, had hitherto been in exclusive use for this purpose. Yet so
                    averse are mankind to abandon their ancient customs, that the improvement of
                    Paré was not sanctioned till after much abuse and persecution, directed both
                    against himself and his discovery; indeed so bitter and unrelenting were his
                    jealous brethren, that he was compelled for his own safety to adduce garbled and
                    incorrect extracts from Galen and other ancients, in proof that to them, and not
                    to him, the invention was to be referred. So far he was less in error than he
                    himself supposed, for we have already stated that he has merely the merit of
                    reviving the use of the ligature.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Ason example of how little the hint of Celsus was attended
                    to, we may mention, that Procopius relates how Artabazes perished of a wound in
                    the neck, “the artery of the neck having been cut through, so that the blood <hi
                    rend="italic">could not be stopped."</hi> Their cauteries and styptic* had no
                    effect on the carotid, or its larger trunks.</p></note> Celsus distinctly
                    advises its employment when pressure fails to stop arterial haemorrhage; and
                    Albucasis sometimes condescended to use it instead of his favourite cautery and
                    cruel styptics. Paré, however, was amply repaid by future fame for the
                    opposition which he had at first sustained. He rose to an unparalleled height of
                    popularity with the army, by whom he was absolutely adored. On one occasion, his
                    mere presence among the garrison of a beleagured city about to capitulate,
                    re-animated the troops to such an extent, that their resistance became more
                    energetic than before, and the besieging army perished beneath the walls. By bis
                    sovereigns he was also highly esteemed. From the general massacre on the fearful
                    night of St Bartholomew he was rescued by the personal exertions of Charles the
                    Ninth, his great merits being appreciated even by that weak and cruel monarch.
                    But he was not content with the respect and praise of his contemporaries; his
                    writings, the result of great experience and accurate observation, freed from

                    high order, have rendered him immortal. His works, first published in 1535, and
                    afterwards more fully in 1682, exerted a most powerful and beneficial influence
                    upon his profession. The influence was not however immediate; for at his death
                    the light he had shed was for a time obscured, surgery reverting to the state of
                    degradation in which he found it, in consequence of its baneful association with
                    barberism. Pigrai was his successor, but an unworthy one: endeavouring to follow
                    the footsteps of his master, he obscured and almost effaced them. The most
                    interesting of Pare’s surgical treatises is that on gunshot wounds, a class of
                    injuries then of recent introduction, and little understood: the murderous
                    cannon and firelock had not long been in use.</p>
                <p>In the seventeenth century surgery again revived, resuming the impulse which the
                    genius of Paré had imparted. Italy produced Caesar Magatus, who simplified, and
                    consequently must have improved, the treatment of wounds; the
                    never-to-be-forgotten Tagliacotius, with his rude repairs of the human face; and
                    Marcus Aurelius Severinus, a skilful and intrepid operator. At the end of the
                    sixteenth and beginning of the seventeenth centuries, Padua was favoured with
                    Fabricius ab Aquapendente, the preceptor of Harvey, a most distinguished
                    physiologist, and the most eminent surgeon of his time. His <hi rend="italic"
                    >Opera Chirurgica</hi> passed through no less than seventeen editions, and
                    contain not only an excellent digest of surgery as it then was, but also many
                    improvements of his own. About the middle of the seventeenth century arose the
                    true father of British surgery, our own Wiseman, the Paré of England. One or two
                    English names are to be found before him: William Clowes, a military surgeon of
                    some eminence, attended the Earl of Leicester’s army in the Low Countries, and
                    wrote on gunshot wounds; and Lowe, a Scotchman, gave to the world a Discourse on
                    the whole Art of Chirurgery, dated 1612: but Wiseman doubtless is the first
                    Briton worthy of note in surgery. He was serjeant-surgeon to Charles II., and
                    amidst the horrors of the civil wars had ample scope for the study of his
                    profession. His surgical works, consisting of eight treatises, dated 1676,
                    contain much information, at that time most valuable, and still amply rewarding
                    an attentive perusal. In military practice he strongly advocated immediate
                    amputation, “while the patient is free of fever,” in the case of such injuries
                    as rendered preservation of the member improbable, of course allowing the
                    primary shock of the accident to be past; a point of practice which long
                    discussion in after years served to confirm. It was not till his time that
                    surgeons ceased to believe that gunshot wounds were necessarily envenomed by the
                    powder and ball, and had to be treated accordingly with potent and cruel
                    dressings. The immortal Harvey, contemporary with Wiseman, cannot perhaps be
                    classed among the eminent surgeons, having principally confined himself to
                    anatomy and physiology, yet he is inseparably connected with that science by his
                    discovery of the circulation of the blood; a discovery which has done so much
                    for the advancement of all medical knowledge, but of surgery in particular.
                    James Young, a surgeon in Plymouth, may be said to have been also contemporary
                    with Wiseman, having written in 1679. He is the first who proposed amputation by
                    a flap, an improvement to which two French surgeons, Verduin and Sabaurin, lay
                    claim; and he is also the first who recommends limited compression of the main
                    artery in amputation.</p>
                <p>Germany boasts of several eminent surgeons of this time; Fabricius Hildanus, a
                    most successful practitioner, and author of a surgical treatise dated 1641;
                    Scultetus, author of the work, celebrated for its horrid array of lethal
                    weapons, called <hi rend="italic">Armamentarium chirurgicum,</hi> 1653; and
                    Purmann, who displayed too great an attachment to the dangerous representations
                    of Scultetus. Heister, a professor in the university of Helmstadt, wrote a
                    system of surgery, which has been translated into most of the European
                    languages, and is still in high repute.</p>
                <p>Holland likewise possessed successful practitioners of surgery, but tainted with
                    an unworthy concealment of their methods of cure. Rau, a native of Germany,
                    though a professor at Leyden, was perhaps the most successful lithotomist that
                    ever lived, but he kept his method of operating a profound secret, and made it a
                    mystery even to his own pupils; as appears from the circumstance that his two
                    favourites, Heister and Albinus, of a more liberal spirit than their master, in
                    attempting to divulge his secret for the benefit of the profession at large,
                    have varied most materially in their statements. This illiberal spirit pervaded
                    the other branches of medicine as well as the surgical. The famous anatomist
                    Ruysch preserved inviolate the secret of his wonderfully minute injections,
                    although really the discovery of his friend De Graaf; and Roonhuysen the
                    accoucheur worked stealthily with his invented lever. The succeeding generation
                    however removed this stigma from the Dutch; and their great Camper was equally
                    celebrated for the number of his discoveries and the zeal with which he made
                    them known.</p>
                <p>From the time of Paré, France produced no surgeons of great eminence until the
                    eighteenth century. In the seventeenth, we find the names of Dionis, Belloste,
                    Saviard, and a few others of some renown, but not at all equal to their
                    contemporaries in other nations. Some idea may be formed of the then feeble
                    condition of surgery in France, from the fact, that Louis XIV. was not cured of
                    a simple fistula in ano, until after his life had been in no small degree
                    endangered by repeated abortive operations. That the French can boast of
                    surgeons of the first class in the next century, however, is indisputably shown
                    by the simple mention of Petit and Desault; names that must ever occupy a proud
                    place in the annals of surgery. The former, adding to the most powerful talents
                    great industry, and an innate love of his pursuits, rose rapidly to eminence,
                    though not without much envious opposition, which seems to be the portion of
                    nearly all those who occupy a pre-eminent place in the profession. On general
                    surgery, he has left a work of much value; and his treatise on diseases of the
                    bones, though produced at an early age, entitles him to be called the father of
                    that branch of pathology. For many years it remained the best work on the
                    subject. He was the inventor of the screw-tourniquet, and the first who operated
                    for fistula lachrymalis by transfixion of the sac. He contributed largely to the
                    Memoirs of the Royal Academy of Surgery; an institution which has done much for
                    the advancement of surgery, not only in France, but throughout the world. Its
                    Memoirs, containing the result of the labours of many eminent men, constitute a
                    work of the greatest value. Desault, also of high reputation, both as an
                    anatomist and as a surgeon, was the first who taught surgical anatomy, and gave
                    clinical lectures on surgery. His improvements on the apparatus for fractures
                    were most important; and a splint invented by him is still in use for fractures
                    high in the femur. His modifications of cutting instruments were also good;
                    among others, changing the amputating instrument to a straight knife, instead of
                    the old curved weapon. He was the first who contemplated the cure of artificial
                    anus, resulting from strangulated hernia; and he further improved Pare’s revival
                    of ligature of the arteries. The proposal of curing aneurism by ligature of the
                    vessel on the distal side of the tumour originated with him; a proceeding,
                    however, of which the merit is still dubious. His writings are both valuable and
                    extensive. After the great names of Petit and Desault, not a few French surgeons
                    of the same century, though less eminent, yet deserve mention; Le Dran, a
                    copious and excellent author; Sabatier, famous in the department of operative

                <p>It is about the middle of the eighteenth century that our attention is first
                    attracted to our transatlantic brethren. In 1763, lectures on anatomy and
                    surgery were delivered in Philadelphia by Dr Shippen; and in 1791 the medical
                    school of that city was completely established, under Benjamin Rush, the
                    Hippocrates of Colombia; a school which has since lent invaluable aid to the
                    progress of both medicine and surgery.</p>
                <p>Our own country was at this time by no means barren in surgery. Percival Pott and
                    John Hunter are names which occur, the one in the middle, the other in the end,
                    of the eighteenth century, and are fully equivalent to Petit and Desault; indeed
                    Hunter may be justly ranked as the greatest man that ever graced the profession.
                    Pott, the best author, operator, and practical surgeon of his time, greatly
                    improved the practice of surgery in England, both by his writings and by
                    personal example. Like Desault, his attention was particularly directed to the
                    treatment of fractures, of which he had some painful experience in his own
                    person, having sustained a severe compound fracture of the leg. He has left a
                    justly celebrated treatise on the subject. On amputation his observations are
                    most important, clearly discriminating between those cases, of injury more
                    particularly, which demand the operation, and those which do not; at the same
                    time marking the period most advantageous to its performance. Regarding injuries
                    of the head, he wrote with more precision, and at the same time with more
                    originality, than any previous author, and will ever remain a valued authority
                    upon that subject. The same may be said of his description of vertebral disease,
                    he having been the first who clearly distinguished between those curvatures of
                    the spine depending on mere change of form in the bones, and those occasioned by
                    caries or abscess: the latter formidable affection is still known as “Pott’s
                    disease” of the vertebras. He greatly improved the treatment of fistula in ano,
                    and abscesses in general; and by simplifying the whole art of surgery,
                    discarding the cautery and escharotic unguents, or rather limiting them to their
                    proper place and use, employing also the cutting instruments with caution and
                    reserve, and placing more implicit trust in, and showing more respect for, the
                    powers of nature than had hitherto been the custom, he achieved a most important
                    and beneficial reform in surgery. Until his time, the maxim “Dolor medicina
                    doloris” remained unrefuted. The actual cautery, for example, was in such
                    general use, that “at the time when surgeons visited the hospital, it was
                    regularly heated and prepared in the wards, and in the presence of the patients,
                    as a part of the necessary apparatus. Mr Pott lived to see these remains of
                    barbarism set aside, and a more humane and rational plan, of which he was the
                    originator, universally adopted.” John Hunter, a native of Scotland, the pupil,
                    first of Cheselden, and afterwards of Pott, though not remarkably distinguished
                    as an operator, was the most gifted surgeon of which the medical profession can
                    boast, and no less eminent as an anatomist, physiologist, and general
                    philosopher. His researches comprehended a wider range than those of Pott, but
                    arrived at the same end, the improvement of surgery. The knowledge obtained by
                    his vast inquiries into physiology, pathology, and human and comparative
                    anatomy, was, with all the power of his genius, brought to bear upon the
                    practice of the profession, and with the happiest success. The doctrines of
                    adhesion, granulation, ulceration, and inflammation with its various results,
                    were, until detected and explained by him, comparatively obscure and uncertain;
                    and no one is ignorant how much the successful treatment of disease, either by
                    surgery or medicine, must ever depend on an accurate and familiar knowledge of
                    these rudiments. To him we are indebted for the simplification of more than one
                    operation, the discovery of the vitality of the blood, important advice as to
                    the treatment of gunshot wounds, the enforcement of excision of bitten or
                    poisoned parts, many new facts as to the physiology and pathology of teeth, and
                    other valuable additions to practical surgery. But these assume an unimportant
                    place among his deeds, when placed beside the two with which his name is
                    indelibly associated— the cure of popliteal aneurism by ligature of the femoral
                    artery, and the elucidation of the venereal disease; his work on the latter
                    subject still remaining standard, and in many respects unsurpassed. His
                    improvement of the operation for aneurism marks an era in the history of
                    surgery, being one of the most important of its advances. Dissatisfied with the
                    cruel, formidable, and unsatisfactory operation for popliteal aneurism, by
                    incision of the tumour and ligature of the vessel at its diseased part, he made
                    himself aware of the causes of failure by the old system, contemplated the plan
                    of cure which bears his name, satisfied himself of its practicability by
                    diligent study and experiment, successfully brought it to the test of actual
                    practice; and then, extending the principle to all aneurisms, effected for
                    surgery a great triumph over that formidable disease.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>“So discouraging were the results of the old
                    operation, that many surgeons preferred performing amputation of the aneurismal
                    limb."</p></note> His first operation was performed in 1785, and was successful;
                    proving that permanent removal of the force of the circulation in the aneurism
                    is sufficient for its cure, by permitting consolidation and ultimate
                    obliteration of the tumour. Since his time the method of applying the ligature
                    has been considerably improved, and the certainty of success consequently
                    increased. But “the more brilliant a discovery, and the more beneficial its
                    results, the more certain is its author of becoming the butt of envy and the
                    object of detraction.” And accordingly we find that Hunter has not been
                    permitted to remain in undisturbed possession of bis discovery. Its merit has by
                    some been claimed as due to Aëtius; others, with better hopes of success,
                    support the pretensions of Guillemeau (a pupil of Ambrose Paré), Anel<note

                    ever result in ascribing the honour to our illustrious countryman. Had he even
                    been deprived of this, his name must still have been immortalized by other and
                    more palpable labour of his mind and hand—his books and museum.</p>
                <p>In the same century with Pott and Hunter, Britain also produced White, an
                    excellent practical surgeon and lucid writer; Cheselden and Douglas, two eminent
                    lithotomists, the former peculiarly successful; Sharp, famed for his Critical
                    Inquiry into the State of Surgery; and Monro, a name indissolubly united with
                    the birth and fame of the Edinburgh medical school.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Dr Monro was appointed professor of anatomy
                    to the company of surgeons in 1719, and during the ensuing year be was appointed
                    to a similar chair in the university. Several other professors in the same
                    faculty had previously been nominated; Sir Robert Sibbald, Dr Halket, and Dr
                    Pitcairne, so early as the year 1685. But Dr Monro was the first who regularly
                    delivered public courses of lectures, and be may in a great measure be regarded
                    as the founder of the medical school of Edinburgh.</p></note></p>
                <p>In Italy, where, during the times of Pott and Hunter, several eminent surgeons
                    lived, Lancisi, Morgagni, Bertrandi, Troja, &amp;c.,—the labours of Hunter in
                    aneurism were ably followed up by Scarpa, who still further elucidated the
                    doctrines regarding the new treatment of that disease, and established the
                    success of the operation. He was also eminently successful in his researches as

                    logy of hernia, a subject which he has made peculiarly his own. The same century
                    saw in Germany, Schmuckcr, Richter, and the great Haller, whose <hi
                    rend="italic">Disputationes Chirurgica</hi> bear, equally with his other works,
                    the impress of both labour and genius of a high order.</p>
                <p>The nineteenth century will not yield to any former era in a numerous and bright
                    array of names dear to surgery. It has seen the fall of Abernethy and Dupuytren,
                    brilliant stars in the galaxy, and mourns others highly valued; but vast and
                    powerful is the host who are still labouring, with distinguished success, in
                    their noble calling. In all civilized countries, the dark days of the profession
                    have, we trust, for ever passed away; and many arc the illustrious names in
                    which it now exults, more particularly in France and Germany. But we hesitate
                    not to assert,—and we cannot think that national prejudice exerts any influence
                    in leading us to the conclusion,—that no country can boast of such a crowd as
                    that by which Britain, in the present century, has been and still is adorned.
                    And we feel an honest pride in stating, that the medical school of Edinburgh can
                    claim connection with not the least among these living names.</p>
                <p>Having followed surgery thus far, from the earliest times, in its most notable
                    points of history, we shall proceed to inquire briefly into the practice of the
                    present day. And, first, of the art of operating. It is a favourite phrase by
                    which operations are stigmatized as the “opprobria of surgery.” Nothing can be
                    more unjust. So long as injury and disease are permitted to afflict mankind; so
                    long as bones are crushed, and flesh bruised and torn; so long as tumours grow,
                    and gangrenes spread—and we know nothing short of direct divine interposition
                    that can wholly prevent such accidents—it is only by operation, dexterously
                    executed and skilfully timed, that the human frame can be kept in repair, and
                    life prolonged. To be able safely and expeditiously to remove parts which
                    accident has rendered totally useless, and which would prove highly injurious if
                    longer attached to the body; to take away diseased formations, or other noxious
                    substances, and, at the expense of but brief suffering, to dispel torture which
                    had rendered existence a burden for previous weeks, months, and years; to
                    accomplish such results, though it be by blood and pain, is alike creditable to
                    the operator and beneficial to the sufferer. It is not a disgrace to the
                    profession that certain injuries and diseases are of so grievous a nature as to
                    be incurable but by operation, for such is the dispensation of Providence; it is
                    the surgeon’s boast to have recourse to the knife as seldom as possible; but it
                    is also his pride to be able by it, as a last, and, to both parties, painful
                    resource, to ward off suffering, deformity, and death. It is not, to operate,
                    but to operate unseasonably, unnecessarily, unskilfully, that can ever bring
                    disgrace; and to refrain from performing an operation when it is loudly and
                    plainly called for, would carry not only opprobrium to surgery, but guilt and
                    shame to the surgeon. We are speaking of surgery as it now is, not as it was. In
                    former times operations were its disgrace. Knives, hot irons, screws, files, and
                    saws, were employed with cruel and ignorant recklessness; but of late years, it
                    has been the object of each truly good surgeon to simplify and diminish the
                    number of instruments, and at the same time to use them as seldom as possible.
                    He does not hesitate to employ them when his knowledge and experience tell him
                    they have become indispensable. On the contrary, he will probably be urgent in
                    their application, knowing that an early wound may save much after-suffering;
                    but, in the first place, he will exert all his skill and all his powers, by
                    milder measures to counteract injury and restrain disease, so as to supersede
                    the necessity of operating. To effect this is doubtless the true triumph of his
                    profession; and this triumph he often attains. But he must be Utopian indeed who
                    can seriously hope that the period will ever arrive when operations shall have
                    altogether ceased to be required. In the progress of surgery, many a murderous
                    weapon, at one time in frequent use, has grown thick with rust, and become
                    almost unknown; those retained are few, effective, and never employed without
                    good cause. the growth of science and experience is bringing the ravages of
                    disease more and more under control; operations are not only less frequent, but
                    more simple and less dangerous in the performance; and it is the pride of the
                    modern surgeon to witness and promote this great improvement of his profession.
                    But there are, and ever must be, diseases which we cannot expect to cure, and
                    injuries against which we cannot hope to strive successfully, so as to preserve
                    life, by any measure short of operation. Modern surgery, accordingly, while
                    anxious to limit the necessities for operation, is not the less aware of its
                    importance as a means of cure; and has not only directed attention towards its
                    improvement, but also extended its application, and with the happiest result, to
                    diseases formerly unopposed. Many patients, for example, are now by the knife
                    freed from morbid growths and natural deficiencies, who were formerly left an
                    unprotected prey to deformity and disease.</p>
                <p>The necessity for an operation having been clearly established, our object then
                    is to perform it as safely and expeditiously as possible. We now no longer hear,
                    as we did even so lately as fifteen or twenty years ago, of a poor patient being
                    tortured for the space of an hour, by cruelties misnamed lithotomy: in a few
                    minutes the bladder is cleared of extraneous matter; and almost the like number

                    adherent to the chest, I cut it without bleeding, with a wooden or horn knife,
                    soaked in aquafortis, with which, having cut the skin, I dig out the rest with
                    my fingers !”</p></note> With this celerity, the safety of the patient is not
                    only equally, but more secure; for rapidity is still held subservient to, though
                    conjoined with, excellence of performance; and the mere absence of protracted
                    pain confers a most important advantage on the reparative powers of the system.
                    A prominent cause of this improvement in the art of operating, is an increased
                    simplicity of the instruments, their arrangement, and use. On this subject, one
                    who is <hi rend="italic">facile princeps</hi> among the operators of the present
                    day,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Mr
                    Liston.</p></note> * observes: Our armamentaria should contain simple and
                    efficient instruments only; the springs, grooves, notches, and curves, seeming
                    to be chiefly intended to compensate for want of tact and manual dexterity. The
                    apparatus, though simple, ought to be in good order, and should always be placed
                    within easy and convenient reach of the operator, so that he may be in a great
                    measure independent of the lookers-on, who, owing to anxiety or curiosity, burry
                    and agitation, are apt to hand any thing but what may at the instant be
                    required. He will consider well what place he himself will most conveniently
                    occupy during the operation; and having obtained proper assistants, he will make
                    sure that they all understand what is expected of them. In short, before he
                    ventures to begin, he will ascertain that every thing is arranged, and in proper
                    order; more particularly, that the cutting instruments have good points, that
                    their edges are keen, and that the joints of forceps and scissors move freely
                    and readily. The principle on which the instrument is made to cut should be well
                    considered. Every knife is to be looked upon as a fine saw; the teeth of some
                    are set forwards, and these cut best from point to heel, as does a razor; but
                    the greater number are set in the opposite direction,—for example, the com-<pb
                    break="no" facs="ht:chi.28490924&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=978"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0720-0978-0832"/> mon scalpel and bistoury,—and act efficiently
                    only in being drawn from heel to point. The cutaneous tissues, and in many
                    instances the subjacent parts, should be divided at once and completely, by a
                    single incision made lightly and rapidly; for the pain experienced is in
                    proportion to the pressure and tardiness of movement in the instrument applied.
                    The pain of partial division of the skin, in tails left at each end of an
                    incision, is very great; and, besides, such wounds are not so available, as they
                    would otherwise be, for the intended purpose of evacuating fluid, for permitting
                    the extraction of foreign bodies, or for the dissection of morbid growths. Also,
                    the pausing of a surgeon in the midst of a dissection, and the resort to fresh
                    and more extensive incisions of the surface, is not only always awkward, but
                    attended with much additional and unnecessary pain to the patient. Every cutting
                    instrument should be well balanced, and placed in a steady, smooth handle; the
                    point should either be in a line with the back, which ought then to be perfectly
                    straight, or both edge and back should be so far convex, the point being in the
                    middle of the blade. The form and size of the instrument ought always to be in
                    proportion to the extent of the proposed incisions, both as regards their length
                    and depth: nothing can be imagined more cruel and reprehensible, for example,
                    than an attempt to remove the lower extremity of a full-grown person with a
                    common scalpel or dissecting knife. If an extensive incision is necessary, an
                    instrument should be employed possessing length of edge sufficient to separate
                    the parts smoothly and quickly. Should the operator be required to cut on
                    important parts, to perform a delicate dissection of the living tissues, he will
                    choose a short-bladed instrument, with a handle rather long and well rounded;
                    and after the superficial incisions have been effected, he will hold it as he
                    would a writing pen, lightly but firmly, so that he can turn the edge, and cut
                    either towards or from himself, as occasion may require. A small well-made
                    scalpel, with a good point, and less convexity than those usually employed, is
                    the instrument best adapted for such a purpose. Grooved probes and directors
                    should be used as little as possible. With a little practice, incisions may be
                    made upon the most delicate parts, without risk, by the hand unsupported, one
                    layer being cut after the other. If any instrument is wanted to make the
                    proceeding more safe—if the closely investing fasciae of a hernial tumour, for
                    example, are to be cautiously raised—dissecting forceps will be found the most
                    convenient instrument for elevation previous to incision. In dividing the skin,
                    the knife, whether a scalpel or a bistoury, is to be held and entered with the
                    point and blade at right angles to the surface. It is carried with a decisive
                    movement down to the subcutaneous cellular tissue; the blade is then inclined
                    towards the part to be divided, and by a rapid and slightly sawing motion—as
                    little pressure being applied as possible—the division is effected to the
                    desired extent. The incision is finished by withdrawing the knife in a position
                    perpendicular to the surface, so as to divide the entire thickness of the skin
                    at the extremity as well as origin of the wound. For dexterously effecting such
                    manipulations, the “fingers must be educated and diligent practice in the
                    dissecting-room will be found the best foundation for surgical dexterity, as it
                    is for sound surgical knowledge: “it is only when we have acquired dexterity on
                    the dead subject, that we can be justified in interfering with the living.” By
                    practice the pupil will be enabled to use either hand almost equally well, and
                    none should neglect to attain this power, for an ambidexterous surgeon possesses
                    a great advantage as an operator. An ordinary degree of expertness is within the
                    reach of any one who will industriously seek for and improve the opportunities
                    for its acquirement; but yet a certain combination of natural qualifications is
                    undoubtedly necessary to the attainment of preeminence in operative surgery; for
                    a great operator in one respect resembles a great poet,—“nascitur, non fit.” The
                    importance of these natural gifts did not escape Celsus. “He must be young, or
                    at most but middle aged,” says he, “and have a strong steady hand, never subject
                    to tremble. He must be ambidexterous, and of a quick, clear sight. He must be
                    bold, and so far void of pity that he may have in view only the cure of him whom
                    he has taken in hand, and not, in compassion to cries, either make more haste
                    than the case requires, or cut less than is necessary, but do all as if he were
                    not moved by the shrieks of his patient.” The coolness and courage thus
                    inculcated are the most valuable natural gifts of the surgeon; and it would be
                    well did every patient remember that they are equally important in himself, for
                    on his steadiness and patience under suffering much of the celerity and success
                    of an operation depends. Expert skill in operation contributes greatly towards
                    perfect self-possession; for the dexterous surgeon, like an adroit master of the
                    sword, “will not enter rashly into difficulties, but being engaged from
                    necessity or conviction, will bring himself through with courage.” He who has
                    what is strangely termed “<hi rend="italic">common</hi> sense,” enjoys another
                    of nature’s choicest gifts; and to no possessor does it prove more valuable than
                    to the surgeon, as by its judicious application the want of more than one of the
                    prominent qualifications considered as essential to his success may be fully
                    compensated.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The ancient
                    Athenians had a law, that no slave or woman should study medicine: probably
                    fearing want of education in the one class, and deficiency of common sense in
                    the other. Perhaps it were well if a similar protection to the practice of the
                    profession were in present force, as was proposed by the late Mr Alexander Wood
                    of this city. In addition to the usual examination for the diploma of surgeon,
                    he tried to establish a jury to determine on the common sense of the candidate,
                    stating as his reason, “If they have not <hi rend="italic">that,</hi> I would
                    not give a—for <hi rend="italic">the rest of</hi> their medical
                    knowledge.”</p></note> But a combination of the natural essentials for an
                    eminent operator, as may readily be imagined, tolls to the lot of only a small
                    number; and to that gifted few it were well, when circumstances will admit of
                    it, to delegate the performance of the more dangerous and difficult operations.
                    Every surgeon, however, should be ready to undertake the greater number of
                    surgical proceedings without hesitation or delay; for though, as we have already
                    stated, operations do not form the most important part of surgery, they still
                    are, and ever must be, inseparable from its successful practice.</p>
                <p>Haemorrhage, the most prominent accompaniment of surgical operation, is now in
                    much better command, both temporarily and permanently, than it used to be, and
                    consequently is less dreaded by the surgeon. During the operation, complicated
                    machines, encircling the whole limb—very painful from the great and general
                    pressure, and increasing the loss of blood by swelling the venous torrents and
                    retarding retraction of the minor vessels—are now superseded by the skilful
                    application of the “educated” and steady hand of an assistant, compressing the
                    trunk of the main artery, and it alone. This change is particularly advantageous
                    to amputation, admitting of its performance with greater despatch, less
                    haemorrhage, and less pain. In more tedious proceedings, the cautious
                    extirpation of tumours, for example, the surgeon commences his incisions where
                    he knows the principal vessels enter the part about to be the scene of
                    operation: they are consequently divided at once; an active and steady assistant
                    secures their orifices by the pressure of one or more fingers, and the
                    proceedings are completed with comparatively little loss of blood, and without
                    the hinderance of applying ligatures to any arterial branches until all the
                    knife-work has been completed. Sometimes, when the part is unusually vas<pb
                    break="no" facs="ht:chi.28490924&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=979"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0720-0979-0833"/> cular, and important vessels come from all sides,
                    this rule cannot be followed, and ligature must be applied to each important
                    branch as it is divided; but this necessity for delay does not often occur. The
                    ligature,—a firm hempen thread, well waxed,—ought in all cases to be applied
                    very carefully, and made to enclose the orifice of the artery alone, which for
                    this purpose is pulled out by common well-pointed dissecting forceps, or, when
                    the parts have been consolidated by infiltration, by a sharp tenaculum. A double
                    knot, carefully secure, having been made upon the isolated orifice, one end of
                    the ligature is cut off close to the knot, the other being left protruding from
                    the most dependent part of the wound, that the ultimate separation of the
                    ligature and its enclosed slough may thus be watched and made certain. It was
                    lately recommended, and is still practised by some, to cut away both ends of the
                    ligature close to the knot, in the belief that the union of the wound by the
                    first intention would thus be favoured, and in the hope that the noose would
                    become encysted in its original situation, and produce no further annoyance;
                    that hope however has been disappointed. It was then thought, that by making the
                    ligature of an animal substance, as catgut, it might be slowly removed by
                    absorption, and thus be prevented from becoming a source of future irritation;
                    but that plan also failed. No doubt, ligatures in such circumstances have long
                    remained quiescent, but that has been seldom; sooner or later, perhaps after the
                    cure has been thought complete, they occasion the formation of abscess after
                    abscess, and produce much irritation, until they themselves are expelled; and
                    thus recovery is in the end much protracted. The usual practice therefore now
                    is, to leave one end of each ligature a little protruding from the lips of the
                    wound, in order to secure their complete expulsion at the proper period. These
                    remarks of course apply only to wounds which are approximated soon after
                    infliction, with the hope of their adhesion. When the cut surface, on the
                    contrary, is left open, in order to suppurate, both ends of each ligature should
                    be removed close to the knot, the practice being then unexceptionable. Another
                    innovation lately practised, was the substitution of torsion for ligature of the
                    arterial orifice, thereby imitating the natural means of suppressing bleeding.
                    The method has only been found to succeed well with vessels of the second class,
                    such as those of the fore-arm—being inapplicable to the smaller twigs, and not
                    safe in the case of the larger arterial trunks. In every extensive wound,
                    therefore, some ligatures must be applied; and that being the case, it has been
                    found more convenient and satisfactory to apply ligatures to each orifice
                    requiring artificial closure. Haemorrhage from veins usually ceases
                    spontaneously when the position of the part is attended to, and all pressure
                    removed that might prove an obstacle to the venous return. If it should be found
                    obstinate, pressure applied to the orifice will be sufficient. Under any
                    circumstances, cauteries and caustics are now seldom if ever required for
                    arresting haemorrhage.</p>
                <p>These remarks naturally lead to the consideration of incised wounds, and here we
                    again find that simplicity and improvement in surgery are synonymous. “Hot
                    dressings, filthy unguents, greasy poultices, stimulating plasters, and
                    complicated bandages, have given place to light water-dressing, unirritating
                    plaster sparingly applied, and careful position of the part.”<note

                    Surgery.</p></note> To no one does a larger share of merit belong in this, than
                    to him from whom we have made the above quotation; and we cannot do better than
                    continue to glean from him a little more on this subject. “Formerly (and they
                    are even stilD wounds were put together without delay, and their edges squeezed
                    into apposition, and retained by various means, such as sutures, plasters,
                    compresses, and bandages. They were carefully covered up, and concealed from
                    view for <hi rend="italic">a</hi> certain number of days. Then the envelopes of
                    cotton and flannel, the compress-cloths, the pledgets of healing ointment, and
                    plasters, were taken away, loaded with putrid exhalations, and a profusion of
                    bloody, ill-digested, fetid matter. A basin was forthwith held under the injured
                    part, and the exposed and tender surface was deluged with water from a sponge,
                    and then well squeezed and wiped. Then came a re-application of retentive
                    bandage, of the plaster, of the grease mixed with drying powder, all surmounted
                    by some absorbing stuff, as charpie or tow, to soak up the discharge. This was
                    not unaccompanied by pain, often more complained of than that attendant on the
                    original injury or operation. This process was repeated day after day, the
                    patient was kept in a state of constant excitement, and often, worn out by
                    suffering, discharge, and hectic fever, fell a victim to the practice. The wound
                    was, as it were, put into a forcing bed, excited action beyond what was required
                    was hurried on, and the consequence was, that immediate union seldom if ever
                    could or did take place. A suppurating surface, on the contrary, with bad
                    profuse discharge, and a very tedious cure, if any, were obtained.” This was an
                    uncomfortable state of matters, but there is now a change. Surfaces are not
                    disposed to unite for many hours after the division and scparation have
                    occurred. So long as there is oozing of blood, no good end is to be attained by
                    their close apposition. Should this be attempted, the blood which continues to
                    be discharged from the smaller vessels is necessarily prevented from escaping;
                    and the consequences are, infiltration of the loose cellular tissue, distention
                    of the cavity of the wound, and separation of the surfaces probably throughout
                    their whole extent. Then ensues a congested state of the surrounding vessels,
                    with perhaps a troublesome haemorrhage from branches that would otherwise have
                    become scaled up; at all events, much constitutional disturbance, a heated
                    swollen state of the injured parts, profuse, bloody, and putrid discharges, must
                    occur; and this will certainly be followed by wasting suppuration from a foul
                    cavity, which will be long in assuming a healthy action. It is only when
                    re-action has occurred, when gentle vascular excitement has taken place in and
                    around the solution of continuity, and when plastic matter begins to be secreted
                    and thrown out, that the process of adhesion can be expected to commence. The
                    edges of a large wound, as that resulting from amputation of the extremities,
                    may be approximated in part, either by position, or by a few points of
                    interrupted suture, as soon as bleeding from the principal vessels has been
                    arrested. But the close apposition, and application of all the retentive means,
                    had better be delayed for six or eight hours at least. In the interval,
                    sensibility will be abated, the oozing moderated, and the chance of secondary
                    haemorrhage much diminished, by lightly covering the parts with lint dipped in
                    cold water, and frequently renewed; or a piece of lint may be placed between the
                    cut surfaces, and a constant irrigation of them be kept up for some time, by
                    threads passing from a vessel containing cold water. When all oozing has ceased,
                    and the surface become glazed, the surrounding skin, previously shaved, is made
                    thoroughly dry; coagula are removed, the edges arc put carefully and neatly in
                    contact, and are retained by narrow slips of adhesive plaster placed at
                    intervals. The plaster commonly in use does not retain its hold sufficiently
                    long, is loosened by discharge, heats the surface, and often gives rise to
                    erythema. A better kind is made by spreading a strong solution of isinglass in
                    spirit on the unglazed side of oiled silk, cut into slips of the necessary
                    length and size;<pb break="no" facs="ht:chi.28490924&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=980"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0720-0980-0834"/> this plaster is quite unirritating, and often
                    retains its hold until the very completion of the cure. Being transparent, it
                    does not prevent any untoward process that may be going on underneath from being
                    observed; and if any fluid collects under it, an opening can be made for its
                    escape. If sutures have been previously employed for the partial approximation
                    of the wound, they can be removed by cutting the thread, shortly after the
                    fixing of the plasters, for these alone are sufficiently retentive. No other
                    dressing need be employed in the first instance; no compress, no pledget, no
                    bandage; for in general they will not promote union of the wound, and may do
                    harm. The slight discharge that oozes out is from time to time wiped from the
                    surrounding skin, and from the glazed cloth on which the part is laid. In some
                    cases of amputation, after a few days a roller may be applied, to encourage the
                    subsidence of any slight oedema that may have arisen, and to bring the stump
                    into a good form. By such simple treatment, a great dead of suffering is saved
                    to the patient, and he enjoys much comfort and cleanliness; besides, the surgeon
                    is relieved from a load of most unpleasant and harassing duty.</p>
                <p>Wounds produced accidentally are almost always attended with more or less
                    bruising of the parts, and can be united only by the second intention. After
                    bleeding has been suppressed by the method recommended for incised wounds, the
                    cold applications are to be superseded by those of an agreeable warmth, such as
                    poultice of bread and water, or, what is much to be preferred, from its
                    simplicity and lightness, lint of thick texture, and of sufficient size to cover
                    the wound, soaked in tepid water, and overlaid by an ample piece of oiled silk
                    to prevent evaporation. Heat and moisture, by which qualities a poultice
                    produces its soothing and beneficial effects, by which the surface is relaxed,
                    its capillary circulation encouraged, and discharge promoted, arc thus amply
                    afforded, without any of the weight, putrefactive fermentation, stench, and
                    filth, inseparable from the best of common poultices. The edges of the wound are
                    approximated as much as possible by attention to position; and by the same means
                    the return of blood is favoured, and engorgement of the vessels and inflammatory
                    swelling prevented to a very great degree. If the wound run across the fibres of
                    the skin and muscles underneath, these are to be relaxed by flexion or
                    extension, as may be, of the neighbouring articulations. Rest of the injured
                    parts is also essential, and to obtain this it is sometimes proper to apply
                    splints. Contraction of the wound takes place naturally, and generally with
                    sufficient rapidity; should the surface, however, from any cause become weak and
                    flabby, the lint is to be wet with a gently stimulating solution, as of zinc,
                    instead of tepid water. Support, by bandage or plaster, may for a like reason
                    sometimes be required. But healing is often retarded by the plasters and
                    bandages which are inconsiderately employed to hurry it on; the granulations are
                    absorbed, the surface of the sore becomes foul, the discharge thin and
                    offensive, perhaps inflammation of the surrounding skin takes place, with
                    extension of the sore by ulcerative absorption. Sometimes adhesion and
                    suppuration may be happily blended in the cure. Thus, when, in a suppurating
                    wound, whether accidental or incised, the discharge begins to thicken, and
                    diminish in quantity, when the granulations are florid, small, and accuminated,
                    and when the surrounding parts are sufficiently lax to admit of easy
                    approximation, the granulating surfaces may then be brought into close
                    apposition, with every prospect of immediate adhesion taking place.</p>
                <p>Under some circumstances, the rule laid down as to the propriety of delay in
                    permanently closing wounds, may be departed from with advantage; as when the
                    entire surface can be brought into close and accurate apposition, so that no
                    clot of blood can be interposed; as, for instance, in penetrating wounds of the
                    mouth; in division of the lip, as for harelip; and in repairing some
                    deficiencies of the genital organs. In such cases, either the twisted or quilled
                    suture is used, usually the former, and no other dressing should be applied. To
                    put on strips of plaster, to cover the part with lint smeared with ointment, to
                    interpose dossils of lint between the skin and ends of the pins, to support the
                    wound by a uniting bandage—all this is mischievous, and a remnant of the old
                    meddlesome surgery. Any kind of application collects and retains the secretions,
                    heats and excoriates the surface, promotes suppuration, and interferes with the
                    process of union.</p>
                <p>Such is an outline of the simple treatment of wounds now employed, with the happy
                    effects of saving the patient from much pain, and the surgeon from much trouble;
                    obtaining a more frequent occurrence of adhesion in incised wounds; shortening
                    the process of suppuration, and depriving it of much of its inconvenience. It is
                    almost needless to observe, that this, as well as every other treatment, will
                    however prove of little avail, unless accompanied with a careful attention to
                    the general health: in other words, the surgeon, not hesitating to encroach thus
                    far upon the duties of the physician, must ever be employing his medical
                    science.</p>
                <p>In no class of diseases is the operating knife now more happily in abeyance, in
                    comparison with former practice, than in affections of the joints. Many a limb
                    is now saved, with its usefulness little if at all impaired, that would, in days
                    not long passed, have been doomed at once, and with very little ceremony, to
                    amputation.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>John Hunter
                    himself seems to have been in the habit of making very unwarrantable
                    abbreviations of living limbs, as the following anecdote abundantly proves. “He
                    once had a patient whose leg he considered it necessary to remove. He had got on
                    bis <hi rend="italic">dress,</hi> and a profound silence reigned in the theatre,
                    The surgery-man disappeared. In two minutes he returned alone, with a face as
                    long as the leg. Why do you not bring in the patient ?’ demanded the expectant
                    operator. 'Because, sir,’ said the astonished surgery-man, ‘ because, sir, he
                    has run away!'” It is to be hoped that the custom of amputating legs that are
                    able to “run away” hot fallen into complete desuetude.</p></note> This important
                    saving of life and limb is mainly attributable to the advance of pathology. The
                    cultivators of that science, among whom the name of Brodie deserves prominent
                    notice, have shown with great perspicuity the various changes which morbid
                    actions induce in the structure of articulations, and established a wonderfully
                    accurate diagnosis of each affection. We can often tell in what tissue of the
                    joint disease originated, of what nature the morbid action is, and can predicate
                    almost with certainty the actual state of the parts, as to extent and manner of
                    degeneration. According to the principle that “the knowledge of a disease is
                    half its cure,” great advantage is thus obtained in adopting and regulating the
                    treatment suitable to the circumstances of each case. Besides, we can tell at
                    once, and with tolerable accuracy, in what cases we shall probably succeed; and
                    in those in which we are made aware that the disease is of such a nature, or has
                    proceeded to such an extent, as to baffle all attempts to cure, we are enabled
                    to save valuable time, and thereby to save life, by proceeding at once to the
                    only cure available, amputation. In whatever part of the joint diseased action
                    may have originated,—bone, cartilage, bursae, or synovial apparatus,—if not
                    arrested, it soon extends to all, converting the whole joint into one mass of
                    disorganization. It is of the utmost consequence, therefore, to be early in the
                    employment of the appropriate means of cure. The first and most important object
                    is to secure absolute want of motion in the diseased parts; and here it is that
                    the greatest improvement has taken place in the treatment of joints. “If perfect
                    repose and quiet of the affected parts be omitted, all other means are found
                    nugatory, and were as well untried. Nothing but disrepute can accrue to the
                    profession, if hot irons, moxas, and issues continue to be used inconsiderately,
                    to the neglect<pb break="no" facs="ht:chi.28490924&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=981"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0720-0981-0835"/> of more powerful and less appalling means.
                    Instant relief invariably follows the securing a state of perfect rest; other
                    means, local and constitutional, are thus afforded a fair chance of doing good,
                    and the natural efforts towards a cure are no longer thwarted and interrupted.
                    But, above all, the effect on the general health is most remarkable and
                    cheering. Even in very complicated and bad cases, in which sinuses communicate
                    with the cavity of the joint, and the heads of the bones are ascertained to be
                    in a state of ulceration, or partially necrosed, the good effects of perfect
                    quietude of the joint will soon be manifested by cessation of pain, diminution
                    of discharge, and speedy improvement of the general health. A cure of the local
                    mischief may not be possible by this means alone, but much will often be gained,
                    as regards the success of ulterior proceedings, by the rapid and certain
                    amendment of the patient’s condition.” This salutary rest is the first part of
                    the treatment of all diseased joints, and is ∞ntinued, in general, throughout
                    the whole period of cure; it is obtained by the application of splints, varied
                    in form and construction according to the particular joint affected.</p>
                <p>Disease of the soft parts of the joint usually commences in an inflammatory form,
                    requiring depletion; when acute, the antiphlogistic treatment, local and
                    general, must be very active, so as at once to arrest the morbid action; and hot
                    fomentation and poultice will generally be found more soothing than cold
                    applications. When the more violent symptoms have subsided, the disease giving
                    way, a determination to the surface, with discharge, lends powerful aid towards
                    its final extinction. For this purpose vesication may be produced,by cantharides
                    or by nitrate of silver; or an eruption may be established by friction with a
                    liniment of croton oil, or an ointment of tartrite of antimony, their strength
                    proportioned to the nature of the part, and age of the patient. In chronic
                    swelling of a joint, whether the effect of inflammatory action, or slowly and
                    gradually supervening after injury, the diseased action must not only be
                    arrested, but absorption also procured of the deposit and effusion within the
                    synovial capsule and bursae. To obtain the former indication, local depletion
                    and counter-irritation are employed, according as the circumstances of the case
                    require; and to obtain the latter, uniform pressure of the whole swelling, and
                    gentle irritation of the surface, are combined with the means of securing the
                    all-important rest of the joint, according to the method first recommended by Mr
                    Scott. The limb having been uniformly supported by a roller, from its extremity
                    up to the diseased articulation, the surface of the swelling is covered by lint
                    spread with some gently stimulating ointment,—soap cerate with camphor, for
                    example, or that with a greater or less proportion of the unguentum hydrargyri;
                    and the whole articulation is then surrounded by long strips of adhesive
                    plaster, drawn with moderate and uniform tightness, so as to support and gently
                    compress the parts, without producing absolute pain or uneasiness. Above all,
                    splints are applied to secure total immunity from motion; and they may either be
                    of leather or wood, as most suitable to the joint affected. When this dressing
                    has become loose, from subsidence of the swelling, it is re-applied as often as
                    may be necessary. Should fresh excitement occur in the joint, from any
                    accidental cause, during this treatment, the apparatus must be discontinued,
                    until such excitement has been subdued by the usual means already described; and
                    when the pressure is resumed, it should at first be very moderate. During the
                    treatment the limb must be kept or gradually brought into the most advantageous
                    position for ultimate use, particularly if, from the duration, nature, and
                    extent of the disease, there is reason to expect impairment of the joint’s
                    motion. Thus, by steady extension with splints, the knee-joint may be brought
                    into nearly a straight position, so that it shall be serviceable in progression;
                    and the elbow may be bent, to form a right angle with the humerus, so as to be
                    convenient for prehension. But such alterations of stiffened limbs must be
                    proceeded with very cautiously, otherwise they may occasion undue excitement,
                    and consequent renewal of disease in the joint.</p>
                <p>The preceding treatment will be found applicable to almost all joints, the hip
                    not excepted. In morbus coxarius, for example, it is useful for securing
                    immobility of the articulation, an object of such paramount importance towards
                    arresting the progress of that formidable disease; and in its advanced stages it
                    is productive of at least relief. The joint is placed extended, that being the
                    preferable position, in case of anchylosis, and surrounded by “soft lint soaked
                    in a strong solution of gum acacia, which is laid on in strips over the side and
                    pelvis, from the short ribs to the knee, and made to embrace the limb fully. A
                    layer of dry lint is first applied, and then two or three others, soaked in the
                    mucilage, follow: these are covered by a fold or two of coarse calico, and the
                    whole is retained by a roller.” Sometimes it is necessary to preserve the limb
                    steadily in position by a wooden splint, as in fracture, until the composition
                    has dried, and the splint, so formed, adapted itself closely to the parts. “This
                    gum-splint can be made of any form, so as to allow of its being taken off,
                    trimmed, lined with wash leather, or protected with a layer of oiled silk, and
                    re-applied with a clean bandage. It can also be fashioned so as to leave any
                    part exposed: the discharge from issues and abscesses can thus be allowed to
                    escape, and the parts can be dressed, and otherwise attended to, without
                    disturbing the limb. In fact, the apparatus can be varied as circumstances
                    demand, and is applicable in a great variety of cases, and to any articulation.”
                    A similarly useful splint is made “of leather dressed without oil, cut to a
                    proper form, moistened in hot water, and applied with a roller. It soon becomes
                    firm, and forms a case which fits the part accurately; it is then pared,
                    fashioned neatly, and lined. In many chronic cases such splints answer
                    admirably; but the gum-splints can be applied with less disturbance of the limb,
                    which in many instances is a great recommendation.”</p>
                <p>“In the painful and dangerous affections of the articulations, when the
                    cartilages are extensively absorbed, and when the cancellated texture of the
                    bone is more or less diseased, good effects may yet follow judicious treatment.
                    Besides following out the principle of preventing all motion, great relief will
                    often be experienced from establishing a permanent discharge from the
                    neighbourhood of the diseased tissues. This can be done simply and effectually,
                    without causing alarm, or exciting much pain, by confining a small piece of
                    caustic potash on the skin near the diseased joint. The sore thus formed is
                    deepened, and made to discharge freely, when disposed to heal, by a few hours’
                    application of the antimonial ointment. <hi rend="italic">A</hi> seton may be
                    preferred in some situations: certainly discharge can be thus kept up, and
                    derivation obtained from the affected parts, fully as well as by actual
                    cauteries, moxas, pea-issues, or other farrier-like practices. Great care must
                    be taken in the placing of issues; they should be near to, but not upon ajoint.
                    Serious results have sometimes followed their careless application; diseased
                    action has been increased, they having reached, or even penetrated, the synovial
                    capsule.”</p>
                <p>By the careful and judicious employment of such treatment, many affections of
                    joints which resisted the less simple modes of cure formerly in use, are now
                    successfully combated; and many limbs are saved which our forefathers would not
                    even have attempted to cure. But still there are too many cases which baffle all
                    efforts to arrest the progress of morbid action; and it becomes necessary, in
                    order to relieve the labouring constitution, and preserve life, to remove either
                    the diseased parts alone, or the remainder of the limb along with them by
                    amputation. The former operation is termed resection, and is the preferable,
                    because the less mutilating and severe, when the case is such as to<pb
                    break="no" facs="ht:chi.28490924&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=982"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0720-0982-0836"/> promise a tolerable certainty of success. Should
                    it fail, amputation then becomes necessary; but by the failure, the chance of
                    the patient’s ultimate recovery is very much diminished. The cases for
                    resection, therefore, should be carefully selected. The general health must not
                    have been much impaired; the soft parts must not be extensively affected; the
                    disease must be almost entirely limited to the articulating surfaces; the joint
                    must be such that the bones can be reached easily, and without the risk of
                    wounding parts of great importance; and the patient must be of that age and
                    constitution most favourable to the reparation of injury. The articulating
                    extremities of the bones are exposed by free incisions, planned according to the
                    circumstances of the case, and the diseased portions are removed by suitable
                    saws, or by cutting pliers. The soft parts are then replaced, and the cavity
                    treated as a suppurating wound, the intention being that it should heal by
                    healthy granulations from the bottom. In patients tolerably advanced in life, it
                    is well to keep the maimed joint in perfect quiet, and in the position most
                    favourable to the subsequent use of the member, in order that the cure may be by
                    ligamentous anchylosis, otherwise the limb will prove weak and not much
                    available, and disease will be liable to return. But in young persons of healthy
                    constitution, motion of the part is encouraged during the cure, with every
                    prospect of the new articulation becoming both free and strong. The elbow-joint
                    is the one to which the operation is most applicable. In the shoulder-joint it
                    sometimes is expedient, also in the carpus and tarsus; but in the knee and hip
                    joints experience loudly forbids its performance.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Fur further information on resection of
                    joints, see Mr Syme’s excellent treatise on this subject.</p></note></p>
                <p>When however all milder means have failed, and resection is inapplicable,
                    amputation must not be deferred until the disease has grown riotous in its
                    progress, and the general health has been seriously impaired. When the surgeon
                    is satisfied that amputation has become absolutely necessary,—that nothing else
                    can save life,—the sooner it is performed, the greater is the chance that this
                    severe remedy will not fail in its issue; and it is consolatory to reflect that
                    modern improvement has greatly mitigated its horrors, and increased the
                    probability of its success. It is performed more rapidly, more skilfully, and
                    the suffering is infinitely less both during and after the operation. The
                    tedious dissection of a limb, called the “circular method,” has now given place
                    to the “flap-operation” by transfixion; the only valid objection that can be
                    brought against which is, that perhaps a greater surface of wound is made; but
                    this is much more than counterbalanced by the many benefits which it otherwise
                    insures. The operation is more rapid, and less painful; the cut surface is
                    smooth and regular; adhesion, or union by the first intention, is much more
                    frequent; whether union be by the first or second intention, the cure is more
                    speedily completed; the end of the bone is infinitely better covered, and the
                    stump consequently more useful; and if the flaps have been skilfully formed,
                    there will be no exfoliation of the end of the bone protruding through ulcerated
                    integuments, and no formation of excruciating neuromata in the cut extremities
                    of the nerves, rendering a renewal of operation necessary for final cure. The
                    manipulations of the flap-operation are simple and well known, so need not be
                    here detailed; but some rules necessary for its dexterous accomplishment are not
                    always sufficiently attended to. The first regards transfixion; and it is, that
                    after the first flap has been formed, the knife should not be again entered
                    close to the top of the wound, but about an inch below, as thus cross-cutting of
                    the integument is avoided. Another is, that in sawing the bone, the surgeon must
                    not trust the distal portion of the limb entirely to an assistant, but, grasping
                    it in bis left hand, must himself regulate its support, and so avoid splintering
                    the bone. Pressure to command the bleeding need not be severe, but must be true.
                    As was formerly stated, the tourniquet is seldom if ever used when the fingers
                    of an assistant can be obtained who is cool, steady, and well conversant with
                    the course of the vessels. The pressure thus obtained is not applied until the
                    instant the incisions are commenced, and then only on one point; the limb
                    consequently is not gorged with blood, as it would have been by the ordinary
                    tourniquet: less blood therefore is lost, and besides, the flaps are much more
                    easily retracted from the bone. When skilful assistants cannot be obtained, or
                    when it is probable that many vessels will require ligature, and that
                    consequently pressure must be long continued, a strong metallic spring may be
                    used, each extremity terminating in a pad, one placed over the course of the
                    vessel,, the other resting on the opposite part of the limb: the assistant
                    preserves its just application, and regulates its pressure, and the risk is
                    avoided of his fingers giving way from cramp or fatigue. When the surgeon, from
                    want of other means, is compelled to use the ordinary screw-tourniquet, its
                    principal pressure should never be applied until the moment before incision; and
                    as soon as the larger vessels have been secured, the whole apparatus should be
                    removed, as thus the loss of much blood by regurgitation, and particularly from
                    veins, will be avoided. The arterial orifices are secured by ligature, according
                    to the method already mentioned; and should the venous trunks continue to pour
                    out their contents, notwithstanding the removal of all constriction of the limb,
                    pressure by the fingers of an assistant, though for only a short time, usually
                    suffices to arrest the haemorrhage. The wound is treated according to the
                    principle of delay formerly explained; and thus adhesion is not only favoured,
                    to the saving of time and pain, but the occurrence of secondary bleeding is also
                    made much more improbable; for no warm coagulum is bound up in the wound, to act
                    as a sponge, and encourage escape of blood from all the untied vessels; and even
                    when it does take place, the bleeding point is much more easily secured than
                    when the stump is bound up tight and close from the first. Should the stump
                    bleed seriously, six, eight, ten, twelve, or fifteen days after the operation,
                    in consequence of sloughing or some other unhealthy action having supervened,
                    the ununited wound is to be laid open, all coagula removed, and direct pressure
                    applied. But should this fail, the surgeon ought instantly to secure the trunk
                    of the vessel whose branches are at fault, at some distance above the stump—in
                    amputation below' the knee, tying the femoral, for example—at the same time
                    supporting the stump by bandage. This practice has been found almost invariably
                    successful.</p>
                <p>Amputation is also less frequently resorted to in cases of severe injury than
                    formerly. In fractures, skilful and careful management preserves many a limb
                    useful and but little out of shape, which before would have been considered too
                    seriously injured to retain its vitality. Nor are compound luxations regarded
                    with the same dread. In compound dislocation of the ankle-joint, for example,
                    with protrusion of the bones, instead of at once amputating the limb, the
                    dislocation is reduced, the protruding portions of bone having been removed in
                    whole or in part, if so injured as to render that proceeding necessary; the limb
                    is retained in a favourable position, and in a state of complete rest; the wound
                    is treated by the simple soothing plan; undue excitement is warded off or held
                    in subjection by the usual means; if abscesses form, they are early evacuated;
                    the parts are uniformly and gently supported; the surgeon’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >medical acquirements</hi> are kept constantly, on the alert; and thus, in very
                    many cases, the limb is retained, with the injured joint,<pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:chi.28490924&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=983" xml:id="kp-eb0720-0983-0837"/>
                    though stiff, exceedingly useful. The ordinary simple dislocations are now at
                    once detected by the observant and well-educated surgeon, and as readily reduced
                    if recent; so that branch of the profession promises to be soon rescued
                    completely from the maltreatment of ignorant empirics.</p>
                <p>The whole treatment of fractures has been simplified and improved; the process of
                    reparation in disunited bone is better understood, and the means which favour it
                    are more skilfully and effectually adapted. In fractures, whether compound or
                    simple, of the smaller bones, more particularly of the upper extremity, the
                    gum-splint will be found very suitable. By the employment of these or other
                    light splints, —of wood, pasteboard, leather,—well padded, so as not to fret the
                    integument, and always of sufficient length to command the neighbouring joints,
                    the bones are not only kept accurately in their proper place, but perfect
                    quietude and freedom from all motion are likewise secured,—a point all-important
                    here, as in the treatment of diseased joints. Broken limbs are no longer laid
                    out in state on pillows, altogether unrestrained. Absolute rest, following early
                    reduction of the bones, and combined with strict attention to the workings of
                    the general system, usually succeeds in preventing interruption of the cure by
                    undue excitement in the neighbourhood of the injury. Should this nevertheless
                    occur, the retentive apparatus can be so arranged as to admit of the part in
                    fault being attended to as freely and as often as is necessary, without
                    disturbance of the rest of the limb; for example, blood may be abstracted
                    locally, fomentation or poultice applied to a particular part, abscesses opened,
                    and wounds dressed, without undoing all the retentive apparatus, and so jarring
                    the fracture. In severe compound fractures this advantage is particularly
                    important. The soft parts can be looked after as well as if no apparatus at all
                    were applied; and the untoward results likely to follow such a serious accident
                    can consequently be sometimes averted, and always moderated, while the hard
                    parts are uniformly kept in the condition most favourable to their union. In
                    fractures of the lower extremity near the hip-joint, Desault’s splint is still
                    in use, somewhat modified When the break is lower in the limb, an improvement of
                    Macintyre’s double inclined plane is by much the most suitable apparatus,
                    combining in an eminent degree the advantages of complete rest of the whole
                    limb, with ready and convenient dressing of particular parts.<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>For more minute details
                    regarding these splints, see Liston’s Practical Surgery, p. 80, <hi
                    rend="italic">et seq</hi>.</p></note> The patient is also able, with safety, to
                    be out of bed, and in the erect posture, at an early period of the cure; a
                    circumstance very favourable to the preservation of the general health.</p>
                <p>When, notwithstanding care and skill, gangrene occurs after severe fracture,
                    either immediately, or in consequence of greater vascular excitement having
                    taken place than the hurt parts are able to bear, amputation must be had
                    recourse to, and the period of its performance is now no longer a subject of
                    dispute. It must be done immediately, in sound parts, at a distance from the
                    gangrene, without waiting for a line of separation, as in chronic gangrene, else
                    the surgeon will expect the opportunity in vain, and meanwhile his patient will
                    sink.</p>
                <p>Sometimes, either by the carelessness of the surgeon and inefficiency of his
                    treatment, or from the fault of his patient or defect of his constitution, union
                    of the fracture fails to take place. In recent cases of such disunion,
                    adjustment of the broken ends in accurate apposition, and undisturbed rest of
                    the fracture and of the whole limb, will occasionally effect a tardy union. But
                    usually it becomes necessary to rouse the parts; and the method now followed,
                    the most convenient, as well as most successful, is the introduction of a seton
                    between the fractured extremities, gradually increasing the size of the tape,
                    but taking care to remove it altogether as soon as it appears that excitement
                    has been produced, sufficient for establishing the regenerative process. A few
                    days are usually enough; when ignorantly permitted to remain for a long period,
                    the mere presence of the foreign body, and more particularly the constant
                    discharge which it maintains, tend most powerfully to prevent the result in
                    favour of which it was employed. After removal of the seton, the limb is placed
                    in the proper position, and must be preserved in a state of most complete
                    rest.</p>
                <p>In fractures and other injuries of the cranium, the trephine is now used with
                    better judgment than formerly; more sparingly in most cases, more readily in
                    others. It is not considered necessary to convert every fissure of the skull
                    into a chasm, by following it out with the trephine; in depressed fracture with
                    compression of the brain, the application of the trephine is imperative, but no
                    more bone is taken away than is necessary for the raising of the depressed
                    portion, and the removal of what is so injured by the accident as to render its
                    retention of vitality improbable; and to bore one or more holes in the cranium
                    in search of extravasated blood, is generally regarded as a proceeding equally
                    mischievous and unprofitable. But in punctured fracture, the necessity for the
                    trephine is urgent; it must be used freely and at once; and as this important
                    point of practice is perhaps not yet sufficiently attended to, we shall be a
                    little more explicit on the subject. The punctured or star-like fracture is
                    occasioned by a sharp body striking the head with considerable force. The
                    integuments are divided, and the surface of the bone presents an appearance of
                    injury somewhat resembling what is often seen in ice when struck in a similar
                    way. But this is a very slight extent of damage compared with what the inner
                    table suffers, when the puncturing weapon has passed through the diploe, as is
                    usually the case. The inner table, being by much the more vitreous, is shivered
                    into numerous spiculae, which being driven inwards by the force of the blow,
                    perforate, or at all events grievously irritate, the coverings of the brain,
                    producing inflammatory action, soon affecting that important viscus, and, if not
                    arrested, proving speedily fatal. After the infliction of such an accident,
                    therefore, even should the patient be at the time so little affected as to walk
                    to the surgeon to have his wound dressed, the trephine should be immediately
                    applied to the punctured point, in order that a portion of the bone may be
                    removed, sufficient to allow extraction of all the displaced portions of the
                    internal plate. In no other way can we avert intense inflammatory action from
                    the wounded dura mater, extending in all probability to the brain and its more
                    immediate investments. Even should the practitioner be in some degree successful
                    in moderating the more immediate mischief by antiphlogistics alone, the
                    necessity for trephining will still remain, on account of abscess under the
                    bone, occasioned and kept up by the spiculae; the matter must be evacuated, and
                    the cause of its formation must be removed. It is surely infinitely better,
                    therefore, to operate in the first instance, and so avert all such calamities.
                    Abscess sometimes forms between the dura mater and the bone, as a consequence of
                    mere contusion; its occurrence, and usually its site, are indicated by
                    constitutional disturbance, peculiar oedema of the scalp, unhealthy discharge
                    from the wound, and a pale necrosed appearance of the bone. In such cases, also,
                    perforation of the skull should not be delayed; for it will usually succeed in
                    evacuating the matter, and relieving the patient. But, on the whole, “trepanning
                    of the skull, which, with our forefathers, appears to have been an everyday
                    occupation, is an operation now very rarely resorted to.” After its performance,
                    from whatever cause, there is now no rasping of the bone, or cutting away of the
                    integuments; the edges of the circular aperture are denuded of their pe-<pb

                    parts, having been carefully replaced, are treated as a suppurating wound; the
                    deficiency of the bone is filled up by a ligamentous expansion, incorporated
                    with the granulating integument. When a large portion of the skull has been
                    removed, it is well to afford support to the cranial contents, by the
                    application of a compress and bandage.</p>
                <p>There is no more successful caterer to the amputating knife than erysipelas
                    inertly treated; destruction of bones and joints has been too often its result.
                    The improved treatment by incision, however, now in general use, saves many a
                    limb entire and unscathed. So soon as tension of the surface indicates that the
                    cellular substance is so infiltrated as to threaten destruction of the tissues,
                    free incision must be immediately had recourse to; the knife is used not only to
                    evacuate matter, but to anticipate its formation, and prevent its baneful
                    consequences. In the milder cases,—and in erysipelas of the face, where
                    incisions cannot be practised with propriety,—sufficient relief is obtained by
                    making, with the point of a lancet, numerous punctures in rapid succession;
                    effusion from which is encouraged by hot fomentations. In most cases, even when
                    severe, division of the integument and subjacent cellular tissue suffices; but
                    if the infiltration has extended to the inter-muscular tissue, the knife must
                    follow: its free use may appear harsh, but is in reality a valuable kindness.
                    The burrowing of matter is prevented, and consequently also sloughing of the
                    soft parts, the opening up of bursae and articulations, and the denuding of
                    bones by destruction of their periosteum, ending in necrosis more or less
                    complete. Museums were at one time copiously enriched with splendid specimens of
                    necrosis of the long bones, throughout almost the whole extent of the limb, all
                    the result of neglected erysipelas; but the bistoury has superseded the
                    amputating knife, and such preparations fortunately are now become valuable by
                    their rarity.</p>
                <p>Similar remarks will apply to the early opening of abscesses in general.
                    “Pointing” is not now waited for; before that takes place, irretrievable
                    mischief may have been done. The <hi rend="italic">tactus eruditus</hi> having
                    acquainted the surgeon with the existence of purulent formation, it must be
                    reached by his bistoury, at whatever depth, if it be in the neighbourhood of
                    joints, bones, or vessels, and more particularly if close to important cavities
                    or canals. The mere contact of purulent matter will not injure these, but its
                    pressure will, and from it they must be relieved, lest their functions be
                    interfered with or their structure destroyed. For example, purulent collections
                    in the fauces are evacuated by the bistoury before the patient is threatened
                    with suffocation; and abscesses in the perineum, and neighbourhood of the anus,
                    are drained by an external opening before they have become troublesome
                    fistulae.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Dr Radcliffe
                    has probably few imitators at present in bis clumsy method of emptying abscess
                    of the fauces. “He was once sent for into the country to visit a gentleman ill
                    of the quinsy. Finding (supposing) that no external or internal application
                    would be of service, be desired the lady of the house to order a hasty pudding
                    to be made; when it was done, bis own servants were to bring it up. While it was
                    preparing, he gave them instructions how they were to act When the pudding was
                    set upon the table, the doctor said, ‘ Come, Jack and Dick, eat as quickly as
                    possible; you have had no breakfast this morning.’ Both began with their spoons;
                    but, on Jack’s dipping once for Dick’s twice, a quarrel arose. Spoonsful of hot
                    pudding were discharged on both sides; handsful were pelted at each other. <hi

                    sharp-pointed bistoury would have saved both time and the pudding.</p></note>
                    The knife must of course be used cautiously when the abscess is deep, lest the
                    vessels and other important parts be wounded; but let not the fear of this deter
                    the surgeon from relieving abscesses in their immediate neighbourhood, for “the
                    vessels and nerves are displaced by the morbid accumulation, and the knife is
                    passed safely, in their course, to such a depth as would greatly endanger them
                    in the healthy state of the parts.” The opening should in all cases be made
                    sufficiently large to afford a free exit to the matter; it should be placed in
                    the most dependent part of the cavity, with which view the prevailing position
                    of the patient should be considered; and sometimes more than one opening should
                    be made at once, to prevent the necessity for future counter-openings, or the
                    formation of sinus,—as when the abscess extends over a considerable surface, and
                    cannot be made to discharge through one aperture. After evacuation, in assisting
                    which no pressure or squeezing should be employed, fomentations and the
                    water-dressing are applied. When the rule of early opening has not been attended
                    to, and the abscess in consequence has become chronic and of large size, free
                    incision should still be made at the most dependent point of the tumour,
                    notwithstanding the advice of the late Mr Abernethy to the contrary; for
                    experience has shown that the Abernethian treatment of chronic abscess is more
                    likely to produce constitutional disturbance, with unhealthy excitement of the
                    cavity, than when the matter is allowed a free and constant drain, and the parts
                    are at the same time duly supported. In establishing an artificial abscess, or
                    issue, the modern caoutchouc seton is a great improvement on the skein of silk
                    or cotton formerly used, requiring no renewal on account of decay, and absorbing
                    no discharge.</p>
                <p>Ulcers, like wounds, are now treated more simply and better; and better because
                    more simply. The healthy suppurating sore is covered, like a suppurating wound,
                    with the plain and light water-dressing; simple in the first instance,
                    afterwards medicated by gentle stimulants or not, according as the progress of
                    the sore may seem to require. When stimulants are used, their solution is at
                    first weak, and is increased in strength very gradually, lest the discharge
                    should be suddenly suppressed and the sore consequently inflame; the object is
                    simply to moderate discharge, and check weak exuberance of granulation. An
                    inflamed ulcer is subdued by the hot-water dressing, combined with
                    antiphlogistic regimen, rest, and elevation of the part. An irritable ulcer is
                    soothed by the water-dressing, and occasional slight application of the nitrate
                    of silver to the jagged angry edges of the sore; or the lint may be dipped in a
                    bland anodyne solution. In all such dressings, the lint is kept constantly
                    invested by a portion of oiled silk, larger than itself, to prevent evaporation
                    of the fluid in which the lint has been soaked. When granulations prove
                    exuberant, they are to be reduced to the proper level by the application of
                    sulphate of copper, or may be shaved off by the rapid sweep of a thin sharp
                    bistoury; or the surface may be compressed by dry lint and bandage. An indolent
                    ulcer is stimulated to healthy action by pressure and support, combined if
                    necessary with a direct stimulant application. This last description of sore is
                    the most common, and is usually found afflicting the labouring classes, to whom
                    the restoration of a limb is of more importance than to any other class of
                    patients; a speedy cure is therefore of no little consequence. It is best
                    effected by the method first recommended by Mr Baynton. When the patient applies
                    for relief, there is usually considerable excitement around the sore, and this
                    must in the first instance be corrected by the usual means. Then the foot and
                    lower part of the leg, for it is the part commonly affected, having been
                    uniformly supported by bandage, the sore is compressed by adhesive plaster,
                    applied in strips encircling the whole girth of the limb, and with their
                    extremities crossed over the sore; if this is large, and pouring out much
                    discharge, it is well to cut a small hole in the plaster where it covers the
                    ulcer. The application having been made to extend about an inch on each side of
                    the sore, a little fine tow is placed above it, to absorb discharge, and the
                    whole is retained<pb break="no" facs="ht:chi.28490924&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=985"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0720-0985-0839"/> by continuation of the bandage which supports the
                    lower part of the limb. This dressing is removed at the end of forty-eight
                    hours, or sooner if necessary. The sore itself is not to be washed or rubbed,
                    for its own secretion is its natural and best protection; but the surrounding
                    skin is wiped clean, and, if excoriated by the pressure, bathed with a
                    spirituous lotion; the dressing is then re-applied as before. By such
                    manipulation, repeated as often as is necessary, the indolent surface of the
                    sore is stimulated to the formation of healthy granulations for raising its
                    depressed surface, while at the same time the swelling of the surrounding skin
                    and cellular tissue is diminished by absorption; and thds, the sore and its
                    margins having been brought to one level, cicatrization proceeds. After the
                    ulcer has in this way been converted into the simple suppurating sore, either
                    the same dressing may be continued, exerting less pressure, or it may be
                    superseded by the medicated lint and oiled silk. When nearly closed, all
                    dressing may be discontinued; the natural secretion forming a crust, under which
                    cicatrization is speedily completed. Of course healing will be materially
                    assisted by rest and elevation of the limb; but the labouring man cannot always
                    afford this, and the treatment by plaster, just described, possesses, in
                    addition to its other virtues, this advantage, that with it the patient can
                    continue in the erect posture with much greater impunity than when using any
                    other application. For some considerable time after cicatrization, the limb
                    should continue to be supported by a bandage or laced stocking. Another frequent
                    ulcer is the weak sore, with thin, dark red margins, based on cellular tissue
                    almost sloughing, and emitting a thin unhealthy discharge. Such generally form
                    in clusters, and can be brought to heal only after the unsound parts have been
                    destroyed by the potassa fusa, so as to obtain a sound foundation on which the
                    reparative granulation may arise. This description of sore, however, is too
                    often combined with and dependent on a strumous diathesis, and is healed only to
                    break out afresh.</p>
                <p>Such is a bare outline of the modem treatment of ulcers, to which however no
                    fixed and absolute rules can be made to apply; for sores are often changing
                    their character and appearance, though perhaps but slightly, and consequently
                    demand as frequent a change in the treatment. “A judicious practitioner, by
                    varying his applications according to the appearance and disposition of the
                    sore, will serve and benefit his patient much more efficiently than by trying
                    empirically this or the other new specific, or blindly applying one remedy for
                    every sore, because he has seen its good effects, or been informed of its
                    answering miraculously in one or two instances.” Be it likewise remembered, that
                    in no class of diseases is attention to the general health more requisite.</p>
                <p>We may here allude to the general improvement in hospital practice, in
                    consequence of which the hospital sore, so long and so frequently a scourge in
                    those valuable institutions, is now almost unknown. The ventilation, cleaning,
                    and general arrangement of the wards, the diet, clothing, and classification of
                    the patients, are all improved; but probably nothing has tended so much to the
                    disappearance of this formidable disease, as the substitution of tow for sponge
                    in the dressing of sores; a change apparently simple and insignificant, but in
                    reality most important. Formerly both nurses and dressers were in the habit of
                    using one sponge for the sores and wounds of a whole ward, and if in one patient
                    unhealthy action supervened, the vitiated discharge was soon afforded an
                    opportunity of inoculating all. Now, sponges are not seen but in the operating
                    theatre; washing of wounds and sores has been discontinued, because found to be
                    preju dicial to cicatrization; and when the parts around require cleansing, this
                    is effected by means of tow, which, when used, is immediately thereafter
                    destroyed or thrown away.</p>
                <p>In aneurism, the discovery of Hunter has been most successfully extended. Further
                    investigation in arterial pathology, especially as to the effects of ligature,
                    has produced the most important results. The accumulated knowledge and
                    experience, applied to practice by the talents and courage of Scarpa, Abernethy,
                    Astley Cooper, Liston, Stevens, and Mott, have achieved most triumphant
                    advancement in surgery; for thus the means of cure have been happily extended to
                    cases of aneurism, formerly regarded as irremediable. There are many aneurisms,
                    and not of unfrequent occurrence, on which the surgeons of the last century were
                    content to look until the tumour burst, and their patient perished under their
                    very gaze, which are now fearlessly encountered, and with the best hopes of
                    success. In aneurism of the neck, Hunter and Scarpa led the surgeon to believe
                    that a ligature placed on the carotid, between the tumour and the heart, might
                    effect a cure, and Cooper proved that it did so. This arresting of the cephalic
                    circulation is no longer looked upon with insurmountable dread; for experience
                    has shown, that even both carotids may be tied, with but a short interval
                    between the operations, and without any untoward result. The surgeon’s knife and
                    ligature have, in the cure of aneurism, ventured even so near the heart as the
                    arteria innominata, but hitherto unfortunately without ultimate success; indeed
                    it is doubtful whether the operation on this vessel can ever prove successful,
                    there being so many inevitable obstacles to complete consolidation by ligature;
                    as yet, ulceration has always supervened, occasioning fatal haemorrhage. The
                    subclavian has been deligated on account of axillary aneurism. Mr Liston had the
                    honour to be the first who did so with success; and an equally happy result has
                    not been unfrequent since. Ligature of the axillary and humeral arteries, though
                    difficult, is regarded as scarcely unusual. The aneurisms of the groin and hip
                    were left to run their course unmolested, until Abernethy and Stevens showed
                    that the Hunterian operation could be extended even to them. “The common,
                    external, and internal iliacs, are now tied without much difficulty, and very
                    often with a successful issue. These operations are quite justifiable, provided
                    always there has been no mistake in diagnosis, and that there is nothing in the
                    state of the patient’s health, or in the condition of the arterial system, to
                    contra-indicate interference.” The original operation on the femoral, on account
                    of aneurism in the ham or in the lower third of the thigh, is now looked upon,
                    when skilfully executed, as at once the simplest, most beautiful, and most
                    successful interference with the larger arteries. Thus we see that all aneurisms
                    of the extremities are within the reach of art, and that a certain degree of
                    success has attended the approaches towards the trunk, as far as the common
                    iliac and arteria anonyma.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>The aorta has been tied, but with a result which does not warrant repetition
                    of the experiment.</p></note> It is to be feared that “the force of surgery can
                    no further go.” It is indeed a triumph that it has gone so far; and we cannot
                    reasonably expect that ligatures, placed nearer the great centre of circulation
                    than either of the above-mentioned vessels, can ever be productive of a
                    successful result. Surgical invention and enterprise have not, however, been
                    easily baffled; and in those cases of aneurism too deep to admit of the
                    Hunterian method of operation, it has been proposed to reverse the procedure,
                    and place a ligature on the distal side of the tumour. The operation has been
                    put in practice, and in a few cases with some temporary advantage, but the
                    general result is not encouraging. Great difficulty has sometimes been
                    experienced in discovering the vessel destined for the ligature, in
                    consequence<pb break="no" facs="ht:chi.28490924&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=986"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0720-0986-0840"/> of displacement by the tumour, or more or less
                    obliteration of its calibre. It is an operation “which, in a favourable case,
                    and at the earnest solicitation of a patient, a surgeon might be induced to
                    adopt, as the only though desperate remedy for an otherwise incurable disease;
                    but it is not a proceeding which he would be warranted in urging his patient to
                    undergo.” In false aneurism from wound, as at the bend of the arm, if pressure
                    methodically and firmly applied—the whole limb below the wounded point being
                    duly supported—fail to arrest the formation of tumour, recourse is had to the
                    ligature. If the tumour be recent, soft, and superficial, and the parts around
                    not much infiltrated, the wounded point may be exposed at once by incision, and
                    ligature placed above and below the aperture. But if the tumour be of
                    considerable duration and size, ligature of the trunk, between the tumour and
                    heart, is the preferable and equally successful proceeding.</p>
                <p>The more important steps in effecting deligation of the larger arteries, whether
                    for true or false aneurism, may here be briefly mentioned. The incisions are
                    made with a small, finely-edged scalpel, used lightly and cautiously; neither
                    directors nor blunt knives should be employed, for they must bruise or tear to a
                    certain extent; and the simpler and smoother the cut is, the greater is the
                    probability that both wound and artery will assume a healthy action. The vessel
                    having been exposed, its sheath is opened on the anterior aspect, to the extent
                    of about an inch, and the point of a blunt aneurism-needle is gently passed
                    beneath and around the artery, great care being taken to exclude nerve and vein
                    from its circuit. A strong silk ligature having been thus passed, its loop is
                    cut, and one half withdrawn along with the needle; the other is firmly secured
                    on the artery, its effect on the tumour having, By previous pressure, been
                    ascertained to be satisfactory. In placing the knot on deep-seated vessels, Mr
                    Weiss’s instrument will be found to afford important assistance. “All this must
                    be done without disturbing the position of the vessel, without detaching it from
                    the sheath, or breaking up its fine cellular connections laterally and behind,
                    further than is barely sufficient for the passage of the needle. There must be
                    no lifting of the vessel on the handle of the knife, or on the director, as if
                    in triumph; for ulceration of the arterial coats, and secondary haemorrhage on
                    or about the separation of the ligature, are the almost inevitable consequences
                    of such proceedings.” If by accident the vessel has been disturbed from its
                    connections, two ligatures are to be applied, one at each termination of the
                    separated portion; but in general one single ligature is much preferable. Both
                    its ends should never be cut away close to the knot; for, in addition to the
                    ordinary disadvantages found to belong to this plan, there is no slight risk of
                    abscess, caused by the deserted knot, inducing secondary bleeding by ulcerative
                    absorption of the arterial coats. And indeed the surgeon will feel more
                    comfortable, in such anxious cases, if he leave both ends pendent from the
                    wound. Fora like reason, separation of the ligature should be throughout its
                    whole course spontaneous; rash pulling at its ends may be productive of the most
                    serious results. The wound is brought together, and otherwise treated, according
                    to the principles formerly detailed. Should secondary bleeding unfortunately
                    occur, the vessel must be exposed above and below the source of haemorrhage, and
                    a ligature applied at each point. But if the original operation have been
                    judiciously as well as dexterously performed, and the after-treatment carefully
                    conducted, such an untoward result need scarcely be dreaded. Should pulsation
                    return in the tumour, on the complete establishment of collateral circulation,
                    pressure well applied will suffice to perfect the obliteration of the sac.</p>
                <p>In dilatation or varix of the veins, if methodical pressure and attention to the
                    bowels fail to remove the disease, or at least its inconveniences, a radical
                    cure is obtained by obstruction of the calibre of the main trunk, on the cardiac
                    side of the dilatation; and this is effected either by the application of
                    potass, or by including about an inch of the vein, at that part, between two
                    points of twisted suture; the needles being passed beneath the vessel, and
                    removed as soon as sufficient excited action has been produced in the venous
                    coats. Either method is effectual in obtaining obliteration of the vein’s
                    calibre at the selected point: the latter is, perhaps, in most instances the
                    preferable; but in both the procedure must be cautious, and the after-treatment
                    watchful, in order to guard against haemorrhage and extension of inflammatory
                    action.</p>
                <p>The operation of phlebotomy has always been simple and of easy execution; in
                    regard to it, the only modem improvement which we have to notice, is the
                    comparative rarity of its performance. It was, and still is, too much the custom
                    to bleed, so as to appear to be doing something active in treatment, not only
                    when the proceeding has seemed to the ignorant practitioner likely to do no
                    harm, but also when a wiser head could have told that it must do irremediable
                    mischief. The good fortune of the first phlebotomist, Podalirius, seems to have
                    produced in his successors an unfortunate attachment to the operation, which has
                    been communicated from generation to generation, and from which our day is not
                    yet wholly exempt. In very many cases it is doubtless the only certain means of
                    relief, and must be employed readily and boldly; but in fully as many it had
                    better be done with a sparing hand, or altogether omitted. What can be worse,
                    for example, than to find a patient who has just sustained a severe accident—
                    still labouring under the shock which the injury has produced, pulseless, and
                    with the powers of the system all but extinguished—robbed by an ignorant or
                    reckless man, unfortunately called to his aid, of that very fluid, and
                    consequently of those very powers, of which he is at the time most in need, and
                    without which the syncope must soon pass into death. Such a case is too frequent
                    even now: but it is consolatory to know that the folly of such proceedings is
                    becoming more and more extensively known, and that the thoughtless, mischievous
                    practice of indiscriminate venesection is more and more abandoned.</p>
                <p>A similarly absurd practice prevails in regard to the treatment of bruise.
                    Leeches are instantly applied, in order that they may suck out the extravasated,
                    or “bruised blood,” as it is called. These little animals drink only from the
                    running stream, drawing for themselves from the bloodvessels, and therefore fail
                    to perform what is expected of them by their employers. At the same time, their
                    bites, admitting the external air to the extravasated blood, may induce
                    suppuration of an unhealthy kind in the cellular tissue. They are of use simply
                    as a mode of local depletion, in order to moderate or avert inordinate excited
                    action occurring as a secondary result of the accident.</p>
                <p>In the treatment of hernia, the advancement of anatomical knowledge has rendered
                    operative procedure more simple, safe, and effective. And pathological
                    experience having now fully established the great danger of delay after the
                    taxis, fairly tried, has been found unavailing, the operation is had recourse to
                    at once, with a much more certain prospect of success. In the greater number of
                    cases the taxis will prove successful, when employed early and with skilful
                    perseverance. But as soon as the surgeon is satisfied that his unarmed hands,
                    assisted by his medical skill, are incapable of reducing the tumour, each moment
                    of delay is culpable until he assumes the knife, and by it relieves the
                    constricted parts; for by its keen edge the patient is infinitely less
                    endangered than by even brief continuance of the incarceration. This principle,
                    now generally acted on, saves many a patient who formerly woula either have
                    perished in excruciating torture, or lingered on<pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:chi.28490924&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=987" xml:id="kp-eb0720-0987-0841"/>
                    with artificial anus, noisome to others, and a burden even to himself. But this
                    is a subject too extensive to be here more fully considered. Endeavours towards
                    the cure of artificial anus are made by the apparatus, and according to the
                    system of treatment, invented by Dupuytren; and sometimes they prove
                    successful.</p>
                <p>In the treatment of calculous disorders, modern improvement has effected much.
                    Chemistry, happily combined with pathology, has taught the surgeon in many cases
                    to anticipate cure by prevention, detecting the tendency to deposit in the
                    secretions of the kidney, ascertaining the exact nature of that deposit, and
                    then applying, according to its nature, the suitable corrective. When there is
                    reason to believe that calculus has actually formed in the bladder, its presence
                    is to be ascertained by careful sounding. Many affections— for example, diseased
                    kidneys or fundament, worms or other causes of irritation in the bowels—occasion
                    all the ordinary symptoms of stone; and it is only after the surgeon has
                    distinctly heard the stroke of his sound on the foreign body, that he can be
                    certain that a stone exists. The most convenient instrument for exploring all
                    parts of the bladder is a sound, steel throughout, with a sharp and sudden
                    curve. When, by its cautious and patient use, the presence of a calculus is no
                    longer doubtful, and some estimate has also been made of its size and form, the
                    question then arises between patient and surgeon as to the preferable mode of
                    its summary extrusion; for removal by chemical solvents, though sanctioned by
                    act of parliament, is no longer trusted to. It is only within these twenty years
                    that a power of selection has existed; till then, the knife alone presented
                    hopes of relief. Now, however, <hi rend="italic">cutting</hi> is often
                    superseded by <hi rend="italic">crushing,</hi> and rightly. Indeed it is a <hi
                    rend="italic">qutestio vexata</hi> among many, as to whether lithotomy or
                    lithotrity be the better adapted for general use; and each has its zealous and
                    uncompromising advocates. As is usual in such cases, we shall probably find that
                    truth lies in the middle, and that both operations must still be employed, each
                    finding cases to which it is peculiarly applicable. Lithotrity was at first a
                    very imperfect art, difficult and complicated in performance, often failing in
                    the attainment of its object, and not seldom followed by the most untoward
                    results. Its practice was likewise in a great measure confined to a particular
                    set of operators, not the best qualified for such undertakings, who, regarding
                    it as a means of gain alone, were not long in bringing discredit on its reckless
                    and indiscriminate use. Thus a great advantage was given to the old operation,
                    over its imprudently managed rival. But the instruments and procedure of
                    lithotrity have of late been greatly improved, and have become, as is usual in
                    such improvements, more easy and simple, and at the same time more effective.
                    They now receive the attention of every well-educated surgeon; the student
                    applies to lithotomy and lithotrity with equal care and attention, and
                    endeavours to perfect himself in the manipulations of both; and in consequence,
                    the latter operation has been rescued from the empirical professor, and placed
                    in the better qualified hands of the regular practitioner. There is not now, as
                    in the time of “the invasion of professed stone-grinders,” some years ago, an
                    indiscriminate performance of one operation, in all cases, simply because the
                    operator knows no other. The circumstances of the case had then very little
                    influence in determining the nature of the operative procedure. If a surgeon was
                    applied to, the knife was recommended; and “if the patient fell into the hands
                    of the professed stone-grinder, he was certain, under all circumstances, of
                    being subjected to the hammering and boring processes.” Now, application being
                    made to the regular practitioner, at least in the first instance, he, equally
                    acquainted with either mode of operating, conscientiously advises the one which
                    circumstances require, either operating himself, or employing one whom he may
                    consider more dexterous and equally skilful. Lithotrity can only be safely
                    performed by those “who understand well the healthy anatomy of the urethra and
                    bladder; who are acquainted with their sympathies, vital actions, and
                    pathological changes; and who understand and practise the treatment of their
                    deranged functions.” And by such it is now performed, in the cases to which it
                    is applicable. In patients above the age of puberty, when the symptoms have not
                    been of very long duration, when the stone has been ascertained not to exceed a
                    chestnut in size, when the urethra is free from contraction, when the bladder is
                    capacious, tolerably healthy in its coats, and free from irritability of its
                    lining membrane, and when the individual is of an easy, patient disposition;
                    under a combination of such circumstances, lithotrity is the preferable
                    operation; in other cases, lithotomy. It is thus apparent, that possibly
                    lithotrity may in time almost entirely supersede lithotomy in the adult; all
                    that is necessary being, that the patient apply to a well-qualified surgeon at
                    the very commencement of his ailments. But until wisdom shall pervade mankind to
                    this extent, very many cases must occur in which the old operation, well
                    performed, is much to be preferred; and this need not be greatly regretted, for
                    the actual difference between the two operations as to pain and danger is not so
                    great as is generally supposed.</p>
                <p>The simple instrument of two branches, as made by the Messrs Weiss, has
                    superseded all the more complicated and less effective apparatus for lithotrity;
                    as also Cooper’s forceps for removal of small stones by the urcthra. The
                    instrument having been introduced into the bladder, tolerably distended, is
                    brought in contact with the stone; its blades are opened, and the stone brought
                    between, great care being taken that the mucous membrane is uninjured; the
                    blades are then approximated by the screw, and the interposed stone crushed more
                    or less completely. When the stone is single, small, and friable, one such
                    proceeding will suffice: if not, the fragments are seized and bruised in
                    succession, either at the time, or at one or more subsequent sittings. The
                    screw-power is preferred to that of the hammer, as equally efficient and more
                    safe, not endangering the twisting or breaking of the instrument. Diluents are
                    freely exhibited, to promote and facilitate passage of the detritus with the
                    urine. Should the pain and irritation thus occasioned prove severe, opiates,
                    blood-letting, and hot bathing, may be required. But, in general, if the case
                    have been judiciously selected, and the operation skilfully performed, the
                    subsequent irritation will be but slight; and after a few days, examination of
                    the bladder may be resumed, to ascertain whether or not all the fragments have
                    been extruded. This exploration cannot be too minute and careful, for the
                    greatest stumbling-block to the advancement of lithotrity in the confidence of
                    the profession, has been the uncertainty as to whether or not the bladder has by
                    such proceedings been completely freed from every fragment, it being well known
                    that but a very small portion of foreign matter remaining will become the
                    nucleus of further deposit, and speedily re-establish the disease. The advantage
                    of lithotomy is, that, for final exploration of the bladder, it has the finger,
                    which, if at all experienced, can seldom be deceived. Lithotrity has but the
                    sound for the same purpose, and must endeavour to make patience, dexterity, and
                    care, compensate for the inferiority of the instrument.</p>
                <p>But when the stone is large, and has been long resident in the bladder, this
                    viscus has its cavity contracted, its coats fasciculated, and its surface
                    irregular, affording receptacles for the fragments, from which the most careful
                    manipulations may not dislodge them. Besides, such a bladder will not bear the
                    annoyance of instruments often introduced; indeed the mere change of a tolerably
                    smooth stone into angular fragments, may be sufficient to excite even fatal
                    disturbance of the viscus and of the system. In all such cases, therefore,
                    lithotomy is the preferable operation; it<pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:chi.28490924&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=988" xml:id="kp-eb0720-0988-0842"/>
                    not only insures, with common care, complete removal of the source of
                    irritation, but also, by suspending the functions of the diseased viscus, gives
                    it the advantage of rest, as well as the relief caused by loss of blood from the
                    neighbouring vessels. Even when the bladder is tolerably sound, a large stone of
                    ordinary consistence is unfavourable to lithotrity; for the fragments must also
                    be large, until after much manipulation; and attempts to pass such fragments
                    must be attended with much pain and some danger. The immediate result of
                    lithotrity in such cases is, “like the partial delivery of a pregnant woman,”
                    very unsatisfactory. The fragments may become firmly impacted in the urethra,
                    causing retention of urine, and all its direful consequences. When this happens,
                    and the impacted portion will not yield to an attempt to push it again into the
                    bladder, it must at once be reached and removed by incision in the mesial line;
                    and then the surgeon may take the opportunity of extending the wound a little
                    farther, and with his finger and a scoop effectually clear the bladder of all
                    remaining detritus. Lithotrity is scarcely applicable to young subjects; the
                    parts are not sufficiently capacious, the patient is too restless, and the
                    concretion, usually of oxalate of lime, is too hard to be easily pulverized.
                    This is the less to be regretted, as in them well-performed lithotomy seldom if
                    ever proves unfortunate. Among them, therefore, and “those of mature age who are
                    so foolish or so ill informed as to permit the stone to attain an inordinate
                    bulk,” lithotomy must still prevail. It is an operation certainly more alarming
                    to the patient, and to the surgeon may be more difficult and perplexing; but
                    when dexterously and skilfully executed, we doubt much if its average risk
                    exceeds, or even equals, that of promiscuous lithotrity; its efficiency is
                    indisputably greater. The mode of operation pursued by Mr Liston, the most
                    dexterous, elegant, and successful lithotomist of the present day, is similar to
                    the method of Cheselden. For its details we beg to refer to Mr Liston’s late
                    work on Practical Surgery, where the modern lithotriteur is also minutely
                    described. He attributes much of his success to limited incision of the
                    prostate, so as to preserve the internal cellular tissue of the pelvis from
                    infiltration of urine; and to the insertion of a gum elastic tube in the wound,
                    so as to afford a free exit to the urine, and diminish the risk of its poisonous
                    infiltration, while at the same time it facilitates the arresting of
                    haemorrhage, should this occur. “The operation of lithotomy,” says he, “if
                    performed in the easy and simple method recommended, is effected with much less
                    pain than is supposed; it is completed, with perfect safety, in a short space of
                    time, and offers very favourable results. It is, however, an operation which
                    ought never to be undertaken without due consideration of all the circumstances
                    that may arise; and the surgeon who does undertake it must have resources within
                    himself to meet with and overcome difficulties in all the various stages of the
                    proceeding.”</p>
                <p>In the treatment of stricture of the urethra, all armed bougies have been laid
                    aside, in favour of the plain metallic catheter and bougie. The milder cases are
                    easily overcome. A plated steel bougie, selected of such a size as will with no
                    great difficulty pass the constricted part, is gently insinuated along the
                    urethra. After three or four days, the introduction is repeated. Then at each
                    farther re-introduction, at an interval of a few days, the size of the
                    instrument is gradually increased, until it completely fills the orifice; a sign
                    that sufficient distention of the canal has been achieved. After this, it is
                    right to pass the last instrument occasionally, at long intervals, to counteract
                    any tendency towards return of the contraction. Soft pliable bougies may
                    sometimes be useful for mere exploration of the canal, but are not of much use
                    otherwise; it being difficult to guide their points, or ascertain the exact
                    direction which they assume. During the cure, the state of the urine should be
                    strictly attended to; for its acridity—one of the causes of stricture—may, by
                    irritation of the urethra, materially retard the progress. Should the bougie
                    cause serious irritation of the urethra, as sometimes happens, the interval
                    between its introductions must be increased, allowing the painful effects of
                    each to subside before another is attempted, else much more harm than good will
                    accrue from the use of the instrument. For the penetration of tight unyielding
                    strictures, a firm silver catheter is the most appropriate instrument, its size
                    being proportioned to the extent of contraction. For very obvious reasons, great
                    caution must be observed in its use; steady, cautious, patient, and gentle
                    pressure, in the right direction, must never be superseded by sudden and daring
                    force, or irreparable mischief may ensue. “Lightness of hand, and gentleness of
                    manipulation, will often enable a surgeon to overcome difficulties which to
                    others may have proved insuperable. The operation of introducing a catheter
                    through what has been called an impermeable stricture, is without doubt the most
                    difficult in the whole range of surgical practice, and demands all the prudence,
                    science, and skill of a master. The art can only be acquired, and that
                    gradually, by frequent practice.” When the stricture is very tight, and has
                    afforded much opposition to the passage of the catheter, and more particularly
                    when the operation has been undertaken on account of retention of urine, it is
                    well to retain the instrument secured in the strictured part for twenty-four or
                    eight and forty hours. The cure is thus much expedited, as well as recurrence of
                    the retention prevented. The presence of the foreign body in the stricture calls
                    up a natural effort for its extrusion, resulting in relaxation of the part, with
                    profuse discharge; and so remarkable is the dilatation thus effected, that on
                    withdrawing the instrument at the end of the time already specified, it is found
                    “lying quite loose” in the passage, although at its introduction it had been
                    grasped most tightly, and firmly fixed in the stricture. Immediately after its
                    withdrawal, a much larger instrument can usually be introduced with ease, and
                    the cure is then proceeded with as in ordinary cases. Sometimes the parts so
                    strenuously resist the presence of the foreign body, that it is prudent to
                    remove the instrument in less time than we have mentioned. Under no
                    circumstances should it be retained beyond two days. It becomes coated with
                    calculous deposit; and, besides, there is danger of its irritation proving
                    excessive; ulceration may take place in the urethra, or abscess form along its
                    course.</p>
                <p>Thus the worst possible stricture may be overcome, and the urethra restored to
                    its healthy functions and dimensions. But, as already said, prudence and
                    experience are inseparable from the safe use of the small catheter; with them,
                    it is a most valuable instrument, and saves many a patient now-a-days who would
                    otherwise have become the victim of cruel and dangerous operation. It is seldom,
                    indeed, that we now hear of puncture of the bladder, even by the rectum, a
                    proceeding at one time so common here, as to be known as “the Edinburgh
                    operation.” And we as seldom hear of the catheter producing tears and wounds of
                    the urethra, followed by abscess and fistula, or urinary infiltration ending in
                    the death of the patient, or at least in the destruction of a large portion of
                    his genital integument and cellular tissue. When from any cause urine has
                    escaped into the cellular tissue of the perineum, free and deep incision, so as
                    to afford ready escape to the poisonous fluid, cannot be too early resorted to.
                    Should it happen that the surgeon, notwithstanding skill and perseverance, is
                    foiled in passing the catheter, and relieving distention, then, instead of
                    puncturing the bladder, the preferable procedure is to “make a free opening in
                    the perineum, directly upon the obstructed part; to cut upon the end of the
                    catheter, carrying the knife forwards; to open the dilated portion of the
                    urethra, and then to pass the catheter on to the bladder.” Thus the viscus is
                    relieved, and a sure commence-<pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:chi.28490924&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=989" xml:id="kp-eb0720-0989-0843"/>
                    ment made of the cure of the stricture, while no permanent inconvenience ensues,
                    as after puncture of any part of the bladder. In passing the catheter to relieve
                    retention caused by prostatic disease, it should never be forgotten that the
                    urethra is in such cases much elongated, and that in consequence the instrument
                    ought to be three or four inches longer than those in ordinary use. The
                    treatment of the enlargement of that gland is entirely palliative; nor can
                    proposals for its removal by operation be ranked among the modern
                    improvements.</p>
                <p>Diseases and injuries of the windpipe are better understood, and more
                    successfully treated, than formerly. In the latter, the surgeon is less
                    meddlesome, and his patient is benefited accordingly. In wounds of the throat it
                    was formerly the custom, after having secured the larger arterial branches, to
                    proceed at once to closure of the wound, dragging it together by stitches and
                    plasters, and covering all by lint and bandage, as if the principal object were
                    to conceal the horrid gash from view. The consequence was, that the blood which
                    continued to ooze, finding no ready outlet externally, collected in the
                    air-passages, and suffocated the patient, provided, as was most probable, he had
                    not at the time sufficient energy for forcible expectoration; or if this danger
                    was escaped, it was shortly succeeded by one equally imminent, closure of the
                    windpipe at the injured part, from inflammatory swelling of the wound. Now the
                    intelligent surgeon is less precipitate; he knows the danger of the old system,
                    and avoids it by treating cut throat on the same principles as he would an
                    ordinary wound, making no approximation until all oozing has ceased, and then
                    only drawing together the corners, trusting the centre to the more gentle
                    apposition by bending the head forward, and by bandage retaining the chin
                    approximated to the top of the sternum. Thus a free outlet is left to the
                    discharges which must form; for the transverse nature of the wound, and the
                    constant motion of its edges in respiration and deglutition, render union by the
                    first intention impossible. Immediate risks are thus avoided; and if the
                    patient’s energy prove sufficient, the wound will gradually close by
                    granulation. But in general, at least in attempted suicides, a low fever ensues,
                    against which all efforts toward cure are unavailing. The patient should be kept
                    in a comfortably warm and equable temperature, and the fore part of the neck
                    should be protected by some loose covering, that the inspired air may be, as
                    nearly as possible, of the same temperature as in natural respiration. Thus the
                    occurrence of bronchitis is so far obviated; and so long as air passes through
                    the wound, no other dressing need be applied. When the pharynx is involved in
                    the wound, nourishment is given from time to time through a tube introduced by
                    the mouth; not through the wound, lest contraction of the tracheal opening
                    should be interfered with, and its edges cicatrize separately, leaving the
                    patient in a very miserable plight. Sometimes respiration becomes obstructed by
                    swelling of the mucous membrane and accumulation of viscid mucus, so as to
                    endanger suffocation, and render it necessary to open the windpipe
                    longitudinally below the obstructed part. In injuries of the interior of the
                    throat, tracheotomy is also sometimes necessary. When the glottis has been
                    injured, for example, by the swallowing of acids, or hot water, or by the
                    inhalation of steam, should the ordinary active treatment fail to arrest the
                    urgent symptoms, tracheotomy must be had recourse to without delay, otherwise
                    the patient will perish, either by immediate suffocation, or by effusion
                    consequent on imperfect pulmonary circulation. A simple blow on the larynx may
                    so completely paralyze the parts, as to render opening of the windpipe necessary
                    for restoring the respiration. And the operation is also required when foreign
                    bodies have lodged in the air-passages, and cannot be expelled by expectoration.
                    If allowed to remain, they are productive of the greatest annoyance; perhaps
                    suffocation is immediate; and if they do not speedily induce inflammatory action
                    of the most serious nature, they are certain ultimately to occasion phthisis, or
                    other chronic disease of fatal tendency. If the foreign body is loose, it will
                    be spontaneously ejected from the opening; if fixed, it must be dislodged by
                    forceps.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>A most
                    interesting case of foreign body in the bronchus, successful removed by
                    operation, is detailed by Mr Liston, in his Practical Surgery, p.
                    371.</p></note></p>
                <p>In diseases of the air-passages, tracheotomy often becomes necessary, on account
                    of obstruction at the top of the windpipe preventing free entrance of air into
                    the lungs. In acute inflammatory affections, croup, for example, it is seldom
                    admissible. In the early stage, “whilst active antiphlogistic remedies are
                    indicated, and considered likely to afford relief, it could not with propriety
                    be proposed; in the latter 6tages, after lymph has formed, when the lungs are
                    gorged, and effusion has commenced at the base of the brain, no good purpose can
                    be answered by an operation.” Sometimes, in adults, a favourable opportunity for
                    the operation may be selected between these stages, but it is seldom. To the
                    chronic affections the operation is more applicable. Even in phthisis laryngea,
                    the most intractable of these, advantage may be derived from it when performed
                    at an early period; the diseased parts above the opening are set at rest, and an
                    opportunity is afforded of making direct application, through the wound, of the
                    suitable remedies to the ulcerated surface. But it is in oedema of the glottis,
                    whether as a primary affection, or supervening on previous disease, that its
                    beneficial results are most frequent and most apparent; the patient is at once
                    relieved from impending suffocation; the swollen parts are put to rest, and in
                    time subside; and after a while they so far recover their healthy condition, as
                    to admit of closure of the wound and re-establishment of the natural course of
                    respiration. In all cases where opening of the windpipe is required, whether on
                    account of accident or disease, tracheotomy is preferable to laryngotomy, and
                    though a little more difficult, is equally safe in performance. An opening in
                    the cricod membrane will not always suffice for detection and removal of a
                    foreign body; and being placed in the ordinary site of laryngeal disease, will
                    usually fail to afford relief when undertaken on that account. The incisions in
                    tracheotomy are made very carefully, so that stray vessels may be pushed aside
                    in safety; the trachea is pierced during the act of deglutition, when the larynx
                    is elevated and the windpipe elongated; a silver tube is immediately introduced,
                    of calibre proportioned to the object in view, and of such a form as to prevent
                    oozing from the wound by compression of the edges. After a short time all
                    irritation from the presence of the tube ceases; but during the whole cure great
                    attention must be paid that it be kept clear of the vitiated mucus. It should
                    also be protected by some loose covering, in the same manner and for like
                    reasons as in cases of cut throat In the treatment of all affections of the
                    throat, the possibility of tracheotomy becoming requisite should always be kept
                    in view; and the curative applications should consequently be confined as much
                    as possible to the sides of the neck, leaving the fore part free, otherwise much
                    difficulty may be thrown in the way of the operator.</p>
                <p>The treatment of diseases of the rectum has become simplified and improved along
                    with the rest of surgery. “Many attempts have been made to mystify the subject
                    of diseases of this region, and to separate them in a great measure from general
                    surgery. There is no such difficulty as has been supposed in understanding their
                    nature; the principles<pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:chi.28490924&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=990" xml:id="kp-eb0720-0990-0844"/>
                    which should guide their management are simple, and the means, operative and
                    otherwise, easily enough applied.” Of late a variance of opinion has arisen in
                    regard to the treatment after operation on the rectum; one party maintaining
                    that in all cases little or no dressing is required; the other, that in every
                    case stuffing and compression of the wound are essential to the safety of the
                    patient. As is usual when opinions are in extreme opposition, we find that truth
                    occupies a middle place. In some slight cases of operation, for fistula,
                    haemorrhoids, &amp;c., no more dressing is required than what is sufficient to
                    prevent immediate union of the divided parts; while in others, a degree of
                    compression must be made on the divided surface, proportioned to the extent of
                    the incision and the probability of haemorrhage. It would be very unnecessary to
                    cram the wound in the first class of cases; in the second, it would be equally
                    unwise to leave the parts wholly unsupported.</p>
                <p>As the pathology of tumours has become more and more understood, operative
                    procedure has been withdrawn from some and extended to others. Diagnosis having
                    become both more easy and more accurate, we can now readily distinguish between
                    those of a benign and those of a malignant disposition. In regard to the latter,
                    experience has taught us to forbear from operative interference, unless at the
                    very first accession of the disease; for though the more simple tumours, even
                    when of large size and long duration, may be removed with every prospect of
                    permanent cure, yet in those of a malignant nature, immunity from recurrence of
                    the disease can be hoped for only when the removal is very early; when the local
                    affection is still limited and loosely attached; when there is a certainty of
                    being able to remove, not only the morbid structure itself, but some portion of
                    the unaltered tissues which invest it; before any affection of the neighbouring
                    lymphatics can be detected; and before the general system seems to have been
                    permanently involved. Among the more benign tumours, the most remarkable
                    extension of active surgery is in regard to the solid tumours of the jaw. Not
                    long since these formidable formations were looked upon with horror and dread,
                    as one and all of the most malignant tendency, and were consequently left to
                    their own course. But now we have been taught that such is not, and ought not to
                    be, the case; that many doubtless are most malignant, and must not be interfered
                    with; but that others, and sometimes even those of the most formidable
                    appearance, are sufficiently local and apathetic to warrant the adoption of
                    active interference with the most sanguine hopes of success. Both the upper and
                    lower jaws, involved in large and frightful tumours, have of late years been
                    removed by operation; and when the case has been judiciously selected, good
                    success has been invariable. In the soft medullary tumour of the upper jaw,
                    commencing in the antrum, an opportunity warranting interference can seldom
                    occur; for before the morbid formation has appeared externally in the mouth or
                    nose, it has not only completely involved the bone in which it originated, but
                    also included in the diseased mass the palate-bone, the ethmoidal cells, the
                    orbit, and even the sphenoidal sinuses.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Sometimes these tumours commence in the latter situations,
                    and involve the superior maxillary bone secondarily.</p></note> It is only when
                    such a disease, at an early period of its existence, is confined to the antrum,
                    that removal of the superior maxillary bone can be of service; but unfortunately
                    its true nature is seldom discovered until a portion of the tumour has become
                    apparent by the giving way of the parietes; and when that has occurred the case
                    is hopeless for its extension backwards very far exceeds the outward protrusion.
                    In its first stage the prominence of the cheek has the same smooth glistening
                    appearance as in chronic abscess of the antrum; but the parietes of the tumour
                    are hard and unyielding; they soon thin at one or more points, there
                    communicating a pulpy feeling to the finger; and when they have completely given
                    way, the ravages of the disease are as rapid as uncontrollable. The more benign
                    tumour in this situation—originating in the bone, and usually the result of
                    injury—is, on the contrary, slow in its progress and of very firm consistence;
                    its surface is lobulated, and if ulcerated by accident, soon heals again; the
                    internal structure, of a firm fibrous character, is limited by a dense cellular
                    cyst; and the neighbouring bones are either simply displaced, or removed more or
                    less by interstitial absorption; the prosress of the tumour is in consequence
                    almost entirely towards the surface. It is in such cases that the surgeon does
                    not now hesitate to remove the superior maxillary bone; for with it. he knows
                    that he can take the whole diseased formation. It is doubtless a formidable
                    operation, and not unattended with danger; but the risk is insignificant when
                    compared with the ultimate benefit likely to accrue. It is therefore evidently
                    of the highest importance to distinguish accurately these two classes of tumour,
                    the treatment suitable to each being so widely different; in the one case
                    operation is wholly inadmissible, while in the other the sooner it is had
                    recourse to, the greater is the probability of a successful result. Care should
                    also be taken not to confound either with the more simple affection of
                    accumulated fluid in the enlarged antrum; for it has happened that a surgeon,
                    after having made up his mind to attempt removal of the superior maxilla, has,
                    “on trying to divide the connections of that bone, had his hands covered with
                    purulent matter, and himself with shame and confusion.” The same general
                    description applies to tumours of the lower jaw as to those of the upper, with
                    this difference, that the relative position of the former somewhat prolongs the
                    favourable opportunity at which tumours even of malignant tendency may be
                    removed. The medullary tumours are also of much less frequent occurrence; there
                    is no large cavity, like the antrum, in which they may originate, and the great
                    majority consequently come under the denomination of ostco-sarcoma. That very
                    many tumours of the jaws are attributable to disease, or even faulty position,
                    of the teeth, and to unskilful dental operations, is a fact as true as it is
                    important, and should direct both surgeon and patient to greater and more
                    frequent attention to those influential little portions of the osseous system.
                    After the operation on either jaw, an unseemly void of course remains; but
                    nature, assisted occasionally by the dentist, does wonders in repairing this,
                    and the actual deformity is in many cases surprisingly slight.<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>For details of the operation,
                    we again refer to Liston’s Practical Surgery; a work of great value, from the
                    perusal of which both practitioner and student will derive much profit, and to
                    which, we beg to acknowledge, we have been not a little indebted in the course
                    of the present article.</p></note></p>
                <p>In operations for the removal of tumours in the soft parts, we have elsewhere
                    stated that the incisions should be so planned as to divide the principal
                    vessels at the outset, as thus both time and blood are saved. If the vessels
                    implicated are large, temporary pressure on the trunk may be made by the
                    assistant; but it can seldom if ever be necessary to practise a preliminary
                    operation for the securing of that trunk by ligature. In most cases the
                    dissection of the tumour should be made as rapidly as is consistent with the
                    safety of important parts in the neighbourhood. But when the tumour is suspected
                    of a malignant tendency, the duration of the proceeding must not be considered;
                    the dissection must be methodical and deliberate. As it proceeds, the parts must
                    be examined carefully by both the finger and eye; and on its completion, the
                    removed mass must be minutely surveyed, lest any shred of morbid formation be
                    left in the wound. No successful result can be hoped for, un-<pb break="no"

                    less the whole altered structure is completely and freely removed. Another point
                    in regard to operations on tumours ought never to be forgotten, namely, that the
                    most simple and best dispositioned formations may, in the course of time,
                    degenerate into the most malignant and intractable, and therefore should not be
                    exposed to this contingency; they should be early removed, for the merest
                    steatom has, by circumstances, been transformed into the most frightful and
                    deadly fungus.</p>
                <p>Vascular tumours, of erectile tissue, are now safely and efficiently removed by
                    ligature. Formerly they were usually left undisturbed. Sometimes attempts at
                    excision were made, but the results were truly discouraging, the haemorrbage
                    proving most alarming, and not unfrequently fatal. In a mere naevus,
                    obliteration of the vessels may be safely effected by vaccination, pressure,
                    acupuncture, seton, or the application of escharotics. But such treatment is
                    totally inapplicable to the erectile tumours. These, when very small, may be
                    removed by excision; but it is not a safe proceeding, particularly in young
                    patients, to whom loss of blood is of serious consequence. But by ligature,
                    vascular tumours of almost any size and extent are safely removed, by arresting
                    their circulation, and so producing sphacelus of the adventitious structure.
                    When the formation is of a broad base, several ligatures are required, passed
                    beneath the tumour by needles; and when the integument is free, or but slightly
                    involved, it should be reflected by preliminary incision, so that these
                    ligatures may be the more effectually applied. By such procedure, even
                    enlargement of the thyroid gland may be removed. Of course no one would think of
                    attacking the whole tumour on account of the mere deformity; but it sometimes
                    happens that enlargement of the isthmus occasions difficult respiration,
                    congestion of the cerebral vessels, and other alarming symptoms; and in such
                    cases the offending part has been successfully removed by a combination of
                    incision with ligature, using the knife as deeply as the haemorrhage will
                    permit, and then completing the isolation of the lobe by strong ligatures
                    applied by transfixion.</p>
                <p>In the treatment of venereal affections, mercurial supremacy has gradually given
                    way to the influence of common sense, and the disease has consequently become
                    more mild and tractable, particularly in its secondary forms. The primary
                    symptoms are treated as simply local affections, until circumstances prove the
                    contrary, which will be comparatively seldom. When the exhibition of mercury
                    seems advisable, little usually suffices; it is used, not abused as
                    formerly.</p>
                <p>Hydrocele, which was at one time the apology for very severe surgical
                    proceedings, by knife, setons, and escharotics, is now under very simple
                    treatment; the palliative, is mere tapping of the cavity; the permanent,
                    injection of it, after tapping, by some gently stimulating fluid, port wine, for
                    example. But great care must be taken during injection, that none of the fluid
                    enter the cellular tissue of the scrotum, otherwise most violent inflammatory
                    action must ensue in the infiltrated parts.</p>
                <p>Restorative surgery, in former years scarcely attempted, is now making rapid
                    progress towards perfection. Noses are made and repaired most adroitly, not
                    according to the old inconvenient system of the European father of
                    rhinoplastics, but by a modification of the plan practised by the Koomas, a
                    caste of Hindoos, and first introduced into this country by Mr Carpue. This
                    decorative operation has been very successfully practised by Mr Liston, who is
                    the author of an important change in the procedure—not bringing the columna from
                    the forehead, but waiting till the new apex and alae so obtained are
                    consolidated, and then fashioning a column out of the upper lip.<note

                    the whole thickness of the lip, and in its application is not twisted. The
                    mucous membrane, after exposure in its new situation, soon becomes cuticular in
                    both appearance and function.</p></note> By this little operation a more
                    vigorous and substantial support is obtained for the new parts; and, besides,
                    the lip, which formerly hung tumid and pendulous, is at the same time very much
                    improved in appearance. His nasal constructions, he tells us, are scarcely to be
                    distinguished from the natural feature at a little distance, are quite
                    sufficient for the ordinary uses of that organ, and sometimes have been brought
                    to desiderate and enjoy the questionable accomplishment of snuff-taking. He has
                    likewise been very successful in relieving the nose from inconvenient and
                    unseemly encumbrances, produced by lipomatous enlargement of the integument. The
                    excrescence is simply pared off, care being taken not to interfere with the
                    subjacent cartilages. The raw surface usually cicatrizes rapidly, leaving the
                    feature of its natural form and size. By an operation conducted on similar
                    principles as the rhinoplastic, the lower lip is renewed from beneath the chin;
                    the ear, or rather portions of it, from the integument behind; and deficiencies
                    in the urethra can be closed by adaptation of a portion of either tire prepuce
                    or loose neighbouring integument. Such proceedings some may affect to disregard
                    as trivial; but they are not looked upon as such by the unfortunate individuals
                    to whom they are applicable, and really constitute a most interesting and useful
                    department of operative surgery.</p>
                <p>Harelip, one of the most disagreeable of the congenital deficiencies, can be very
                    perfectly remedied, by paring the edges of the fissure, and securing them in
                    close and accurate apposition by two or more points of twisted suture. According
                    to the principles already detailed, no further dressing is applied; and if the
                    patient be otherwise in good health, and the parts protected from external
                    injury, adhesion will seldom or never fail to occur. The most important part of
                    the operation, as regards restoration of the lip’s natural appearance, is
                    complete removal, by the paring of the rounded margins where the membrane that
                    covers the edge of the fissure joins the true prolabium. If this be not attended
                    to, the operation is imperfect, for a most unseemly notch remains in the lip; in
                    fact, the fissure is merely diminished, not obliterated. But when these rounded
                    portions are completely removed, and the operation is in other respects well
                    conducted, a mere line of cicatrization is all that remains of the
                    deformity.</p>
                <p>Club-foot, a most inconvenient as well as unseemly malformation, is remedied in
                    children by simple means; merely applying the necessary retentive apparatus,
                    until the parts become fixed in the normal position in which that apparatus
                    places them. Now, the cure is extended even to the adult; and very many varous
                    feet, formerly regarded as irremediable, are restored to usefulness and
                    symmetry, at the cost of but slight pain and inconvenience. The first part of
                    the treatment is to sever the tendo Achillis; an operation simple in
                    performance, and seldom if ever followed by any untoward results. A narrow knife
                    or lancet-shaped needle is introduced obliquely through the integument, beneath
                    the tendon, and at a little distance from it on one side; “by directing the edge
                    against the resisting fibres, the foot being kept powerfully extended by au
                    assistant, the object can he effected with scarcely a perceptible external
                    wound, and with the escape of only a drop or two of blood.” The foot is then
                    placed in the desired position, and retained so by the suitable apparatus, for
                    the necessary period; the foot becomes both “useful and ornamental and the space
                    between the separated ends of the divided tendon is, after no long time, firmly
                    and completely occupied by <hi rend="italic">a</hi> new formation, of tendinous

                    similar operation has been for some time in practice in the veterinary
                    profession. It was first performed on the human body by the continental
                    surgeons. After dividing the tendon, they again brought the retracted ends
                    together, and retained them in apposition until partial reunion took place,
                    when, by gradual extension, the new formation was elongated to the extent
                    necessary for the adjustment of the foot. This method, however, is both more
                    tedious and more painful than the one already described; and by either, the
                    repair is equally substantial and efficient. In some cases of the deformity, the
                    bones are either so deficient in original development, or so firmly secured in
                    their malposition, as to be irremediable even by such means. But, as already
                    stated, there are very many cases, both of simple extension of the foot, and of
                    that complicated with inversion, in which this little operation, well seconded
                    by the care of the machinist, will be followed with success almost equal to the
                    most sanguine hopes of both surgeon and patient.</p>
                <p>We have thus briefly sketched the subjects which naturally occur to us, as the
                    most prominent examples of the modern advancement of surgery. It were easy to
                    swell the list. But our assigned limits have already been attained, if not
                    exceeded; and enough has probably been said, both to convey a general idea of
                    the improvement recently effected in this profession, and to encourage a hope
                    that such progress will still continue, year after year, bringing the practice
                    of this useful, enlightened, and noble art, closer to perfection. (c. D.)</p>
