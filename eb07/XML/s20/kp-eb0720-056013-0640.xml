                <p><label type="entry">STANHOPE, <hi rend="smallcaps">Phillip Dormer</hi></label>,
                    the fourth <hi rend="smallcaps">Earl. of Chesterfield,</hi> was born at London,
                    on the 22d of September 1694. He was the son of Philip, the third earl, by his
                    wife, Lady Elizabeth Savile, daughter of George, marquis of Halifax. At the age
                    of eighteen he was sent to Trinity Hall, Cambridge, where he studied
                    assiduously, and, according to his own account, became an absolute pedant. In
                    1714 he quitted the university, and travelled on the continent, where a
                    familiarity with good company soon convinced him he was totally mistaken in
                    almost all his notions; and an attentive study of the air, manner, and address
                    of people of fashion, soon polished a man whose prominent de sire was to please,
                    and who, as it afterwards appeared, valued exterior accomplishments beyond any
                    other human acquirement. While Lord Stanhope, he obtained an early seat in
                    parliament; and in 1722, succeeded to his father’s estate and titles. In 1728,
                    and in 1745, he was appointed ambassador extraordinary and plenipotentiary to
                    Holland. This high character he supported with the greatest dig nity, serving
                    his own country, and gaining the esteem of the States-General. Upon his return
                    from Holland, he was sent as lord-lieutenant of Ireland; and during his
                    administration there, gave general satisfaction to all parties. He left Dublin
                    in 1746, and in October succeeded the earl of Harrington as secretary of state,
                    in which post he officiated un til February 6, 1748. In 1752, being seized with
                    a deafness which incapacitated him for the pleasures of society, he from that
                    time led a private and retired life, amusing himself with books and his pen; in
                    particular, he engaged largely as a volunteer in a periodical miscellaneous
                    paper called <hi rend="italic">The World,</hi> in which his contributions have a
                    distinguished degree of excellence. He died on the 24th of March 1773, leaving a
                    character for wit and abilities that had few equals. He distinguished himself by
                    his eloquence in parliament on many important occasions, of which we have a
                    characteristic instance of his own relating. He was an active promoter of the
                    bill for altering the style; and on this occasion, as he himself writes in one
                    of his letters to his son, he made so eloquent a speech in the house, that every
                    one was pleased, and said he had made the whole very clear to them, “when,”<pb
                    break="no" facs="ht:chi.28490924&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=641"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0720-0641-0561"/> says he, “God knows, I had not even attempted it.
                    I could just as soon have talked Celtic or Sclavonian to them, as astronomy; and
                    they would have understood me full as well.” Lord Macclesfield, who was
                    considered as a great mathematician, and who had a principal hand in framing the
                    bill, spoke afterwards, with all the clearness that a thorough knowledge of the
                    subject could dictate; but not having a flow of words equal to Lord
                    Chesterfield, the latter gained the applause which was more justly due to the
                    former. The high character which Lord Chesterfield supported during life,
                    received no small injury soon after his death, from a fuller display of it by
                    his own hand. He left no issue by his lady, Melosina de Schulenburg, countess of
                    Walsingham; but he had a natural son, Philip Stanhope, Esq., whose edu cation
                    was for many years a close object of his attention, and who was afterward envoy
                    extraordinary at the court of Dres den, but died before him. After Lord
                    Chesterfield’s death, Mr. Stanhope’s widow published a series of letters,
                    written by the father to the son, filled with instructions suitable to the
                    different gradations of the young man’s life to whom they were addressed. These
                    letters contain many fine ob servations on mankind, and rules of conduct; but it
                    is observable that he lays a greater stress on exterior accomplishments and
                    address than on intellectual qualifications and sincerity; and allows a much
                    greater latitude to fashion able pleasures than good morals will justify. These
                    Letters to his Son, so discreditable to the memory of the writer, appeared in
                    1774, in 2 vols. 4to. This publication was followed by a collection of his
                    Miscellaneous Works, 1777, 2 vols. 4to. A third volume was added in 1778; but
                    his lord ship’s works do not appear to have attracted much attention.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Stanhope, Charles</hi>, Earl Stanhope, born in 1753, was the
                    eldest son of Philip, the second earl, a man equally remarkable for his
                    mathematical talents, and his liberal political opinions. The subject of this
                    notice succeeded to the peerage in 1786, and died in 1816. By his first marriage
                    he became the brother-in-law of Pitt; and on the mother’s side he was closely
                    allied to the Scotish earls of Haddington. This eccentric but public-spirited
                    and most inventive man, while he divided his attention among a variety of
                    inquiries, sufficient to have prevented excellence in any, had the rare merit of
                    excelling in several most important pursuits, while in more than one he has
                    bequeathed to the world discoveries that have proved most extensively useful. In
                    politics he was a decided Whig, an assertor of religious toleration, and of
                    nonintervention in the internal affairs of foreign states. Sometimes, however,
                    he carried out the principles of his party with a boldness which other minds
                    scrupled to follow; and in the latter years of his parliamentary life, Earl
                    Stanhope used to be called “the minority of one.” His political works were a
                    refutation of Price’s scheme of the sinking fund, an answer to one of Burke’s
                    invectives on the French Revolution, and an essay on juries. But his inventions
                    in mechanical science are those by which he has secured the gratitude of
                    posterity. They are too many to be here so much as completely enumerated. The
                    principal of them, the Stanhope press, has been described in our article <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Ρrinting,</hi> where notice has also been taken of his
                    exertions for improving the process of stereotype. He was an early student of
                    Franklin’s theory of electricity, to which he contributed several valuable
                    observations. Another of his most useful inventions was one for improving the
                    locks of canals; and more cu rious ones were his two calculating machines, one
                    of which performed addition and subtraction, the other multiplication and
                    division.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Stanhope</hi>, <hi rend="italic">George,</hi> an eminent
                    divine, was born at Hertishorn in Derbyshire, in the year 1660. His father was
                    rector of that parish, vicar of St. Margaret’s at Leices ter, and chaplain to
                    the earls of Chesterfield and Clare. His grandfather, Dr. George Stanhope, was
                    chaplain to James I. and Charles I.; had the chancellorship of York, where he
                    was also a canon residentiary, held a prebend, and was rector of Weldrake in
                    that county. For his loyalty he was driven from his home with eleven children,
                    and died in 1664. The son was sent to school, first at Uppingham in Rutland,
                    then at Leicester; he was afterwards removed to Eton, and thence chosen to
                    King’s College in Cambridge, in the place of W. Cleaver. He took the degree of
                    A. B. in 1681, and of A. M. in 1685; was elected one of the syndics for the
                    university of Cambridge, in the business of Alban Francis, 1687; minister of
                    Quoi near Cambridge, and vice-proctor, 1688. He was that year preferred to the
                    rectory of Tringin Hertfordshire, which after some time he quitted. In 1689 he
                    was presented to the vicarage of Lewisham in Kent by Lord Dartmouth, to whom he
                    had been chaplain, as well as tutor to his son. He was also appointed chaplain
                    to King William and Queen Mary, and continued to enjoy that honour under Queen
                    Anne. He commenced D. D. July 5, 1697, performing all the exercises required to
                    that degree publicly and with great applause. He was made vicar of Deptford in
                    1703; succeeded Dr. Hooper as dean of Canterbury the same year; and was thrice
                    chosen prolocutor of the lower house of convocation. His uncommon diligence and
                    industry, assisted by his excellent parts, enriched him with a large stock of
                    polite, solid, and useful Iearning. His discourses from the pulpit were equally
                    pleasing and profitable; a beautiful intermixture of the clearest reasoning with
                    the purest diction, attended with all the graces of a just elocution. In him
                    were happily united the good Christian, the solid divine, and the fine
                    gentleman. His conversation was polite and delicate, grave without precise ness,
                    facetious without levity. His piety was real and rational, his charity great and
                    universal, fruitful in acts of mercy and in all good works He died March 18,
                    1728, aged sixty-eight years; and was buried in the chancel of the church at
                    Lewisham. The dean was twice married; first to Olivia Cotton, by whom he had one
                    son and four daughters. His second lady, who was sister to Sir Charles Wager,
                    survived him, dying October 1, 1738, aged about fifty-four. One of the dean’s
                    daughters was married to a son of Bishop Burnet. Dr. Moore, bishop of Ely, died
                    the day before Queen Anne; who, it has been said, designed the dean for that see
                    when it should become vacant. “The late Dean of Canterbury,” says Dr. Felton,
                    “is excellent in the whole. His thoughts and reasoning are bright and solid. His
                    style is just, both for the purity of the language and for the strength and
                    beauty of expression; but the periods are formed in so peculiar an order of the
                    words, that it was an observation, nobody could pronounce them with the same
                    grace and advantage as himself." His writings, which are considered as a
                    treasure of piety and devotion, are, A Paraphrase and Comment upon the Epistles
                    and Gospels. 1705, 4 vols. 8vo. Sermons at Boyle’s Lectures. 1706, 4to. Fifteen
                    Sermons. 1700, 8vo. Twelve Sermons on Several Occasions. 1727, 8vo. A

                    Andrews, with Additions, 1730. In his translations, it is well known, Dr.
                    Stanhope did not confine himself to a strict and literal version; he took the
                    liberty of paraphrasing, explaining, and improving upon his author, as will
                    evidently appear (not to mention any other work) by the slightest perusal of St.
                    Augustin’s Meditations, and the Devotions of Bishop Andrews.</p>
