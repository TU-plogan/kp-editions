                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra

                    >Taisch,</hi> is a mode of seeing superadded to that which nature generally
                    bestows. This gift or faculty, which is neither voluntary nor constant, is in
                    general rather troublesome than agreeable to the possessors of it, who are
                    chiefly to be found among the inhabitants of the Highlands of Scotland, those of
                    the Western Isles, of the Isle of Man, and of Ireland. It is an impression made
                    either by the mind upon the eye, or by the eye upon the mind, by which things
                    distant or future are perceived, and seen as if they were present. A man on a
                    journey far from home falls from his horse; another, who is perhaps at work
                    about the house, sees him bleeding on the ground, commonly with a landscape of
                    the place where the accident befalls him. Another seer, driving home his cattle,
                    or wandering in idleness, or musing in the sunshine, is suddenly surprised by
                    the appearance of a bridal ceremony, or funeral procession, and counts the
                    attendants or mourners, of whom, if he knows them, he relates the names, but if
                    he knows them not, he can describe the dresses. Things distant are seen at the
                    instant they happen.</p>
                <p>Of things future, Johnson says that he knows no rule pretended to for determining
                    the time between the sight and the event; but we are informed by Mr Grose, that
                    in general the time of accomplishment bears some relation to the time of the day
                    in which the impressions are received. Thus visions seen early in the morning,
                    which seldom happens, will be much sooner accomplished than those appearing at
                    noon; and those seen at noon will take place in a much shorter time than those
                    happening at night. Sometimes the accomplishment of the latter does not fall out
                    within a year or more.</p>
                <p>These visions are not confined to solemn or important events, nor is it true, as
                    is commonly reported, that to the second sight nothing is presented but phantoms
                    of evil. The future visit of a mountebank or a piper, a plentiful draught of
                    fish, the arrival of common travellers, or, if possible, still more trifling
                    matters than these, are foreseen by the seers. A gentleman told Dr Johnson, that
                    when he had once gone far from his own island, one of his labouring servants
                    predicted his return, and described the livery of his attendant, which he had
                    never worn at home, and which had been, without any previous design,
                    occasionally given him.</p>
                <p>Dr Beattie of Aberdeen gives the following account of this imaginary gift. The
                    Highlands of Scotland are a picturesque but a melancholy country. Long tracts of
                    mountainous desert, covered with dark heath, and often obscured by misty
                    weather; narrow valleys, thinly inhabited, and bounded by precipices resounding
                    with the fall of torrents; a soil so rugged, and a climate so dreary, as in many
                    parts to admit neither the amusements of pasturage nor the labours of
                    agriculture; the mournful dashing of waves along the friths and lakes that
                    intersect the country; the portentous noises which every change of the wind and
                    every increase or diminution of the waters is apt to raise in a lonely region
                    full of echoes and rocks and caverns; the grotesque and ghastly appearance of
                    such a landscape by the light of the moon; objects like these diffuse a gloom
                    over the fancy, which may be compatible enough with occasional and social
                    merriment, but cannot fail to tincture the thoughts of a native in the hour of
                    silence and solitude. If these people, notwithstanding their reformation in
                    religion, and more frequent intercourse with strangers, do still retain many of
                    their old superstitions, we need not doubt but in former times they must have
                    been much more enslaved to the horrors of imagination, when beset with the
                    bugbears of Popery and Paganism. Most of their superstitions are of a melancholy
                    cast. That of Second Sight, by which some are still supposed to be haunted, is
                    considered by themselves as a misfortune, on account of the many dreadful images
                    it is said to obtrude upon the fancy. It is said that some of the Alpine regions
                    do likewise lay claim to a sort of second sight. Nor is it wonderful, that
                    persons of a lively imagination, immured in deep solitude, and surrounded with
                    the stupendous scenery of clouds, precipices, and torrents, should<pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:chi.28490924&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=85" xml:id="kp-eb0720-0085-0071"/>
                    dream, even when they think themselves awake, of those few striking ideas with
                    which their lonely lives are diversified; of corpses, funeral processions, and
                    other subjects of terror; or of marriages, the arrival of strangers, and such
                    like matters of more agreeable curiosity.</p>
                <p>Let it be observed, also, that the ancient Highlanders of Scotland had hardly any
                    other way of supporting themselves than by hunting, fishing, or war, professions
                    which are continually exposed to fatal accidents; and hence, no doubt,
                    additional horrors would often haunt their solitude, and a deeper gloom
                    overshadow the imagination even of the hardiest native.</p>
                <p>A treatise on this subject was published in the year 1762, in which many tales
                    were told of persons whom the author believed to have been favoured, or haunted,
                    with these illuminations; but most of the tales were trifling and ridiculous,
                    and the whole work betrayed, on the part of the compiler, the most extreme
                    credulity.</p>
                <p>That any of these visionaries are apt to be swayed in their declarations by
                    sinister views, we will not say; but this may be alleged with confidence, that
                    none but ignorant people pretend to be gifted in this way; and in them it may be
                    nothing more, perhaps, than short fits of sudden sleep or drowsiness, attended
                    with lively dreams, and arising from some bodily disorder, the effect of
                    idleness, low spirits, or a gloomy imagination. For it is admitted, even by the
                    most credulous Highlanders, that as knowledge and industry are propagated in
                    their country, the second sight disappears in proportion; and nobody ever laid
                    claim to the faculty who was much employed in the intercourse of social life.
                    <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> Nor is it at all extraordinary that one should
                    have the appearance of being awake, and should even think one’s self so, during
                    those fits of dozing; that they should come on suddenly, and while one is
                    engaged in some business. The same thing happens in persons much fatigued, or
                    long kept awake, who frequently fall asleep for a moment, or for a long space,
                    while they arc standing, or walking, or riding on horseback. Add but a lively
                    dream to this slumber, and take away the consciousness of having been asleep,
                    and a superstitious man may easily mistake his dream for a waking vision; which,
                    however, is soon forgotten when no subsequent occurrence recalls it to his
                    memory, but which, if it shall be thought to resemble any future event, exalts
                    the poor dreamer into a Highland prophet. This conceit makes him more recluse
                    and more melancholy than ever, and so feeds his disease, and multiplies his
                    visions, which, if they are not dissipated by business or society, may continue
                    to haunt him as long as he lives, and which, in their progress through the
                    neighbourhood, receive some new tinctures of the marvellous from every mouth
                    that promotes their circulation. As to the prophetical nature of this second
                    sight, it cannot be admitted at all. That the Deity should work a miracle in
                    order to give intimation of the frivolous things of which these tales are
                    composed, the arrival of a stranger, the nailing of a coffin, or the colour of a
                    suit of clothes; and that these intimations should be given for no end, and to
                    those persons only who are idle and solitary, who speak Gaelic, or who live
                    among mountains and deserts; is like nothing in nature or providence that we are
                    acquainted with, and must therefore, unless it were confirmed by satisfactory
                    proof, be rejected as absurd and incredible.</p>
                <p>To these objections Dr Johnson replies, that by presuming to determine what is
                    fit and what is beneficial, they presuppose more knowledge of the universal
                    system than man has attained, and therefore depend upon principles too
                    complicated and extensive for our comprehension; that there can be no security
                    in the consequence when the premises are not understood; that the second sight
                    is only wonderful because it is rare, for, considered in itself, it involves no
                    greater difficulty than dreams, or perhaps than the regular exercise of the
                    cogitative faculty; that a general opinion of communicative impulses, or
                    visionary representations, has prevailed in all ages and among all nations; that
                    particular instances have been given, with such evidence as neither Bacon nor
                    Bayle has been able to resist; that sudden impressions, which the event has
                    verified, have been felt by more than own or publish them; that the second sight
                    of the Hebrides implies only the local frequency of a power which is nowhere
                    totally unknown; and that where we are unable to decide by antecedent reason, we
                    must be content to yield to the force of testimony. By the pretension to second
                    sight, no profit was ever sought or gained. It is an involuntary affection, in
                    which neither hope nor fear are known to have any part. Those who profess to
                    feel it do not boast of it as a privilege, nor are considered by others as
                    advantageously distinguished. They have no temptation to feign, and their
                    hearers have no motive to encourage the imposture.</p>
