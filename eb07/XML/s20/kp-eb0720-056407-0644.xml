                    knowledge have made it necessary to introduce into physicoathematical science.
                    It was found convenient to distribute the doctrines of universal mechanics into
                    two classes, which required both a different mode of consideration and different
                    principles of reasoning.</p>
                <p>Till the time of Archimedes little science of this kind was possessed by the
                    ancients, from whom we have received the first rudiments. His investigation of
                    the centre of gravity, and his theory of the lever, are the foundations of our
                    know ledge of common mechanics; and his theory of the equilibrium of floating
                    bodies contains the greatest part of our hydrostatical knowledge. But it was as
                    yet limited to the simplest cases; and there were some in which Archimedes was
                    ignorant, or was mistaken. The marquis Guido Ubaldi, in 1578, published his
                    theory of mechanics, in which the doctrines of Archimedes were well explained
                    and consider ably augmented. Stevinus, the celebrated Dutch engineer, published
                    about twenty years after an excellent system of mechanics, containing the chief
                    principles which now form the science of equilibrium among solid bodies. In
                    particu<pb break="no" facs="ht:chi.28490924&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=645"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0720-0645-0565"/> lar, he gave the theory of inclined planes, which
                    was un known to the ancients, though it is of the very first importance in
                    almost every machine. He even states in the most express terms the principle
                    afterwards made the foundation of the whole of mechanics, and published as a
                    valuable dis covery by Varignon, viz. that three forces, whose directions and
                    intensities are as the sides of a triangle, balance each other. His theory of
                    the pressure of fluids, or hydrostatics, is no less estimable, including every
                    thing that is now received as a leading principle in the science. When we con
                    sider the ignorance, even of the most learned of that age, in mechanical or
                    physicomathematical knowledge, we must consider these performances as the works
                    of a great genius; and we regret that they are so little known, being lost in a
                    crowd of good writings on those subjects which appeared soon after.</p>
                <p>Hitherto the attention had been turned entirely to equilibrium, and the
                    circumstances necessary for producing it. Mechanicians indeed saw, that the
                    energy of a machine might be somehow measured by the force which could be
                    opposed or overcome by its intervention: but they did not remark, that the force
                    which prevented its motion, but did no more than prevent it, was an <hi
                    rend="italic">exact</hi> measure of its energy, because it was in immediate
                    equilibrio with the pressure exerted by that part of the machine with which it
                    was connected. If this opposed force was less, or the force acting at the other
                    extremity of the machine was greater, the mechanicians knew that the machine
                    would move, and that work would be performed; but what would be the rate of its
                    motion or its performance, they hardly pretended to conjecture. They had not
                    studied the action of moving forces, nor conceived what was done when motion was
                    communicated.</p>
                <p>The great Galileo opened a new field of speculation in his work on local motion.
                    He there considers a change of motion as the indication and exact and adequate
                    measure of a moving force; and he considers every kind of pressure as competent
                    to the production of such changes. He contented himself with the application of
                    this principle to the motion of bodies by the action of gravity, and gave the
                    theory of projectiles, which remains to this day without change, and only
                    improved by considering the changes which are produced in it by the resistance
                    of the air.</p>
                <p>Sir Isaac Newton took up this subject nearly as Galileo had left it. For, if we
                    except the theory of the centrifugal forces arising from rotation, and the
                    theory of pendulums, published by Huygens, hardly any thing had been added to
                    the science of motion. Newton considered the subject in its utmost extent; and
                    in his mathematical principles of natural philosophy he considers every
                    conceivable variation of moving force, and determines the motion resulting from
                    its action. His first application of these doctrines was to explain the
                    celestial motions; and the magnificence of this subject caused it to occupy for
                    a while the whole attention of the mathematicians. But the same work contained
                    pro positions equally conducive to the improvement of common mechanics, and to
                    the complete understanding of the mechanical actions of bodies. Philosophers
                    began to make these applications also. They saw that every kind of work which is
                    to be performed by a machine may be considered abstractedly as a retarding
                    force; that the impulse of water or wind, which are employed as moving powers,
                    act by means of pressures which they exert on the impelled point of the machine;
                    and that the machine itself may be considered as an assemblage of bodies
                    moveable in certain limited circum stances, with determined directions and
                    proportions of velo city. From all these considerations resulted a general
                    abstract condition of a body acted on by known powers. And they found, that
                    after all conditions of equilibrium were satisfied, there remains a surplus of
                    moving force. They could now state the motion which will ensue, the new
                    resistance which this will excite, the additional power which this will absorb;
                    and they at last determined a new kind of equilibrium, not thought of by the
                    ancient mechanicians, be tween the resistance to the machine performing work and
                    the moving power, which exactly balance each other, and is indicated, not by the
                    <hi rend="italic">rest,</hi> but by the <hi rend="italic">uniform motion</hi> of
                    the machine. In like manner, the mathematician was enabled to calculate that
                    precise motion of water which would completely absorb, or, in the new language,
                    balance the superiority of pressure by which water is forced through a sluice, a
                    pipe, or canal, with a constant velocity.</p>
                <p>Thus the general doctrines of motion came to be considered in two points of view,
                    according as they balanced each other in a state of rest or of uniform motion.
                    These two ways of considering the same subject required both different
                    principles and a different manner of reasoning. The first has been named <hi
                    rend="italic">statics,</hi> as expressing that rest which is the test of this
                    kind of equilibrium. The second has been called <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Dynamics</hi> or <hi rend="smallcaps">Universal Mechanics,</hi> because the
                    different kinds of motion are characteristic of the powers or forces which
                    produce them. A knowledge of both is indispensably necessary for acquiring any
                    useful practical know ledge of machines; and it was ignorance of the doctrines
                    of accelerated and retarded motions which made the pro gress of practical
                    mechanical knowledge so very slow and imperfect. The mechanics, even of the
                    moderns, before Galileo, went no further than to state the proportion of the
                    power and resistance which would be balanced by the intervention of a given
                    machine, or the proportion of the parts of a machine by which two known forces
                    may balance each other. This view of the matter introduced a principle, which
                    even Galileo considered as a mechanical axiom, viz., that <hi rend="italic">what
                    is gained in force by means of a machine is exactly compensated by the
                    additional time which it obliges us to employ.</hi> This is false in every
                    instance, and not only prevents improvement in the construction of machines, but
                    leads us into erroneous maxims of construction. The true principles of dynamics
                    teach uβ, that there is a certain pro portion of the machine, dependent on the
                    kind and proportion of the power and resistance, which enables the machine to
                    perform the greatest possible work.</p>
                <p>It is highly proper therefore to keep separate these two ways of considering
                    machines, that both may be improved to the utmost, and then to blend them
                    together in every practical discussion.</p>
                <p>Statics therefore are preparatory to the proper study of mechanics; but they do
                    not hence derive all their importance. They are the sole foundation of many
                    useful parts of know ledge. This will be best seen by a brief enumeration.</p>
                <p>1. They comprehend all the doctrines of the excitement and propagation of
                    pressure through the parts of solid bodies, by which the energies of machines
                    are produced. A pressure is exerted on the impelled point of a machine, such as
                    the float-boards or buckets of a millwheel. This excites a pressure at the
                    pivots of its axle, which act on the points of support. This must be understood,
                    both as to direction and intensity, that it may be effectually resisted. A
                    pressure is also excited at the acting tooth of the cogwheel on the same axle,
                    by which it urges round another wheel, exciting similar pressures on its pivots,
                    and on the acting t∞th perhaps of a third wheel. Thus a pressure is ultimately
                    excited in the working point of the machines, perhaps a wiper which lifts a
                    heavy stamper, to let it fall again on some matter to be pounded. Now statics
                    teach us the intensities and direction of all those pressures, and therefore how
                    much re mains at the working point of the machine unbalanced by resistance.</p>
                <p>2. They comprehend every circumstance which influences the stability of heavy
                    bodies; the investigation and proper ties of the centre of gravity; the theory
                    of the construction of arches, vaults, and domes; the attitudes of animals.<pb
                    break="no" facs="ht:chi.28490924&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=646"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0720-0646-0566"/> , 3. The strength of materials, and the
                    principles of con struction, so as to make the proper adjustment of strength and
                    strain in every part of a machine, edifice, or structure of any kind. Statics
                    therefore furnish us with what may be called <hi rend="italic">a theory of
                    carpentry,</hi> and give us proper instructions for framing floors, roofs,
                    centres, &amp;c.</p>
                <p>4. Statics comprehend the whole doctrine of the pressure of fluids, whether
                    liquid or aeriform, whether arising from their weight or from any external
                    action. Hence therefore we derive our knowledge of the stability of ships, or
                    their power of maintaining themselves in a position nearly up right, in
                    opposition to the action of the wind on the sails. We learn on what
                    circumstances of figure and stowage this quality depends, and what will augment
                    or diminish it.</p>
