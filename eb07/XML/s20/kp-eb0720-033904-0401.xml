                    between Austria and Prussia. In ancient times, it was inhabited by two rude
                    tribes, called the Lygiern and the Quadi, who were subdued in the sixth century
                    by the Sclavonians, by which it became subject to Poland. Their manners and
                    language, as well as the Christian religion, were introduced by the conquerors.
                    The first bishopric was founded in 966, at Schmogen, from whence it was
                    subsequently removed to the city of Breslau.<pb break="no"

                    In the year 1138, Boleslaus the III., regent of Poland, divided his states
                    amongst his sons, and gave over to his eldest, Wladislaus, Silesia, with some
                    other estates, and the greatest authority in the government. His brothers,
                    however, conspired against him, and succeeded in expelling him from the country.
                    The three brothers divided the land into portions to each, who thus became the
                    founders of the three dukedoms of Silesia, belonging to the race of the Piastis.
                    As the progeny of these dukes multiplied, their respective portions were
                    subdivided, and thus gave rise to the great number of principalities of which
                    the country consists. Besides these, there were other princes, especially in
                    Upper Silesia, who were the descendants of Ottohar, king of Bohemia, who died in
                    1278, after establishing the dukes of Troppau, Jagendorf, and Raliber. When king
                    John had succeeded to the throne of Bohemia, he was anxious to unite all the
                    power in his own hands, under the pretext of restoring tranquillity to the
                    country, which had been weakened by internal quarrels and hostility He was so
                    far enabled to succeed, in 1327, in persuading the several princes to receive
                    their lands as a feud from him, that two only of the whole number, the prince of
                    Jauer, and the prince of Schweidnitz, declined compliance. In the next reign,
                    when John was succeeded by his son, the emperor Charles IV. of Germany, these
                    two principalities came into his possession by marriage; and Silesia was thus
                    formed into one dukedom, in connexion with the kingdom of Bohemia, in the year
                    1355. At this time, the king of Poland relinquished all claim over Silesia, and
                    renewed his renunciation by a subsequent treaty in 1372.</p>
                <p>Under the Bohemian monarchy, the religious tenets of Huss, Luther, Calvin, and
                    Swenkfeld, spread themselves over the whole country, and the adherents to them
                    were, under some restrictions, permitted to exercise their own forms of
                    worship.</p>
                <p>In 1498, a kind of constitution was imparted to the country, which, whilst it
                    gave consistency to it as a whole, lessened the power of the nobility, and
                    increased that of the king, Wladislaus, who then filled the throne. Under him,
                    as well as under his predecessors, since the Polish renunciation, the language
                    and manners of the Poles were gradually exchanged for those of the Germans, and
                    industry, and commerce, and with them, the arts and sciences, were gradually
                    extended. They, however, received a severe check by the persecution of the
                    protestants which was barbarously carried on by the successive princes of the
                    house of Austria. The tremendous scourge of religious and civil war extended
                    from Bohemia to Silesia.</p>
                <p>The peace of Westphalia gave tranquillity to the country, for though that treaty
                    was less productive of religious toleration in the dominions of Austria, than in
                    the other divisions of Germany, yet a degree of it was allowed to the
                    protestants, though with imperfect securities for its continuance. Under that
                    house, however, to which it passed, in the early part of the sixteenth century,
                    it was tolerably prosperous; manufactures were introduced, the land was well
                    cultivated, and a degree of ease enjoyed by the inhabitants, to which their
                    ancestors had been utter strangers.</p>
                <p>After a century of increasing advancement, Silesia became the theatre of a
                    tremendous war. The death of the emperor Charles VI., when the throne devolved
                    on a female, revived a long dormant and certainly fictitious claim to the
                    western part of Silesia, by Frederick of Prussia, commonly surnamed the great.
                    No justification of his conduct could be made; indeed, in his memoirs his
                    ambition is avowed. He and Bavaria made attacks on Austria on each side, which
                    received some aid both from England and France. The contest was carried on with
                    alternate success, and terminated by the cession of Silesia to Prussia. But the
                    proud house of Austria had no intention of definitively relinquishing such a
                    valuable province. A war commenced in 1756, when France, Saxony, Russia, and
                    Sweden, formed an alliance against Prussia, which brought the king and his
                    country to the brink of ruin, from which it was saved by the talents of the
                    monarch, and some aid from England. After seven years of hostilities, the peace
                    of Hubertsburg was concluded in 1763, by which Silesia was finally settled under
                    the government of Frederick, and has remained subject to his successors to the
                    present time.</p>
                <p>Prussian Silesia, according to its present limits, (for a portion of Silesia is
                    still retained by Austria,) extends in north latitude, from 49° 49' to 52° 1';
                    and in east longitude, from 14° 20' to 19° 17', and comprehends 15,945 square
                    miles. It is bounded on the north-west by Brandenburg, on the north-east by
                    Posen, on the east by Poland, on the south-east by Cracow and Galicia, on the
                    south by Moravia, and on the south-west by Bohemia.</p>
                <p>It is divided into the governments, taking their names from the cities where the
                    administrative boards are fixed, viz. Breslau, Oppeln, and Liegnitz. In these,
                    are 186 cities and towns, and 5355 villages and hamlets. It is the most densely
                    peopled of any portion of the Prussian dominions; and it appeared by the census
                    of 1831, that the number of inhabitants was 2,464,413; the births exceeding the
                    deaths at the rate of 100,000 annually. Nearly one half the inhabitants are
                    Catholics, the others are chiefly Lutherans, with about four or five thousand
                    Calvinists, some Menonites, Hussites, and Hernhutters, and about 17,000 Jews.
                    Each of these sects have their establishments for education, and a University in
                    Breslau, open to all, without distinction of religious opinions.</p>
                <p>The river Oder runs from south to north, and divides the province into two parts
                    of different character, as to the face of the country. On the east, it presents
                    a flat sandy plain of rather a sterile appearance. On the eastern or German
                    side, the land is rather mountainous, presenting much variety of scenery, with a
                    good soil, though intermixed with extensive tracts of sandy land.</p>
                <p>In the part of the province where it touches on Bohemia is a mountainous range,
                    some of whose peaks are very lofty. The Reisenkoppe is 4950 feet, the Grasse-Rad
                    4070, and several others above 4000.</p>
                <p>The state of agriculture is much improved, and the land produces a sufficiency,
                    in some years a surplus, of corn, consisting chiefly of rye, with about
                    one-fifth as much wheat. The cultivation of flax is. however, the employment to
                    which the greatest skill is directed, and in some years 17,000,000 pounds have
                    been raised, the greater part of which was used in the manufactures of the
                    province. Tobacco, fruit, and culinary vegetables are abundant, and in the
                    southern part, some moderate wine is made. The mines are considerable, and yield
                    still a little gold and silver, and abundance of copper, lead, iron, calamine,
                    arsenic, vitriol, sulphur, zinc, and cobalt. This country has been long
                    celebrated for its manufactures of fine linen; their shirtings are exquisite,
                    both for strength and fineness, and no other table linen has yet been made that
                    can rival theirs. Of late years the cotton trade has been introduced, and is
                    increasing. The chief commerce is in manufactures, and the exportation of pitch,
                    tar, and turpentine. The imports of foreign goods reach them by the way of the
                    Oder from Stettin, or by the Elbe from Hamburg.</p>
                <p>Breslau, the capital, contains 90,000 inhabitants.</p>
                <p>The portion of Silesia left to Austria by the peace of Hubertsburg, has been
                    incorporated with Moravia, and makes a part of the government of Bran. It is
                    formed into the following circles, viz. Teschen, Bielitz, Freudenthal,
                    Freistadt, Friedeck, Deutchleuthen, Reschenwaldau, and Roy, each named from the
                    chief city of the district.</p>
                <p>It is bounded by Prussian Silesia, by Galicia, by Moravia, and Hungary. It
                    comprises 27 cities, 4 towns, and 646 villages, with about 380,000 inhabitants.
                    The country is<pb break="no" facs="ht:chi.28490924&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=403"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0720-0403-0341"/> mountainous; the Carpathian range is partly on
                    the eastern side of it, and the Moravian on the west. Much of the land is very
                    productive in corn, pasture, and wood. The people are mostly of Sclavonian
                    origin, and speak the Polish language more than the German. In the city of
                    Bielitz are manufacturers of woollen goods, and in all parts linen is made from
                    flax grown near them, which is both good and abundant. There are good grammar
                    schools in Teschen, Troppau, and Weisswassen.</p>
