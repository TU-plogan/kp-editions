                <p><label type="entry">SIDNEY, <hi rend="smallcaps">Sir Philip</hi></label>, was
                    born, as is supposed, at Penshurst in Kent, in the year 1544. His father was Sir
                    Henry Sidney, an Irish gentleman, and his mother, Mary, the eldest daughter of
                    John Dudley, Duke of Northumberland. He was sent, when very young, to
                    Christ-Church College at Oxford, but left the university at seventeen to set out
                    on his travels. After visiting France, Germany, Hungary, and Italy, he returned
                    to England in 1575, and was next year sent by Queen Elizabeth, as her ambassador
                    to Ro-dolph, the Emperor of Germany. On his return he visited Don John of
                    Austria, governor of the Netherlands, by whom he was received with great
                    respect. In 1579, when Queen Elizabeth seemed on the point of concluding her
                    long projected marriage with the Duke of Anjou, Sir Philip wrote her a letter,
                    in which he dissuaded her from the match with unusual elegance of expression,
                    and great force of reasoning. About this time a quarrel with the Earl of Oxford
                    occasioned his withdrawing from court; during which retirement he is supposed to
                    have written his celebrated romance called Arcadia,</p>
                <p>In 1585, after the Queen’s treaty with the United States, he was made governor of
                    Flushing and master of the horse. Here he distinguished himself so much both by
                    bis courage and his conduct, that his reputation rose to the highest pitch. He
                    was named, it is said, by the republic of Poland as one of the competitors for
                    that crown, and might even have been elected, had it not been for the
                    interference of the queen. But his illustrious career was soon terminated; for
                    being wounded at the battle of Zutphen, he was carried to Arnheim, where he died
                    on the 15th of October 1586. His body was brought to London, and buried in St.
                    Paul’s cathedral. He is described, by the writers of that age, as the most
                    perfect model of an accomplished gentleman that could be formed even by the
                    wanton imagination of poetry or of fiction. Virtuous conduct, polite
                    conversation, heroic valour, and elegant erudition, all concurred to render him
                    the ornament and delight of the English court; and as the credit which he
                    enjoyed with the queen and the Earl of Leicester was wholly employed in the
                    encouragement of genius and liter ature, his praises have been transmitted with
                    advantage to posterity. No person was so low as not to become an object of his
                    humanity. After the battle of Zutphen, whilst he was lying on the field mangled
                    with wounds, water was brought him to relieve his thirst; but observing a
                    soldier in a like miserable condition, looking wistfully towards him, he
                    resigned it to him, saying, “This man’s necessity is still greater than mine.”
                    Besides his Arcadia, he wrote a discourse on Poetry, and some other pieces both
                    in prose and verse, which have been published. There is a complete edition of
                    his works in three volumes octavo, Lond. 1725.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sidney</hi>, <hi rend="italic">Algernon,</hi> was the second
                    son of Robert Earl of Leicester, and Dorothy, eldest daughter of the Earl of
                    Northumberland. He was born in 1617. During the civil wars he took part against
                    the king, and distinguished himself as a colonel in the army of the parliament.
                    He was afterwards appointed one of King Charles’s judges, but declined appearing
                    in that court. During the usurpation of Cromwell, Sidney, who was a violent
                    republican, retired to the country, and spent his time in writing those
                    discourses on government which have been so de servedly celebrated. After the
                    death of the Protector, he again took part in the public transactions of his
                    country, and was abroad on an embassy to Denmark when Charles was restored. Upon
                    this he retired to Hamburg, and afterwards to Frankfort, where he resided till
                    1677, when he returned to England and obtained from the king a pardon. It has
                    been affirmed, but the story deserves no credit, that, during his residence
                    abroad, Charles hired ruffians to assassinate him. After his return he made
                    repeated attempts to procure a seat in parliament, but all of them proved
                    unsuccessful. After the intention of the Commons to exclude the Duke of York
                    from the throne had been defeated by the sudden dissolution of parliament,
                    Sidney joined with eagerness the councils of Russel, Essex, and Monmouth, who
                    had resolved to oppose the duke’s succession by force of arms. Frequent meetings
                    were held at London; whilst at the same time, a set of subordinate conspirators,
                    who were not, however, admitted into their confidence, met and embraced the most
                    desperate resolutions. Keiling, one of these men, discovered the whole
                    conspiracy; and Algernon Sidney, together with his noble associates, was
                    immediately thrown into prison, and no art was left unattempted to involve them
                    in the guilt of the meanest conspirators.</p>
                <p>Howard, an abandoned nobleman, without a single spark of virtue or honour, was
                    the only witness against Sidney; but as the law required two, his discourses on
                    government, found unpublished in his closet, were construed into treason, and
                    declared equivalent to another witness. It was in vain for Sidney to plead that
                    papers were no legal evidence; that it could not be proved they were written by
                    him; and that if they were, they contained nothing treasonable. The defence was
                    overruled; he was declared guilty, condemned, and executed on Towerhill,
                    December 7,1678. His attainder was reversed in the first year of William
                    III.</p>
                <p>He was a man of extraordinary courage, steady even to obstinacy, and of a sincere
                    but rough and boisterous temper. Though he professed his belief in the Christian
                    religion, he was an enemy to an established church, and even, according to
                    Burnet, to every kind of public worship. In his principles he was a zealous
                    republican. Government was always his favourite study; and his essays on that
                    subject are a proof of the progress which he made. His Treatise on Government,
                    and some other pieces, with memoirs of his life, were published by Thomas
                    Holles, in 1763, in a quarto volume.</p>
