                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra

                <p><label type="entry">SIMSON, <hi rend="smallcaps">Dr. Robert</hi></label>,
                    professor of mathematics in the university of Glasgow, was born in the year
                    1687, of a respectable family, which had held a small estate in the county of
                    Lanark for some generations. He was, we think, the second son of the family. A
                    younger brother was professor of medicine in the university of St. Andrews, and
                    is known by some works of reputation, particularly a <hi rend="italic"
                    >Dissertation on the Nervous System,</hi> occasioned by the dissection of a
                    brain completely ossified.</p>
                <p>Dr. Simson was educated in the university of Glasgow under the eye of some of his
                    relations who were professors. Eager after knowledge, he made great progress in
                    all his studies; and, as his mind did not, at the very first openings of
                    science, strike into that path which afterwards so strongly attracted him, and
                    in which he proceeded so far almost without a companion, he acquired in every
                    walk of science a stock of information, which, though it had never been much
                    augmented afterwards, would have done credit to a professional man in any of his
                    studies. He became at a very early period, an adept in the philosophy and
                    theology of the schools, was able to supply the place of a sick relation in the
                    class of oriental languages, was noted for historical knowledge, and one of the
                    most accomplished botanists of his time.</p>
                <p>It was during his theological studies, as preparatory for his entering into
                    orders, that mathematics took hold of his fancy. He used to tell in his
                    convivial moments how he amused himself when preparing his exercises for the
                    divinity hall. When tired with vague speculation, in which he did not meet with
                    certainty to reward his labours, he turned up a book of oriental philology, in
                    which he found something which he could discover to be true or to be false,
                    without going out of the line of study which was to be of ultimate use to him.
                    Sometimes even this could not relieve his fatigue. He then had recourse to
                    mathematics, which never failed to satisfy and refresh him. For a long while he
                    restricted himself to a very moderate use of the cordial, fearing that he would
                    soon exhaust the small stock which so limited and abstract a science could
                    yield; till at last he found, that the more he learned, a wider field opened to
                    his view, and scenes that were inexhaustible. Becoming acquainted with subjects
                    far beyond the elements of the science, and with numbers of names celebrated
                    during that period of ardent research all over Europe, he found it to be a manly
                    and important study, by which he was as likely to acquire reputation as by any
                    other. About this time, too, a prospect began to open of making mathematics his
                    profession for life. He then gave himself up to it without reserve.</p>
                <p>His original incitement to this stuoy as a treat, as something to please and
                    refresh his mind in the midst of more severe tasks, gave a particular turn to
                    his mathematical studies, from which he never could afterwards deviate.
                    Perspicuity and elegance are more attainable, and more discernible, in pure
                    geometry, than in any other parts of the science of measure. To this therefore
                    he chiefly devoted himself. For the same reason he preferred the ancient mode of
                    studying pure geometry, and even felt a dislike to the Cartesian method of
                    substituting symbols for operations of the mind, and still more was he disgusted
                    with the substitution of symbols for the very objects of discussion, for lines,
                    surfaces, solids, and their affections. He was rather disposed, in the solution
                    of an algebraical problem, where quantity alone was considered, to substitute
                    figure and its affections for the algebraical symbols, and to convert the
                    algebraic formula into an analogous geometrical theorem. And he came at last to
                    consider algebraic analysis as little better than a kind of mechanical knack, in
                    which we proceed without ideas of any kind, and obtain a result without meaning,
                    and without being conscious of any process of reasoning, and therefore without
                    any conviction of its truth. And there is no denying, that if genuine
                    unsophisticated taste alone is to be consulted, Dr. Simson was in the right; for
                    though it must also be acknowledged, that the reasoning in algebra is as strict
                    as in the purest geometry of Euclid or Apollonius, the expert analyst has little
                    perception of it as he goes on, and his final equation is not felt by himself as
                    the result of ratiocination, any more than if he had obtained it by Pascal’s
                    arithmetical mill. This does not in the least diminish our admiration of the
                    algebraic analysis; for its almost boundless grasp, its rapid and certain
                    procedure, and the delicate metaphysics and great address which may be displayed
                    in conducting it. Such, however, was the ground of the strong bias of Dr.
                    Simeon’s mind to the analysis of the ancient geometers. It increased as he went
                    forward; and his veneration for the ancient geometry was carried to a degree of
                    idolatry. His chief labours were exerted in efforts to restore the works of the
                    ancient geometers; and he has nowhere bestowed much pains in advancing the
                    modern discoveries in mathematics. The noble inventions, for example, of
                    fluxions and of logarithms, by which our progress in mathematical knowledge, and
                    in the useful application of this knowledge, is so much promoted, attracted the
                    notice of Dr. Simson; but he has contented himself with demonstrating their
                    truth on the genuine principles of the ancient geometry. Yet was he thoroughly
                    acquainted with all the modem discoveries; and there are to be seen amongst his
                    papers, discussions and investigations in the Cartesian method, which show him
                    thoroughly acquainted with all the principles, and even expert in the <hi
                    rend="italic">tours de main,</hi> of the most refined symbolical analysis.<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>In 1732 the writer of tbis
                    article, being then bis scholar, requested him to examine an account which he
                    gave him of what he thought a new curve (a conchoid having a circle for its
                    base.) Dr. Simson returned it next day with a regular list of its leading
                    properties, and the investigation of such as be thought his scholar would not so
                    easily trace. In this hasty scrawl the lines related to the circle were
                    familiarly considered as arithmetical fractions of the radius considered only as
                    unity. This was before Euler published his Arithmetic of the Sines and Tangents,
                    now in universal use.</p></note></p>
                <p>About the age of twenty-five, Dr. Simson was chosen professor of mathematics in
                    the university of Glasgow. He went to London immediately after his appointment,
                    and there formed an acquaintance with the most eminent men of that bright era of
                    British science. Amongst these he always mentioned Captain Halley (the
                    celebrated Dr. Edmund Halley) with particular respect; saying, that he had the
                    most acute penetration, and the most just taste in that science, of any man he
                    had ever known. And, indeed, Dr. Halley has strongly exemplified both of these
                    in his divination of the work of Apollonius <hi rend="italic">de Sectione
                    Spatii,</hi> and the eighth book of his <hi rend="italic">Conics,</hi> and in
                    some of the most beautiful theorems in Sir Isaac Newton’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Principia.</hi> Dr. Simson also admired the wide and masterly steps which
                    Newton was accustomed to take in his investigations, and his manner of
                    substituting geometrical figures for the quantities which are observed in the
                    phenomena of nature. It was from Dr. Simson that the writer of this article had
                    the<pb break="no" facs="ht:chi.28490924&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=420"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0720-0420-0358"/> remark which has been oftener than once repeated
                    in the course of this work, “That the thirty-ninth proposition of the first book
                    of the <hi rend="italic">Principia</hi> was the most important proposition that
                    had ever been exhibited to the physicomathematical philosopher and he used
                    always to illustrate to his more advanced scholars the superiority of the
                    geometrical over the algebraic analysis, by comparing the solution given by
                    Newton of the inverse problem of centripetal forces, in the forty-second
                    proposition of that book, with the one given by John Bernoulli in the Memoirs of
                    the Academy of Sciences at Paris for 1713. We have heard him say, that to his
                    own knowledge Newton frequently investigated his propositions in the symbolical
                    way, and that it was owing chiefly to Dr. Halley that they did not finally
                    appear in that dress. But if Dr. Simson was well informed, we think it a great
                    argument in favour of the symbolical analysis, when this most successful
                    practical artist (for so we must call Newton when engaged in a task of
                    discovery) found it conducive either to dispatch or perhaps to his very
                    progress.</p>
                <p>Returning to his academical chair, Dr. Simson discharged the duties of a
                    professor for more than fifty years, with great honour to the university and to
                    himself.</p>
                <p>It is almost needless to say, that in his prelections he followed strictly the
                    Euclidian method in elementary geometry. He made use of Theodosius as an
                    introduction to spherical trigonometry. In the higher geometry, he prelected
                    from his own Conics, and he gave a small specimen of the linear problems of the
                    ancients, by explaining the properties, sometimes of the conchoid, sometimes of
                    the cissoid, with their application to the solution of such problems. In the
                    more advanced class, he was accustomed to give Napier’s mode of conceiving
                    logarithms, that is, quantities as generated by motion, and Mr. Coats’s view of
                    them, as the sums of ratiunculae; and to demonstrate Newton’s lemmas concerning
                    the limits of ratios, and then to give the elements of the fluxionary calculus;
                    and to finish his course with a select set of propositions in optics, gnomonics,
                    and central forces. His method of teaching was simple and perspicuous, his
                    elocution clear, and his manner easy and impressive. He had the respect, and
                    still more the affection, of his scholars.</p>
                <p>With respect to his studies, we have already informed the reader that they got an
                    early bias to pure geometry, and to the elegant but scrupulous methods of the
                    ancients. We have heard Dr. Simson say, that it was in a great measure owing to
                    Dr. Halley that he so early directed his efforts to the restoration of the
                    ancient geometers. He had recommended this to him, as the most certain way for
                    him, then a very young man, both to acquire reputation, and to improve his own
                    knowledge and taste; and he presented him with a copy of Pappus’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Mathematical collections,</hi> enriched with some of his own
                    notes. The perspicuity of the ancient geometrical analysis, and a certain
                    elegance in the nature of the solutions which it affords, especially by means of
                    the local theorems, soon took firm hold of his fancy, and made him, with the
                    sanguine expectation of a young man, direct his very first efforts to the
                    recovery of this <hi rend="italic">in toto;</hi> and the restoration of Euclid’s
                    <hi rend="italic">Porisms</hi> was the first task to which he set himself. The
                    accomplished geometer knows what a desperate task this was, from the scanty and
                    mutilated account which we have of this work in a single passage of Pappus. It
                    was an ambition which nothing but success could justify in so young an
                    adventurer. He succeeded; and as early as 1718, seemed to have been in complete
                    possession of this method of investigation, which was considered by the eminent
                    geometers of antiquity as their surest guide through the labyrinths of the
                    higher geometry. Dr. Simson gave a specimen of his discovery in 1723, in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Philosophical Transactions;</hi> and after this time he ceased not
                    from his endeavours to recover that choice collection of Porisms which Euclid
                    had collected, as of the most general use in the solution of difficult
                    questions. What some of these must have been, was pointed out to Dr. Simson by
                    the very nature of the general proposition of Pappus, which he has restored.
                    Others were pointed out by the lemmas which Pappus has given as helps to the
                    young mathematician towards their demonstration. And, being thus in possession
                    of a considerable number, their mutual relations pointed out a sort of system,
                    of which these made a part, and the blanks of which now remained to be filled
                    up.</p>
                <p>Dr. Simson, having thus gained his favourite point, had leisure to turn his
                    attention to the other works of the ancient geometers; and the porisms of Euclid
                    now had only an occasional share. The <hi rend="italic">loci plani</hi> of
                    Apollonius was another task which he very early engaged in, and completed about
                    the year 1738. But, after it was printed, he imagined that he had not given the
                    <hi rend="italic">ipsissimae propositiones</hi> of Apollonius, and in the
                    precise spirit and order of that author. The impression lay by him for some
                    years; and it was with great reluctance that he yielded to the entreaties of his
                    mathematical friends, and published the work, in 1746, with some emendations,
                    where he thought he had deviated farthest from his author. He quickly repented
                    of this scanty concession, and recalled what he could of the small number of
                    copies which he had given to the booksellers, and the impression again lay by
                    him for years. He afterwards recorrected the work, and still with some
                    reluctance allowed it to come abroad as the <hi rend="italic">Restitution of
                    Apollonius.</hi> The public, however, had not been so fastidious as Dr. Simson,
                    and the work had acquired great celebrity, and he was now considered as one of
                    the first and the most elegant geometers of the age; for, in the meantime, he
                    had published his <hi rend="italic">Conic Sections,</hi> a work of uncommon
                    merit, whether we consider it as equivalent to a complete restitution of the
                    celebrated work of Apollonius Pergaeus, or as an excellent system of this
                    important part of mathematics. It is marked with the same features as the <hi
                    rend="italic">loci plani,</hi> the most anxious solicitude to exhibit the very
                    text of Apollonius, even in the propositions belonging to the books which had
                    been completely lost. These could be recovered in no other way but by a thorough
                    knowledge of the precise plan proposed by the author, and by taking it for
                    granted that the author had accurately accomplished this plan. In this manner
                    did Viviani proceed in the first attempt which was made to restore the conics of
                    Apollonius; and he has given us a detail of the process of his conjectures, by
                    which we may form an opinion of its justness, and of the probability how far he
                    has attained the desired object. Dr. Simeon’s view in his performance was
                    something different, deviating a little in this one case from his general track.
                    He was not altogether pleased with the work of Viviani, even as augmented by the
                    eighth book added by Halley, and his wish was to restore the ancient original.
                    But, in the meantime, an academical text-book for conic sections was much
                    wanted. He was much dissatisfied with those in common use; and he was not
                    insensible of the advantage resulting from the considerations of these sections,
                    independent of the cone first introduced by Dr. Wallis. He therefore composed
                    this excellent treatise as an elementary book, not to supersede, but to prepare
                    for the study of Apollonius; and accordingly he accommodates it to this purpose,
                    and gives several important propositions in their proper places, expressly as
                    restitutions of Apollonius, whom he keeps constantly in view through the whole
                    work.</p>
                <p>Much about this time, Dr. Simson seriously began to prepare a perfect edition of
                    Euclid’s <hi rend="italic">Elements.</hi> The intimate acquaintance which he had
                    by this time acquired with all the original works of the ancient geometers, and
                    their ancient commentators and critics, encouraged him to hope that he could
                    restore to its original lustre this leader in mathematical science; and the
                    errors which had crept into this celebrated work, and which still remained in
                    it, appeared of<pb break="no" facs="ht:chi.28490924&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=421"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0720-0421-0359"/> magnitude sufficient to merit the most careful
                    efforts for their removal. The <hi rend="italic">data</hi> also, which were in
                    like manner the introduction to the whole art of geometrical investigation,
                    seemed to call more loudly for his amending hand. For it appears that the
                    Saracens, who have preserved to us the writings of the ancients, have contented
                    themselves with admiring these celebrated works, and have availed themselves of
                    the knowledge which they contain; but they have shewn no inclination to add to
                    the stock, or to promote the sciences which they had received. They could not do
                    any thing without the synthetical books of the geometers; but, not meaning to go
                    beyond the discoveries which they had made, they neglected all the books which
                    related to the analytic art alone, and the greatest part of them (about
                    twenty-five out of thirty) have irrecoverably perished. The data of Euclid have
                    fortunately been preserved, but the book was neglected, and the only ancient
                    copies, which are but three or four, are miserably erroneous and mutilated.
                    Fortunately, it is no very arduous matter to reinstate this work in its original
                    perfection. The plan is precise, both in its extent and its method. It has been
                    restored, therefore, with success by more than one author. But Dr. Simson’s
                    comprehensive view of the whole analytical system pointed out to him many
                    occasions for amendment. He therefore made its restitution a joint task with
                    that of the elements. All the lovers of true geometry will acknowledge their
                    obligations to him for the edition of the <hi rend="italic">Elements</hi> and
                    <hi rend="italic">Data</hi> which he published about 1758. The text is corrected
                    with the most judicious and scrupulous care, and the notes are inestimable, both
                    for their information, and for the tendency which they must have to form the
                    mind of the student to a true judgment and taste in mathematical subjects. The
                    more accomplished reader will perhaps be sometimes disposed to smile at the
                    axiom which seems to pervade the notes, “that a work of Euclid must be supposed
                    without error or defect.” If this was not the case, Euclid has been obliged to
                    his editor in more instances than one. Nor should his greatest admirers think it
                    impossible, that in the progress of human improvement, a geometrical truth
                    should occur to one of these latter days, which escaped the notice of even the
                    lynx-eyed Euclid. Such merit, however, Dr. Simson nowhere claims, but lays every
                    blame of error, omission, or obscurity, to the charge of Proclus, Theon, and
                    other editors and commentators of the renowned Grecian.</p>
                <p>There is another work of Apollonius on which Dr. Simson has bestowed great pains,
                    and has restored, as we imagine, <hi rend="italic">omnibus numeris
                    perfectum,</hi> namely, the <hi rend="italic">Sectio Determinata;</hi> one of
                    those performances which are of indispensable use in the application of the
                    ancient analysis. This also seems to have been an early task, though we do not
                    know the date of his labours on it. It did not appear till after his death,
                    being then published along with the great work, the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Porisms</hi> of Euclid, at the expense of the Earl Stanhope, a nobleman
                    intimately conversant with the ancient geometry, and zealous for its reception
                    amongst the mathematicians of the present age. He had kept up a constant
                    correspondence with Dr. Simson on mathematical subjects; and at his death in
                    1768, engaged Mr. Clow, professor of logic in the university of Glasgow, to
                    whose care the Doctor had left all his valuable papers, to make a selection of
                    such as would serve to support and increase his well-earned reputation as the
                    restorer of ancient geometry.</p>
                <p>We have been thus particular in our account of Dr. Simson’s labours in these
                    works, because his manner of execution, whilst it does honour to his inventive
                    powers, and shews his just taste in mathematical composition, also confirms our
                    former assertion, that he carried his respect for the ancient geometers to a
                    degree of superstitious idolatry, and that his fancy, unchecked, viewed them as
                    incapable of error or imperfection. This is distinctly to be seen in the
                    emendations which he has given of the texts, particularly in his editions of
                    Euclid. Not only every imperfection of the reading is ascribed to the ignorance
                    of copyists, and every indistinctness in the conception, inconclusiveness in the
                    reasoning, and defect in the method, is ascribed to the ignorance or mistake of
                    the commentators; but it is all along assumed that the work was perfect in its
                    kind, and that by exhibiting a perfect work, we restore the genuine original.
                    This is surely gratuitous; and it is very possible that it has, in some
                    instances, made Dr. Simson fail of his anxious purpose, and give ns even a
                    better than the original. It has undoubtedly made him fail in what should have
                    been his great purpose, namely, to give the world a connected system of the
                    ancient geometrical analysis, such as would, in the first place, exhibit it in
                    its most engaging form, elegant, perspicuous, and comprehensive; and, in the
                    next place, such as should engage the mathematicians of the present age to adopt
                    it as the most certain and successful conductor in those laborious and difficult
                    researches in which the demands of modem science continually engage them. And
                    this might have been expected, in the province of speculative geometry at least,
                    from a person of such extensive knowledge of the properties of figure, and who
                    had so eminently succeeded in the many trials which he had made of its powers.
                    We might have expected that he would at least have exhibited in one systematic
                    point of view, what the ancients had done in several detached branches of the
                    science, and how far they had proceeded in the solution of the several
                    successive classes of problems; and we might have hoped, that he would have
                    instructed us in what manner we should apply that method to the solution of
                    problems of a more elevated kind, daily presented to us in the questions of
                    physicomathematical science. By this he would have acquired distinguished
                    honour, and science would have received the most valuable improvement. But Dr.
                    Simson has done little of all this; and we cannot say that great helps have been
                    derived from his labours by the eminent mathematicians of this age, who are
                    successfully occupied in advancing our knowledge of nature, or in improving the
                    arts of life. He has indeed contributed greatly to the entertainment of the
                    speculative mathematician, who is more delighted with the conscious exercise of
                    his own reasoning powers, than with the final result of his researches. Yet we
                    are not even certain that Dr. Simson has done this to the extent he wished and
                    hoped. He has not engaged the liking of mathematicians to this analysis, by
                    presenting it in the most agreeable form. His own extreme anxiety to tread in
                    the very footsteps of the original authors, has, in a thousand instances,
                    precluded him from using his own extensive knowledge, that he might not employ
                    principles which were not of a class inferior to that of the question in hand.
                    Thus, of necessity, did the method appear trammelled. We are deterred from
                    employing a process which appears to restrain us in the application of the
                    knowledge which we have already acquired; and, disgusted with the tedious, and
                    perhaps indirect path, by which we must arrive at an object which we see clearly
                    over the hedge, and which we could reach by a few steps, of the security of
                    which we are otherwise perfectly assured. These prepossessions are indeed
                    founded on mistake; but the mistake is such, that all fall into it, till
                    experience has enlarged their views. This circumstance alone has hitherto
                    prevented mathematicians from acquiring that knowledge of the ancient analysis
                    which would enable them to proceed in their researches with certainty, dispatch,
                    and delight. It is therefore deeply to be regretted, that this eminent genius
                    has occupied, in this superstitious palaeology, a long and busy life, which
                    might have been employed in original works of infinite advantage to the world,
                    and honour to himself.</p>
                <p>Our readers will, it is hoped, consider these observations as of general
                    scientific importance, and as intimately connected with the history of
                    mathematics; and therefore as<pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:chi.28490924&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=422" xml:id="kp-eb0720-0422-0360"/>
                    not improperly introduced in the biographical account of one of the most eminent
                    writers on this science. Dr. Simeon claimed our notice as a mathematician; and
                    his affectionate admiration of the ancient analysis is the prominent feature of
                    his literary character. By this he is known all over Europe; and his name is
                    never mentioned by any foreign author without some very honourable allusion to
                    his distinguished geometrical elegance and skill. Dr. James Moor, professor of
                    Greek in the University of Glasgow, no less eminent for his knowledge in ancient
                    geometry than for his professional talents, put the following apposite
                    inscription below a portrait of Dr. Simson: “Geometriam, sub Tyranno barbaro
                    saeva servitute diu squalentem, in libertatem et decus antiquum vindicavit
                    unus.”</p>
                <p>Yet it must not be understood that Dr. Simeon’s predilection for the geometrical
                    analysis of the ancients did so far mislead him as to make him neglect' the
                    symbolical analysis of the present times; on the contrary, he was completely
                    master of it, as has been already observed, and frequently employed it. In his
                    academical lectures to the students of his upper classes, he used to point out
                    its proper province, which he by no means limited by a scanty boundary, and in
                    what cases it might be applied with safety and advantage even to questions of
                    pure geometry. He once honoured the writer of this article with the sight of a
                    very short dissertation on this subject, perhaps the one referred to in the
                    preface to his <hi rend="italic">conic Sections.</hi> In this piece he was
                    perhaps more liberal than the most zealous partizans of the symbolical analysis
                    could desire, admitting <hi rend="italic">p* C as</hi> a sufficient equation of
                    the Conic Sections L=- <hi rend="subscript"> 5</hi>-, where</p>
                <p>L is the <hi rend="italic">latus rectum, x</hi> is the distance of any point of
                    the curve from the focus, <hi rend="italic">p</hi> is the perpendicular drawn
                    from the focus to the tangent in the given point, and <hi rend="italic">c</hi>
                    is the chord of the equicurve circle drawn through the focus. Unfortunately this
                    dissertation was not found amongst his papers. He spoke in high terms of the
                    analytical works of Cotes, and of the two Bernoullis. He was consulted by Mr.
                    Maclaurin during the progress of his inestimable <hi rend="italic">Treatise of
                    Fluxions,</hi> and contributed not a little to the reputation of that work. The
                    spirit of that most ingenious algebraic demonstration of the fluxions of a
                    rectangle, and the very process of the argument, is the same with Dr. Simson’s
                    in his dissertation on the limits of quantities. It was therefore from a
                    thorough acquaintance with the subject, and by a just taste, that he was induced
                    to prefer his favourite analysis, or, to speak more properly, to exhort
                    mathematicians to employ it in his own sphere, and not to become ignorant of
                    geometry, while he successively employed the symbolical analysis in cases which
                    did not require it, and which suffered by its admission. It must be
                    acknowledged, however, that in his later years, the disgust which he felt at the
                    artificial and slovenly employment on subjects of pure geometry, sometimes
                    hindered him from even looking at the most refined and ingenious improvements of
                    the algebraic analysis which occur in the writings of Euler, D’Alembert, and
                    other eminent masters. But, when properly informed of them, he never failed to
                    give them their due praise; and we remember him speaking, in terms of great
                    satisfaction, of an improvement of the infinitesmal calculus, by D’Alembert and
                    D’Lagrange, in their researches concerning the propagation of sound, and the
                    vibration of musical cords.</p>
                <p>And that Dr. Simson was not only master of this calculus and the symbolical
                    calculus in general, but held them in proper esteem, appears from two valuable
                    dissertations to be found in his posthumous works; the one on logarithms, and
                    the other on the limits of ratios. The last, in particular, shows how completely
                    he was satisfied with respect to the solid foundation of the method of fluxions;
                    and it contains an elegant and strict demonstration of all the applications
                    which have been made of the method by its illustrious author to the objects of
                    pure geometry.</p>
                <p>We hoped to have given a much more complete and instructive account of this
                    eminent geometer and his works, by the aid of a person fully acquainted with
                    both, and able to appreciate their value; but an accident has deprived us of
                    this assistance, when it was too late to procure an equivalent. And we must
                    request our readere to accept of this very imperfect account, since we cannot do
                    justice to Dr. Simson’s merit unless almost equally conversant in all the
                    geometry of the ancient Greeks.</p>
                <p>The life of a literary man rarely teems with anecdote; and a mathematician,
                    devoted to his studies, is perhaps more abstracted than any other person from
                    the ordinary occurrences of life, and even the ordinary topics of conversation.
                    Dr. Simson was of this class; and, having never married, lived entirely a
                    college life. Having no occasion for the commodious house to which his place in
                    the university entitled him, he contented himself with chambers, good, indeed,
                    and spacious enough for his sober accommodation, and for receiving his choice
                    collection of mathematical writers, but without any decoration or commodious
                    furniture. His official servant sufficed for valet, footman, and chamber-maid.
                    As this retirement was entirely devoted to study, he entertained no company in
                    his chambers, but in a neighbouring house, where his apartment was sacred to him
                    and his guests.</p>
                <p>Having in early life devoted himself to the restoration of the works of the
                    ancient geometers, he studied them with unremitting attention; and, retiring
                    from the promiscuous intercourse of the world, he contented himself with a small
                    society of intimate friends, with whom he could lay aside every restraint of
                    ceremony or reserve, and indulge in all the innocent frivolities of life. Every
                    Friday evening was spent in a party at whist, in which he excelled, and took
                    delight in instructing others, till increasing years made him less patient with
                    the dulness of a scholar. The card-party was followed by an hour or two
                    dedicated solely to playful conversation. In like manner, every Saturday he had
                    a less select party to dinner at a house about a mile from town. The Doctor’s
                    long life gave him occasion to see the <hi rend="italic">dramatis persona</hi>
                    of this little theatre completely changed, whilst he continued to give it a
                    personal identity; so that, without any design or wish of his own, it became, as
                    it were, his own house and his own family, and went by his name.</p>
                <p>Dr. Simson was of a good stature, with a fine countenance; and even in his old
                    age he had a graceful carriage and manner, and always, except when in mourning,
                    dressed in light coloured clothes. He was of a cheerful disposition; and though
                    he did not make the first advances to acquaintance, had the most affable manner,
                    and strangers were at perfect ease in his company. He enjoyed a long course of
                    uninterrupted health; but toward the close of life suffered from an acute
                    disease, and was obliged to employ an assistant in his professional labours for
                    a few years preceding his death, which happened in 1768, at the age of
                    eighty-one. He left to the university his valuable library, which is now
                    arranged apart from the rest of the books, and the public use of it is limited
                    by particular rules. It is considered as the most choice collection of
                    mathematical books and manuscripts in the kingdom, and many of them are rendered
                    doubly valuable by Dr. Simson’s notes. <hi rend="smallcaps">(b b.b.)</hi></p>
