                <p><label type="entry">SIAM</label>, an extensive kingdom of India beyond the
                    Ganges, situated principally between the 10th and 15th degrees of north
                    latitude, in the heart of the great peninsula between India and China. It is
                    bounded on the north by unknown tracts, that extend as far as Thibet and China;
                    on the south it has the Gulf of Siam and the Malay peninsula; on the east it has
                    ranges of mountains, by which it is separated from Cambodia and Cochin China;
                    and on the west it is bounded by the Burmese dominions. The extent of this
                    kingdom, like many others in the east, appears to have varied with the success
                    of its arms. It formerly was estimated to extend in length three hundred and
                    sixty miles, by three hundred in average breadth; but it has since been
                    contracted by the encroachments of the Burmese within narrower limits. It may be
                    considered as consisting of the extensive valley through which the great river
                    Menan flows, on the banks of which all the principal towns are situated; and it
                    possesses besides a great extent of sea-coast along the Gulf of Siam, which is
                    but thinly inhabited, as the Siamese have an aversion to settle on the
                    sea-coast, from their dread of the Malay pirates. The valley of the Menan is
                    subject to be inundated during the rainy season by the periodical floods of that
                    river, the artificial sites of the villages and the trees being the only objects
                    that rise above the expanse of the waters. It is only this part of the country
                    which is known to Europeans; and it is an extensive flat, consisting of alluvial
                    land, with many extensive morasses, from which the exhalations under a tropical
                    sun are noxious to Europeans, causing fluxes, dysenteries, and acute fevers. In
                    those tracts which are beyond the reach of the inundations, the country is
                    parched and dried up.</p>
                <p>The country is described by those who composed the British embassy which
                    accompanied Mr. Crawfurd to Siam in 1822, as rich and fertile in a high degree,
                    and possessing extensive commercial resources. This is almost entirely owing to
                    the peculiar fertility of the soil, very little of the merit being due to native
                    industry, except in the formation of canals. It is to the overflowing of the
                    river Menan and its numerous tributaries, that this fertility is owing. The
                    country yields the most abundant crops of rice and of other plants, which
                    require a redundant supply of moisture. Wheat is also reared on the higher
                    grounds, but not in any great quantity, so that it requires to be imported for
                    the use of the Europeans who reside here. All the richer productions of the
                    tropical climates would also thrive in the same place; but there is little
                    industry amongst the people, who are depressed by the tyranny of their rulers,
                    and have no encouragement to cultivate the country. There is no country in the
                    world where all sorts of fruits, the most luscious and exquisite, arrive at
                    greater perfection. The pine-apple, the tamarind, and the banana, abound in
                    Siam. Of the mangoes, there are not less than thirty species, all excellent; and
                    so is also the coffee plant. The sugar cane grows to perfection, though only for
                    home consumption; for the rude natives do not possess the art of refining it.
                    The areka and the betel-nut are produced; the latter is exported in considerable
                    quantities by the Portuguese in their ships, and also in Chinese junks. Pepper,
                    on the other hand, is not reared to nearly the same extent as in Java. The
                    cocoa-nut is a great resource to the indolent Siamese. It is applied to numerous
                    uses; its milk seasons many of the dishes, and the oil affords an excellent
                    seasoning; it is also used for torches, and as a kind of pitch, which, when
                    clarified, is well adapted for painting. Here are, besides, many medicinal
                    plants and gums, and also oil of jessamine, benzoin, lack, crystal, emery,
                    antimony, oil, wax, lack varnish, wild cinnamon, cassia buds, and iron wood, the
                    lost of which is much used by the natives as anchors for their vessels. Cotton
                    grows abundantly, and is as fine as silk; “but,” says a European visitor to this
                    country, “these wretches do not know how to value it beyond stuffing beds and
                    pillows.”</p>
                <p>Siam abounds in all the wild animals known in the tropical countries, which find
                    ample cover in the deep forests of the interior. The elephant ranges in the
                    outskirts of the kingdom, amongst the mountains and jungles which form its
                    eastern and its western boundary. The hunting of this animal is a royal
                    monopoly; a great number are taken every year, the finest of which are selected
                    for the studs of the king and nobles, and the rest are exported to other parts
                    of India. The white elephant is found in some parts; it is a very rare animal,
                    and is so prized, that it has occasioned wars between sovereign states. The
                    rhinoceros also frequents the forests, whose skin is much sought after as an
                    object of trade. He is a dangerous animal when enraged, and is not easily
                    overcome, as his skin is so hard that it can hardly be penetrated by a musket
                    ball. But one of the most numerous and most dangerous animals found in the woods
                    is the tiger, which grows to a large size, and is remarkably fierce in the
                    interior regions of Siam. The monkey race are in vast variety, and spread over
                    the cultivated fields, which they speedily lay waste. There are numerous other
                    wild animals, namely, lizards of various kinds, cameleons, tortoises, hedgehogs,
                    and a species of porcupine, which yields valuable bezoar.</p>
                <p>The domestic animals are horses, cows, buffaloes, sheep, goats, and elephants.
                    There is abundance of common poultry; and besides, peacocks, pigeons,
                    partridges, snipes, parrots, and other birds. The horses are very inferior, the
                    best being imported from Batavia; and the same may be said of all domestic
                    animals except the hog, the flesh of which' is superior to the same animal in
                    Europe. Insects and vermin abound here as in other parts of India; and the sea
                    and rivers yield abundance of excellent fish, on which a great proportion of the
                    lower classes subsist. There are besides lobsters and turtle of a good quality,
                    and the manjo fish, which is so much esteemed in Calcutta.</p>
                <p>The mineral riches of Siam are but little known. It is inferred that gold must
                    exist in the mountains, as it is collected in small quantities in the streams,
                    by which it is washed down. Iron, tin, lead, and copper, are likewise procured,
                    but in small quantities. The copper is of a good quality. Iron is imported in
                    considerable quantities from Europe, no diligence being employed to procure it
                    in the country. The mountains in the interior yield diamonds equal to those in
                    Hindustan, also sapphires, rubies, and agates.</p>
                <p>Tire Siamese, from the fertility of their soil, and the facilities of internal
                    traffic afforded by the numerous streams and canals which everywhere intersect
                    the country, are less dependent than most other nations on foreign trade. They
                    are supplied chiefly by the Chinese, who, from their similarity of character and
                    other causes, are the only people permitted to trade freely here. The Chinese
                    commerce with Siam is said to be very extensive, and to employ no less than from
                    30,000 to 40,000 tons of shipping annually in the port of Bankok alone. It is to
                    the supple character of the Chinese, the long connexion that has subsisted
                    between the two countries, and the number of that nation resident in Siam, that
                    this great trade is to be ascribed. The articles which chiefly attract the
                    Chinese traders, are sugar, sapan wood, of which 18,000 tons are exported
                    annually, pepper, cardamoms,sharks fins, birds’nests, bechedemer, hides, about
                    200,000 of which are exported annually; bones of the elephant, the rhinoceros,
                    the tiger, the dcer, and the buffalo; indigo, cotton, wines, and a variety of
                    smaller articles. The Chinese traders, in their junks, arrive every year in
                    February, March, and April, from Hainan, Canton, Soukah, Amoy, Ningpo, and other
                    places. They take away, besides the above articles, a considerable quantity of
                    culmin. There are annually about eighty vessels, mostly freighted by Chinese
                    settlers at Bankok, or Siamese nobles, some of whom engage in traffic. Rice and
                    salt of the very best quality are exported to all the European settlements to
                    the eastward.<pb break="no" facs="ht:chi.28490924&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=384"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0720-0384-0322"/> Among the articles produced in smaller
                    quantities, but which are still valuable for Indian or European cargoes, are
                    agil-wood, a perfumed or scented wood, benjamin, ivory, and stick lac. lron,
                    formed into cooking utensils, forms an extensive article of export from Siam.
                    There are four American ships come annually for cargoes of sugar, for which they
                    pay in dollars.</p>
                <p>Siam carries on a considerable trade with the British settlement of Singapore.
                    This trade is chiefly managed by the Chinese, either natives from China, or
                    their descendants settled in Siam, the Siamese being an indolent race, devoid of
                    the spirit of industry or of enterprise. The vessels and cargoes belong
                    invariably to the Chinese. The principal articles which they import, are British
                    piece goods, or goods of Indian manufacture, such as Bengal muslins, chintz,
                    gurrahs, and sannahs; gold dust, bees’ wax, gambier, rattans, tea, sago,
                    sea-weed, cowries, and coarse paper, likewise constitute articles of import. In
                    addition to those articles, cotton twist is much in demand. Amongst the imports
                    into Siam, opium is one of the most important, about two hundred and fifty
                    chests of this article being annually consumed. It is brought chiefly in junks,
                    from Penang and Singapore; and though a contraband article, for a length of time
                    met with a safe and speedy sale, the very persons appointed to enforce the
                    prohibition being the principal dealers. But since the laws have been so rigidly
                    enforced against the im∣x&gt;rtation of opium into Canton, and the whole stock
                    seized by the Chinese authorities, the dealers of it being besides threatened
                    with death, and the British resident, Elliot, seized and imprisoned, the same
                    severities have been enforced against the trade in Siam. The laws are equally
                    strict against the importation of the drug, a severe fine being the penalty,
                    which, if the offen ler cannot pay, as is commonly the case, his goods are
                    confiscated; and if the sum raised be still insufficient, he is condemned, with
                    his whole family, to perpetual slavery. In June 1839 several unfortunate Chinese
                    sailors were accordingly seized with opium on board, from Singapore, and were
                    cast into prison, where they were treated with great severity.</p>
                <p>No impediment is offered to the admission of European ships into the Siamese
                    ports; nor are the imposts heavy. The port charges for a ship of three hundred
                    and fifty tons do not amount to more than 1200 dollars, and the duties on
                    imports are generally eight per cent., though many articles are free. Sugar pays
                    3s. 2d. per cwt. The real impediments to commerce, consist in the privileges of
                    the king, who is, properly speaking, the only merchant in the kingdom, as he
                    claims the right of pre-emption in the market, from which he derives a large
                    profit. His agents are hard to deal with. They regard foreign trade merely as a
                    source of dishonest profit; and European vessels are only admitted to give an
                    opportunity for extortion. It was to procure the abolition of those oppressive
                    monopolies that Mr. Crawfurd’s embassy was sent to Siam in 1822. But he tailed
                    entirely to attain this object.</p>
                <p>The Menan, by which ships enter, discharges itself into the Gulf of Siam; but it
                    has a bar at its mouth, to cross which, the aid of a pilot is required. The
                    southerly monsoons is the best season for ships to visit Siam, and the northerly
                    for returning to Hindustan, through the straits of Malacca. Bankok, situated on
                    the river near the bay, is the chief place of trade. It is capable of making
                    little defence against a European force; it is indeed, in a military point of
                    view, quite defenceless; nor is there any fortification at the mouth of the
                    river, or all the way up to the capital. A fleet of prows constitutes the whole
                    naval defence of the kingdom of Siam, the bar of the river affording a defence
                    against vessels of war.</p>
                <p>The sovereign of this country exercises, as in other eastern kingdoms, absolute
                    sway. He has no hereditary nobility of any kind, nor any popular assembly to
                    controul his supreme will. The whole male population are liable to military
                    conscription. Their names are enrolled in a register, and they are bound to
                    perform military service for six months in the year; they receive no pay, carry
                    their own provisions, and are only provided with arms and accoutrements. The
                    country is divided into districts, and a chief is placed over each, under whose
                    colours they march to battle. They have made no progress in the science of war,
                    and possess neither discipline nor courage. Like the Burmese, they trust to
                    fortifications of stockades of trees, and posts encircled by a ditch. But the
                    real defence of the country consists in the natural obstacles of jungles,
                    morasses, and the branches of rivers by which it is everywhere intersected. They
                    march without order, nor do they take any precautions against a surprise. They
                    seldom stand more than one discharge, which is sure to frighten one or other of
                    the parties engaged, when they quit the field in disorder. Their chief
                    dependance is on their elephants, which, when they are frightened or wounded,
                    become equally formidable to friends and foes. There is nothing like a standing
                    army. A body of guards, composed chiefly of foreigners, who are attached to the
                    person of the sovereign, is the only force which is not disbanded. They are
                    chiefly Tartars, with a corps of Mohars, who frequently display a desperate
                    courage, however, said to be owing to the stimulus of opium. A small part of the
                    taxes is levied in money, the greater part of the revenue being received in
                    kind.</p>
                <p>The rules followed in the administration of justice, are rude and barbarous. The
                    tribunals are composed of three members; but the president alone decides. By the
                    laws of Siam, children are clothed for the first time, at the age of four or
                    five; and they are never afterwards uncovered for chastisement. Parents may sell
                    their children. But they never resort to this proceeding except from absolute
                    want. It is not true, as has been reported, that they sell their daughters, if
                    offended with them, for courtezans. The duties between a pupil and his teacher
                    are reckoned next in importance to those of parent and child. Their system of
                    education resembles that of the Burmese. Priests are not allowed to become
                    teachers of the female sex. The principal object of their education is to enable
                    them to superintend their husbands’ affairs. Marriage is considered merely as a
                    civil contract, and the priests are not called upon to assist in it. Polygamy is
                    admitted, but is only practised by the higher classes; and even they consider
                    the first wife only as mistress of the house, whilst all the rest are little
                    better than slaves. In general, the lot of the females is severe in this
                    country, the heaviest part of the labour falling upon them; nor are they allowed
                    to eat with their husbands, nor even to sail in the same boat; they attend no
                    public amusements, but spend their time almost entirely at home. In every
                    intricate case, the ordeal is resorted to as the easiest solution of all
                    difficulties. The accused is required, as a satisfactory purgation of his
                    innocence, to walk over red hot iron, or burning coals. Another ordeal is by
                    water, when the person who remains longest beneath is declared innocent. Pills
                    that cause vomiting are also employed; and he on whom they first take effect is
                    adjudged guilty. But in some cases, the accused are subjected to the perilous
                    test of being thrown to tigers, which in their fury, will, it is supposed, make
                    the proper distinction between the innocent and the guilty. The punishments, as
                    in all barbarous countries, are shocking by their severity. Sacrilege is
                    punished by fixing the head of the offender to the hearth, where it is consumed
                    by a slow fire. A stake is thrust through the body of assassins, in such a
                    manner as to cause exquisite pain. Noblemen are sometimes subjected to degrading
                    punishments, being condemned to cut grass for the elephants; some are subjected
                    to the pillory; others are allowed to languish in prisons in the most miserable
                    state, or they are seen wandering about the city, chained seven and seven
                    together, begging their bread from<pb break="no"

                    door to door. They are confined at night within a circle formed with stakes, and
                    are obliged by turns, and at short intervals, to call out their names.</p>
                <p>The religion of Siam is the same system which has diffused itself so extensively
                    over the east and north of Asia, which is variously designated in different
                    countries, as the doctrine of Boodh or Buddha, or of Gaudama, and in Tartary of
                    Shamanism. The language of their sacred books, like the Sanscrit and the Zend in
                    Persia, differs entirely from that in ordinary life, and is called Bali,
                    apparently the same Indian language which is called Pali by the Burmans. The
                    creed is singularly severe; but the common people escape from its austerities,
                    as they believe that a rigid adherence to its maxims is only prescribed to the
                    priests, to whose mortifications they trust as an atonement for their errors.
                    They have an order of monks professing celibacy, and residing in convents. They
                    harangue the people from morning to night, who not only express their feelings
                    in murmurs of applause, but load the preacher with costly gifts. Their temples
                    are distinguished above all those in Asia, by their magnificence, and by the
                    gigantic statues which they contain. The principal pagoda in the city is of a
                    long and narrow form, covered externally with tin, whilst the interior is one
                    complete blaze of gold, and contains an idol, forty-five feet in height, which
                    reaches to the roof, and is said to be composed entirely of that precious
                    metal.</p>
                <p>The Siamese have made scarcely any advances either in science or literature.
                    Their progress in mathematics is not great, their attention being confined
                    chiefly to arithmetic, on account of its utility in commerce. They know little
                    of astronomy beyond some of its humblest practical applications. They first
                    learned from Cassini to find out the place of the sun and moon by calculation.
                    But they have not turned their knowledge to any account in navigation, their
                    junks making use merely of the compass, and creeping where they can along the
                    coasts for safety. Time is measured by vessels having a small hole perforated
                    and placed in a tub of water, the construction of clocks being beyond their
                    mechanical powers. Their system of medicine is equally imperfect, consisting
                    chiefly in certain receipts, the virtues of which they say have been ascertained
                    by experience. They are entire strangers to anatomy, having a religious scruple
                    against opening dead bodies. They are fond, like many other barbarous nations,
                    of music and poetry, and their bards are chiefly exercised in songs and in
                    impromptu recitations. Their festivals and pleasure excursions upon the water
                    are always enlivened with music. Their taste, however, appears to be equally
                    rude in this as in all other arts or sciences. Instrumental music is chiefly
                    valued on account of its loudness; the organ is preferred on this account to any
                    other European instrument; and next to it hautboys, drums, trumpets, and fifes.
                    Their theatrical amusements are, as might be expected, extremely rude,
                    consisting of extravagant tables or gross caricatures, often levelled against
                    the reigning monarch, or against persons in power, who choose to wink at these
                    liberties, being the only vehicle of public opinion. Dancing and wrestling are
                    amongst their most favourite amusements; and their puppet shows, the theatrical
                    exhibitions in which they chiefly delight, are got up with great parade and
                    expense by the king and the nobles for the amusement of the people.</p>
                <p>The moral character and habits of the Siamese are rated extremely low by those
                    travellers who have visited the country. From the highest to the lowest, they
                    are, according to their account, mean, cowardly, and mercenary. Like most of the
                    Eastern nations, they have no regard to truth. These bad qualities are perceived
                    in every action of their lives; and their rapacity in their intercourse with
                    strangers is well known. To increase their wealth and promote their own
                    interest, form the lasting object of all classes, which is pursued by every
                    indirect and fraudulent practice. Timidity is a remarkable characteristic of the
                    nation, insomuch that two Europeans would put to flight fifty of them; and the
                    doctrine that cruelty and cowardice go together, is exemplified in their
                    treatment of those who are made prisoners in their wars with the Burmese, or are
                    kidnapped on the frontier; they are employed in public works of the most servile
                    nature, with chains about their necks, legs, and feet, and are condemned to this
                    degradation for life. Amongst their other evil propensities they carry on
                    gambling to a great excess; and some have attributed the low state to which
                    trade has occasionally fallen, to n species of lottery, in which all classes
                    engage, and which is countenanced by the king. To such a length is the rage for
                    these gambling speculations carried, that it is the cause of serious disorders.
                    The victims of this vice, impoverished, and reduced to nakedness, betake
                    themselves to open and lawless violence for subsistence. They follow robbing as
                    a trade, and herd together in bands, so that it is not safe to venture out in
                    decent attire, as they plunder openly, and commit daily murders.</p>
                <p>Europeans have no very accurate knowledge of the statistics of Siam, and the
                    estimate of the population by different travellers is rather conjectural.
                    According to such imperfect statements as have been received, the entire
                    popu-ation of the country was stated at four millions. The inhabitants resemble
                    the Chinese and Mongols in their features; they have a broad face, and very
                    prominent cheek bones, whilst the remainder of their cheek has rather a hollow
                    appearance. The eyes are small, with a deep yellow tinge in the white part; the
                    mouth large, and the lips thick and full. Both males and females take as much
                    pains to blacken their teeth, as the Europeans do to preserve them white. The
                    men eradicate their beards, but allow their nails to lengthen like the Chinese.
                    They are extremely gross feeders, eating rats, buzzards, grasshoppers, and other
                    insects. They are, as has been already stated, indolent, and have made no
                    progress in mechanical arts, nor in agriculture. It is chiefly by the Chinese
                    that the country is cultivated, and that sugar and other productions are raised.
                    They, along with the Portuguese settled here, manage the commerce that is
                    carried on. They are strangers to the making of silk and woollen cloths; and
                    even the fabrics of cotton are not nearly on the same scale as in Hindustan.
                    Their artists in gold are however remarkably expert, and their fillagree work is
                    extremely beautiful. They also excel in beating out gold leaf, which is greatly
                    employed in adorning their temples and idols.</p>
                <p>The Siamese annals affect to detail with much minuteness the events that have
                    occurred in Siam and the adjacent states and countries for the last fourteen
                    hundred years; but these, like most Eastern histories, consist of fables or
                    gross exaggerations. The kingdom of Siam was unknown in Europe until the
                    discovery of the route to India by the Cape of Good Hope. The first traces of
                    their history were received through the Portuguese, who frequently acted as
                    auxiliaries to the contending factions. In 1684 ambassadors were sent from Siam
                    to Louis XIV., and in consequence M. Cerberet and La Loubère were dispatched as
                    ambassadors to Siam, where they arrived in 1687, and immediately attempted to
                    make a proselyte of the king to the Catholic faith. The monarch declined the
                    religion so freely proffered to him by the French, but entered into a strict
                    alliance with them, and allowed them two garrisons, Bankok and Mergui. In 1688,
                    the king was, however, by a sudden revolution, dethroned and murdered, which was
                    fallowed by the expulsion of the French. From this period Siam was the scene of
                    much internal discord, and of many sanguinary massacres; and in 1754 was
                    involved in a serious war with the Burmese, who having conquered Pegu, and
                    enlarged their territories, came in contact with the dominions of Siam. A long
                    war ensued, which terminated al-<pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:chi.28490924&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=386" xml:id="kp-eb0720-0386-0324"/>
                    together to the disadvantage of the Siamese, who were repeatedly defeated with
                    great slaughter; their capital was sacked by the Burmese in 1766, who besides
                    took all their maritime possessions on the bay of Bengal and along the west
                    coast of the Malay peninsula, including the important places of Tavoy, Mergui,
                    and Tenasscrim. Though greatly reduced by this unsuccessful war, and frequently
                    brought to the brink of ruin, Siam still exists as an independent kingdom, to
                    which it is indebted partly to the dissensions of the Burmese, and partly to the
                    actual strength of the country.</p>
                <p>An embassy was sent to Siam by the British government in 1822, which was placed
                    under the charge of Mr. Crawfurd, who had an audience of the king of Siam, by
                    whom he was received so favourably, that he had every reason to expect a
                    favourable termination to his mission. But these hopes were frustrated by the
                    jealous and unaccommodating policy of the government. They made propositions one
                    day which were revoked the next; and displayed their faithless character so
                    clearly, that all negotiations were finally broken off; and the embassy were
                    finally interdicted from going about the town or on the river, and were not
                    allowed to trade. An American embassy was more agreeably received by this
                    jealous government in 1833, and it is said succeeded in concluding a commercial
                    treaty with the government. <hi rend="italic">Asiatic Journal,</hi> new series.
