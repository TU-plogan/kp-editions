                <p><label type="entry">SOCINUS, <hi rend="smallcaps">Laelius</hi></label>, the first
                    author of the sect of the Socinians, was born at Sienna in Tuscany in 1525.
                    Being designed by his father for the law, he began very early to search for the
                    foundation of that science in the word of God; and by that study discovered that
                    the Romish religion taught many things contrary to revelation. Being desirous of
                    penetrating farther into the true sense of the scriptures, he studied Greek,
                    Hebrew, and even Arabic. In 1547 he left Italy, to go and converse with the
                    Protestants; and spent four years in travelling through France, England, the
                    Netherlands, Germany, and Poland, and at length settled at Zürich. He by this
                    means became acquainted with the most learned men of his time, who testified by
                    their letters the esteem which they had for him; but as he discovered to them
                    his doubts, he was greatly suspected of heresy. He however conducted himself
                    with such address, that he lived among the capital enemies of his opinions,
                    without receiving the least injury. He met with some disciples, who heard his
                    instructions with respect; these were Italians who had left their native country
                    on account of religion, and wandered about in Germany and Poland. He
                    communicated likewise his sentiments to his relations by his writings, which he
                    caused to be conveyed to them at Sienna. He died at Zii-rich in 1562. Those who
                    were of sentiments opposite to his, and were personally acquainted with him,
                    confess that his outward behaviour was blameless. He wrote a paraphrase on the
                    first chapter of St. John; and other works are ascribed to him.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Socinus</hi>, <hi rend="italic">Faustus,</hi> nephew of the
                    preceding, and principal founder of the Socinian sect, was born at Sienna in
                    1539. The letters which his uncle Laelius wrote to his relations, and which
                    infused into them many seeds of heresy, made an impression upon him; so that,
                    knowing himself not innocent, he fled as well as the rest when the inquisition
                    began to persecute that family. He was at Lyon when he heard of his uncle’s
                    death, and he departed immediately to take possession of his writings. He
                    returned to Tuscany; and made himself so agreeable to the grand duke, that the
                    charms which he found in that court, and the honourable posts which he filled
                    there, hindered him for twelve years from remembering that he had been
                    considered as the person who was to put the last hand to the system of divinity,
                    of which his uncle Laelius had made a rough draught. At last he went into
                    Germany in 1547, and paid no regard to the grand duke’s advices to return. He
                    stayed three years at Basel, and there studied divinity; and having adopted a
                    set of principles very different from the system of Protestants, he resolved to
                    maintain and propagate them; for which purpose he wrote a treatise <hi
                    rend="italic">De Iesu Christa Servatore.</hi> In 1579 Socinus retired into
                    Poland, and desired to be admitted into the communion of the Unitarians; but as
                    he differed from them in some points, on which he refused to be silent, he met
                    with a repulse. He did not however cease to write in defence of their churches
                    against those who attacked them. At length his book against James Paleologus
                    furnished his enemies with a pretence to exasperate the king of Poland against
                    him; but though the mere reading of it was sufficient to refute his accusers,
                    Socinus thought proper to leave Cracow, after having resided there four years.
                    He then lived under the protection of several Polish lords, and married a lady
                    of a good family; but her death, which happened in 1587, so deeply afflicted him
                    as to injure his health; and to complete his sorrow, he was deprived of his
                    patrimony by the death of Francis de’ Medici, great duke of Florence. The
                    consolation which he found in seeing his sentiments at last approved by several
                    ministers, was greatly interrupted in 1598; for he met with a thousand insults
                    at Cracow, and was with great difficulty saved from the hands of the rabble. His
                    house was plundered, and he lost his goods; but this loss was not so uneasy to
                    him as that of some manuscripts, which he extremely regretted. To deliver
                    himself from such dangers, he retired to a village about nine miles distant from
                    Cracow, where he spent the remainder of his days at the house of Abraham
                    Blonski, a Polish gentleman, and died there in 1604. All Faustus Socinus’s works
                    are contained in the first two volumes of the great collection entitled <hi
