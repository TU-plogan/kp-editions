                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Τηε</hi> kingdoms of Spain and Portugal together form what
                    is called the Pyrenean Peninsula, the most southerly, and at the same time the
                    most westerly, portion of Europe. Ex cept on the northeast, where it is
                    connected with the rest of Europe by an isthmus about one hundred miles in
                    breadth, this peninsula is wholly surrounded by the ocean. Spain, which occupies
                    by far the greater part of it, has for its boundaries on the south and southeast
                    the Mediterranean Sea; on the west, partly the long and narrow territory of
                    Portugal, partly the Atlantic Ocean; on the north, the Bay of Biscay; and on the
                    northeast the Pyrenees, a chain holding the second rank among the mountains of
                    Europe, and forming a well-defined line of separation between France and
                    Spain.</p>
                <p>That the Peninsula was peopled at a very early period seems abundantly certain,
                    but by whom it would be vain to inquire. The traditions which ascribe its
                    colonization to Tubal, the grandson of Noah, may be allowed to repose
                    undisturbed in the obscurity of the chronicles in which they are embodied. The
                    earliest inhabitants whom his tory makes known to us were the Iberians, a race
                    probably of Asiatic origin. At some period lost in the depths of antiquity, the
                    Celts, amid their widespread migrations, penetrated into the Peninsula; but we
                    are still ignorant how they entered the country, and whence they came, al though
                    these subjects have been matter of keen disputation. The two nations appear at
                    first to have contended for the sovereignty of the soil, but finally to have
                    amalgamated, to have shared the country between them, and, as a united people,
                    to have assumed the compound name of Celtiberians. They were split into numerous
                    tribes or clans, each of which occupied its own particular territory.</p>
                <p>The delightful climate which Spain enjoys, the fertility of its soil, and the
                    mines of gold, silver, and iron, by which it is enriched, proved powerful
                    attractions to the Rhodians and Phoenicians, who established colonies in the
                    country at a very early period. But the Carthaginians were the people who
                    obtained the firmest footing in it. Availing themselves of the pretext of
                    commerce, they frequented the coast of Cadiz, where they succeeded in erecting
                    fortresses, dwell inghouses, temples, and buildings where business was
                    transacted; and pushing their conquests into the interior as well as along the
                    coast, they at length made themselves masters of the whole of Baetica or
                    Andalusia, employing force when artifice failed. The Spaniards were roused to
                    make resist ance, but it was too late. Hamilcar, father of Hannibal, succeeded
                    in overrunning a considerable part of the coun try, and bringing it, at least
                    nominally, under subjection to Carthage, 238 years before the birth of Christ.
                    He extend ed his conquests towards Murcia, Valencia, and Catalonia, in the
                    latter of which provinces he founded the city of Barcelona. This conqueror
                    having perished in a battle fought with some of the native tribes, was succeeded
                    by his son inlaw Asdrubal, who built the port of New Carthage, now called
                    Carthagena. The rapid strides which the Cartha ginians had made towards the
                    total subjugation of the Peninsula, aroused the fears of the Greek colonies
                    situated on the coast of Catalonia and Valencia, and alarmed those tribes in the
                    interior who still stoutly maintained their independence. Too weak to make head
                    against Carthage themselves, they applied to the Romans for assistance. This
                    great nation had long regarded with a jealous eye the growing prosperity of its
                    rival Carthage, and eagerly em braced the cause of the discontented states. In
                    the character of ally and protector, Rome sent a deputation to Car thage, and
                    obtained from its senate two important con cessions; that the Carthaginians
                    should not extend their conquests beyond the Ebro; and that they should not dis
                    turb the Saguntines and the other Greek colonies. But these conditions, although
                    agreed to, did not correspond with the gigantic designs which Asdrubal had
                    formed. The Romans, fully aware of the vast riches which the Car thaginians drew
                    from Spain, and of the immense value of such a country to themselves in
                    prosecuting their own am bitious schemes of foreign conquest, had entered into
                    close alliance with some of the discontented tribes, no doubt with the ulterior
                    view of subjecting them to their own domination. Saguntum, one of the most
                    flourishing cities of the Peninsula, was one of these allies of Rome; and
                    Asdrubal, in the prosecution of his design of subduing the whole of Spain before
                    Rome could send succours to the confederates, collected a considerable force and
                    marched against this city. On his way, however, he was assassinated by a slave;
                    but the chief command passed into still abler hands, those of the renowned
                    Hannibal. This famous Car thaginian was then in his twentyfifth year, and
                    greatly es teemed for his valour and his talents. After having con quered the
                    kingdom of Toledo, he besieged Saguntum with his whole force, which is said to
                    have amounted to 150,000 men. The Romans lost much time in fruitless attempts at
                    negociation, and failed to send prompt succour to its faithful ally. The
                    consequence was, that after a vigorous defence, the Saguntines were so reduced
                    by hunger and fa tigue, that they retired from the walls into the centre of the
                    city, where they amassed all their valuable effects, and every thing
                    combustible, into one vast pile. Placing their wives and children around it,
                    they themselves issued from the gates and plunged sword in hand into the midst
                    of the Carthaginians. The slaughter was prodigious on both sides, but in the end
                    the Saguntines were cut off almost to a man. No sooner was their fate known in
                    the city than their wives set fire to the pile, and precipitated themselves and
                    their children into the devouring element. Thus perished Sa guntum, one of the
                    largest and most flourishing cities of Spain; and its destruction may be
                    regarded as the opening of the second Punic war. Of the contests carried on be
                    tween the Carthaginians and the Romans, till the final sub jugation of the
                    former, and the consequent incorporation of its territories with the Roman
                    empire, an account will be found under the articles <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Carthage</hi> and <hi rend="smallcaps">Roman History</hi>. We shall only in
                    this place notice such leading events as are necessary to give clearness and
                    connection to our nar rative.</p>
                <p>Two centuries were required by Rome to effect the total subjugation of Spain,
                    that is, from the first invasion of the country by Cneus Cornelius Scipio in the
                    year 218 <hi rend="smallcaps">b. c.,</hi> till the last tribes, the Cantabrians
                    and Asturians, laid down their arms to Augustus in the year 19 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b. c.</hi> No other conquest had cost Rome so much. The numbers
                    who perished in the field of battle, and the amount of treasure sacrificed, are
                    not to be calculated. At the same time, scarcely any other acquisition was
                    productive of so much advantage to the state, from the inexhaustible riches of
                    the country. After the destruction of the Carthaginian power in Spain, this
                    country was regarded as a Roman province, received the name of Hispania, and was
                    divided by the senate into Cite rior and Ulterior, or Hither and Farther; the
                    Ebro sery ing as a boundary between the two. Each of these was governed by a
                    praetor, annually appointed by Rome. The extortions of these functionaries very
                    soon became so op pressive to the natives, that they at last resolved on
                    attempting to rid themselves of their unprincipled rulers. Viria<pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:chi.28490924&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=565" xml:id="kp-eb0720-0565-0491"/>
                    thus, a native of Lusitania, the most remarkable man in the ancient history of
                    Spain, collected a considerable body of malcontents, and took the field against
                    the Romans. Not only by stratagems and sudden surprises, but in regular pitched
                    battles, he succeeded in foiling the most valiant officers of the Roman legions.
                    For above eleven years he bade defiance to the formidable hosts of the invader.
                    To subdue him by force of arms was found impossible, and the base spirit of Q.
                    Servilius Caepio had recourse to treachery. The offer of a magnificent
                    recompense stimulated three of the followers of Viriathus to assassinate him,
                    which bloody deed they accomplished whilst he lay asleep. It is some consolation
                    to record, that the murderers were disappointed of their reward, and dismissed
                    from the Roman camp with insults and contempt. The indomitable spirit of
                    independence which animated the Spaniards was not, how ever, broken by the death
                    of their great leader. The Nu mantians, in particular, still remained fiercely
                    hostile to the Romans, and the destruction of Numantia was decreed by the
                    senate. Scipio Aemilianus, the conqueror of Carthage, was appointed to the
                    command of the legions destined for this service, and the city was closely
                    invested by a powerful army. While food was left to the besieged, they defied
                    all the efforts of the Romans to take their city. Famine however humbled them
                    into submission, and they sued for mercy, but in vain. Driven to desperation,
                    the wretched remains of the defenders issued from the gates, and fell with fury
                    upon the Roman intrenchments; but they were forced back within the walls.
                    Aemilianus had formed the cruel resolution of starving them into an
                    unconditional surrender. Rather than yield to this, the Numantians determined,
                    in imitation of the Saguntines, to make a sacrifice of them selves, and of all
                    that was valuable which they possessed. This resolution they carried into effect
                    under circumstances even more shocking than those which accompanied the de
                    struction of Saguntum. When the victor entered the city, not a human being
                    remained alive to grace his triumph; nothing met his eyes but smouldering ruins
                    and a horrible solitude. This event took place in the year 133 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b. c.</hi></p>
                <p>After the destruction of Numantia, three fourths of the Peninsula submitted to
                    Rome; and nothing very remarkable occurs in its history till the time of the
                    civil war between Marius and Sylla. The latter having crushed the Marian
                    faction, proscribed those who had taken a part in it, whom he could not
                    immediately destroy. Among these was Ser torius, who had previously served in
                    Spain as a tribune; a man of great bodily and mental endowments, of consummate
                    valour, and experience in the art of war, but whose ambition was equal to his
                    nobler gifts. Having es caped to Spain, he there succeeded in gaining over to
                    his interest several of the native tribes, raised a considerable army, and
                    routed the Roman legions in repeated engage ments. He introduced a strict order
                    of discipline among his troops, founded public schools, constituted a senate in
                    imitation of that of Rome, and attempted to establish in Spain a rival
                    sovereignty to that of Italy. But, in the midst of these brilliant though
                    ambitious undertakings, Sertorius was basely assassinated by his subaltern
                    Perpenna, in the year 73 <hi rend="smallcaps">b. c.</hi> With the death of this
                    great captain expired the last faint glimmer of national independence. Pompey,
                    and afterwards Julius Caesar, reduced most of the native tribes to subjection.
                    After the fall of Pompey in Africa, his eldest son selected Spain as the fittest
                    scene for opposing the dreaded dictator. For the fourth time, Caesar hastened to
                    the Peninsula, and, on the plains of Munda, gained a bloody but decisive victory
                    over the younger Pompey, who was slain in attempting to effect his escape from
                    the country. Augustus, ' the successor of Caesar, effectually secured the
                    dominion of Rome over Spain, hav mg reduced the Asturians, Galicians, and
                    Cantabrians, the bravest and most warlike of the native tribes. Spain now began
                    to rest from the continual wars with which it had been devastated from the
                    period of the Carthaginian conquest, and quietly submitted to the domination of
                    Rome, from which it received its religion, its laws, its manners, and its
                    language.</p>
                <p>It has already been noticed that the country was at first divided into two
                    provinces, Citerior and Ulterior, between which flowed the Ebro as the natural
                    boundary. With the advance of the Romans the size of the provinces increased,
                    but it is impossible to define their exact limits before the time of Augustus.
                    This emperor, less desirous of effecting new conquests than of securing the old,
                    made arrangements for improving the condition of the whole peninsula. Out of the
                    two provinces he formed three, and gave them the names of Tarraco, Lusitania,
                    and Baetica. Under the pretext of saving time and trouble to the senate, but
                    really for the purpose of retaining power over the whole army in his own hands,
                    he undertook the management of two of the provinces, in which, on account of the
                    pretended inse curity of their situation, a considerable number of troops was
                    maintained. Only Baetica came under the direct control of the senate. A
                    proconsul, who had his seat at Hispalis, was installed governor of this
                    province, but without any military power; whilst in the imperial provinces, a
                    legatus Augustalis in Emerita, and a legatus proconsularis in Tarraco, exercised
                    complete civil and military autho rity. Subsequently the province conceded to
                    the senate fell entirely under the sway of the emperor, when the go vernor
                    received the name of praeses or president. The districts being very extensive,
                    it was found necessary to ap point inferior officers; under the legate of
                    Lusitania was placed a vicelegatus militaris, and there were three placed under
                    the consular legates of Tarraco. A legate and a quaestor were subject to the
                    proconsul of Baetica. In this manner the country as a whole was divided. Let us
                    now take a glance of the constitution and condition of the towns.</p>
                <p>After the complete subjugation of the Peninsula, the co horts, composed
                    principally of the natives of the country, were transplanted to the most distant
                    parts of the empire, while Roman legions were sent into Spain to supply their
                    place. No arrangement could have been made that was better calculated to give a
                    Roman impress to the character of the people, and to their manners, customs, and
                    establishments. In the interior of the country, towns purely Roman sprung up,
                    small tracts of country having been conferred on soldiers as a reward for their
                    services. Thus the town of Leon is indebted for its name and origin to the
                    seventh legion, which settled there; and in the same manner arose Emerita
                    Augusta (Merida), Pax Julia (Beja), Caesar Augusta (Saragossa), and many others.
                    Originally, most of the cities managed their own affairs; but when Caracalla
                    declared all his subjects throughout his vast empire Roman citizens, the
                    constitutions of the cities of Spain were made uniform with those of the other
                    cities of the empire. Rome, the capital, was the great type to which they all
                    conformed. For purposes of general police, and for the superintendence of public
                    works, for tresses, entertainments, and the like, aediles were appointed in
                    provincial towns, whose office, however, was one more of pomp and honour than
                    emolument. The affairs of the cities were universally administered by a council
                    or curia, the members of which, called <hi rend="italic">decuriones,</hi> were
                    chosen from among the richest and most respectable of the inhabitants. As
                    advocates or defenders of the people, there were the <hi rend="italic"
                    >defensores civitatum,</hi> who neither belonged to the body of the decurions
                    nor to the army, but formed rather a sort of check upon these, and resisted the
                    encroachments of power on the rights of the citizens. We pass over a number of
                    other subordinate functionaries, whose duties are either im perfectly known, or,
                    where known, of minor importance.</p>

                    feeting the interest of the emperor, were discussed in the assembly of the
                    decurions. For all important affairs, such as those affecting the welfare of the
                    whole district, the de curions of the principal city of a province could call a
                    <hi rend="italic">general</hi> assembly, <hi rend="italic">concilium,</hi> to
                    which the other towns sent plenipotentiaries. Long after the comitia had ceased
                    to exist in Rome, the province enjoyed the privilege of calling together such
                    meetings; and they served at the same time as a means of making known their
                    wants to the emperor.</p>
                <p>Of all the provinces incorporated with the Roman em pire, there was not one
                    productive of so much gain, not one in which such inexhaustible sources of
                    wealth were discovered, as the Pyrenean Peninsula. Mines, rich in the pre cious
                    metals,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Gibbon very
                    justly observes, “Spain, by a very singular fatality, was the Peru and Mexicoof

                    and the oppression of the simple natives, who were compelled to labour in their
                    mines for the benefit of strangers, form an exact type of the more recent
                    history of Spanish America.” Cbap. vi.</p></note> satisfied the thirst of the
                    Romans for gold; and a soil nowhere surpassed in productiveness filled their
                    granaries with corn. During the republic the Peninsula was laid under the
                    obligation of supplying the capital of the empire with the twentieth part of its
                    corn harvests. The price paid for the grain was fixed by the Roman se nate
                    itself, a convenient way of obtaining cheap provisions.</p>
                <p>While Spain continued to be ravaged by war, the Ro mans did not in general bind
                    themselves to a regular sys tem of taxation, but only drew as much from the
                    Peninsula as it was convenient for it to pay at the time; but when the conquest
                    of the country was completed, a fixed rate of taxation was introduced.
                    Consequently, after Augustus hail divided Spain in the manner which we have
                    described, the senate sent quaestors into the provinces to collect the taxes. In
                    those provinces placed under the immediate control of the emperor, there were
                    procurators em ployed; and functionaries of this class were also appointed to
                    look after the monies received by the officers of the senate, the application of
                    the whole being under the entire management of the emperor. These procurators
                    were likewise extremely useful in preventing the subordinates from defrauding
                    the emperor. By degrees their number increased, so that ultimately there came to
                    be procurators, not only for the collective income of a province, but for
                    separate branches of the taxes.</p>
                <p>In Spain, as well as throughout the whole Roman empire, the taxes consisted of a
                    capitation and a land tax; but by degrees, more from the extravagance of the
                    empe rors than from the necessities of the state, the people came to be burdened
                    with a multitude of other imposts. The towns had their own particular estates
                    and incomes, inde pendent of those of the government, and which were managed by
                    the civic authorities themselves. These served to defray the expenses of
                    erecting public establishments, building fortresses, and instituting games. The
                    contribution to the state taxes paid by the towns was levied by the magistrates
                    from the inhabitants, in exact proportion to their wealth; hence the taxes,
                    although they continued to rise, did not press with unequal and crushing weight
                    upon individuals and classes. Never was Spain so wealthy, so populous, and so
                    industrious, as during the first centuries of the empire. Aqueducts, bridges,
                    amphitheatres, and other magnificent structures, even the ruins of some of which
                    posterity surveys with wonder, still bear testimony to the flourishing condition
                    of the country during that period.</p>
                <p>When Constantine the Great assumed the purple, im portant changes were introduced
                    into the empire. From the province of Tarraco he separated the governments of
                    Carthagena and Galicia, thus making five provinces in the Peninsula, viz.
                    Tarraco, Carthagena, Galicia, Lusitania, and Baetica. Theodosius the Great
                    erected the Bale aric Isles into a province, and the African district of Tin
                    gitania was also reckoned another, so that there were seven in all. The
                    principal cities of these provinces were as follow:</p>
                <p>of Baetica, Hispalis; of Lusitania, Emerita; of Galicia, Bracara; of Tarraco,
                    Caesar Augusta; of Carthagena, New Carthage; of the Balearic Isles, Palma; and
                    of Tingitania, Tingis. The first three were placed under consuls, and the others
                    under presidents <hi rend="italic">(praesides).</hi> Spain was subject to the
                    prefecture of Gaul, and over these local governors was placed a <hi
                    rend="italic">vicar (vicarius),</hi> whose administration was chiefly confined
                    to civil affairs, and the count <hi rend="italic">(comes),</hi> whose functions
                    were of a military nature. Sometimes, however, both the civil and military
                    departments fell to the vicar. We have yet to mention one important event con
                    nected with the Roman conquest of Spain, namely, the in troduction of
                    Christianity into the Peninsula. This took place so early that the unanimous
                    voice of tradition has ascribed it to St James the elder; and from the same
                    autho rity we also learn that St Paul preached “Christ crucified” to the
                    idolaters of Spain. Of course little or no reliance is to be placed on such
                    statements; but whether the apostles or their successors propagated the gospel
                    in these regions, certain it is that Spain can adduce her martyrs as early as
                    the second century. There is abundant evidence to prove the antiquity of the
                    persecutions sustained by the Christians of Spain, but our limits prevent us
                    from entering into details.</p>
                <p>The prosperity of the Peninsula began to decline after the death of Constantine,
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">a.</hi> D. 337. A species of tax in troduced by Diocletian,
                    which was made to fall with paralysing weight on the middle or industrious
                    classes, proved so pernicious in its operation, that in a short time the coun
                    try presented the melancholy picture of deserted towns, fields lying waste,
                    fruittrees uprooted from the soil, that the possessors of the ground might
                    lessen the value of their property, and thus escape the taxes; trade and
                    manufactures at a stand; in short, nothing but desolation, poverty, and misery,
                    everywhere presented themselves. It only required a strong impulse from without
                    to overwhelm the whole country in ruins. The last day of the year 406 marks the
                    passage of the Vandals, Alans, Suevi, and other Germanic tribes, across the
                    Rhine. From this river to the Pyrenees, terror and dismay announced their ap
                    proach, death and destruction marked their progress. For <hi rend="italic"
                    >a</hi> time this great barrier of nature and of nations restrained the roving
                    bands, and the mountainpasses were at first well guarded. But the prolific
                    fields and wealthy mines of Spain were too rich a prey not to be reached at all
                    hazards. Finding an opportunity, when negligence had weakened the line of
                    defence (409), they burst like a torrent through the Pyrenean chain, and poured
                    the tide of destruction from its base to the Pillars of Hercules. Native
                    historians of the Peninsula describe the ravages committed by these barbarians
                    as dreadful and revolting almost beyond parallel. The very wild beasts quitted
                    their lairs to prey upon the human species, too emaciated by famine and
                    pestilence to drive them back. In a word, the country was turned into a de sert;
                    and, satiated with carnage and rapine, the barbarians sat down amidst its ruins
                    and divided it by lot. Baetica fell to the Vandals, Lusitania to the Alans, and
                    Galicia, with a great portion of Leon and Castille, to the Suevi. Tarraco alone
                    seems still to have been retained by the Romans.</p>
                <p>But a fourth people, more formidable than all the rest combined, came to disturb
                    the new settlers in their pos sessions. These were the Goths under Ataulphus, to
                    whom Honorius, the Roman emperor, had ceded the fertile provinces of Southern
                    Gaul and the Peninsula. The Gothic monarch espoused Placidia, the emperor’s
                    sister, in 414, and immediately proceeded to Barcelona, where, however, he was
                    shortly afterwards assassinated. His successor, Sigeric, a detestable monster,
                    shared the same fate; and the elec tion of the Goths now fell upon Wallia, a
                    chief every way<pb break="no" facs="ht:chi.28490924&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=567"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0720-0567-0493"/> worthy of their choice. Peace being made with
                    Rome, hostilities were vigorously commenced against the kindred barbarians
                    (418). The result of the war was the subjugation of the Suevi, the total
                    destruction of the Alans, and the expulsion of the Vandals from Spain (427). But
                    the restless and powerful Suevi were scotched, not killed. During the reign of
                    Theodoric, Wallia’s successor, they be came formidable alike to the Romans and
                    the Goths, and made many important conquests in the neighbouring pro vinces.
                    Theodoric might easily have subdued them had he not been summoned to encounter a
                    far more terrible antagonist, the renowned Attila, with his half million of
                    mounted Huns. The death of the Gothic monarch on the plains of Chalons (451),
                    the elevation of his son Thorismund to the vacant throne, his assassination by
                    his brothers, and the elevation of the elder of the fratricides, Theodoric, were
                    events which closely followed each other. The reign of the lastnamed prince was
                    diversified by alternate suc cess and disaster. The Peninsula, become one great
                    battle field to three contending hosts, the Goths, Romans, and Suevi, was
                    plunged in misery, and, from the Pyrenees to the sea of Africa, was overspread
                    with innumerable swarms, which, like so many locusts, utterly destroyed the
                    spots on which they settled. While Theodoric was preparing to conduct an army
                    across the Pyrenees against Remismund, king of the Suevi, he was assassinated by
                    his brother Euric, in his capital of Toulouse (466).</p>
                <p>The reign of Euric was unusually brilliant and successful. He rendered himself
                    absolute lord of the country, by extinguishing the dominion of Rome in it, and
                    completely subjecting the Suevi. Euric was the first legislator of his nation,
                    and the founder of the Gothic kingdom of Spain; for hitherto the country had
                    rather been overrun than sub dued. This prince died at Arles, the capital of his
                    em pire, <hi rend="smallcaps">a.</hi> D. 483. He was succeeded by his son
                    Alaric, a weak sovereign, who, after submitting pusillanimously to many
                    indignities, was overthrown in battle, and slain by Clovis, king of the Franks
                    (506). Amalaric, the son of Alaric, being a minor, was for a time superseded by
                    his natural brother Gensaleic, but ultimately ascended the throne (522). He was
                    the first Gothic king who established his court in Spain. He fixed on the city
                    of Seville. From the death of this prince (531) till Recared I. became king of
                    the Goths (587), a few obscure royal names occur, regarding whom it would be a
                    mere waste of space to enter into details. The chief act of this sovereign was
                    to reclaim his subjects from the heresy of Arianism to orthodox Catholicism. He
                    died in 601. Of eleven monarchs who followed, occupying a period of seventy
                    years, none is in any way remarkable. In 673, Wamba, a man distinguished alike
                    for wisdom, valour, and virtue, was raised, by the unanimous voice of the Gothic
                    electors, to the throne, left vacant by the death of Receswind (672). The early
                    part of his reign was spent in quelling intestine war. During the latter part of
                    it he successfully cultivated the arts of peace, and built a fleet for the
                    protection of the coast; a very wise precaution, for the Saracens had already
                    begun to swarm all over the sea of Africa. Had Wamba been succeeded by monarchs
                    of equal prudence and activity, the scourge of Saracenic domination, the
                    greatest perhaps that ever afflicted any people, would probably have been for
                    ever avert ed from Spain. In consequence of having sunk into a deathlike trance,
                    in which state he was apparelled in the garments of the grave, Wamba was
                    compelled to relinquish the crown (680).</p>
                <p>One of the most celebrated names in the line of Gothic princes is that of
                    Roderick, who ascended the throne in 709. He owed his elevation to a party which
                    rose against his predecessor Witiza, whose two sons, with their relations, Count
                    Julian, governor of the Gothic possessions in Africa, and Oppas, an archbishop,
                    are supposed to have aided the</p>
                <p>Saracens in their design of conquering the Peninsula. At all events, the party
                    which they formed against Roderick weakened the Gothic monarchy, and thus gave
                    encouragement to the Moors to make a descent on the country, which they effected
                    in 711. Roderick marshalled a large army, amounting, it is said, to 90,000 men,
                    and advanced against the audacious infidel. The hosts met upon the plains of
                    Xeres, where was fought a battle, so bravely contested on either side that it
                    seems scarcely unworthy to have decided the fate of a kingdom. For three days,
                    from sunrise to sunset, the embattled squadrons fought with equal ardour and
                    obstinacy, till victory at last declared for the Mahom medans. Roderick himself
                    is believed to have perished in the conflict, as he was never heard of more. By
                    this decisive battle the Moors made themselves masters of nearly the whole of
                    Spain. The wretched remains of the Goths retired into the mountainous parts of
                    Asturias, Burgos, and Biscay, where they maintained their independence, and
                    perpetuated their monarchy. In a few years their power began to revive under the
                    renowned Pelagio or Pelayo, a prince of the royal blood. But before noticing the
                    exploits of this warrior, we shall take a brief view of the political, civil,
                    and religious condition of the people subject to the Gothic monarchy.</p>
                <p>The local divisions of Spain, as already laid down, under went little or no
                    change until some time after the descent of the Mahommedans. The power possessed
                    by the Gothic kings was considerable; but its exercise was greatly controlled by
                    the nobles, in general a fierce, turbulent, and haughty body. The jurisdiction
                    of the monarch was not confined to affairs purely temporal. He nominated
                    bishops, presided, if he chose, at ecclesiastical tribunals, convoked national
                    councils, and regulated the discipline of the church. Next to the king in civil
                    dignity were the dukes, who appear to have been governors of provinces. After
                    them came the counts, whose jurisdiction is supposed to have been confined to
                    particular cities. A number of other functionaries were subordinate to these;
                    and besides the officers of the crown, each city or town had its municipal
                    council. Of course there were regular courts of law in stituted throughout the
                    country, where justice was administered; the forms of procedure in these
                    tribunals being much the same as those practised in the Spanish courts at the
                    present day, but less tedious. There was a Visigoth code of laws, partly of
                    Gothic, partly of Roman origin. If we pass from the civil to the military state
                    of the country, we find that the Goths were a nation of soldiers, the obli
                    gation of service being imperative on all freemen. After the Gothic power was
                    established in Spain, the constitution of the church underwent important
                    changes. The pope was acknowledged as supreme head, and metropolitan sees were
                    formed, which exercised an ecclesiastical jurisdiction over the suffragan
                    bishops. The bishops possessed an irresponsible power over the rectors,
                    displacing or removing them at pleasure. The cathedrals and parish churches were
                    in general well endowed; lay patronage existed, and monasteries were introduced.
                    As in other countries, the ecclesiastical councils were of a threefold
                    description, diocesan, provincial, and national, convoked respectively by the
                    bishop, the metropolitan, and the king. The Goths present nothing of literature
                    worthy of particular notice. If we pass to the domestic arts, we find still less
                    to admire; in every thing they consulted the useful in preference to the
                    beautiful or magnificent. It is therefore to be concluded, that however devout,
                    temperate, honest, and sincere the Goths might have been, as many historians
                    attest, yet Spain under their dominion made little advancement in civilization
                    and the elegant arts.</p>
                <p>The Moors under Tarik and Musa subdued the fairest portion of Spain, including
                    the largest and strongest cities of the kingdom, with a rapidity which shows how

                    xml:id="kp-eb0720-0568-0494"/> ly the power of the Goths was broken. Still many
                    of them preferred independence under severe privations amidst the wild rocks of
                    the Asturias, to abundance and plenty on the fertile plains of Murcia. At the
                    head of those who sought a refuge in this mountain sanctuary was Pelayo, a
                    prince of royal Gothic blood, and who is recognised by Spanish historians as
                    having acceded to the throne in 718; Theo domir, the legitimate monarch, having
                    ingloriously submitted to the yoke of the infidel. Numbers of his countrymen
                    flocked to his standard, and his force became at length so formidable as to
                    create alarm in the Saracens. A large army was despatched to the Asturias to
                    crush the rising insurrection; but in attempting to gain the position where
                    Pelayo and his resolute followers were strongly posted, the Moors were repulsed
                    with a slaughter so terrible, that for some years they showed no inclination to
                    assail their for midable neighbours. Various successes followed, and the
                    Asturias, now left in the undisturbed possession of Pelayo and his band, became
                    the asylum of the liberty and the re ligion of the Christians in Spain. It
                    formed the nucleus of a kingdom, which was destined slowly but surely to
                    increase in size from century to century, until the invaders were finally
                    expelled from the Peninsula. Little more is known of Pelayo, than that he gained
                    repeated victories over the Moors, and died in peace in 737. He was succeeded by
                    his son Favila, whose reign was brief and his end tragical, he having been
                    killed by a wild boar in 739. The subsequent history of Spain is rendered so
                    confused by the numerous kingdoms established by Christians and Moors, that some
                    chronological guide is necessary to render it intelligible. We shall therefore
                    present a chronological list of the various sovereigns who reigned over
                    different parts of the country, which had been erected into distinct and
                    independent sovereignties. The dates given mark the years in which the
                    sovereigns acceded to the throne; the intervening periods, of course, indicate
                    the du ration of their respective reigns. We shall commence with the Mahommedan
                    succession, as during the earlier centu ries the greater part of Spain was
                    subject to the Moors.</p>

                    united with Castille in 1516.</p>
                <p>COUNTS OF BARCELONA.</p>
                <p>During the early period of Mahommedan domination in Spain, Barcelona and all
                    Catalonia were subject to it. In the year 801, however, the Moors were expellled
                    from Bar celona, and a count named Bera, a native of Gothic Gaul, was nominated
                    head of the independency. The names of his successors, eleven in number, are too
                    insignificant to require mention individually. Alfonso Raymond, the last count,
                    acceded to power in 1131. On his death, Barcelona was united with Aragon.</p>
                <p>To give a connected history of these various sovereign ties is quite incompatible
                    with our limits. We can only briefly describe those more important transactions
                    affecting the whole country, in which the Christians, by wresting portions of
                    soil from the Moors, compelled them to retire within narrower limits, and thus
                    circumscribed their power. Alfonso and Fruela, the sovereigns who immediately
                    succeeded Pelayo’s son, inflicted several severe blows on the Moors, and overran
                    a considerable portion of the flat coun try. But what proved a more effectual
                    check upon the Saracens than the arms of the Christians, were their own domestic
                    quarrels. So mutable had been the govern ment, that in the space of only forty
                    years from the period of their first landing in Spain, no less than twenty emirs
                    had been called, or had raised themselves, to the seat of power. On the
                    establishment of a monarchy under Abderahman, intestine revolt was quelled for a
                    time; but a more formidable foe from without made his appearance. This was no
                    other than the celebrated Charlemagne, who poured his legions over the Pyrenees
                    into the valleys of Catalonia. We shall not discuss the much agitated question
                    as to the motives which brought this emperor into Spain. He appears to have
                    received an invitation from some discontented Moorish governors; and in acceding
                    to their request, he probably also listened to the dictates of his own ambition.
                    Certain it is that he entered Spain with a powerful army, and, if we can trust
                    his historian Eginhard, subjected the country from the Pyrenees to the Iberus.
                    But he was soon recalled from the Peninsula by the revolt of the Saxons. In his
                    passage through the mountain defiles, the rear of his army was attacked by the
                    Navarrese, and cut to pieces.</p>
                <p>It seems certain, that from the period when Charlemagne poured his legions into
                    Navarre, he considered the country as a fief of his crown, and thus gave great
                    umbrage to the Asturian kings. But the inhabitants of the province, averse to
                    the sway of either, longed for independence, and this they succeeded in
                    achieving about the year 885. The rise of this kingdom was another blow to the
                    Saracens. So signal were the successes gained over them by the Chris tians of
                    Navarre, that in the year 920 not a Mahommedan remained in the whole kingdom
                    north of the Ebro. The kings of Asturias and Leon also rapidly extended their do
                    minions. Ordofio II. invaded the Mahommedan possessions, and gained many
                    advantages. In 932, Ramiro II. made an irruption into the states of the enemy,
                    and ruined Madrid. Arabian writers boast of terrible reprisals having been made
                    on the Christians, and assert that Ramiro himself was defeated. The Saracens
                    having invested Zamora, Ramiro approached with a formidable army. The combatants
                    met, and a battle ensued, more obstinately con tested and bloody than any that
                    had been fought since the days of Roderick. There can be no doubt that victory
                    shone on the banners of the Christians, but the success was less splendid than
                    their writers assert it to be. The ac counts of all the battles fought between
                    the Moors and the Christians in Spain are to be received with caution. The
                    Arabian writers, to exalt the prowess of their countrymen, exaggerate mere
                    skirmishes into great battles, and temporary and partial checks into decisive
                    victories. In equivocal cases, they seem invariably to claim the advantage; and
                    where they were defeated, they either obscurely hint the fact, or diminish the
                    loss which they sustained. It is to be feared, that in many instances Christian
                    chronicler* are chargeable with similar partiality.<pb break="no"

                    The reign of Abderahman III. (912) has been extolled as the most brilliant
                    period in the history of the Spanish Arabs. Commerce flourished, and riches were
                    accumulated to an unexampled extent. A powerful navy was formed, and maintained
                    in full activity; the arts and sciences were cultivated with ardour, because
                    their professors were re warded with princely liberality; many splendid works
                    were undertaken in the towns of Mahommedan Spain; and the king himself was the
                    friend of industry and of merit. Still none of the territories which had been
                    lost in previous reigns was recovered, and the Christians were gradually
                    becoming more and more formidable to the Moors, when Mohammed, better known as
                    Almanzor, appeared to restore the glory of the Saracen arms. He was an eminent
                    general, an enlightened statesman, and a patron of the liberal arts. His
                    campaigns against the Christians proved most fatal to them. The towns were
                    ruined, the open country was ra vaged, and once more the mountains of Asturias
                    became the inaccessible asylum of the native monarchy. At length the three
                    powers, Navarre, Castille, and Leon, entered into a confederacy to repel the
                    common foe. The armies met at a place situated between Soria and Medina Celi,
                    where a drawn battle was fought. This check, and the fearful loss which he had
                    sustained, so mortified Almanzor, that he sunk under the weight of his despair,
                    and died, some assert by voluntary abstinence from food, in the year 1001. An
                    event of some importance to the Christian cause was the erection of Castille
                    into a distinct kingdom, by Sancho el Mayor, king of Navarre, the most powerful
                    prince of his age and coun try. Besides Sobrarve, he held the lordship of
                    Aragon; and in 1026, in right of his wife, a princess of Castille, he became
                    king of that country. By his conquests he considerably extended his dominions;
                    and the marriage of his son Fernando to the heiress of Leon gave him influence
                    in the affairs of that kingdom; so that at the period of his death, in 1035, he
                    was virtually master of all Christian Spain except Catalonia. Before his death
                    he divided his states among his sons, and Aragon fell to the share of Ramiro.
                    The in dependence of Aragon as a separate kingdom is therefore to be dated from
                    1085, the year in which Ramiro I. obtained possession of the throne.</p>
                <p>About the middle of the eleventh century Spain may be said to have been divided
                    into two unequal parts, by a straight line drawn from east to west, from the
                    coasts of Valencia to a little below the mouth of the Duero. The country north
                    of this belonged to the Christians, who as yet had the smallest and least
                    valuable portion, while all the rest belonged to the Moors. In point of wealth
                    and real power, both by land and sea, the latter were much superior to the
                    former; but their perpetual dissensions materially weakened them, and every day
                    facilitated the progress of the Christians. Indeed, had either party been
                    united, the other must soon have been quelled; but the Christians, although they
                    did not constantly make war upon each other like the Moors, continued from time
                    to time to be so em broiled by domestic feuds, as to be unprepared for striking
                    a decisive blow with the combined armies of all the kingdoms; while the same
                    evils, existing to a still greater ex tent amongst the Mahommedans, rendered it
                    impossible for their monarchs to take advantage of the untoward state of the
                    affairs of the Christians. Among the Moors almost every city was a kingdom; and
                    as these petty sovereignties supported one another very indifferently, they, one
                    after an other, fell a prey to their enemies. The rapidity with which the
                    kingdom of Cordova fell to pieces has few examples in history. Alfonso I. king
                    of Aragon, also of Navarre, and for some time of Castille and Leon, is reckoned
                    among the most valiant princes of Spain. From his warlike habits he was surnamed
                    <hi rend="italic">El Batallador.</hi> He conquered Tudela, Saragossa, Tarragona,
                    Calatayud, Daroca, Mequinencia, and much of the country south of the Ebro. Since
                    the con quest by the Arabs, he was the first who carried the Chris tian ensigns
                    into Andalusia. In 1134, however, he lost a great battle, and either perished in
                    the conflict or died of grief shortly afterwards. This was a misfortune, but the
                    misfortunes of the Christians were in general soon repaired, although for nearly
                    a century their conquests were less brilliant than those achieved by <hi
                    rend="italic">El Batallador.</hi> At the commencement of the thirteenth century,
                    indeed, the Moors gained some decided advantages, and reduced several important
                    towns. But the balance was restored on the celebrated plains of Tolosa, where an
                    enormous army of Moors from Africa was nearly annihilated. Alfonso of Castille
                    having made some destructive inroads into Andalusia, Mo hammed Abu Abdalla,
                    emperor of Barbary, prepared to punish his audacity. It is related, on credible
                    authority, that one of the five divisions of the army which he assembled
                    mustered 160,000 combatants. To meet this over whelming host, the Christian
                    kings, fortunately at this juncture brought to terms of amity with one another,
                    united their armies at Toledo, where they were joined by nume rous volunteers
                    from Portugal and France. On the 16th of July 1212 the Christian army descended
                    the mountainous chain which divides New Castille from Andalusia into the plains
                    of Tolosa, where the Mahommedan army was drawn up in battle array. The conflict
                    which ensued was obstinate and bloody, but victory at length declared for the
                    Christians, and its immediate consequences involved the ruin of the Mahommedan
                    empire in Spain. The thirteenth century is distinguished by other important
                    advantages gained by the Christians. Ferdinand III. king of Leon, afterwards of
                    Castille, by his numerous victories made himself lord of Spain, from the Bay of
                    Biscay to the vicinity of the Guadalquivir, and from the confines of Portugal to
                    those of Aragon and Valencia. In 1233 he triumphed over Aben Hud, king of
                    Murcia, Granada, Cordova, Merida, and Seville; and from that year to 1248 he
                    successively obtained possession of Toledo, Cordova, the whole of Murcia, Jaen,
                    and Seville. The loss of the city of Cordova, which in the eyes of the
                    Mahommedans was sacred alike from its magnificent mosque, and from its having
                    been so long the seat of their caliphs, was a severe blow to their power. About
                    the same time King Jayme, the greatest name in the ancient history of Aragon,
                    and surnamed the conqueror on account of his victories, reduced the Balearic
                    Isles, and obtained other important victories. At this period Mahommedan Spain
                    obeyed three sovereigns, who hated each other as cordially as they were all
                    detested by the Christians. Mo hammed, who ruled in Jaen, was the least
                    powerful, but the most successful, of these petty kings. He successively got rid
                    of his two contemporaries, and fixed his court in Granada, resolving if possible
                    to extend, or at the worst to preserve, his new states against the independent
                    walis or local governors on the one hand, and the Christians on the other. Thus
                    the celebrated kingdom of Granada was found ed in the year 1238, for that of
                    Cordova no longer existed. During two centuries and a half, this Mahommedan
                    state withstood the hostile attacks of its Christian neighbours, and only fell
                    when all Spain became united under one sceptre, and was consequently rendered
                    irresistibly superior to the kingdom of the Moors.</p>
                <p>The first king of Granada was equally valiant in war and wise in council, but he
                    was not in a condition to contend with Ferdinand of Castille. He submitted to do
                    homage to him as his vassal; and during the lifetime of Ferdinand a good
                    understanding subsisted between him and Mohammed. But in succeeding reigns war
                    again broke out between the Moors and Christians. In 1303 the strong fort of
                    Gibraltar was reduced by Ferdinand IV. king of Castille and Leon. But the reign
                    of this prince was mostly one of disaster. An iniquitous league was formed by
                    two native princes, who proposed to share the kingdom be<pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:chi.28490924&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=571" xml:id="kp-eb0720-0571-0497"/>
                    tween them. The kings of France, Portugal, and Gra na&lt;la, were not ashamed to
                    sanction this unhallowed corn pact. The king of Portugal invaded Castille, the
                    king of Granada spread his ravages into Andalusia, and the fate of Ferdinand
                    seemed on the point of being sealed, and his kingdom partitioned among the
                    combined robbers. But dissensions among the confederates, and the want of money,
                    dissolved the league, and saved Spain. The greatest battle which had been fought
                    between the Moors and Chris tians since the mighty African host was destroyed on
                    the plains of Tolosa, took place in October 1340, on the banks of the small
                    river Salado. The Christians under Alfonso of Castille were a very small band
                    compared with the enormous host led by the king of Granada; but the former
                    gained a brilliant victory, the loss of the Moors having been immense. The
                    consequence was the surrender of several fortresses; and in the following year
                    the destruction of the Mahommedan fleet was effected by the Christians.</p>
                <p>It is now necessary to mention some circumstances in the history of Navarre,
                    relative to the intimate connection which so long subsisted between that kingdom
                    and France, and which had a material influence on the destinies of Spain. The
                    male line of the house of Sancho Inigo, founder of the sovereignty, having ended
                    in Sancho VI., who died in 1234, leaving no issue, the Navarrese elected as
                    their future king, Thibault, a French prince, and nephew to the de ceased
                    Sancho. Of this monarch we know little beyond an expedition to Palestine, which
                    he undertook along with several princes of France. His two sons, who
                    successively occupied the throne of Navarre, espoused French princesses, and
                    thus an intimate connection with France was establish ed. The relationship
                    between the two kingdoms became still more close when Queen Jeanne gave her hand
                    to Philip the Fair of France. In short, Navarre became a province of France, and
                    for four reigns has no distinct history. In 1328, however, the kingdoms were
                    again separated, though the sovereigns of Navarre were closely related to those
                    of France. Charles II. surnamed the Wicked, ascended the Navarrese throne in
                    1349, and shortly afterwards married Jeanne, daughter of King John of France.
                    His reign is one of perfidy, intrigue, and dishonourable alliances. Events which
                    belong more immediately to the history of France, led to the arrest of Charles
                    by the French monarch, and his detention in prison for several years. He
                    effected his escape, and again resumed his old practice of intriguing,
                    particularly against the king of France. In 1366 he entered into a league with
                    the celebrated Black Prince of England, for the restoration of Pe dro, surnamed
                    the Cruel, who had been driven from the throne of Castille on account of his
                    many enormities. The expulsion of this detestable monster was the act of an
                    indignant nation, which immediately elevated his bastard brother Enrique, or
                    Henry, count of Trastamara, to the throne of Castille. The exiled king himself
                    appealed in per son to the generosity of the English hero, and the consequence
                    was that the Black Prince led a powerful force across the Pyrenees. In his
                    combined army of English and Normans were some of the flower of English
                    chivalry. Henry made every disposition in his power, resolving to hazard all in
                    a battle. The recollection of the cruelties and oppressions of Pedro’s
                    government were a strong stimulus to his followers, and might have insured
                    success had he only been opposed by Pedro the Cruel and Charles the Wicked; but
                    he had to contend with the victor of Cressy and Poictiers. The battle which
                    decided the fate of the two kings was fought near Logrofio, a few miles south of
                    the Ebro, on the 3d of April 1367. Henry nobly contested the day, as also did
                    his antagonist, who was as brave as he was cruel. The conflict was for a short
                    time desperate, but it terminated in the complete discomfiture of Henry, an
                    event followed by the immediate restoration of Pedro to the Castillian throne.
                    His gallant ally had soon reason to regret his connection with a prince equally
                    perfidious, debauched, and bloody. Edward quitted him in disgust, without
                    receiving payment of the sum promised to the English troops. Pedro, no longer
                    overawed by the Black Prince, who was as humane as he was valiant, immediately
                    set about punishing those whom he either knew or suspected of having been
                    zealous in the cause of Henry. His late disgrace had sharpened his naturally
                    keen appetite for blood; but we pass over the revolting details of the
                    enormities which he committed. They produced their usual effects, the complete
                    alienation of the minds of his subjects from him, and then a conspiracy to put
                    an end to such barbarous tyranny. Henry, who had fled to France, entered Spain
                    with a small force, which, however, soon became augmented to an army. Tyrants
                    have few friends in the hour of adversity, and those who have been bribed by
                    gold or overawed by authority to become their pliant tools, are too easily
                    seduced from their allegiance to be trusted when the day of trial comes.
                    Mohammed V., king of Granada, was induced to take the field in behalf of Pedro;
                    but it was less to aid his ally than to take advantage of the confusion of the
                    times. Pedro’s army gradually melted away, and he himself, compelled to flee for
                    shelter to a fortress, and nearly deserted by his followers, was there shortly
                    afterwards slain by the hand of Henry. Although, as we have already noticed,
                    this prince was a bastard, yet he quietly ascended the Castillian throne, which
                    he bequeath ed to his posterity.</p>
                <p>For nearly a century after these events took place, the history of Spain presents
                    little or nothing that is remark able. The continued and petty hostilities
                    between the native princes, or between any or all of them and the Moors, merit
                    but slight attention. Henry IV. surnamed the Impotent, ascended the throne of
                    Castille in 1454. The mis conduct of this prince, a frivolous and contemptible
                    de bauchee, produced a conspiracy amongst his turbulent nobles, to resist his
                    weak and flagitious administration. He was formally deposed at Avila, in a very
                    extraordinary manner; an effigy which represented him being solemnly de graded
                    from the royal dignities, while at the same time his brother Alfonso was
                    proclaimed king of Castille and Leon. Henry was naturally anxious to punish the
                    rebels, but they assumed an attitude too formidable for him. Civil war produced
                    a total relaxation of the laws, and let loose bands of robbers, who pillaged the
                    open country, and not unfrequently attacked and plundered the towns. In the
                    midst of these troubles the Infante Alfonso died, an event for the present
                    highly favourable to the king. Some attempts to raise the lnfanta Isabella, his
                    sister, to the throne, proved at first abortive; but she was the person upon
                    whom the nobles had set their eyes as the only legitimate successor to Henry. In
                    1469 was laid the foundation of a union which was to prove of such unbounded
                    advantage to Spain. Juan II. of Aragon solicited the hand of Isabella of
                    Castille for his son and heir Don Ferdinand, king of Sicily. By distributing
                    largesses amongst the Castillian nobles, and firmly attaching the archbishop of
                    Toledo to his interest, Juan succeeded in his object. On the 25th of October
                    1469, the royal pair received the nuptial benediction in the cathedral of
                    Valladolid. The negociations had been secretly conducted, and the whole affair
                    was brought to a conclusion without the knowledge of Henry or his queen, a
                    princess as licentious as himself. She had borne a daughter, the Infanta Juana,
                    whom the whole kingdom supposed, on pretty good grounds, to be the fruit of her
                    intrigue with Don Beltran de la Cueva, count of Ledesma, one of Henry’s
                    favourites. No sooner was Henry made acquainted with this precipitate marriage,
                    than he resolved to leave no measure untried for securing the crown to Juana. He
                    caused her to be proclaimed heir ess of his dominions, and in his last will
                    declared her his suc<pb break="no"

                    cessor. But popular opinion is too strong even for princes. The country believed
                    her illegitimate, and on the death of Henry in 1474, Ferdinand V. and Isabella
                    were elevated to the throne of Castille and Leon, it being stipulated that the
                    king and queen should reign conjointly. The king of Portugal at first espoused
                    the cause of Juana; but the alliance was productive of no event of importance,
                    and peace was restored between Castille and Portugal in 1479. The very same
                    year, Ferdinand, by the death of his father, Juan II., was called to the throne
                    of Aragon. Having received the homage of his Aragonese subjects at Saragossa, of
                    the Catalonians at Barcelona, and of the Valencians in the capital of that
                    province, he returned into Castille.</p>
                <p>The reign of Ferdinand and lsabella is distinguished by great events, events of
                    the highest importance, not only to Spain, but to mankind. It was under their
                    auspices that Columbus brought a new world to light, and it was by their arms
                    that the power of the Mahommedans was for ever extinguished in the Peninsula.
                    Their first object was the regulation of the government and the enforcement of
                    the laws, which, from the license of preceding reigns, had fallen into
                    desuetude, or were openly defied. The king and queen were noted for a rigid
                    administration of justice; neither for money nor favour would they spare the
                    guilty: and there was too much to punish and correct not to give their
                    administration a character of severity, which would have had no existence had
                    the country not fallen into a state of civil and political disorganization
                    almost unprecedented. The local judges were overawed by the nobles, and
                    extraordinary judges or corregidors were appointed to see that they did their
                    duty. This not being found sufficient to eradi cate an evil which had existed
                    for centuries, the aid of the Holy Brotherhood was sought and obtained. This
                    association, which had existed since the middle of the thirteenth century,
                    consisted of a number of confederated cities and towns, which maintained a
                    considerable body of troops, in order to protect travellers and pursue
                    criminals, and took cognizance of all violent offences against the laws,
                    appointing courts and judges in various parts of the kingdom. New powers were
                    reposed in this association, so that it be came a powerful instrument in the
                    hands of government, and alike terrible to robber and rebel. By this means the
                    territorial jurisdiction of the seignoral nobles was materially abridged, while
                    the royal prerogative was greatly extended. The prompt and impartial
                    administration of justice restored tranquillity and order; and it had been well
                    for the fame of these sovereigns if their salutary severity had been only
                    directed against the disturbers of the public peace. But unfortunately they were
                    equally severe against all who ventured to differ from the established faith.
                    Against apostates, all converts who, after baptism, reverted to Judaism or the
                    faith of Islam, their hatred was impla cable. Their intemperate zeal led them to
                    establish, or rather to reorganize, an ecclesiastical tribunal, which became
                    proverbial throughout the civilized world for its enormous cruelties and
                    injustice This was the court of inquisition.</p>
                <p>We now approach what is not only an important event in the reign of Ferdinand and
                    Isabella, but an era in the history of Europe, namely, the conquest of Granada,
                    the last possession of the Mahommedans in Spain. A sovereign so zealous for the
                    Catholic faith as Ferdinand proved himself to be, was not likely to allow such
                    enemies of Christianity to remain long in the Peninsula, if by force of arms he
                    could expel them; and accordingly he early turned his attention to the subject.
                    Every thing conspired to favour his design; the Moorish kingdom was distracted
                    and dis united by a civil war between father and son; and Ferdinand having
                    obtained the bull of Sixtus IV. authorizing a crusade, put himself at the head
                    of his troops, and entered Granada. He continued the war with rapid success;
                    Isabella attended him in several expeditions; and they were both in considerable
                    danger at the siege of Malaga, an important city, which was defended with great
                    courage, and taken in 1487. Baza was reduced in 1489, after the loss of 20,000
                    men. Gaudix and Almeria were delivered up to them by the Moorish king Alzagel,
                    who had first dethroned his brother Alboacen, and afterwards been chased from
                    his capital by his nephew Abdali. That prince engaged in the service of
                    Ferdinand and Isabella, who, after reducing every other place of eminence,
                    undertook the siege of Granada. Abdali made a gallant defence; but all
                    communication with the country being cut off, and all hopes of relief at an end,
                    he capitulated, after a siege of eight months, on condition that he should enjoy
                    the revenue of certain places in the fertile mountains of Alpuxarras; that the
                    inhabitants should retain the undisturbed possession of their houses, goods, and
                    inheritances; the use of their laws, and the free exercise of their religion.
                    Thus ended the empire of the Arabs in Spain, after it had continued about eight
                    hundred years.</p>
                <p>Its overthrow was soon followed by the expulsion of the Saracens from Spain. This
                    expulsion, however, was not entirely effected till the 17th century. Vast
                    numbers of the Moors, indeed, oppressed by their conquerors, abandoned a country
                    where they could not reside with comfort and with freedom. From the reign of
                    Ferdinand of Cas tille, to that of Philip III. of Spain, more than 3,000,000 of
                    these people quitted Spain, and carried with them, not only a great part of
                    their acquired wealth, but that industry and love of labour which are the
                    foundation of national pros perity.</p>
                <p>The conquest of Granada was followed by the expulsion of the Jews, under
                    circumstances of great injustice and atro city. This unhappy people had
                    engrossed the greater part of the wealth and commerce of Spain, yet not being
                    allowed to take away the value of their property in the precious metals, they
                    were compelled to barter it for the produce or manufactures of the Peninsula,
                    and this could not be effected except at a great sacrifice. One alternative was
                    left them, to embrace Christianity. The inquisition <hi rend="italic"
                    >exhausted</hi> first its art and then its fury to accomplish this object, but
                    with comparatively little success. Many, indeed, to save their property, always
                    dear to an Israelite, outwardly at least embraced the faith of the cross; but by
                    far the greater number, in profound despair, and stripped of much of their
                    wealth, took leave of the land of their birth. About the same time that this
                    decree was promulgated, their Catholic majesties concluded an alliance with the
                    emperor Maximilian, and a treaty of marriage for their daughter Juana with his
                    son Philip, archduke of Austria, and sovereign of the Netherlands. To this
                    period also belongs the contract concluded with Columbus for the discovery of
                    new countries; an event which more powerfully than any other attracts the notice
                    of posterity to this splendid reign, and which materially tended to raise the
                    Spanish monarchy above any other in Europe. To Isabella must be ascribed the
                    glory of the enterprise, for she it was who borrowed the sum of money necessary
                    for the armament, and bade the great navigator depart. This great queen died in
                    1504, leaving her daughter Juana, and after that princess her own grandson (the
                    celebrated Charles V.), heirs to the monarchy, but appointing her husband
                    Ferdinand regent of the kingdom till the majority of Charles. The latter years
                    of Ferdinand’s life were embittered by family dissen sions, which broke out even
                    before Isabella had breathed her last. Juana was undoubtedly queen, for the
                    Salic law, which excludes females, never existed in Spain. This was well known,
                    and is important, as bearing on events which happened in more recent times.
                    Philip therefore prepared to enforce his right, while Ferdinand, fond of power,
                    and backed by the will of his late wife, showed a determination to maintain his
                    position in the kingdom. But just as the affairs of Spain were assuming a
                    serious aspect, Philip died,<pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:chi.28490924&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=573" xml:id="kp-eb0720-0573-0499"/>
                    and Ferdinand gradually resumed his authority over the whole country.
                    Insurrection quailed before him, the laws resumed their empire, and prosperity
                    revisited the people. The remaining events of his reign must be briefly summed
                    up. He solicited and obtained the hand of Germaine, niece to Charles of France,
                    in the hope of leaving a male heir to the throne; but his anticipations were not
                    realized. In several expeditions to Africa, important conquests were made in
                    that country, Algiers, Tunis, and other places submitting to become vassals to
                    the king of Spain. In 1511 he went to Italy to assist the pope against the
                    schismatics under the protection of the king of France and the em peror. But
                    into the interminable affairs of Italy, the critical wars carried on by
                    Ferdinand in that country in defence of his Sicilian and Neapolitan possessions,
                    we cannot enter. This war, however, led to one memorable result, and one not
                    very glorious to Ferdinand. Desirous of carrying hostilities into France, he
                    demanded from Jean d’Albret, king of Navarre, permission to march his troops
                    through that country. The Navarrese refused, but at the same time promised to
                    remain neutral. He broke his engagement, however, and entered into an alliance,
                    offensive and defensive, with France. Determined to accomplish his end by force,
                    and to punish the duplicity of the Navarrese, Ferdinand invaded Navarre, and in
                    a short time obtained possession of the whole kingdom, annexing it to that over
                    which he formerly ruled, and successfully defending it against the invasion of
                    the French. This was the last great event of Ferdinand’s life, and, however
                    fortunate for the country, it was by no means honourable to the king. After a
                    lingering illness, his death took place on the 23d of January 1516. In his last
                    will he declared his daughter Juana heiress to all his dominions in Spain and
                    Italy, and after her his grandson Charles. Cardinal Ximenes Cisneros was at the
                    same time appointed sole regent of Castille till the arrival of his grandson.
                    Ferdinand is justly regarded as the founder of the Spanish monarchy; and
                    although his character has some dark stains upon it, intolerant bigotry being
                    not the least conspicuous, he was certainly the greatest prince of his age, and
                    one of the ablest and best that ever swayed the sceptre of Spain. We shall now
                    glance at the civil and political condition of Spain under the Moors and under
                    the Christians respectively, from the period of the Mahommedan conquest till the
                    death of Ferdinand.</p>
                <p>Mahommedan Spain originally comprehended nearly nine tenths of the Peninsula.
                    Murcia, which the Arabs call Tadmir, though governed by the Christian Theodomir
                    and his successor Athanagild, was as much dependent on the Saracens as Andalusia
                    or New Castille. The districts over which the barbarian sway never extended were
                    the mountains of the Asturias, Biscay, Navarre, and an angle of Aragon. Thus not
                    only by far the greatest, but infinitely the most valuable, part of the
                    Peninsula was comprised in the Mahommedan kingdom. Under the viceroys of the
                    caliphs, and the immediate successors of the first Abderahman, that is, during
                    the first three centuries, it was the admiration and terror of Europe. The
                    revenues which the kings of Cordova derived from their ample possessions were
                    doubtless immense, and this enabled them to main tain not only a large army of
                    native troops, but great bodies of foreign auxiliaries. These mercenary soldiers
                    are sup posed by some of the most distinguished Arabian histo rians to have been
                    the principal cause of the downfall of that splendid monarchy. The spirit of
                    nationality was not destroyed; it was fostered by transplantation from the
                    original soil; the Egyptians in Beja and Lisbon; the Persians in Huete; the
                    Assyrians in Granada; the Berbers and Slavones in most of the great cities,
                    especially about the court; the inhabitants of Damascus, Emessa, and of Old
                    Palestine, in Cordova, Seville, Niebla, Medina Sidonia, and Algeziras; became so
                    many rival factions, all eager in the pursuit of power, and all mutually
                    hostile. Their frequent quarrels occasioned great disasters in the state, and
                    allowed the ambitious no less than the desperate a long continued impunity. In
                    this distracted state of the king dom, rebel chiefs contrived to retain and even
                    to extend their governments; while the Christians, ever ready to take advantage
                    of circumstances, drove the Saracens from city to city, and from province to
                    province, till they finally expelled them from the country. After Cordova fell
                    from its proud eminence, the Mahommedan power declined with great rapidity. The
                    rulers of Toledo, Badajos, Beja, Seville, Ecija, Malaga, Granada, Almeria,
                    Lorca, Murcia, Denia, Valencia, Lerida, Saragossa, and Huesea, all openly
                    aspired to independent sovereignty. Many of these petty states were annihilated
                    by the king of Seville; but his own, with those which still remained, were swept
                    from the Peninsula by Yussef, the first emperor of the Almoravides. This African
                    dynasty was again subverted by the still more ferocious Almohades. In the
                    decline of the latter, the local governors again endeavoured to establish inde
                    pendent kingdoms. The Moorish domination thus be came circumscribed within the
                    mountainous region bounded by the sea, and by a line drawn from Malaga through
                    Archidona, Loxa, Guardia, the Sierra de Cazorla, to the environs of Lorca. This
                    small state was still farther limited by the succeeding sovereigns of Castile,
                    from Alfonso el Sabio downwards, till, as we have seen, it was finally
                    subjugated by Ferdinand the Catholic.</p>
                <p>In all the states of Spain, whether Mahommedan or Christian, the government was
                    absolute, but not despotic. If the Christian, as a protection against arbitrary
                    power, could appeal to the legal code of the country which he inhabited, the
                    Mahommedan could also invoke the provisions of the Koran, for the laws <hi
                    rend="italic">of</hi> the followers of the prophet are founded in their
                    religion. Several of the Mahommedan potentates were the munificent patrons of
                    literature and literary men, the names of some of whom are mentioned with
                    respect at the present day. At the close of the eleventh century, Mahommedan
                    Spain could boast of seventy public libraries, and of colleges, or seminaries of
                    learning, in all the principal cities. Thus learning was much encouraged; and
                    among these numerous collections of books were many hundred volumes by native
                    writers. So great, in fact, was the literary reputation of the Spa nish Arabs,
                    that when the caliph of Egypt desired his library to be arranged and indexes to
                    be made, he confided the task to two individuals of that nation. These men of
                    learning comprised historians, poets, grammarians, ora tors, rhetoricians,
                    mathematicians, astronomers, philosophers natural and moral, physicians,
                    lawyers, and divines. It was in the physical and experimental sciences that the
                    people most excelled, and that too at a time when many of the sciences were
                    wholly neglected or totally unknown in the rest of Europe. Their knowledge of
                    botany was far famed; that of chemistry was still more so. Indeed they are to be
                    regarded, if not the founders, at least the regenerators, of that science in
                    Europe. Their skill in medicine was great; in the mathematics they particularly
                    distinguished themselves; the improvements which they made in algebra are well
                    known. Optics and astronomy were much cultivated by them; nor were the useful
                    arts less at tended to, more especially agriculture, including horticulture and
                    planting. The mechanical arts and manufactures were also carried to considerable
                    perfection by the Spanish Arabs. Commerce was deemed no less worthy of
                    encouragement than domestic industry. The fine arts however were less
                    cultivated; but still all the great cities of Mahommedan Spain, Cordova,
                    Granada, Toledo, Va 1encia, Ubeda, Coimbra, were deeply indebted to the Moorish
                    inhabitants; a fact sufficiently proved by the remains of their past
                    magnificence, which still exist.<pb break="no"

                    From the foundation of the Christian states, the extent of territory comprised
                    by each was usually variable, dependent alike on their conquests over the common
                    enemy and among themselves. The relative extent of each at different periods may
                    be briefly noticed. 1. When Pelayo established his little court at Cangus, the
                    <hi rend="italic">Asturian</hi> king dom could only have occupied the
                    mountainous district immediately surrounding that humble capital. By Alfonso I.
                    this territory was extended into Galicia on the west, probably to Aragon on the
                    east, and to the confines of Toledo on the south. Alfonso III. still further
                    amplified the Asturian kingdom, by extending its frontiers to the Sierra de
                    Cuenza, in the territory of Toledo, to the Duero, in Estremadura and Portugal;
                    in one instance even as far as the Guadiana. The capital regularly continued to
                    shift towards the centre of Spain as new territory was acquired. Thus the
                    Asturian kingdom went on increasing till, on the incorporation of Castille with
                    it, and the subsequent conquest of Andalusia by San Fernando, the capital of the
                    monarchy was fixed at Seville. From the reign of San Fernando may be dated the
                    true era of Spanish greatness. Murcia was conquered by his son Alfonso; and by
                    his successors the Moorish kingdom of Granada was first circumscribed and
                    finally subjugated. 2. <hi rend="italic">Navarre</hi> (that is, Spanish
                    Navarre), from its origin to its conquest by Ferdinand V. underwent little
                    change in its dimensions; and its capital was always Pamplona. See the article
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">Navarre.</hi> 3. The <hi rend="italic">Lordship of
                    Barcelona,</hi> which for some time continued dependent on the Carlovingian
                    princes, comprehended anciently, not only Catalonia, but likewise Languedoc. The
                    Spanish frontier, however, was subsequently held as a separate government, to
                    which other lordships were subordinate. The dependence on France was of short
                    duration, and appears nearly to have ceased towards the close of the ninth
                    century, when Wifredo II., count of Barcelona, entirely cleared Catalonia from
                    the infidels. That ruler decrees in the sovereign style, and is re cognised even
                    by the French as the founder of an hereditary state; which continued as
                    independent a sovereignty as any in the Peninsula, till its union with Aragon,
                    about the middle of the twelfth century. 4. <hi rend="italic">Aragon</hi> was at
                    first buta small mountainous region at the foot of the Pyrenees, the capital of
                    which was Jaen, or San Juan de la Pena. The conquest of Sobrarve, Ribagorza, and
                    Pallas, by Ramiro I.; of the Mahommedan fortresses from the Pyrenees to the Ebro
                    by Sancho I.; of Huesea by Pedro; of Tudela, Sara gossa, Calatayud, Daroca,
                    Mequinencia, &amp;c. by Alfonso I., amplified this little lordship into a
                    considerable kingdom, the capital of which in 1119 was transferred to Saragossa.
                    When Lerida and Fraga were reduced by the prince of Aragon, the Balearic Isles
                    and Valencia by Don Jayme el Conquistador, Aragon became, next to Castille, the
                    most extensive and powerful of the peninsular kingdoms.</p>
                <p>The government of all the Christian states was absolute, and in the whole of them
                    latterly it was hereditary. The powers of the sovereign varied at different
                    times; latterly they became very great. He could concede or revoke, interpret or
                    abrogate laws, declare war or make peace, ap point judges, levy and exact
                    contributions, and the like. But still all was to be done <hi rend="italic"
                    >according to the ancient form,</hi> that is, according to established custom.
                    Other restraints were placed upon his power, and it is pretty certain that the
                    Spa nish kings were not commonly tyrannical. The true tyrants were the feudal
                    lords, who were at perfect liberty to exercise almost royal authority within
                    their respective jurisdictions. Of their violence and rapacity there are
                    innumerable com plaints in the national chronicles, and in the acts of the
                    Cortes. It is worthy of remark, that the queens presided with their husbands in
                    the Cortes, the councils, and the tribunals of justice, and that as judges, not
                    merely as spectators. The only great feudatories of the crown, exercising a
                    local jurisdiction, were the condes, who held different ranks and enjoyed
                    different degrees of power. But, from the thirteenth century, the governors of
                    provinces were termed <hi rend="italic">adelantados</hi> (now captains generaD,
                    while those of cities, towns, and fortresses, were known as <hi rend="italic"
                    >alcaldes.</hi> As conquest gave the Christians additional territory, admirals
                    and constables were appointed, with power over the affairs of sea and land
                    respectively. Of the dignities, whatever their names might be, most were
                    doubtless of a mixed nature, partly civil and partly military. But there were
                    functionaries who exercised an exclusively military authority. Among the
                    officers of administration, those of the law must have occupied a prominent
                    place. The judgment in civil or criminal cases properly depended on the counts
                    or viscounts, who some times decided themselves, sometimes in concert with men
                    learned in the law, called counsellors, and at other times they left the duty to
                    the ordinary judges. These counsellors or judges were expressly educated for the
                    office, and otherwise well adapted for such a situation. The forms of
                    proceeding, which were simple and brief, were conducted in public, and the
                    sentence was also openly delivered. From the decision of all the ordinary
                    judges, lay an appeal to the royal tribunal, which also took cognizance of
                    certain offences and cases. Spain can boast of an ample body of laws promulgated
                    during the middle ages.</p>
                <p>As the circumstances of the country altered, and the state of society advanced,
                    it became necessary to extend or limit the existing laws, and to enact new ones.
                    To encourage the cultivation of waste lands, the Christian kings promised to the
                    lower orders, that if they reclaimed unoccupied wastes, formed themselves into
                    small communities, building villages and towns, and defended their pos sessions
                    against the common enemy, they should enjoy cer tain social privileges in
                    addition to the profits of their in dustry. Of these privileges the most highly
                    prized were those which rescued the people from the jurisdiction of their feudal
                    tyrants, which empowered them to elect their own magistrates, to form municipal
                    juntas, and to dispose of cer tain revenues arising from forests and other
                    possessions. It may well be believed that so brilliant a reward attracted many
                    settlers, who were thus at once raised from the rank of serfs to that of
                    citizens. Such was the origin of many <hi rend="italic">fueros,</hi> or
                    provincial laws, which varied in their spirit according to the liberality of the
                    monarch and the relative importance of the colonies. These fueros were de vised
                    with jealous care to preserve the inhabitants from feudal domination. No baron
                    or noble could settle in a community, unless he abandoned his birthright,
                    enrolled himself among the citizens, and owned obedience to the local fuero. So
                    many temptations did these new communities present, in the shape of municipal
                    posts, that many nobles were known to renounce their rank, and class them selves
                    among the plebeians, for the purpose of obtaining them. The defects of such a
                    system were not long in being felt, and a remedy was provided by the
                    introduction of the “Siete Partidas,” so called from the seven parts into which
                    it is divided. It is by far the most comprehensive code of Spain, being taken
                    from the code of Justinian, the Visi gothic, the Fuero Viejo, the local fueros,
                    as well as from the canon law.</p>
                <p>Passing over the much-disputed question regarding the origin of popular
                    representation in Spain, we find that there were present, at the Cortes held at
                    Leon in the year 1188, “the deputies of towns, chosen by lot,” that is,
                    representatives of the people, the third estate. On these municipal towns many
                    important privileges were conferred by successive sovereigns, the direct
                    tendency of which was to abridge the powers of the feudal lords. But even at the
                    brightest period of popular representation, which was the fourteenth century,
                    the representation was never definite. Many of the great towns neglected to send
                    any deputies at all, and those which<pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:chi.28490924&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=575" xml:id="kp-eb0720-0575-0501"/>
                    did return them appear to have observed little proportion in the numbers. Two
                    was the number which ought to have been returned by each, but some towns sent
                    eight, while others of larger size sent only one or two. Indeed it seems highly
                    probable that the privilege of sending deputies was a favour granted by the
                    sovereign to such towns as it was his pleasure to honour. It is preposterous,
                    therefore, to look upon the third estate as consisting of independent repre
                    sentatives of the nation: the members were little better than nominees of
                    royalty, and their numbers could be in creased or diminished just as it suited
                    the purposes of government Much as the popular representation of Castille is
                    extolled by national writers, it seems to have been better adapted for securing
                    and extending the power of the crown, than for protecting the rights of the
                    people. Under Ferdinand and Isabella the last lingering traces of popular
                    liberty were destroyed; but the power of the other orders of the state suffered
                    at the same time a corresponding diminution, as we have already noticed. Such is
                    a brief outline of the government and laws of Castille and Leon, the most import
                    ant of the peninsular kingdoms, and almost the only ones in which the reader
                    will take much interest, or, indeed, regarding which authentic documents remain.
                    It may be mentioned, however, with regard to the kingdom of Aragon, that, with
                    the exception of the lowest order, the serfs of the soil, the Aragonese
                    possessed a greater share of individual liberty than any other people in the
                    Peninsula. The citi zens and nobles frequently coalesced for the purpose of
                    obtaining fueros or privileges from the crown, and when thus united they were
                    generally too powerful to be resisted. Hence numerous concessions were made by
                    successive sovereigns, and an amount of popular freedom obtained by the people
                    which frequently threatened the existence of the monarchy itself. Catalonia and
                    Valencia were always distinct from Aragon, both in government and laws. Each had
                    its Cortes, consisting of three estates, prelates, nobles, and deputies, all no
                    less tenacious of their privileges than those of Aragon.</p>
                <p>Several historians of note, whose works have come down to us, flourished in the
                    various Christian kingdoms of Spain during the period of Mahommedan domination.
                    Poetry sprung up about the middle of the twelfth century, and some very
                    interesting specimens of these ancient compositions still remain, particularly
                    the <hi rend="italic">Poema del Cid.</hi> The old Spanish ballads are well
                    known, and celebrated throughout Europe. The scientific state of Spain, as
                    compared with the Mahommedan, exhibits a lamentable contrast; nor does it appear
                    that in any of the useful arts of life the Spanish Christians were equal to the
                    Moors. The most distinguished place in Spanish science during this period has
                    been as signed to Alfonso X. surnamed el Sabio; but even he was greatly indebted
                    to the Arabians for the perfection which he attained. The theologians of Spain,
                    during the middle ages, were more numerous than all her other writers put
                    together, and the writings of many of these shining lights of the church are to
                    be met with in the libraries of Spain. With regard to religion it is only
                    necessary to state, that the Catholic faith prevailed in full force, and was
                    characterized by the darkest bigotry and the fiercest intolerance, as the doings
                    of the inquisition amply testify.</p>
                <p>Charles I. (V. of Germany) became king of Spain on the death of Ferdinand, but a
                    regency had been nominated to govern the kingdom until he should attain his
                    twentieth year. If the events and transactions in which this monarch was
                    concerned were to be woven into the history of Spain, it would in fact be the
                    history of almost all Europe during the period of his reign. But our business is
                    with events purely peninsular; or if others of a more general character are
                    occasionally noticed, it will be because they are too closely connected with the
                    former to be separated without violence. His foreign wars, negociations, and
                    other trans actions, arose from his position as emperor of Germany, not from his
                    being king of Spain.; and an account of them will be found under the heads <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">France</hi>, <hi rend="smallcaps">Italy</hi>, and <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">England</hi>, to which articles the reader is referred.</p>
                <p>The Cardinal Ximenes Cisneros, to whom the regency had been left by the deceased
                    king, was bitterly opposed in his administration, principally by the nobles of
                    Castille, who, envious of his dignity, displeased with his firmness and vi gour,
                    and hoping for impunity under a young monarch, soon showed a disposition to
                    refuse him obedience. Popular discontent reached a great height; and as his best
                    measures were misrepresented to the king, Charles perceived the necessity of
                    making his appearance in Spain, where he arrived in 1517. Nobles and prelates
                    hastened to meet their sovereign, and among the rest the calumniated Ximenes.
                    But that sovereign he was not destined to see; he suddenly sickened and died,
                    not without suspicions of poison. Charles brought with him a multitude of
                    Flemings from the Nether lands, who soon monopolized the principal situations in
                    church and state, and in all their dealings evinced an unquenchable thirst for
                    gold. The favour extended to these foreigners so incensed the people, that
                    Charles found extreme difficulty in obtaining the homage of the Spaniards.
                    Although they swore allegiance to him, it was on certain stipulated conditions,
                    sufficiently advantageous to them selves. In 1519 occurred an event destined to
                    exercise great influence over his future life, over his hereditary states, in
                    fact over all Europe. This was his election to the imperial throne of Germany,
                    left vacant by the death of his paternal grandfather Maximilian. The Spaniards
                    were pleased that this dignity was conferred on their sovereign; but as the old
                    grievances continued to gall them, they were not so dazzled as to be insensible
                    to their own interests. The leading men of many of the principal cities publicly
                    remonstrated with Charles, and it was only by granting certain concessions that
                    he could keep them from open rebellion. His presence having become absolutely
                    necessary in Germany, he quitted Spain, but proceeded first to England to
                    concert with Henry VIII. the means of humbling the power of the French king,
                    Francis I. This monarch had been a candidate for the imperial diadem; but,
                    disappointed in his ambition, and in hatred of his successful rival, he leagued
                    himself even with the enemy of the Christian faith. He also laid claim to Italy,
                    the Nether lands, and Navarre; so that war was unavoidable, and hostilities
                    immediately commenced; for an account of which see the articles already referred
                    to.</p>
                <p>The turbulence of the times was not likely to be assuaged by the absence of the
                    king from his all but revolt ed territories in the Peninsula. Opposition had now
                    de generated into rebellion; and what before might have been dignified with the
                    name of patriotism, could only be characterized as crafty schemes of personal
                    ambition. Unfortunately for the interests of order, the regency of Castille,
                    where disaffection had assumed the most serious aspect, was held by a man,
                    estimable and virtuous, indeed, but little fitted for such stormy times. The
                    appointment of this in dividual, Cardinal Adrian, who subsequently wore the
                    triple crown, had at the first given great offence to the nobles and deputies at
                    court; but the king, though solicited, would not change him for another. The
                    persons upon whom the fury of the mob fell were chiefly the governors and
                    deputies of the cities and provinces. Many were massacred; open insurrection
                    spread from city to city; and no species of crime was left uncommitted. In this
                    critical position of the royal cause, it was fortunate that Aragon, Catalonia,
                    and most of Andalusia, stood aloof from the confederation. Had they joined it,
                    the evils might have been long protracted, and the whole Peninsula plunged in
                    misery and ruin. But the revolted cities followed one another in making their
                    submis sion to government; and those which did not voluntarily<pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:chi.28490924&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=576" xml:id="kp-eb0720-0576-0502"/>
                    submit were reduced by the royal troops, now augmented to a considerable body.
                    An attempt of the French king to seize Navarre was happily frustrated, so that
                    in 1522 the whole country was restored to tranquillity.</p>
                <p>In July of that year, the emperor, whose presence had been often requested by the
                    royalists, arrived in Spain. It was expected that summary justice would be
                    inflicted on those who had taken a prominent part in the recent disturbances;
                    but on this occasion Charles showed a degree of clemency almost unexampled in
                    history, very few being condemned to suffer. During the remainder of this
                    prince’s reign, the domestic tranquillity of Spain was undisturbed, except by an
                    insurrection of the Moors, which was soon sup pressed. Of two expeditions of the
                    emperor to the African coast, to humble, if not to extirpate, the Mahommedan
                    pirates, one was successful, the other disastrous. He compelled the Grand Turk,
                    who penetrated into the centre of Europe, to retreat; and took his great rival,
                    Francis I. of France, prisoner at Pavia. Such were some of his achievements in
                    his foreign wars, by which the fame of the Spanish arms was ex tended throughout
                    Europe. The mines of the west also had begun to pour their inexhaustible wealth
                    into the country, so that the military and political power of Spain now attained
                    its zenith, and became a source of uneasiness to other nations. In 1525 Charles
                    married the Princess Isabella, sister of Joam III. king of Portugal. The issue
                    of this union was, besides two daughters, the infant Philip, destined to be no
                    less famous than his father. Charles made an ineffectual effort to procure for
                    him the imperial crown of Germany; but in 1554 succeeded in obtaining the hand
                    of the princess Mary of England. That the nuptial ceremony might be per formed
                    with greater splendour, he invested his son with the regal title, by abdicating
                    in his favour his Italian possessions, the kingdoms of Naples and Sicily, and
                    the duchy of Milan. This was but a prelude to a still more extraordinary
                    sacrifice. It appears that from the very prime of life the emperor had meditated
                    a retreat from the world; and that on the death of his mother Juana, in 1555, he
                    was determined on fulfilling his long-cherished project. Many reasons have been
                    assigned for this memorable act, but the principal cause is to be traced to his
                    superstitious temperament; something is also to be allowed for the bad success
                    of his arms during the latter years of his reign. Having concluded a truce with
                    Henry, the successor of Francis, and re called Philip from England, he assembled
                    at Brussels the states of the Netherlands. There, amidst the most imposing
                    solemnity ever witnessed since the days of the Roman Caesars, he resigned the
                    sovereignty of the Low Countries into the hands of his son. With the same august
                    ceremony he resigned the crown of Spain, and the dominions thereto belonging;
                    and from the monastic retreat to which he retired, be sent his resignation of
                    the imperial diadem. The place which he had chosen for his residence was the
                    monastery of St Justus, one of the most secluded and delightful situations in
                    Estremadura. Here, employed in religious observances, passed the latter years of
                    the life of the most powerful sovereign Europe had seen since the days of
                    Charlemagne and the empire of the west. His character has been variously
                    described by natives and foreigners; the former can see little in it to condemn,
                    the latter nothing to admire. His policy was always close, sometimes crooked,
                    and in not a few instances dishonourable. He was no friend either to civil or
                    religious liberty, and may safely be pronounced a bigot. Under him the condition
                    of Spain was more splendid, perhaps also more prosperous, than in any prior or
                    sub sequent reign. Notwithstanding his many wars, the people do not appear to
                    have been overburdened in supporting them, for the New World poured its
                    treasures at his feet. A new impulse was given to national industry by the
                    markets opened for Spanish productions in the transatlantic colonies. But the
                    brightest landscape has its masses of shade. The nobles held a power over the
                    people which was often <hi rend="italic">exercised</hi> with violence.
                    Favouritism to foreigners was practised to an unprincipled extent, and the sale
                    of offices be came a branch of traffic. Another baneful evil was the
                    multiplication of religious orders. Lastly, the exemption from taxation of the
                    nobles and clergy, which threw the whole weight of public contribution on the
                    third estate, in creased the disaffection of that body, and was one of the chief
                    causes of the subsequent decline of the kingdom. For an account of the private

                <p>The reign of Philip II. commenced in 1556, and extend ed to the year 1598. Much
                    of it was occupied in foreign wars, to which we can only briefly advert. For an
                    account of Philip’s long, bloody, and inglorious struggle with his revolted
                    subjects of the Low Countries, see the article <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Holland.</hi> The circumstances which led to the invasion of Portugal, and the
                    annexation of that kingdom to the Spa nish crown, will be found fully detailed
                    under the head Portugal. An attempt was made by the pope, in conjunction with
                    France, to wrest from Philip his Italian dominions, but without success. The
                    duke of Alva, the viceroy of Naples, put his troops in motion, seized several
                    fortresses of the papal states, and the holy city began to tremble for its
                    security. Philip himself invaded France, and inflicted a severe blow on Henry
                    under the walls of St Quentin. The French army, under the duke of Guise, was
                    recalled from Italy; and the pope, left at the mercy of the duke of Alva, was
                    compelled to purchase his safety by withdrawing from the French alliance. In
                    1559 peace was made with France; and Philip having become a widower, further
                    ratified the treaty by marrying Elizabeth, sister of the French king. But the
                    Turks continued to harass Naples, although they durst not make a stand before
                    the Spanish forces. In 1565, Philip assisted the Maltese with 10,000 Spaniards
                    in the famous siege which they underwent from sultan Solyman. Five years
                    afterwards, the war between the Venetian re public and the Porte again brought
                    the Spaniards into collision with the latter power, and they had no small share
                    in achieving the glorious victory of Lepanto. The Mahom medans, however, still
                    continued to make descents on the Italian coast, and to harass the African
                    possessions of Philip; but, on the whole, the war with the misbelievers was
                    honour able to the Spanish arms.</p>
                <p>We now approach an event of peculiar and lasting inte rest to every Briton, the
                    projected invasion of England by the famous Spanish Armada. Elizabeth had
                    certainly done much to provoke the resentment of Philip. She had succoured the
                    insurgents of the Netherlands, fomented the disturbances in Portugal, assisted
                    France, and her naval captains had ravaged the dominions of Spain in both he
                    mispheres. Philip’s patience being exhausted, he prepared a mighty armament for
                    the invasion of England. A complete account of this famous attempt to plant a
                    foreign standard on our shores, and its disastrous termination, will be found in
                    the article <hi rend="smallcaps">England</hi>. A second expedition for the
                    invasion of Ireland shared the fate of the former; and this effectually cured
                    Philip of all ambition to attempt the subjugation of the most hated of his
                    enemies.</p>
                <p>The revolt of the Moriscos occupies a remarkable place in the native annals of
                    the sixteenth century. These Christianized Moors still remained Mahommedans at
                    heart, making amends for compulsory apostasy by celebrating in secret the rites
                    of their religion. It was the jealous policy of Spain to destroy, if possible,
                    every vestige of their nationality. To effect this end the government had re
                    course to severe and unjust measures, which produced open revolt and civil war
                    in Granada. Dreadful atrocities were committed by the Moriscos, and fierce was
                    the retaliation of the Christians. The war raged with various suc cess for some
                    time, but how the struggle must terminate<pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:chi.28490924&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=577" xml:id="kp-eb0720-0577-0503"/>
                    could never for a moment be doubtful. The Moriscos fled to the mountains, the
                    ancient asylum of liberty; and in the deep caverns with which they abound they
                    deemed them selves secure. But thither they were hunted by the Chris tians, and,
                    like wild beasts, smoked to death by fires kindled at the mouths of these
                    subterranean retreats. All who were in arms were cut off' in this manner, or by
                    the sword. The total expulsion of the Moriscos, however, did not take place till
                    a subsequent period. To some affairs of a private or more trivial nature it is
                    unnecessary to advert, although some of them deeply implicate the character of
                    Philip. This prince died in September 1598, in the palace of the Escu rial, of
                    which he was the founder, and which is the noblest monument of his reign. By the
                    last of his four wives, Anne of Austria, Philip left a son, who succeeded by the
                    title of Philip III.; his other male children preceded him to the tomb. Don
                    Carlos, one of these, is generally believed to have been murdered by the command
                    of his bloody and un relenting father. The character of Philip was gloomy, stem,
                    and cruel; he was suspicious, dark, and vindictive, the irreconcilable foe of
                    civil and religious liberty, for which there can only be brought forward as a
                    palliation his zeal for what he called religion. But Philip was eminently
                    prudent, attentive to public affairs, and what he conceived to be the best
                    interests of his country. It has been supposed that the sceptre of Philip was
                    swayed over 100,000,000 of human beings, including the population of all the
                    foreign pos sessions of Spain. At this time the state of the inhabitants of the
                    Peninsula was one of comparative comfort. Agri culture, manufactures, and
                    commerce, flourished to an ex tent even greater than in the best period of the
                    emperor’s reign. Yet all his vast resources, especially in the New World, were
                    unhappily wasted by Philip; and his own policy destroyed the very foundations on
                    which they rested, and hastened the decay, or rather ruin, of the kingdom. The
                    measures which exercised so fatal an influence over the destinies of Spain may
                    be briefly enumerated. 1. His persecution of the Flemings and Dutch, which led
                    to a re volt that cost him 150,000,000 of ducats; 2. his war with England, no
                    less expensive and disastrous; 3. the treasures sent to support the abominable
                    Catholic league, and wars in other quarters; 4. the subjugation of the Moriscos,
                    and the proceedings of the inquisition, by which the most productive and useful
                    classes of his subjects were ruined or expatriated. From these and from other
                    minor causes, notwithstanding the enormous revenues and resources of the
                    kingdom, Philip died insolvent.</p>
                <p>The greatness of Spain having passed away with Philip II., from this period it
                    declined with fearful rapidity. For a long period there is little to be recorded
                    beyond the reign of worthless favourites, the profligacy of courts, and the
                    feeble efforts of a government struck with mortal paralysis. Our retrospect of
                    these reigns will therefore be charac terized by a brevity corresponding with
                    their importance. The most signal event of Philip III.’s reign was the total
                    expulsion of the Moriscos from all parts of Spain where they had sought a home
                    during the struggle recorded in the last reign. The loss to agriculture and
                    commerce, for they were by far the most ingenious and industrious portion of the
                    community, and the blow which would be inflicted on the national prosperity by
                    the withdrawal of so much wealth as they possessed, were never taken into ac
                    count by the duke of Lerma, the prime ministers, nor any of his inquisitorial
                    councillors. Orders were issued for their immediate expulsion in September 1609,
                    and no fewer than 600,000 individuals were forcibly dragged from their homes,
                    and landed on the African shore, there to be treated even worse, by the most
                    cruel and perfidious of the human family. The foreign transactions of this reign
                    are unimportant. Philip III. died in March 1621, leaving his kingdom to a son
                    who bore his name, and also inherited his imbecility.</p>
                <p>Philip IV. ascended the Spanish throne in his seventeenth year. Profligate
                    extravagance and dissipation soon began to characterize the proceedings of the
                    court, and murmurs and complaints to agitate the people, who were exhausted of
                    their wealth in supporting pantomime and mummery at home, and iniquitous wars
                    abroad. The reins of government were surrendered into the hands of the Conde de
                    Olivares, a worthless favourite. An attempt to enforce an obnoxious measure
                    drove the Catalans to revolt. They sought and obtained the aid of France, and
                    this occasioned a feeble and unimportant war, which languished till 1660, when
                    peace was concluded, but not till Spain had surrendered part of her territory to
                    France. Contemporary with the origin of the Catalan insurrection was that of
                    Portugal, by which the Portuguese freed themselves from the Spanish yoke. See
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">Portugal.</hi> During his long reign, Philip was frequently
                    at war with England, Holland, and France, and every power committed fearful
                    ravages on his territories. England took Jamaica during this disastrous and
                    disgraceful period of Spanish history. In Naples, a terrible shock was sustained
                    in 1646, by the insurrection of Massaniello. See the article <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Naples.</hi> But the most calamitous of Phi lip’s transactions
                    was the war in the Low Countries, which terminated in his recognising the
                    independence of the seven United Provinces. Philip died in 1665. His character
                    needs no description. Since the days of Roderick the Goth, a more disastrous
                    reign than his had not darkened the annals of Spain.</p>
                <p>Charles II. son of Philip IV. succeeded to the throne when only four years of
                    age. As the affairs of the kingdom were then situated, they were not likely to
                    improve under a child; and it was a further misfortune, that throughout his long
                    reign the king remained little better than a child. He was feeble in body, and
                    next to imbecile in mind; in proof of which it may be mentioned, that he
                    believed himself bewitched, and submitted to the exorcisms of his confessor with
                    devout solemnity. Louis of France, who espoused Maria Teresa, sister of Charles
                    II. by a prior marriage, in right of his wife preferred a monstrous claim to the
                    Low Countries, and poured his legions over the frontier to make it good. The
                    union of Sweden, Holland, and England, to oppose the ambition of the Frenchman,
                    saved the whole Netherlands from subjugation; but by the peace of Aixla Chapelle
                    Louis retained the most valuable of the conquests which he had made. In this
                    reign the complete independence of Portugal was recognised. In 1672, France
                    invad ed Holland, now the ally of Spain, conquered Franche Comté, which belonged
                    to Spain, made some destructive in roads into Catalonia, and reduced some
                    fortresses in the Low Countries. By the alliance against France, in which
                    England, Germany, and Spain joined, Louis’s career of ambition was effectually
                    checked. But subsequently he reduced Valenciennes, Cambray, St Omers, and other
                    places; Ypres and Ghent were assailed with equal success; and a place on the
                    Catalan frontier also yielded to his arms. Most of these places, however, were
                    restored at the peace of Nimeguen in 1078, one of the conditions of which was,
                    that Charles should receive the hand of Maria Louise, niece of the French king.
                    On the death of this princess in 1689, the French again poured the storm of war
                    over the frontier of Catalonia. Destitute of money and of troops, Spain trembled
                    to her most distant extremities. But circumstances of a delicate nature, into
                    which we shall not enter, induced Louis to restore all his conquests at the
                    peace of Ryswick in 1697. The health of Charles, always infirm, now rapidly
                    declined, and he expired on the 1st of November 1700. He was the last of the
                    Austrian dynasty; and glorious as the condition of Spain was under its early
                    sovereigns, those who succeeded them had brought the kingdom to the verge of
                    ruin. From the accession of the third Philip it had declined, from causes
                    already specified.<pb break="no" facs="ht:chi.28490924&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=578"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0720-0578-0504"/> The condition to which it was now reduced was
                    pitiable. The army and navy were in a state of utter disorganization; the walls
                    of towns and fortresses were in ruins; the public revenues had dwindled to
                    little more than a nobleman’s in come; and trade, manufactures, and commerce,
                    had all but ceased to exist. Another such reign as that of Charles II. would
                    have dissolved the bonds of society.</p>
                <p>Charles II. was succeeded by Philip V. duke of Anjou, grandson to Louis XIV. of
                    France. He was the eldest son of Maria Teresa, eldest daughter of Philip IV.,
                    consequently the most legitimate sovereign; for Charles left no issue, and
                    before his death he had subscribed an instrument, declaring Philip his
                    successor. The foreign events of this reign demand our first attention. The
                    transactions of the war which was soon declared against France and Spain, by
                    England, Holland, and the empire, assisted by Savoy, Por tugal, and Prussia,
                    have been already related under the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Βritian.</hi>
                    The chief objects of the alliance were to obtain satisfaction for the Austrian
                    claims on Spain, the emperor Leopold being not only descended from Fernando,
                    brother of Charles V., but whose mother was the daughter of Philip III.; to
                    rescue the Netherlands from France; to prevent the union of the French and
                    Spanish crowns; and to exclude subjects of the former from the Spanish
                    possessions in the West Indies. The treaty of Utrecht, which terminated the
                    differences between the principal contending powers, was signed in 1713; and in
                    1715 a permanent peace was concluded between Spain and Portugal. By the
                    celebrated treaty of 1713, Spain was stripped of half her European possessions.
                    Philip was indeed acknowledged king of Spain and the Indies; but Sicily was
                    ceded to the duke of Savoy; Milan, Naples, Sardinia, and the Nether lands, to
                    the emperor; and Gibraltar and Minorca to the English. The Catalans, who had
                    revolted and joined the allies, were likewise guaranteed a general amnesty, but
                    without any stipulations for the preservation of their ancient fueros or
                    privileges, which they had justly forfeited. Philip also renounced, both for
                    himself and his successors, all claims to the French crown. In return for this
                    renunciation, he forced rather than persuaded his council to introduce a measure
                    to which subsequent events in the history of Spain gave great importance. This
                    was to alter the order of succession, and establish a sort of Salic law, by
                    which the most distant male of the family would be called to the inheritance in
                    preference to the nearest female. The innovation was regarded with discontent.
                    By the ancient law, which, in default of direct male issue, called females to
                    the throne, the monarchy had been formed. By it Catalonia had been united with
                    Aragon, and the latter with Castille; and by it Philip himself had inherited the
                    crown.</p>
                <p>Philip made an unsuccessful attempt to recover Sicily, Sardinia, and Naples; for
                    he had now rendered both his navy and his army formidable alike by discipline
                    and num bers. His fleet, however, was totally destroyed off the coast of Sicily,
                    by our Admiral Byng, in the year 1718.</p>
                <p>By a new treaty in 1720, Sardinia was given to the duke of Savoy, and Sicily to
                    the emperor; and by the treaty of Seville, concluded in 1729, the duchies of
                    Tuscany, Parma, and Placentia, were ceded to Spain. In 1731, the Spanish king
                    invaded Naples, took possession of that kingdom, and conferred it on his son Don
                    Carlos, in consequence of which war was declared between Spain and the empire in
                    1733. At the end of that year the palace of Madrid was consumed by fire, and all
                    the archives relating to the Indies perished in the flames. In 1739, hostilities
                    were renewed between Spain and Britain; but the only successes obtained by the
                    latter power were the capture of Porto Bello by Admiral Vernon, and that of the
                    Manilla galeon by Commodore Anson. Philip’s long and turbulent reign was now
                    drawing to a close. In July 1746, he was hurried to the grave by an attack of
                    apoplexy. One memorable event of his reign remains to be noticed. In imitation
                    of the emperor, he resigned the cares of royalty into the hands of his son in
                    1724; but finding seclusion irksome, he resumed them again in a very short time.
                    Whatever might be the weak nesses of this prince, he had a sincere desire for
                    the good of Spain, and retrieved it from hopeless ruin by several judicious
                    measures which he introduced, so that the country attained a degree of positive
                    prosperity unknown since the days of the second Philip.</p>
                <p>Ferdinand VI. a mild, prudent, and beneficent prince, reformed abuses in the
                    administration of justice and management of the finances. He revived commerce,
                    established manufactures, and promoted the prosperity of his kingdom.</p>
                <p>Charles III. succeeded Ferdinand in 1759. The famous family compact was concluded
                    at Versailles in 1761, among the four kings of the house of Bourbon. The
                    English, alarmed by the naval preparations of Spain, declared war in 1762, and
                    took Havannah in the island of Cuba, and Manilla in the East Indies.
                    Notwithstanding this success, peace was hastily concluded at Fontainebleau, in
                    Novem ber, by which the Havannah was restored. In 1767 the Jesuits were expelled
                    from Spain. An unsuccessful <hi rend="italic">expedition</hi> was concerted
                    against Algiers in 1775, the particulars of which it is unnecessary to detail.
                    In the war between Great Britain and her American colonies, Spain, by the
                    intrigues of the French court, was instigated to take up arms in support of the
                    latter. At the conclusion of that calamitous war, Great Britain, in a treaty
                    with Spain, ceded to this power East and West Florida, and the island of
                    Minorca. Charles died in 1788, and was succeeded by his second son Charles
                    Anthony, prince of Asturias, the eld est having been declared incapable of
                    inheriting the crown.</p>
                <p>Charles IV. had not long been seated on the throne be fore the portentous
                    revolution in France involved Europe in a general scene of political and
                    military contest. The king of Spain joined the general confederacy against the
                    new republic, and in consequence was numbered among the objects of its
                    resentment, by a declaration of war in 1793. The military operations of Spain,
                    however, were extremely languid; and after two campaigns, in which she might be
                    said to carry on rather a defensive than an offensive war against the republican
                    armies, she was compelled to conclude a treaty of peace, which was signed at
                    Basel on the 22d July 1795. By this treaty the French republic restored to the
                    king of Spain all the conquests which she had made from him since the
                    commencement of hostilities, and received in exchange all right and property in
                    the Spanish part of St Domingo.</p>
                <p>This treaty was soon followed by <hi rend="italic">a</hi> rupture with Great
                    Britain. On 5th October 1796, the court of Spain having published a manifesto
                    against this country, the court of London made a spirited reply; and about the
                    same time was published a treaty of offensive and defensive alliance, which had
                    been concluded about two months before, between the king of Spain and the French
                    republic. In the war which followed between Spain and Great Britain, his
                    Catholic majesty could boast of but little honour or success; and the French
                    republic gained little from its new ally but the contributions of money which it
                    from time to time compelled him to advance. On the 14th of February 1797, a
                    Spanish fleet of twenty-seven sail of the line was defeated by Sir John Jervis
                    off Cape St Vincent, and four of the Spanish line-of-battle ships were left in
                    the hands of the victors. From this time till the temporary cessation of
                    hostilities by the peace of Amiens in 1802, there is nothing remarkable in the
                    transactions of Spain.</p>
                <p>On the renewal of the war in 1803, Spain was again compelled, by the overbearing
                    power of France, to take an active part against Great Britain, and fitted out a
                    formidable fleet, which was united to a considerable naval force belong<pb

                    xml:id="kp-eb0720-0579-0505"/> ing to the French. The Spanish declaration of war
                    against Britain is dated at Madrid on the 12th of December 1804; and on the 21st
                    of October 1805, the combined fleets of France and Spain were annihilated by
                    Lord Nelson off Cape Trafalgar. After this terrible blow to the naval power of
                    Spain, nothing of importance took place till 1808, when the liberties of Spain
                    were subverted by the machinations of Napoleon. The designs of the French
                    emperor, long suspected, became sufficiently apparent in 1808. Unfortunately the
                    dissensions of the royal family of Spain were so favourable to his plans, that
                    they may be said to have hurried on their execution. The dark and tortuous
                    policy by which he effected his purpose, and the course which events took in
                    Spain, will be found detailed in the article <hi rend="smallcaps">France</hi>,
                    so that only a brief notice of the leading facts will be given in this place. At
                    this time (1807) the management of state affairs was in the hands of Don Manuel
                    Godoy, the favourite of Charles IV. and his queen, and better known by the name
                    of the Prince of Peace. He had been raised from the humblest station to be the
                    richest and most powerful subject in the kingdom, and to fill its highest posts.
                    Ferdinand, the prince of Astu rias, had refused to marry the sister-in-law of
                    this fortu nate minion, and to secure himself from his vengeance he wrote to
                    Napoleon asking for protection. At the same time he exposed the administration
                    of Godoy, in a letter to his father, and requested to be allowed some
                    participation in the government. This so enraged the queen that she ordered his
                    immediate arrest; but, on asking pardon of the king, Ferdinand was restored to
                    liberty, not however before Charles had taken the fatal step of appealing to
                    Napoleon regarding his son’s supposed treasonable conduct. The emperor of France
                    was thus constituted umpire between father and son. French troops poured into
                    Spain, which was thrown into a ferment by the rumour that the royal family were
                    preparing to fly to America. Popular indignation was kindled against the hated
                    favourite, who narrowly escaped with his life. At length Charles abdicated in
                    favour of his son, but two days afterwards privately protested against his own
                    act, and sent a copy of this strange paper to Napoleon, who afterwards made it a
                    pretext for his ulterior designs.</p>
                <p>The prince of Asturias, now elevated to the throne un der the title of Ferdinand
                    VII. made his triumphal entry into Madrid. Shortly afterwards he was induced to
                    under take a journey to Bayonne to meet Napoleon, and consult about the affairs
                    of the kingdom. This memorable inter view took place, and the eyes of Ferdinand
                    were now thoroughly opened to the designs of the French emperor, by finding
                    himself a captive in his hands, and his right to be considered king of Spain
                    rudely denied. The rest of the royal family eagerly rushed into the snare set
                    for them by the master of toils at Bayonne. Here father and son sur rendered the
                    crown of Spain into the hands of Napoleon, by whom it was transferred to the
                    head of his brother Joseph. But such a momentous event as a change of dynastics,
                    effected under circumstances of such atrocious perfidy, could not take place
                    without rousing every loyal and every indignant feeling in the bosoms of the
                    Spanish people. No sooner was the fact of the renunciation known, than the
                    northern provinces burst into open insurrection. Asturias and Galicia set the
                    example; and it was soon followed by almost every part of Spain not immediately
                    occupied or overawed by the armies of France. One of the first steps taken by
                    the leaders of the insurrection was to assemble the juntas or general assemblies
                    of the provinces. When these were organized, they issued proclamations, calling
                    on the Spaniards to rise in defence of their sovereign, and in the assertion of
                    their own independence. Besides these proclamations from the provincial juntas,
                    addresses were published in almost every province by the leaders of the popular
                    cause; in particular, the province of Aragon was addressed by Palafox, a name
                    celebrated in the annals of the Spanish revolution, in a bold and spirited
                    manifesto. The junta of Seville, which assembled on the 27th of May, formed
                    itself into a supreme junta of government, caused Ferdinand to be proclaimed
                    king of Spain, took possession of the military stores, and issued an order for
                    all males from sixteen to forty-five, who had no children, to enroll themselves
                    in the national armies. On the 4th of July the alliance of Great Britain with
                    the Spanish nation was proclaimed, and a struggle began which terminated in the
                    complete ex pulsion of the French from the Peninsula. The events of this
                    celebrated war will be found recorded in the article <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Britian</hi>.</p>
                <p>The loss of the royal family, by which they were deprived of a directing power, a
                    legitimate head to give the constitutional stamp to their proceedings, plunged
                    the Spaniards in great difficulties. Unity of opinion was wanting to the junta,
                    and vacillation and weakness marked its proceedings. It was unfortunate, that
                    while one spirit animat ed the mass of the people against the French, many of
                    the nobles and other influential individuals had given in their adhesion to the
                    French dynasty. The successes of the lat ter were attributed, probably not
                    without some reason, to treachery; and more than one Spanish general fell a
                    victim to public indignation, whether justly or unjustly cannot now be known.
                    But whatever victories the French gained, they only remained masters of the
                    places which they occu pied. A vast system of guerilla warfare had been
                    organized and vigorously prosecuted, which served to preserve the energy and
                    confidence of the nation unbroken. The guerillas everywhere surrounded and
                    harassed the French; no line of communication was safe for them. These petty
                    achievements, however, could not compensate for the loss of battles on a large
                    scale, and the capture of fortresses, the strongholds of the kingdom. The
                    supreme junta fell under suspicion, and, unable to sustain the weight of
                    government and the storm of public indignation, it was agreed that the Cortes
                    should be convoked, and a regency appointed. The manner in which this celebrated
                    Cortes was constituted has been a subject of keen disputation; but the
                    circumstances in which the kingdom was placed at the time, rendered it
                    impossible for the members being chosen according to the ancient forms. It has
                    been alleged that this assembly was of a much more popular and democratic nature
                    than the regular Cortes, which is undoubtedly the fact. It ought to be
                    recollected, however, that the nobles were a suspected body, and therefore the
                    burgesses and others might consider it dangerous to admit their voice in a
                    matter which involved the liberties of the kingdom. But, we repeat, the
                    situation in which Spain stood at this eventful moment made it a matter of
                    necessity for those who directed the affairs of the nation, to act as they did.
                    Had not the progress <hi rend="italic">of</hi> the French armies dispersed the
                    central junta, and concentrated the fugitive patriots at Cadiz, it is more than
                    probable that the Cortes would have been assembled according to the ancient
                    forms, and that the privileged classes, supported by the majority of the nation,
                    would have defeated any attempt to alter the old constitution. But Cadiz offered
                    to that par ty which has been since known by the name of liberal, the most
                    favourable opportunity of striking a deadly blow at the very root of the
                    monarchical power under which they had so long groaned in hopeless yet silent
                    restlessness. Cadiz was not only in itself a place much more democratic than any
                    other in Spain, but during the usurpation of the French it had become the asylum
                    of all who professed liberal prin ciples. As they generally belonged to that
                    numerous class of the Spanish gentry who look up to the patronage of <hi
                    rend="italic">government</hi> for the means of subsistence, the court drew them
                    together from the provinces. On the prospect of the political changes which the
                    captivity of Ferdinand opened to the country, these men attached themselves to
                    the central junta, and finally followed its members in their flight from<pb

                    xml:id="kp-eb0720-0580-0506"/> Seville to Cadiz. Hither, too, flocked all the
                    stragglers of the philosophical party; and on the dissolution of that dull,
                    dilatory knot of ill-assorted men, who, under the veil of dignified gravity, had
                    for a time concealed their unfitness to direct the nation, the Spanish
                    speculatists found themselves in the midst of a population highly disposed to
                    listen to their doctrines, to approve their views, and constitute them the
                    organs of the new laws which were to remodel the kingdom.</p>
                <p>The majority of the first Cortes being composed of liberals, the project of a
                    constitution was immediately set on foot, and a committee of the ablest members
                    appointed to draw up the fundamental code of the monarchy. Such a task, at all
                    times arduous, was, in the present circumstances of the country, beset with
                    peculiar difficulties. Encouraged by the absence of the king, placed beyond any
                    check from the privileged classes, and the weight of the landed property of the
                    country, it is not surprising that the framers of the constitution allowed their
                    zeal to carry them too far, especially when it is considered that the Spanish
                    people were almost entirely unaccustomed to the exercise of civil rights. The
                    government was wholly remodelled, so that from being the most absolute monarchy
                    in Europe, it became the most strictly limited of all limited monarchies. As
                    this constitution, with the exception of a few alterations, is nearly the same
                    as that which is now in force, our introducing it in this place will serve to
                    give greater clearness to the subsequent narrative of events. It was drawn up by
                    184 members of Cortes, on the 18th March 1812. On the 20th of the same month the
                    regency, which consisted of Cardinal Bourbon and two other apparently incapable
                    individuals, took the oath to maintain it. This constitution was acknowledged by
                    the allies of Spain, namely, Great Britain, Sweden, Denmark, Prussia, Russia,
                    and other states.</p>
                <p>By one of the first articles in the code, the sovereignty is declared to reside
                    essentially in the nation, which, being free and independent, neither is nor can
                    be the patrimony of any person or family. All Spaniards, without distinction,
                    are subject to taxation. “The religion of the Spanish nation is, and shall be
                    for ever, the Catholic, Aposto lic, and Roman, which is the only true religion.”
                    “The nation,” it is added, “protects it by wise and just laws, and forbids the
                    exercise of any other whatever.” The government of the Spanish nation is stated
                    to be “a limited hereditary monarchy.” The power of making laws is vested “in
                    the Cortes, jointly with the king.” In describing the class of Spaniards who
                    enjoy the privileges of citizenship, per sons “reputed of AÏrican origin, either
                    by the father or the mother’s side,” are excluded. A similar exclusion is given
                    to Spaniards who obtain naturalization in another country, or who, without
                    leave, absent themselves five years from Spain. The only basis for the number of
                    <hi rend="italic">representatives</hi> in the Cortes is <hi rend="italic"
                    >population,</hi> to be taken from the census of 1797, till one more correct can
                    be made. For every seventy thousand souls there is to be one deputy in the
                    Cortes. The returns of the members are made by three successive elections. Every
                    parish appoints electors for the district to which it belongs. These repair to
                    the chief town of the district to choose another set of electors, who, lastly,
                    meeting in the capital of the province, make the final appointment to the
                    Cortes. The Cortes are triennial. No member can be elected for two successive
                    representations. No debate can be carried on in the presence of the king; his
                    ministers may attend and speak, but are not allowed to vote. There is a
                    permanent deputation, or committee of the Cortes, composed of seven members,
                    appointed by the whole body, before a prorogation or dissolution, whose duty is
                    to watch over the executive, and report any infringement of the constitution to
                    the next Cortes. It also belongs to them to convoke an extraordinary meeting of
                    the Cortes in the cases prescribed by the constitution.<note anchored="true"

                <p>The powers of the Cortes are chiefly these: 1 <hi rend="italic">st</hi>, To move

                <p>Laws may be proposed, in writing, by any one of the de puties. Two days after the
                    motion, the bill is to be read a second time. It is then determined whether the
                    subject is to be debated, or to be referre&lt;1 to a committee. Four days after
                    the bill has been voted worthy of discussion, it is read a third time, and a day
                    is appointed for the debate. A majority of votes decides the fate of the bill;
                    the members present on these occasions must exceed half of their total number by
                    one.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Some alteration in
                    the powers of the sovereign was made in 1836. when this constitution was

                    enactment of laws, and should likewise have the power of convoking, proroguing,
                    and dissolving the Cortes; but in the latter case to be under the obligation of
                    assembling others within a given time.</p></note></p>
                <p>The powers of the king are, 1. To suspend the passing of a law, by withholding
                    his sanction. He can exercise this power against any decree of the Cortes for
                    two consecutive sessions; but is compelled to give his assent if the same law is
                    passed by three Cortes successively. 2. The executive power resides exclusively
                    in the king, and extends to whatever relates to the preservation of public order
                    in the interior, and to the external security of the state, ac cording to the
                    constitution and the laws. The privileges and duties of the executive are thus
                    detailed in the consti tution. The king may issue decrees, regulations, and
                    instructions, for the more effectually enforcing of the laws; it is his duty to
                    watch over the administration of justice; he declares war and makes peace, under
                    the control of the Cortes; he appoints judges to all the civil and criminal
                    courts, on the presentation of the council of state; all civil and military
                    employments are of the king’s appointment; he presents to all bishoprics,
                    ecclesiastical dignities, and benefices which may be in the gift of the crown,
                    all by the advice of the council of state; the king is the fountain of honour;
                    the army and the navy are at his command, and he has the appointment of generals
                    and admirals; he has the right of coinage, and the privilege of impressing his
                    bust on the metallic currency of the realm; the king can propose new laws, or
                    amendments to those in existence. It belongs also to him to circulate or
                    withhold the pope’s rescripts and bulls. He can choose and dismiss his own
                    ministers.</p>
                <p>The following checks are imposed on the king’s authority by the constitution.</p>
                <p>1. The king cannot prevent the meeting of the Cortes at the periods fixed by the
                    constitution, neither can he dis<pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:chi.28490924&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=581" xml:id="kp-eb0720-0581-0507"/>
                    solve them or disturb their sittings; his advisers and abet tors in such
                    attempts are guilty of treason. 2. If the king should quit the kingdom without
                    the consent of the Cortes, he is understood to have abdicated the crown. 3. The
                    king cannot alienate any part of the Spanish territory. 4. He cannot abdicate
                    the crown in favour of his successor without the consent of the Cortes. 5. He
                    cannot enter into any political alliance, or make commercial treaties, with out
                    the consent of the Cortes. 6. He cannot grant privileges or monopolies. 7. The
                    king cannot disturb any in dividual in the enjoyment of his property, nor
                    deprive him of his personal liberty. If the interest of the state should require
                    the arrest of any individual by virtue of a royal order, the prisoner must be
                    delivered over to a competent tribunal within eight and forty hours. 8. The king
                    can not marry without the consent of the Cortes; he is sup posed to abdicate the
                    crown by taking a wife against their will.</p>
                <p>The council of state is composed of forty individuals, viz. two bishops, two
                    priests, and four grandees; the other thirty-two must not belong to any of these
                    classes. The members of the council of state shall be chosen by the king, out of
                    a triple list presented to him by the Cortes. The councillors of state cannot be
                    removed without a trial before the supreme court of justice. Their salary is
                    fixed by the Cortes. The functions of this council of state are to ad vise the
                    king on all important matters of government, and especially upon giving or
                    refusing his sanction to the laws, declaring war, or making treaties. The king,
                    besides, can not bestow any ecclesiastical benefice, or appoint any judge, but
                    at the proposal of the council of state, who, upon every vacancy, are to confine
                    his choice to one out of three individuals, whose names they are to lay before
                    his majesty.</p>
                <p>The laws for the security of personal liberty are these: 1. No Spaniard can be
                    imprisoned without a summary pro cess, in which he is credibly charged with the
                    infraction of some law that subjects the offender to corporal punishment; 2. the
                    arrest cannot take place without the warrant of a competent judge; 3. prisoners
                    are not to be examined upon oath; 4. the gaoler shall keep a register of the pri
                    soners, expressing the warrant, and the alleged cause of his confinement.</p>
                <p>The rapid series of misfortunes which had shaken the imperial throne of France to
                    its foundations opened the way for the return of the captive Ferdinand to
                    Madrid. The constitutionalists looked forward to his appearance in the country
                    with no favourable eye, and the arrival of despatches from him to the regency
                    threw them into great consternation. Ferdinand announced that he had concluded a
                    treaty with Napoleon. This assumption of absolute power on the part of the king,
                    without the knowledge of the Cortes, was aiming a direct blow at their
                    authority, and violating the constitution recently established; and they
                    accordingly rejected the treaty. They likewise suspended the king from the
                    exercise of all power till he should take the oath which the new constitution
                    prescribed. He entered the Spanish territory on the 24th of March 1814, and took
                    up his residence at Valencia. On his way he had not been slow to discover that
                    the lower orders were in general in different to the constitution. The fact is,
                    the new political principles had scarcely struck root among the people; and with
                    a very considerable party, consisting of grandees, dignitaries of the church,
                    and others, the king was still absolute, and these flocked around their master.
                    In the Cortes itself there was a strong body opposed to the new order of things.
                    A petition, signed by sixty-nine members, was presented to the king, in which
                    the Cortes was described as a mere tool in the hands of a republican party,
                    without freedom of debate, and acting under the control of a mob regularly hired
                    to take possession of the galleries. Nothing, therefore, could be more
                    favourable to Ferdinand’s resuming absolute power. Accordingly, on the 4th of
                    May 1814, a decree was solemnly promulgated, in which the Cortes were declared
                    illegal, and all their laws consequently rescinded. Some of the leading members
                    were arrested, as a prelude to what was shortly to happen. Under their usual
                    leaders, the priests, the lower orders broke out into fierce demonstrations of
                    joy when the news of these events reached the chief towns, and the king
                    proceeded in a sort of triumph to Madrid. Further arrests of the deputies of the
                    late Cortes took place; property was sequestrated and papers were seized; judges
                    were appointed to try obnoxious members; but justice proving too tardy for the
                    king’s eager spirit of revenge, he himself pronounced sentence on the prisoners
                    in a wholesale manner, in open defiance of all law and justice. A few were
                    capitally punished, and a great many more were con signed to dungeons. The
                    inquisition was restored, and was urged to exert its powers against all persons
                    suspected of liberal opinions. Monks became once more the sole direc tors of the
                    king’s conscience, and the reign of absolutism and bigotry was completely
                    restored.</p>
                <p>But these arbitrary acts roused the dormant spirit of the Spanish people, and a
                    revulsion of feeling was the conse quence. In vain did the court party silence
                    the press or bribe it into their service; facts which could not be concealed
                    from the people daily pleaded the cause of liberty. Bribery and venality were
                    soon observed to prevail around the throne; the treasury was completely drained,
                    and the army remained unpaid; while, to add to the difficulties and dangers of
                    Ferdinand’s position, armed bands of guerillas, now become organized banditti,
                    swarmed over the country, setting the helpless magistrates at defiance, and
                    commit ting all sorts of atrocities. Freemasonry was abolished, and effectually
                    kept in check; but a far more dangerous society, the members of which assumed
                    the name of <hi rend="italic">Comuneros,</hi> was secretly formed, and, in spite
                    of the inquisition and its emissaries, held meetings in most of the principal
                    towns, and kept up an active correspondence among their lodges. The constitution
                    was publicly burned; but this served only to spread disaffection, and to give it
                    an importance in the eyes of the people which it did not formerly possess. Cadiz
                    having been fixed on as the headquarters of the liberals, a regular plan for the
                    overthrow of the government was there formed, and its secret influence was
                    extended through out the provinces. Our limits do not permit us to mention the
                    numerous conspiracies which were discovered, and quenched in blood. They were
                    sufficient to alarm any monarch but one wholly abandoned to the guidance of
                    weak, wicked, or fanatical counsellors. Those who ventured to remonstrate with
                    the king were banished or thrown into prison. The promise which he had made of
                    granting a constitution founded on liberal principles remained un fulfilled, and
                    for six years (18141820) Ferdinand reigned with absolute power. During that time
                    there had been no less than twenty-five changes in the ministry', mostly sud
                    den, and attended with severities. They were produced by the influence of the
                    <hi rend="italic">camarilla,</hi> or individuals in the personal service of the
                    king. Every attempt to save the state was frustrated by such counsellors; and
                    the overthrow of the government, now apparently inevitable, became accelerated
                    by the loss of the American colonies.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                <p>The army was the instrument of its fall. Amongst the officers several
                    conspiracies had been organized for the restoration of the new constitution, at

                    Porlier, Mina, Lacy, and Vidal. Mina had succeeded in making his escape, but the
                    others were taken and executed, their friends at the same time being put to the
                    torture or thrown into prison. But these severities had no effect in repressing
                    the discontent of the army; for the cause which immediately produced it was not
                    removed,—the arrears due to the troops still remained unpaid. The money which
                    might have been employed for this purpose was foolishly lavished in fitting out
                    an expedition to destroy the liberties of the revolted South Americans: by a
                    singular destiny it became the instrument of the overthrow of despotism at home,
                    and the restoration of Spanish freedom. The troops which were to embark in the
                    autumn of 1819, were indis posed to the American service; and the officers,
                    favourable to the constitution of the Cortes, took advantage of this state of
                    feeling to effect their own purposes. Whole regiments had determined not to
                    embark; and the commander himself, O’Donnel, count del Abisbal, was in the
                    secret. But he basely betrayed the cause, and had the principal conspirators
                    arrested in front of the troops. For this devotion to despotism he was rewarded
                    by the court party by being removed from the command of the expedition. Such un
                    grateful conduct towards a man who had forfeited his ho nour to save them, could
                    not fail to bring the <hi rend="italic">Serviles,</hi> as they were designated,
                    into general contempt. A favour able opportunity soon occurred for the liberals
                    carrying into execution the same plan which had failed through the perfidy of
                    O’Donnel. The yellow fever having made its appearance at Cadiz, the safety of
                    the troops which were there assembled demanded that they should be removed to
                    some distance, thus leaving the members of the secret societies and other
                    patriots at liberty to prosecute their schemes without fear of violent
                    interruption. The embarkation of the troops had been fixed for January 1820; but
                    on the first of that month, Riego, who had been placed at the head of the
                    insurrection, gained over several battalions, and proclaimed the constitution of
                    1812. He arrested Calderon, the successor of O’Donnel; and finally joining
                    Quiroga, a liberated patriot, and at the time in command of some troops, the
                    combined force, amounting to 5000 men, marched on La Caracea, which was
                    occupied. They had previously taken possession of La Isla. But still the coun
                    try showed no disposition to second this bold movement of the army. In vain
                    Riego led a flying column through the provinces, proclaiming the constitution,
                    and expecting sup port from the inhabitants; few or none joined him. But several
                    fortunate circumstances which occurred at this time materially contributed to
                    the success of the insurrection. Mina, who had been obliged to fly to France,
                    entered the Spanish territory of Navarre on the 25th of February, and a numerous
                    band immediately surrounded his standard. Risings simultaneously took place in
                    different quarters in favour of the constitution, which was publicly proclaimed
                    in Galicia, Saragossa, Valencia, Murcia, Granada, and many other places. General
                    Freyer, who had been appointed to the command of the troops in Seville, was
                    himself obliged to publish the constitution in that city.</p>
                <p>These insurrections could not fail to appal the weak, ignorant, and unpopular
                    party which surrounded the throne. Ferdinand himself saw no general of
                    sufficient ability or loyalty to be trusted with the command of a large army,
                    which could soon have been concentrated, for there still existed fidelity among
                    a sufficient number of the troops. It was however an expiring feeling, which
                    could only have been reanimated by a great leader, but which, in the pre sent
                    destitution of the country, a mere breath might extinguish. And it was
                    extinguished. Ferdinand was abandoned by his troops. Even O’Donnel, who had
                    acted the part of traitor to the liberal cause, became one of its principal
                    supporters. At Ocana he proclaimed the constitution; an event which produced a
                    great sensation in Madrid. The royal palace was surrounded by a crowd, who
                    called on Ferdinand to accept the constitution, and he now found that no
                    alternative was left to his choice. The humbled monarch appeared at the balcony,
                    holding a copy of the constitution in his hand, as a pledge of his readiness to
                    swear to its observance. This occurred early in March 1820. To give efficacy and
                    legality to the restoration of the constitution, it was necessary that the
                    Cortes should be convoked, and the oath of the king to uphold the new order of
                    things taken in their presence. The Cortes assembled on the 9th of July, and all
                    the formalities were regularly observed. Mean while the constitutional system
                    had been put into complete operation. During its proclamation at Cadiz, a bloody
                    and disgraceful transaction took place; some of the royal troops present
                    wantonly fired on the unarmed multitude, and about 500 were killed or wounded.
                    The inquisition was abolished, as inconsistent with it, the state-prisoners were
                    liberated, and new ministers were appointed. In place of the Council of
                    Castille, and that of the Indies, a supreme judicial tribunal, with appropriate
                    subordinate courts, was established; national guards were organized in the
                    provinces, and the municipal authorities were made to conform to the consti
                    tution.</p>
                <p>The meeting of the Cortes of 9th July, and their subsequent proceedings, mark the
                    establishment of a new order of things, destined however to be of short
                    duration. This assembly acted with extreme moderation, the measures of
                    retaliation being infinitely less severe than those which followed the king’s
                    triumph over the constitution. The members strove to temper the violence of the
                    liberals, and endeavoured to restore the <hi rend="italic">afrancesados</hi>
                    (those who took the oath to support the French dynasty) to their rights, to
                    counteract the machinations of the serviles, and to heal the wounds of the
                    country. But some of their proceedings were characterized by less judgment and
                    humanity. The suppression of many of the convents and of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >majorates,</hi> the banishment of the nonjuring clergy, and some other of their
                    measures, excited discontents. Various parts of the country became disgraced by
                    popular excesses, while on the frontiers of Portugal the royalist party formed a
                    junta for restoring the privileges of the crown and the church. Conspiracy and
                    openly avowed disaffection to the new order of things spread so widely, that
                    when the second session of the Cortes opened in April 1821, the country was
                    declared to be in a state of danger. The command of the army having been
                    intrusted to Morillo, quiet was in some measure restored; but still it was found
                    necessary to summon an extraordinary meeting of the Cortes in September. Spanish
                    affairs in America had now assumed their gloomiest aspect; and the government
                    wished to compromise the matter by acknowledging America as a kingdom
                    independent of Spain, but united with her under a common sovereign, Ferdinand
                    VII. Such an absurd proposal was rejected with scorn. The absolutists, although
                    beaten everywhere by the troops of the government, could not be entirely
                    suppressed; and even the adherents of the constitution began to complain of the
                    weaknesses and mistakes of the ministry. The Cortes requested the king to
                    appoint abler men; and to this he reluctantly yielded in 1822. Notwithstanding
                    the errors of the Cortes, considering that the king was with them, and that his
                    brother Carlos, although approving of the conduct of the absolutists, had not
                    ventured to join them, it is probable that the struggles, after continuing for a
                    few years, might have ended in a compromise, had not the whole power of France
                    been thrown into the scale of the serviles.</p>
                <p>The events which immediately preceded Ferdinand’s restoration to absolute power,
                    and the complete annulment of all the acts of the Cortes, were so various and
                    compli cated, that, if fully detailed, they would of themselves more than occupy
                    all the space within the limits to which this<pb break="no"

                    outline of Spanish history must be confined. Into particulars, therefore, we
                    shall not enter; only the most import ant transactions can be noticed.
                    Disaffection to the <hi rend="italic">government</hi> in the southern provinces,
                    where a strong body of French troops was stationed as a sanitary cordon during
                    the prevalence of pestilence in Spain, terminated in open revolt. The national
                    guards were called out to suppress it, and they were everywhere victorious; but
                    the pecuniary resources were chiefly in the hands of the supporters of
                    despotism. In Madrid an occurrence took place in July 1822, which threatened the
                    most disastrous consequences. This was a daring attempt of the friends of
                    absolute government to overthrow the constitution. They were supported by the
                    royal guards, while the national guards were ranged on the popular side. A
                    conflict took place, in which nearly the whole of the royal guards were cut off.
                    But insurrection, although thus suppressed in the capital, still prevailed to an
                    alarming extent in Biscay, Navarre, and Catalonia, where armed bands, under the
                    name of apostolical troops, <hi rend="italic">feotas,</hi> or soldiers of the
                    faith, committed revolting cruelties. Near the French frontier, and probably
                    under French influence, the absolutists appointed a regency, which issued orders
                    in the name of the “imprisoned” king, as they thought fit to call Ferdinand,
                    although he had recently, under no compulsion, but in the most voluntary manner,
                    again declared his adherence to the constitution. The avowed object of this
                    regency was the restoration of every thing to the state in which it had been
                    prior to the 7th of March 1820. But this band of outrageous serviles,
                    unsupported by the nation, was compelled to fly to France in November 1822. The
                    foreign relations of Spain now fell into a state of dreadful disorder; and the
                    principle of armed intervention pronounced by Austria, Russia, and Prussia, in
                    relation to this unhappy kingdom, was threaten ed to be acted upon by France.
                    The restoration of Ferdinand to the full enjoyment of sovereign authority was
                    demanded by the four powers named, while England advised the Cortes to yield,
                    and offered her mediation. But the Spanish government repelled with indignation
                    this attempt of foreign powers to interfere in its affairs. The consequences
                    were the recall of the foreign ambassadors by their respective courts, and the
                    march of 100,000 French soldiers across the Bidassoa. The duke of Angouléme, by
                    whom this army was commanded, established a junta, consisting of Eguia,
                    Calderon, and Erro, who formed a pro visional government, declaring the king the
                    sole depositary of sovereign power, and that no change in the government should
                    be recognised but such as the king should make of his own free choice. All the
                    decrees of the Cortes were declared void; in short, the object of French
                    interference was simply to restore the reign of absolute power. Unfortunately
                    the Cortes had no ally. The relations of Portugal to Great Britain did not allow
                    her to conclude a defensive treaty with Spain. Britain remained neutral; but the
                    exportation of arms and ammunition to Spain was allowed, and, in parliament,
                    Canning called the attempt of the French unjust, and wished the arms of the
                    Cortes success; an expression of sympathy which led the Spaniards for a time to
                    hope that Britain would take a part in the war. Ferdinand, for greater safety,
                    had removed to Seville, and on the 23d of April 1823 he formally declared war
                    against France; but he in vain called on the nation to support the consti
                    tution. The great mass of the people were completely under the influence of the
                    most bigoted priesthood in the world, who of course were absolutists, and hailed
                    the arrival of the French; the adherents of the constitution were confined to
                    the educated class, the army, and the in habitants of cities. The Spanish army
                    might be equal in strength to that of the French, but a considerable part of it
                    was disposed in garrisons and fortresses, scattered over a large surface of
                    country. The military operations of the</p>
                <p>French, during their advance upon Madrid, were the siege and capture of several
                    strong towns, and a few partial engagements, in one of which, at least, that of
                    Logroño, they were defeated. The southern provinces, where the absolutists had
                    always a preponderancy, were occupied by the invaders with hardly any
                    resistance; but in Lower Cata lonia, where Mina commanded, they were kept in
                    check for a considerable time. The main body of the French army under Angouléme
                    hastened to the capital, which was occupied on the 24th of May. One of the first
                    steps taken was to appoint a regency, which put every thing on the same footing
                    as before March 7, 1820. But the regency had no pecuniary resources, and no
                    power, if they had the will, to prevent the furious ebullitions of party hatred.
                    The Cortes had in vain tried to excite a general guerilla war; it was but too
                    plain that the mass of the people, at once miserably ignorant and furiously
                    bigoted, without any just notions of what rational liberty was, or in what the
                    new constitution consisted, were content to sur render themselves entirely to
                    the guidance of the priest hood, and consequently everywhere opposed the
                    constitutionalists. Their hatred was still further increased by the seizure of
                    all the property of persons of the opposite party, by a large forced loan, and
                    by the coining of the superfluous church plate, to which measures the want of
                    money compelled the Cortes to have recourse. The war had now spread from the
                    south to the north over the whole breadth of the land, and was actively
                    prosecuted in Andalusia and Estremadura. An attempt at mediation on the part of
                    the English ambassador, Sir W. A’Court, failed; and the king having refused to
                    go to Cadiz, the Cortes, acting on that part of the constitution which provides
                    for the moral incapacity of the sovereign, appointed a regency with royal
                    powers. We cannot regard this proceeding in any other light than as a gross
                    indignity offered to the king, and most impolitic at the time. However,
                    Ferdinand accompanied the Cortes to Cadiz, and the regency ceased to exist. On
                    the other hand, the members of the Cortes who had declared the king morally
                    incapable, were denounced as traitors by the regency of Madrid, which now became
                    recognised by foreign powers, Austria, Prussia, and France, as the only
                    legitimate government of Spain.</p>
                <p>Meanwhile the war was briskly carried on, but nothing would induce the people to
                    join the constitutionalists, who accordingly were gradually driven from
                    stronghold to strong hold, although in some places they made a gallant resist
                    ance. Defection among the officers of the army materially contributed to the
                    downfall of their cause. Morillo and Sarsfield were among the deserters. The
                    regency of Madrid conducted themselves in a cruel and outrageous manner towards
                    the friends of the constitution, notwithstanding the strenuous efforts of the
                    French generalissimo to restrain their fury. The duke of Angouléme took
                    possession of the city of Cadiz on the 4th October 1823. Previously to this, the
                    Cortes had reinvested Ferdinand with absolute power, and requested him to remove
                    to the French headquarters where he was received with becoming pomp. The first
                    measure of the king was to declare all the acts of the constitutional government
                    from March 7, 1820, to October 1, 1823, null and void, on the ground that during
                    that period he was acting under compulsion. The war terminated in November; and
                    on the 22d of that month the duke of Angouléme took his leave of the army of the
                    Pyrenees. Among the crowds of fugitives were Mina and the count of Abisbal; and
                    among the victims capitally punished was Riego, who suffered at Mad rid on the
                    6th of November.</p>
                <p>The party which now succeeded to power, although weak from want of means, was
                    powerful enough to exercise a persecuting and vindictive policy towards the
                    former partisans of the constitution. The French wished to secure<pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:chi.28490924&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=584" xml:id="kp-eb0720-0584-0510"/>
                    mildness and moderation, but the bad faith of the Spanish government frustrated
                    these objects. To restrain the violence of party fury, which so widely
                    prevailed, a treaty was concluded with France, by which that power agreed to
                    maintain a large military force in the country, until the Spanish army could be
                    organized. This was certainly a wise measure in the circumstances; for Spain, if
                    left to itself, would probably have fallen into irretrievable confusion. It was
                    divided by two parties, who mortally hated each other; and the bonds of society,
                    already shaken loose by years of war and unrestrained licentiousness, required
                    little more to dissolve them altogether. The reports from the provinces were
                    appalling; the treasury was empty; home and foreign credit were alike destroyed;
                    and trade and commerce were paralyzed. The personal moderation of the king led
                    to the formation of a plot by the absolutists, to compel him to ab dicate, and
                    to raise his brother Carlos to the throne. This was the origin of the Carlists,
                    who make so conspicuous a figure in the sequel. An attempt to restore the
                    inquisition was happily frustrated. In May 1824, a decree of amnesty appeared;
                    but it was a mere mockery, for it contained so many exemptions, that those who
                    were to enjoy its benefits seemed rather to form the exception than the rule.
                    The year 1825 was disturbed by several insurrections of the Carlists, which were
                    attended with numerous executions. The independence of the American colonies was
                    recognised by foreign powers, but Spain herself did not acknowledge it till the
                    year 1836. The general interruption of commerce and industry, with the flight of
                    many persons of property, occasioned much distress. The disturbances continued
                    for some years, attended with the same marks of feebleness on the part of the
                    government, and a continuance of general distress. It was a period of terror for
                    the liberals, who were plundered and imprisoned on the slightest pretexts. The
                    army, purged of all officers suspected of liberalism, was recruited by a motley
                    throng of adventurers, friars, smugglers, mechanics, publicans, and muleteers,
                    who had been officers in the guerilla bands of Catalonia and Navarre. The ranks
                    being replenished in this manner, the French troops were enabled to evacuate
                    Spain in 1828. Some insurrections, which had broken out during the preceding
                    year, were suppressed without much trouble; and in spite of the arbitrary rule
                    of the Carlists, their tortuous policy, and their open violence, the country
                    began to show some symptoms of improvement.</p>
                <p>In May 1829, Ferdinand lost his queen, and on the 9th of November following, her
                    place was supplied by a Neapolitan princess, Christina Maria. Unblessed with
                    issue by his three former marriages, the hope and the desire of having a child
                    of his own to inherit his honours and preserve the throne to his dynasty,
                    probably hastened the nuptials of Ferdinand. The French revolution of 1830
                    caused much less sensation in Spain than might have been ex pected. The fact is,
                    the liberal party had been so devour ed or dispersed by the sword, the scaffold,
                    exile, and the dungeon, that in the country itself it was not powerful; but a
                    rash and ill-judged attempt in the constitutional cause was made from without.
                    General Mina assembled a body of refu gees and others, and invaded the Basque
                    provinces; but they were speedily repelled, and sought refuge in France. Mean
                    while, some events of momentous importance had taken place in the royal family.
                    The Infant Don Carlos was presumptive heir of the throne; the succession to the
                    Spa nish crown had been subjected to the Salic law by Philip V., so that, as
                    matters stood at present, no daughter of the reigning king could interrupt its
                    descent to his brother. The queen of Ferdinand' was about to make him a father,
                    and in order to secure the crown to his own child, should the issue prove a
                    female, he resolved on revoking the Salic law, which excludes females. It is
                    important to observe, that, in 1789, Charles IV. issued a pragmatic sanction,
                    having the force of law, and establishing the regular succession to the crown of
                    Spain in females as well as males. The Cortes of 1812 likewise solemnly revoked
                    the law of Philip V., and reestablished the old law of the Partidas. But as
                    Ferdinand had annulled the acts of that assembly, and as the decree of Charles
                    IV. might be cavilled at by the fierce and intolerant party who wished that
                    Carlos should succeed to the throne, the king obtained the records of the Cortes
                    of 1789 regarding the succession, and on the mar gin opposite the decree of
                    Charles IV., with his own hand, wrote a decree to the same effect. The minister,
                    Calomarde (a Carlist at heart), remonstrated with the king against its
                    publication; but Ferdinand was firm, and ordered the resolution to be carried
                    into effect. In compliance with this demand, the whole was forwarded to the
                    council; and in the gazette of the 6th of April 1830, the edict was published to
                    the world. It was likewise regularly proclaimed in the streets of Madrid with
                    the usual formalities. Ferdinand’s foresight was justified. The infant with
                    which the queen presented him was a daughter, born on the 10th of October, and
                    christened Isabella Maria Luisa.</p>
                <p>But the Carlists did not wait for the expected birth of the heir to the throne to
                    show how terribly the publication of the decree had staggered them. They rushed
                    into hasty plots against the government, which were detected before they were
                    ripe for execution; and in various ways showed their chagrin and irritation. In
                    order to render the succession still more secure, Ferdinand called a meeting of
                    the Cortes, before which the edict of Philip V. was again repealed, and his
                    daughter, the Infante Isabel, recognised as princess of the Asturias. An
                    insurrection broke out in Cadiz in 1831, at the head of which was General
                    Torrijas. It was soon quelled, and the leader, with fifty-three companions, fled
                    to Malaga, where they were taken prisoners, and all shot in cold blood. The
                    other events of this year are unimportant, with the exception of a sudden
                    illness of the king, which so excited the hopes of the Carlists, that they
                    strenuously urged their master to take advantage of the circumstance, and at
                    once seize the crown. This re markable fact shows with what spirit they were
                    animated. It was not a love of justice, but ambition, and a spirit of vindictive
                    hostility to the constitutionalists, who now began to be tolerated, that
                    instigated them to attempt the exaltation of Carlos to the throne, and that at
                    all hazards, even before he possessed the semblance of a claim to it; for while
                    Ferdinand lived, by what right could he grasp at his sceptre? Yet his partisans
                    extol his magnanimity in refusing it at this time.</p>
                <p>In the course of the year 1832, Ferdinand had an alarming relapse of his disease,
                    during the paroxysms of which a transaction took place of the utmost importance
                    in itself, and which has been very differently represented by different parties.
                    It was the signing of a decree by which he re stored the Salic law to full
                    operation, and the further confirming the disinheriting of his daughter, by
                    annulling his testament in her favour. It is certain that the ministers
                    strenuously urged him to adopt this measure; and that they were under Carlist
                    influence, is no less certain. Every thing was accomplished to their wishes; the
                    document was signed and properly secured, and the king appeared to have fallen
                    into the sleep of death. His dissolution indeed was announced; but, contrary to
                    all human expectation, the disease took a favourable turn; all symptoms of
                    immediate danger disappeared, and consciousness and understanding were restored
                    to Ferdinand. The use which he made of the lucid interval thus vouchsafed to
                    him, was to dismiss his ministers, to appoint the queen regent during his
                    illness, and to undo what he had lately done regarding the succession, thus
                    restoring to his daughter her right to the throne. The decree to this effect was
                    issued on the last day of the year. The former ordinance, he declared, had been
                    extort<pb break="no" facs="ht:chi.28490924&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=585"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0720-0585-0511"/> ed from him, not only when he was in the agonies
                    of expected death, but under false misrepresentations that all Spain demanded
                    it, and that the inviolability of the monarchy required it; whereas it had only
                    been desired by an ambitious and unscrupulous faction, and was opposed to the
                    fundamental laws of the kingdom. A more liberal minis try was formed, and some
                    liberal measures were adopted; high expectations were raised that milder times
                    were at hand, and the funds in Madrid rose ten per cent. Early in 1883,
                    Ferdinand was able to resume the reins of govern ment. On the 20th of June he
                    assembled the Cortes to swear allegiance to his daughter, and do homage to her
                    as their future sovereign. This solemnity was performed with great pomp in the
                    church of the royal monastery of St Jerome. Don Carlos refused to take the oath;
                    but previously to this he had taken up his residence in Portugal, where his
                    nephew was playing the same desperate game which he himself was about to
                    undertake. Ferdinand survived the ceremony of <hi rend="italic">the jura</hi>
                    only a few months. He <hi rend="italic">expired</hi> on the 29th of September
                    1833, leaving a will, in which he appointed his daughter Isabella heir to the
                    crown, and her mother regent during her minority.</p>
                <p>No sooner was Isabella II. proclaimed queen, than Don Carlos announced his claim
                    to the throne, and the flames of civil war burst out in the northern provinces,
                    where his par tisans, assembled in great numbers, stood ready armed for the
                    contest. Of the bloody and protracted struggle for the throne which ensued, we
                    can afford room for few details; indeed, an account of the numerous battles,
                    skirmishes, sieges, and other warlike operations, would prove a very
                    uninteresting and monotonous portion of the modem his tory of Spain. Isabella
                    was acknowledged without opposition throughout all the provinces of Spain, and
                    by the leading powers of Europe. The question of the Spanish suc cession, apart
                    altogether from the bloody war to which it gave rise, has been keenly agitated
                    in this and many other countries. It may be briefly stated as follows. Carlos’s
                    right rests upon the Salic law, which had never the force of law in Spain. The
                    Salic law was not the ancient rule of succession; it was first introduced by the
                    Bourbon Philip V., the greatgrandfather of Don Carlos. Females could always
                    succeed in Castille, Leon, and Portugal. It was by marriage with the heiress of
                    Navarre that a king of France obtained a claim to that kingdom; and although
                    females were excluded in Aragon, yet it was through a princess that its
                    inheritance passed to the counts of Catalonia. It was by the right of female
                    succession that the house of Austria reigned in Spain; it was by the same right
                    that the Bourbons themselves occupied the throne. It formed a part of the
                    Partidas, or system of constitutional law, which Philip swore to observe on his
                    succession to the throne. The Salic law, on which Carlos grounds his claim,
                    could only be established in two ways; by the old forms of the constitution, or
                    by the despotic will of the sovereign. If the advocates of Don Carlos take their
                    stand on the former ground, the answer is, that the forms as well as the sub
                    stance of the constitution were violated when Philip V. established his law of
                    succession; and that, conscious of its in validity, he did not register it in
                    the form usual with similar acts; while again, if we pass over the Cortes of
                    1789 as secret and irregular, we have the Cortes of Cadiz in 1812, which
                    abolished the decree of Philip, and restored the ancient law of the Partidas.
                    But Ferdinand having annulled the proceedings of this body, its reestablishment
                    of the right of female succession must fall to the ground with its other
                    decrees. There is however Ferdinand’s own de cree, constituting his daughter his
                    successor, which was just as regularly sanctioned by the Cortes as Philip’s law
                    of succession. If, on the other hand, the sovereign is to be regarded as
                    despotic in Spain, the question is at an end; for even Carlos must acknowledge
                    that Ferdinand had a right to regulate the succession according to his own royal
                    plea sure. This view seemed to have been taken by the king’s confessor, and his
                    minister Calomarde,, when, during his dangerous illness at La Granja in 1832,
                    they induced him to sign a new will, settling the crown on Don Carlos.
                    Ferdinand’s recovery disconcerted their plan; but their effort plainly shows
                    that the partisans of Don Carlos at that time felt that the Salic law was a very
                    weak support to their favourite’s claims. The transaction by which Ferdinand
                    (supposed to be on his deathbed) transferred the crown to his brother, is
                    admitted by the Carlists to have been a perfectly legal proceeding. Can the
                    subsequent transaction, by which, under exactly similar circumstances, the king
                    ap pointed his daughter his successor, be considered otherwise than as an
                    equally legal proceeding? If the constitution be referred to, the question is
                    decided against Don Carlos; the will of the sovereign is against his claim; and,
                    what is of yet more consequence, as the event has shown, the will of the
                    majority of the nation is against him.</p>
                <p>It was in the northern provinces, in Navarre, Guipuscoa, Biscay, and Alava, that
                    the strength of Don Carlos lay. Here he was immediately proclaimed in several
                    towns by the title of Charles V., and bands of Carlist guerillas assembled to
                    maintain his right to the throne. He himself still hovered a fugitive on the
                    frontiers of Portugal, his movements being closely watched by a royal force
                    under General Rodil. Another strong division of the queen’s army, under General
                    Sarsfield, marched against the disaffected provinces. The Carlists retired
                    before him; Bilboa and other towns were occupied and garrisoned; the
                    constitutional party was restored in several places where it had lost ground;
                    and the insurrection seemed at first to have been happily put down without much
                    loss. But early in 1834 the affairs of the Carlists assumed altogether a new
                    aspect. Hitherto their operations were carried on in an unconnected manner; this
                    system was now exchanged for one of steady unity of design. Indeed so numerous
                    were the adherents of Don Carlos in the north, that there was only required a
                    firm hand to seize the reins, control local jealousies, and direct aright the
                    energies of the provinces. Such a man was Thomas Zumalacarreguy, who now assumed
                    the chief command of the Carlists. He was admirably skilled in the desultory
                    warfare of these provinces, and well acquainted with the country and with the
                    charac ter of the inhabitants. By his activity and enterprise he repeatedly
                    inflicted severe blows upon the forces of the queen, or the Christinos, as they
                    were generally called. His method of fighting was to surprise the enemy in an
                    unprotected position, and cut off as many of them as he could before they
                    recovered from their panic. His troops would then suddenly separate and fly, but
                    only to unite again at a predetermined point some miles in the rear. By this
                    mode of warfare he caused great loss to the Christinos, while his own small band
                    suffered little. The Christino army under General Rodil, who had now obtained
                    the chief command, might amount to 20,000 men, and was thus sufficiently strong
                    at least to have confined Zumalacarreguy to the mountains; but it was greatly
                    reduced by several thousand troops having been distributed among a number of
                    petty fortresses, most of which, one after the other, fell a prey to the Carlist
                    chieftain. It was further weakened by being divided into different corps and
                    scattered over the country. Rodil found it necessary to resign the command,
                    which now devolved upon Mina, from whom much was ex pected. Nor did he
                    disappoint the hopes which were formed of him. Just before his appointment,
                    Generals O’Doyle and Asina had severally been defeated with great loss by
                    Zumalacarreguy, which occasioned much alarm at Madrid, and loud outcries against
                    the ministry. But the old war rior, though broken by sickness and infirmities,
                    restored confidence by making head against the hitherto victori<pb break="no"

                    ous Carlists, and bringing victory to the standards of the queen.</p>
                <p>In the mean while, Don Carlos, after paying a short visit to England, made his
                    appearance in Spain; and his presence among his partisans greatly strengthened
                    his cause in the northern provinces. France and Britain had acknowledged Queen
                    Isabella II. These two powers, along with Portugal, entered into a treaty with
                    Spain, the conditions of which quadruple alliance were, that France should watch
                    the fron tiers, so that the insurgents might receive no aid from that country;
                    that Britain should supply such arms and munitions of war as the Spanish
                    government should stand in need of, whilst at the same time she should guard the
                    northem ports of Spain, so as to prevent the insurgents from receiving any
                    assistance in men, money, or ammunition, and also assist the queen with a naval
                    force; and that Portugal should cooperate by every means in her power: but that
                    country was at the time in too embarrassed a situation to render any efficient
                    assistance. As soon as the arrival of Don Carlos in Navarre was known, the four
                    powers who had been parties to the treaty renewed its stipulations, in respect
                    that its object had not yet been attained. This imparted confidence and vigour
                    to the cabinet of Madrid, of which it stood greatly in need. A variety of
                    measures occupied the attention of government during the year 1834, not the
                    least important of which was the plan of a new charter or constitution. It is
                    quite unnecessary to enter into any details of what the Cortes proposed should
                    be done, as every thing was overturned and put upon a new footing by a
                    revolution which occurred two years afterwards. The financial state of Spain,
                    particularly the large debt which the government owed to foreign nations, formed
                    a subject of protracted discussion. Doubts were raised as to whether a part of
                    it was legitimately owing; but the debates in the Cortes terminated in the whole
                    being recognised as justly due. This contributed to restore the credit of Spain
                    in foreign money-markets, where it had been greatly shaken, and enabled the
                    government to contract for a new loan. Another measure of importance which
                    engaged the attention of the Cortes, was the passing of a bill of exclusion from
                    the throne against Carlos and his descendants. During the year the ministry had
                    undergone a complete change, chiefly through the instrumentality of a popular
                    leader of the name of Llauder. Zea was superseded in the office of prime
                    minister by Martinez de la Rosa, supposed to be a person of more liberal
                    predilections.</p>
                <p>The military operations of 1835 were prosecuted with great vigour on the part of
                    the Carlists. Several import ant towns and fortresses fell into their hands, and
                    siege was laid to Bilboa, the capital of Biscay. After sustaining a furious
                    bombardment for several days, the place was re Reved, principally through the
                    instrumentality of some British gunners under Lord John Hay, commander of a ship
                    of war then on the coast of Biscay. It was during the attack on Bilboa that
                    Zumalacarreguy received the wound of which he died on the 23d of June. The death
                    of this chief threw a gloom on the affairs of Don Carlos; it was the severest
                    loss which his cause had sustained, and he never properly repaired it. Among the
                    Christines this event diffused a joy and hope which they made no efforts to
                    conceal. Worn out by long service, by age, and by dis ease, the veteran Mina
                    resigned the command, which ultimately devolved upon General Cordova, under whom
                    was the celebrated Espartero. The Spanish government having been permitted to
                    levy a body of mercenaries in Great Britain, several thousand recruits were
                    raised in this country, and were led to the theatre of war in Spain under the
                    command of General Evans. The British legion soon took an active part in the
                    war, and distinguished itself upon various occasions. The Carlist army, although
                    it abandoned the siege of Bilboa, still continued in the neighbour hood,
                    prepared to take advantage of circumstances. An opportunity soon occurred for
                    attacking the Christinos at the village of Arrigoriaga, which they made an
                    attempt to pass. The royalists were driven back with considerable loss, and this
                    check for the time interrupted the movements of Cordova’s army. On the other
                    hand, the Christinos laid claim to more than one victory gained over their
                    enemies; but these doubtful and unproductive skirmishes, which in the flush and
                    enthusiasm of triumph were magnified into decisive battles, are too
                    insignificant to require a detail in this place. At the close of 1835, matters
                    stood much as they did at the commencement of the year. But the war was now
                    carried on with more humanity than formerly. A strong remonstrance on the part
                    of the British government, against the barbarous practice of putting prisoners
                    to death, had the desired effect, at least for a time, of staying the effusion
                    of blood in this inhuman manner.</p>
                <p>Those parts of Spain exempt from the horrors of war, were for the most part
                    subjected to the scourge of political anarchy. The new government of the
                    queen-regent had been founded on an abandonment of the old system of un
                    mitigated despotism. Her daughter’s throne was to be identified with more
                    liberal institutions, and was thus to be protected by all political reformers,
                    all who were inimical to absolutism. But the extent to which the old system was
                    to be abandoned, and the form in which a popular government was to be
                    established, were questions regarding which every possible diversity of opinion
                    prevailed. The un quiet elements thus at work showed themselves first in a
                    military revolt, and then in the revolt of several provinces, in which the
                    democratic party sought to usurp the powers of government. For a time they set
                    the lawful authorities at defiance, for the government of Madrid was helpless.
                    Even here disaffection had spread to a most alarming ex tent, the urban militia
                    having openly revolted. In vain were royal decrees issued, and strong measures
                    put in force to repress the disturbances; an open war between the government and
                    numerous sections of the liberals seemed on the eve of breaking out. Fortunately
                    this was averted by a change of the ministry, which was loudly demanded by the
                    factious opposition. The life and soul of the new ministry was Mendizabel, a man
                    of great vigour, and very popular among the people, on account of his liberal
                    prin ciples. He condemned the repressive measures which had been acted upon,
                    adopted a more lenient system of dealing with the malcontents, and proposed
                    various alterations in the constitution, the mere mention of which sufficed to
                    restore the country to comparative tranquillity. But all the deliberations of
                    the ministry and the Cortes were rendered abortive by the military revolution
                    which broke out at Malaga on the 25th of July 1836. The object of the ultra
                    liberals had uniformly been the restoration of the constitution of 1812. Without
                    this no change of ministers could satisfy them, and no vigilance on the part of
                    government could prevent them from covertly prosecuting their designs. It was
                    with the national guard that the revolt originated. In Malaga the governor was
                    assassinated, and a junta was appointed to proclaim the constitution.
                    Intelligence of these events spread throughout the country with the greatest
                    rapidity. Cadiz and Saragossa took up the signal nearly at the same moment; and
                    they were instantly followed by Seville, Cordova, Granada, and Valencia. At
                    length the capital itself joined the insurgent cities; and on the 13th of August
                    the queen, now deserted and helpless, was compelled to issue a decree, promising
                    the restoration of the constitution of 1812. But all men who were reasonable and
                    honest in their politics felt and admitted that some alterations in that code
                    were quite indispensable. The Cortes accordingly appointed a committee to
                    consider and propose<pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:chi.28490924&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=587" xml:id="kp-eb0720-0587-0513"/>
                    such alterations as were necessary and advisable; and this they accomplished in
                    a highly satisfactory manner. The changes recommended and finally adopted by the
                    Cortes were, 1st, that the part of the constitution which contain ed mere
                    regulations and forms, and regarded organic bodies and laws, should be entirely
                    suppressed: 2dly, that in stead of the Cortes continuing to form, as they did
                    under the constitution of 1812, only one body, they should now consist of two
                    bodies, differing from each other in the personal qualification of their
                    members, &amp;c. but neither to be hereditary nor privileged: 3dly, that the
                    crown should have an absolute veto in the enactment of laws, and should like
                    wise have the power of convoking, proroguing, and dis solving the Cortes; but in
                    the latter case to be under the obligation of assembling others within a given
                    time: 4thly, that the election of members of the Cortes should be direct, and
                    not indirect, as established by the constitution of 1812.</p>
                <p>While Spain was thus undergoing the most momentous political changes, the very
                    existence of the queen’s government was threatened by the Carlists, who were
                    making alarming progress in the very centre of the kingdom. During the early
                    part of the year the Christines attacked the position of the Carlists at
                    Arlavan, but with so little success that they were compelled to make a
                    retrograde movement. However, early in May, the British legion, under General
                    Evans, gallantly carried the Carliist lines be fore St Sebastian; but
                    unfortunately this victory, like many others gained, was productive of no
                    important result, chiefly through the sloth and inactivity of the Spanish
                    generals. The circumstance which created the great alarm to which allusion has
                    been made, was the march of a large body of Carlists under Gomez through the
                    very heart of Spain. This chief penetrated from province to province, to the
                    centre of Andalusia, laying the country under heavy contribution, and carrying
                    off loads of booty from every place which he visited. The audacity of this
                    enterprise seems for a time to have paralysed the royalists. Consternation
                    spread over Spain from Madrid to Gibraltar. Gomez at tacked and carried several
                    towns, and some bodies of troops who attempted to arrest his progress were
                    totally destroyed. No less than three distinguished Spanish generals, each with
                    a large army, were despatched to cut him oft’; but all their efforts to entrap
                    him and his daring band proved fruit less. He was repeatedly surrounded, and
                    apparently on the eve of being taken, but always succeeded i n effecting his
                    escape. At length, however, he was hemmed in to the seacoast at San Roque, and
                    his destruction seemed inevi table; but, by a daring and masterly movement, he
                    broke through the line which encompassed him, and secured his retreat to the
                    strongholds of the north.</p>
                <p>Towards the close of 1836, the town of Bilboa was again invested by the Carlists,
                    to whom it was an object of great importance, as being a city of sufficient
                    consideration to give dignity to the court of Carlos, and an appearance of
                    permanence to his establishment. It was, besides, the capital of Biscay, and
                    inseparably connected, in the eyes of the Basques, with their <hi rend="italic"
                    >fueros</hi> and local parliament. The siege was carried on with an ardour
                    corresponding with the importance attached to the place. The defence was equally
                    spirited and heroic. During the sixty days which the in vestment lasted, the
                    fortitude of the besieged was put to the severest test, not only by the
                    long-continued fire of the Carlists, by their repeated attacks, and by their
                    mining operations, but by want of proper food and by sickness. At length General
                    Espartero succeeded in compelling the Carlists to retire with the loss of all
                    their guns and <hi rend="italic">matériel</hi> for the siege, and Bilboa was
                    relieved. The intelligence was received at Madrid with unbounded enthusiasm, and
                    honours and rewards were heaped upon the defenders, and those who had so
                    opportunely relieved them. The Chris tinos, however, as usual, neglected to
                    follow up the success, allowing the Carlists to remain unmolested in the
                    neighbourhood. Near St Sebastian they mustered very strong during the early part
                    of 1837, and here they were attacked by the Anglo-Christinos under General
                    Evans, and driven back with some loss; but receiving a great accession of
                    strength, the Carlists in their turn compelled the royalists to retreat with at
                    least equal loss. The affair of Hernani would have been much more disastrous,
                    but for the steady bravery of a small body of British marines, who checked the
                    advance of the Carlists, and retired to St Sebastian in good order. In a
                    subsequent attack on Irun and Fuent arahia, General Evans was completely
                    successful; but it seems perfectly clear that this officer was never cordially
                    supported by the Spanish commanders. The defeat before Hernani would never have
                    taken place had Espartero and Sarsfield supported him according to the concerted
                    plan. The time for which the British legion volunteered its ser vices expired in
                    the month of May, and shortly afterwards it disbanded, nearly the whole
                    returning to England in the most destitute condition. Meanwhile Don Carlos had
                    follow ed the example of Gomez, by marching an army through the central parts of
                    the kingdom. Our limits will not permit us to follow him in this daring but
                    useless expedition. One body of Carlists advanced within a few leagues of
                    Madrid, and all was consternation in the capital. But the Christino generals
                    concentrating their forces, compelled the main body of the Carlist army to
                    retire from the provinces into which it had made so fierce an irruption.
                    Disunion also began to show itself in the camp of Don Carlos, so that,
                    disappointed and disheartened, he retreated to his old fastness beyond the Ebro,
                    accompanied however by a large convoy of booty. Besides these military
                    operations, prosecuted on a large scale, there was a system of desultory warfare
                    maintained all over the country, more destructive in its effects upon the
                    inhabitants than the regular operations of an army. Brigandage, never viewed
                    with much horror in Spain, had now become as common as a lawful trade.
                    Remorseless cruelty characterized the proceedings of all parties; and civil
                    life, except in the large towns, seemed for the time suspended.</p>
                <p>The civil and parliamentary history of Spain for 1837 presents little that is of
                    any importance. The new constitution formed a fruitful theme of discussion in
                    the Cortes. After undergoing the alterations already mentioned, and some others
                    of less moment, it was solemnly ratified by the queen-regent in the Cortes, and
                    proclaimed to the nation. It is worthy of being noticed, that an attempt to
                    introduce toleration in religious matters, by an amendment to the article which
                    establishes the Catholic faith, met with the strongest opposition. This striking
                    fact shows how deeply rooted the old Spanish bigotry remains in the national
                    mind. During the year, bills were passed for the suppression of religious
                    houses, and the abolition of the payment of tithes, the maintenance of the
                    clergy being left to the government. Several judicious ecclesiastical reforms
                    were projected; and among other important measures passed by the Cortes, was the
                    abolition of the local parliaments in the Basque provin ces. Ministerial changes
                    repeatedly took place during the year, but into these we shall not enter.</p>
                <p>The military operations of the Carlists in 1838 were Iess successful and less
                    enterprising than they had been during the two previous years. Cabrera, indeed,
                    a general w ho had frequently signalized his talents for war, had firmly
                    established himself in Aragon and Valencia, and the bands of partisans allowed
                    no respite to the distracted provinces; but we have to record none of those
                    daring and brilliant flying expeditions which more than once traversed Spain in
                    all directions with such celerity and success as to command the attention of
                    Europe. Something of this kind was indeed attempted by Basilio Garcia, and by
                    Tallada, but<pb break="no" facs="ht:chi.28490924&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=588"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0720-0588-0514"/> both these generals were signally defeated. The
                    cause of Don Carlos was now visibly declining: the best and bravest of the
                    chiefs who had served him had successively incurred his displeasure, and were
                    either in disgrace, exile, or confinement; above all, the country was beginning
                    to be favourably disposed to the queen. Her troops however were very
                    unsuccessful in the field. General Orad was defeated at Morella, and General
                    Alaix also suffered a repulse. But the principal battle fought between the
                    Carlists and Christinos was that of Maella, where General Cabrera completely
                    routed the queen’s troops under Pordinas, but sullied his victory by butchering
                    nearly two hundred prisoners in cold blood. The war throughout had been
                    disgraced by similar atrocities, notwithstanding the efforts of Britain to put a
                    stop to them. Both parties appear to have been equally guilty of this inhuman
                    practice. The operations of Eεpar tero were feeble and uncertain. He did little
                    but march a large army from place to place, without striking a decisive blow. As
                    usual, almost every part of Spain continued to be ravaged by guerilla bands, who
                    swarmed over the pro vinces with no other objects in view but plunder and blood
                    shed. During the year, the Cortes had twice met; their deliberations chiefly
                    referred to the state of the finances and the negociation of a loan, which was
                    not effected. The ministry, always feeble, had now become more feeble than ever,
                    notwithstanding that changes were continually taking place. The queen-regent
                    found it impossible to form a strong government in the present political state
                    of the coun try. Its helplessness was such that the generals commanding in the
                    different provinces found it necessary to act in dependently of its
                    arrangements, and to appropriate the revenues of each province to the payment of
                    the military expenses incurred in it, instead of allowing the monies to pass
                    into the treasury. Thus General Van Halen, who had organized a fine army of
                    40,000 men, called the army of the centre, after declaring the kingdoms of
                    Aragon, Valencia, and Murcia, in a state of siege for the rest of the war, and
                    that in future the civil were to consider themselves in sub ordination to the
                    military authorities, proclaimed, that the entire revenues of those provinces
                    should be paid into the military chest, and exclusively appropriated to the
                    expenses of the war. This was probably the very wisest measure that could have
                    been adopted for bringing the war to a speedy termination. Want of pay had
                    repeatedly paralyzed the operations of the Christine armies; it had dispersed
                    the British legion; and at this very moment it was exciting discontent, if not
                    revolt, in the camp of Don Carlos. To place the pay of the queen’s troops upon a
                    sure footing, was therefore the first step to secure ultimate triumph in the
                    field.</p>
                <p>During 1839, the cause of Don Carlos rapidly declined, notwithstanding the
                    desperate efforts made by Generals Cabrera and Maroto to maintain it. Espartero,
                    the comman der-in-chief of the queen’s troops, after some hard fighting, cut off
                    the Carlists completely from the plains of Alava, while Diego Leon likewise
                    expelled them from the rich country between the mountains and the Ebro. Many
                    towns and fortresses of importance, one after another, submitted to the
                    triumphant Christines, so that almost the only parts of Biscay which now owned
                    the authority of Carlos were rugged mountainous tracts of country, whither no
                    regular army could follow the fugitives. An armistice was at length concluded
                    between Maroto and Espartero, which was followed by twenty-one Carlist
                    battalions laying down their arms. Don Carlos himself, reduced to the last
                    extremity, fled for refuge into France, where he formally renounced his
                    pretensions to the throne of Spain, under certain conditions alike reasonable
                    and necessary. The question relative to the fueros of the Basques and Navarre,
                    which, it will be recollected, had been abolished, caused much uneasiness. It
                    seemed perfectly evident that these important provinces would not be satisfied,
                    or completely surrender themselves to the queen’s authority, unless their local
                    privileges were restored. After some debating in the Cortes this measure was
                    agreed to, government stipulating that it would so modify the fueros as to
                    reconcile the interests of these provinces with those of the nation, and with
                    the constitution of the monarchy. The only Carlist chief who gave any uneasiness
                    to the government was Ca brera, who, little affected by the pacification of the
                    northern provinces, still maintained his footing in Valencia, determined to
                    support the cause of Carlos while an army remain ed to back him. Towards the
                    close of the year, however, sickness paralyzed his exertions; nor is it supposed
                    that he will be able to effect much when the season again arrives for an army
                    taking the field. It is to be hoped that this protracted, bloody, and
                    disgraceful war is now virtually at an end. It has left Spain overwhelmed with a
                    debt which at present she has no prospect of being able to pay for many years to
                    come. National property, chiefly that of the church, was sold to the amount of
                    L. 10,000,000, to meet the exigencies of the time, but even this large sum fell
                    far short of what was required. The resources of the country are no doubt great,
                    but a long period of peace, and a wise administration of public affairs, will be
                    necessary before these are developed to their full extent. Spain has scarcely
                    been free from internal war since this century commenced. The injury thus
                    inflicted on agriculture, commerce, trade, and manufactures, is not to be
                    estimated, while its effect on the morals of the people has been most
                    pernicious, transforming the peaceful husbandman into a robber, and the aspiring
                    student into a leader of banditti. That Spain has struggled through this
                    sanguinary period of her history without being involved in total ruin, proves
                    that the natural resources of the country are immense, and only require proper
                    management to raise her above her former rank in the scale of nations.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">statistics</hi>.</p>
                <p>The position and boundaries of Spain have already been described. Its extent
                    north and south is from Tarifa Point, in the Straits, in 36° north latitude, to
                    Cape Ortegal in Galicia, 43° 46', making 7° 46' of latitude, or about 540
                    English miles. From east to west the extreme points are Cape Creus, in
                    Catalonia, 3° 17' of east longitude, and Cape La Roca, 9° 17' of west longitude,
                    the distance in this direction being 560 miles. The Peninsula thus forms almost
                    a square, allowance being made for the irregularity of its outline; and the
                    entire extent of Portugal being ex cluded, it is reckoned to contain about
                    176,000 square miles English.</p>
                <p>Spain may be considered as composed of a series of mountain terraces, which,
                    projecting successively their rugged edges towards the south, present a flight
                    of gigantic steps from the Pyrenees to the Mediterranean. The chains of
                    mountains which terminate and divide the great plains of the Peninsula are
                    branches of the immense ridge that, from the most elevated part of Tartary, runs
                    across Asia and Europe, penetrates into the south of France by Switzerland, and,
                    entering Spain in the direction of the valleys of Roncal and Bastan, separates
                    Navarre from Guipuscoa, Biscay from Alava, the highlands of Burgos from the
                    plains of Old Castille, and Asturias from the kingdom of Leon; then crosses
                    Galicia, and dips into the ocean at Capes Ortegal and Finisterre.</p>
                <p>The Pyrenees are lateral ramifications of this great trunk, which run east and
                    west on the eastern side of Spain, and take a southwest and northwest direction
                    on the confines of Aragon and Navarre. The accumulated mass of these mountains
                    presents, towards the Peninsula, the convex side of a spherical segment, which,
                    like a shield with its boss to<pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:chi.28490924&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=589" xml:id="kp-eb0720-0589-0515"/>
                    the south, rounds its edges near the Atlantic and the Mediterranean, and rears
                    the highest part of its curve on the Spanish territory, between the springs of
                    the rivers Cinca and Ara. This eminence, called <hi rend="italic">Mont
                    Perdu</hi> by the French, is known, in Aragon, by the appellation of Tres
                    Sorores, alluding to its three peaks, distinctly seen from Saragossa, of which
                    the highest rises 4114 Spanish yards above the level of the sea. The line of
                    perpetual congelation is there at the height of 2924 yards.</p>
                <p>In the minor branches which strike off from the Pyrenees in a south direction,
                    without forming a part of the great secondary chains, which we shall presently
                    describe, there are some mountains too remarkable to be left unnoticed. Such are
                    the Monsein, on the coast of Catalonia, near the town of Arens, and the
                    well-known Monserrat, which rises, on the same coast, to the height of 1479
                    yards above the sea; such the Sierras of Ribagorza, Barbastro, Hucsea, and Jaca,
                    which take their names from the principal cities in their neighbourhood; such,
                    finally, those numerous spurs of the great ridge which run into Navarre, whose
                    various appellations would only tend to confuse the reader.</p>
                <p>Of the main ridges which run across the Peninsula, that which rises to the west
                    of the source of the Ebro was called <hi rend="italic">Idubcda</hi> by the
                    Romans, and formed the limits of the ancient <hi rend="italic">Celtiberia.</hi>
                    In its course towards the Mediterranean, the natives, according to a general
                    custom, distinguish the various portions or great links of the chain by the
                    appellation of <hi rend="italic">Sierras,</hi> adding the name of some town or
                    notable height in their vicinity. Such are the Sierra de Oca of Urbion (the <hi
                    rend="italic">Distertiae</hi> of the middle ages), of Moncayo (<hi rend="italic"
                    >Mons Caunus),</hi> of Molina, Albarracin, and Cuenza. Part of this chain forms
                    the limits of Aragon and Castille; it then penetrates into Valencia, Murcia, and
                    Granada, and ends in the Capes Oropesa (Tenebrium), Martin, Palos, and Gata. The
                    small town of Alcolea, in the province of Soria, stands on this chain, at the
                    height of 1486 yards above the sea. Its mean elevation, on the road between
                    Molina and Teruel, in Aragon, is 1580 yards.</p>
                <p>The first point where this great ridge splits into the minor chains, which lose
                    themselves in the Mediterranean, is to the north of Albarracin, in Aragon. Of
                    these branches the most remarkable is that which, entering the province of
                    Valencia, is again subdivided into the smaller ridges which terminate at
                    Peñiscola and Cape Oropesa. The waters that descend from these heights, to the
                    north, mix finally with the Ebro, while the Turia and the Mijares are swelled by
                    those which flow from the southern declivities. On the branch stretching towards
                    Peñiscola, and in the limits of Ara gon, rises the Muela de Ares, a conical
                    mountain, deprived of its apex; whose top is an extensive plain covered with
                    luxuriant pasture, and surrounded by fearful precipices, at the elevation of
                    1562 Spanish yards above the sea. This is one of the highest spots in the
                    Peninsula. The Tagus, the Xucar, and the Cabriel, take their rise among these
                    mountains, and divide the waters which flow from their sides between the
                    Atlantic and the Mediterranean. Numerous flocks of sheep, both itinerant and
                    stationary, find, in the valleys formed by this chain, the most abundant summer
                    pastures.</p>
                <p>From Albarracin, this chain strikes into the territory of Cuenza, in a direction
                    nearly north and south. It then sends off a branch to the east-south-east, on
                    which the Collado de la Plata, or Silver Hill, rises 1598 yards above the sea.
                    It contains a quicksilver mine, which was formerly worked. From the
                    neighbourhood of this town the Sierra de Espadan runs, like an unbroken bulwark,
                    to the sea near Murviedro, in a direction between southeast and north west.
                    These hills are described as singularly grand and picturesque.</p>
                <p>Near the source of the Tagus, the Iberian ridge sends off another branch, which,
                    stretching in almost a southern direction, separates La Mancha from the province
                    of Murcia, to the west of the town of Albacete, and rises into the lofty
                    mountains of Alcaraz and Segura (the ancient <hi rend="italic">Orospeda),</hi>
                    dividing the waters between the Guadalquivir and the Segura, the two main
                    streams which severally and finally convey them to the ocean and the
                    Mediterranean. One of the two great limbs which terminate the Iberian ridge runs
                    into the sea at Cape Cervcra; the other, bending to the south, skirts the
                    kingdom of Granada, and disappears at Cape Gata. To the latter belongs the
                    mountain called Cabezo de Maria, between Carthagena and Cape Gata, one league
                    west of the town of Vera, on the coast of Valencia. It rises 2287 yards above
                    the sea, and has its summit covered with snow during one half of the year.</p>
                <p>Smaller brunches of this chain project between the Turia and the Cabriel, which
                    loses itself in the Xucar at Cofrentes. A ridge runs between the last-mentioned
                    river and the Al coy, another stream, which flows into the sea near Gandia. A
                    minor chain separates the Alcoy and the mouth of the Segura. The province of
                    Valencia is, in fact, divided by mountains into most fertile stripes, watered by
                    numerous streams, and enjoying every blessing which nature grants to the most
                    favoured climates.</p>
                <p>The great ridge whose summits divide the waters be tween the Duero and the Tagus
                    grows out of the Iberian chain, not far from the sources of the Xalon and the Ta
                    juña, to the south of the city of Soria, and the site of the ancient Numantia.
                    Where it divides the province of Guadalaxara from that of Soria, it is called
                    Sierra de Paredes, and Altos de Baraona. On one of the hills, north of Sigu
                    enza, rises the Henares, which gives its name to the ancient <hi rend="italic"
                    >Complutum,</hi> now Alcala de Henares, the seat of a university. Near the
                    source of the Lozoya, a rivulet which runs into the Xarama, these mountains are
                    called Somosierra, till, more to the west, they bear the name of Guadarrama; an
                    appellation which they preserve throughout the long course in which they skirt
                    the provinces of Segovia, Avila, Guada 1axara, and Madrid. The Puerto de
                    Navacerrada, the highest point on the road from Madrid to the summer pa lace of
                    San Ildefonso, is 2204 yards above the sea.</p>
                <p>The mountains of Guadarrama are a very striking object when seen from the
                    neighbourhood of Madrid, on the road to Old Castille. They principally consist
                    of naked, fractured granite rocks, heaped up together, and adorned only towards
                    their bases with single evergreen oaks, while the upper parts are bleak, dreary,
                    and barren, presenting fantastic prominences, and in many places covered with
                    perpetual snow. This chain, in its course towards Portugal, where it ends in the
                    Rock of Lisbon, rises into some re markable elevations. We shall notice that of
                    Peñalara, be tween the sources of the Eresma and the Lozoya, 2834 yards above
                    the sea; the Puerto del Pico in the province of Salamanca; the Peña de Francia,
                    and Sierra de Gata, on the northern limits of Spanish Estremadura.</p>
                <p>The minor branches run nearly north and south from the main ridge, and may be
                    traced from the opposite course of the rivers which flow either into the Duero

                <p>Almost parallel to the mountains of Guadarrama, we find the ridge which divides
                    the waters between the Tagus and the Guadiana; but it rises to no great height,
                    and is altogether of minor importance.</p>
                <p>The third great branch of the Iberian ridge is the Sierra Morena <hi
                    rend="italic">(Montes Mariani),</hi> which divides the waters be tween the
                    Guadiana and the Guadalquivir. It begins in the vicinity of Alcaraz, near the
                    eastern limits of the pro vince of La Mancha, issuing from that spur of the
                    Iberian chain which terminates in Cape Palos, and, trending in a direction
                    northeast and southwest, with La Mancha and Spanish Estremadura to the north,
                    and Jaen, Cordoba, Seville, and Algarve in Portugal, to the south, ends in

                    del Rey, where the road from Madrid to Andalusia crosses these mountains, is 821
                    yards above the sea. Near Cordo ba, where the bold skirts of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Montes Mariani</hi> are seen, within a short distance to the
                    north, like a skreen raised to protect the rich and extensive plains watered by
                    the Gaudalquivir, the ridge borrows the name of the neigh bouring city. On the
                    southern limits of Estremadura, and to the north of Seville, it is called Sierra
                    de Guadal canal. The chain now bends to the southwest, forms the northern
                    boundary of the Portuguese province of Algarve, and, through the Sierras of
                    Caldeiraon and Monchique, connects itself with Cape St Vincent.</p>
                <p>The brink of the last mountain plain towards the south of Spain is skirted by the
                    ridge of Granada and Ronda, which, striking off at the extremity of the Iberian
                    chain, is successively called Sierra de Gador, Sierra Nevada, Ber meja, and de
                    Ronda, till it ends in various points of the coast, but most conspicuously in
                    the Rock of Gibraltar.</p>
                <p>Part of Sierra Nevada rises above the highest Pyrenees. The Cumbre de Mulhacen is
                    4254 yards above the sea, the Picacho de Veleta 4153. The line of perpetual con
                    gelation is found in these mountains at the height of 3305 yards.</p>
                <p>The five great streams which water the plains lying be tween the great mountain
                    ridges, are the Miño, the Ebro, the Duero, the Tagus, the Guadiana, and the
                    Guadal quivir.</p>
                <p>The Mino, or Minho <hi rend="italic">(Minins</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >Baenis),</hi> rises in Galicia, in the district of Lugo, from a beautiful
                    spring called Fuente Miña. This river is navigable only to Salvatierra, two
                    leagues above Tuy. The Ebro rises, near Reynosa, out of a spring so copious that
                    it turns a corn-mill a few steps from its source. After a course of 110 leagues,
                    it flows into the Mediterranean at Alfaques. From the boundaries of Navarre to
                    the sea, the Ebro makes a progress of 1° 12' 42” towards the south. The chief
                    towns on this stream are Logroño and Calahorra, in the province of Rioja;
                    Tudela, in Navarre; Saragossa, in Aragon; and Tortosa, in Catalonia. It is a
                    misfortune for Spain that this great river presents strong obstacles to
                    navigation, both in its course and where it reaches the sea. Of the plans which
                    have been conceived, and partly executed, to obviate these impediments, we shall
                    presently have occasion to speak. The Duero, or Douro, has its source to the
                    north of the city of Osina, in a deep lake, at the summit of that portion of the
                    neighbouring chain of mountains called Sierras de Urbion. Its course is at first
                    towards the south, passing by Garray and Soria, where it turns to the west,
                    continuing in that direction till it reaches Miranda. From this town to Moncorvo
                    the river falls again into a south direction. It lastly takes a decided course
                    to the ocean, which it reaches near Oporto, having traversed a distance of 150
                    leagues. This river is navigable up to the tower of Moncorvo, a space of thirty
                    leagues. The navigation, which was formerly obstructed by rapids, has been
                    expedited through the exertions of the Portuguese company of Alto Douro. Some of
                    the smaller streams flowing into the Duero rise at remarkable heights. The
                    Adaja, which descends from the northern slope of the great chain between the
                    Duero and the Tagus, is, at Avila, 1271 yards above the sea; the Eresma, when it
                    flows by the castle of Segovia, is 1107 yards above the same level. We have
                    mentioned that elevated part of the chain between the Tagus and the Guadiana
                    which takes the name of Albarracin, and the truncated mountain called Muela de
                    San Juan. An in considerable spring, denominated Pie Izquierdo, is the source of
                    the majestic Tagus. In its course through the province of Cuenza it is
                    considerably augmented by the contributions of several streams. Before its
                    waters reach Aran juez, they surmount the rocky edge of its native mountain,
                    and, dashing upon the plain beneath, sink into a pool of great depth, called
                    Olla de Borlaque. The Tagus, now running placidly through the plains of Zorita
                    and the royal gardens of Aranjuez, at the elevation of 621 yards above the sea,
                    directs its course to Toledo, passes by Talavera, Alcantara, Abrantes, and
                    Santarem, losing itself finally in the sea near Lisbon. The latitudes of several
                    towns on the banks of the Tagus show the gradual inclination of its stream
                    towards the south. The sources of the Guadiana are found north of Alcaraz, in La
                    Mancha, at the pools of Ruidera. The course of the river is first to the
                    northwest for eight leagues. It is then absorbed by the soil, and dis appears
                    for seven leagues. The first gathering of its waters, after their subterraneous
                    dispersion, takes place near Day miel. The spot is called Ojos (Eyes) de
                    Guadiana. The stream now proceeds to Ciudad Real, the chief town of the province
                    of La Mancha, to Merida, Badajos, Mertola in Portugal, and, reentering the
                    Spanish territory, terminates in the ocean at Ayamonte. In its course to this
                    point, the Guadiana passes over a space of more than 100 leagues, but it is not
                    navigable higher than Mertola in Portugal. The Guadalquivir occupies the centre
                    of the plain which lies be tween the Sierra Morena and the chain of Granada,
                    where it takes its course to the northeast of Jaen. The chief towns on its banks
                    are Andujar, Cordoba, Seville, and San Lucar (<hi rend="italic">Templum
                    Luciferi).</hi> At the ferry near Mengibar, on the road from Madrid to Granada,
                    the Guadalquivir is 203 yards above the sea. This river is navigable for large
                    vessels up to Seville; but its bed being constantly raised and obstructed by
                    growing shallows, the navigation is extremely tedious.</p>
                <p>If we except the series of small lakes from which the river Guadiana takes its
                    rise, there are in Spain few lakes that merit particular notice. The most
                    remarkable of these is the lake of Abulfera, in the province of Valencia. This
                    lake begins near the village of Cataroija, about a league north of the city of
                    Valencia, and extends nearly four leagues, as far as Cullera. When it is full,
                    it is about four leagues in length, and two in breadth; but it is so shallow
                    that small boats can scarcely float in it. To supply the deficiency of water, an
                    engine is employed, by which the neighbouring waters are drawn into the bed of
                    the lake; and any super abundant water occasioned by heavy rains is carried off
                    into these by means of an artificial opening. This lake contains a great many
                    fish, and numerous aquatic birds make it their haunt.</p>
                <p>According to Professor Hausmann, viewing Spain as a whole, a threefold principal
                    difference is to be observed. The northern zone, which extends to the Ebro,
                    differs entirely in its characters from the middle zone; and this again is
                    completely different from the southern zone, which is bounded on the north by
                    the Sierra Morena and a part of the Ostrandes. The northern zone, which includes
                    Galicia, Asturias, the Basques, Navarre, the northern part of Aragon and
                    Catalonia, is a widely extended, mountainous, and hilly country. The snow-fields
                    and glaciers of the Pyrenees on the one side, and on the other the north and
                    northwest winds, have a marked influence in lowering the temperature of the
                    atmosphere, and in increasing the sup ply of water. The increased humidity is
                    favourable to vegetation, which on the whole very much resembles that of the
                    south of France; and the variety of rocks containing lime, clay, and sand, and
                    also their frequent alternations, operate beneficially on the soil. Everywhere
                    it invites to cultivation, and the inhabitants of this region are active
                    husbandmen. The middle part of Spain, which comprises Old and New Castille, a
                    part of Aragon, Leon, and Estre madura, is not so favourably circumstanced.
                    Generally speaking, it is deficient in either beauty or variety of aspect. The
                    broad and lofty tablelands present a uniform and monotonous surface, destitute
                    of trees, and scorched by the rays<pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:chi.28490924&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=591" xml:id="kp-eb0720-0591-0517"/>
                    of the sun. The cornfields are wretchedly cultivated, and desert heaths of
                    cistus everywhere meet the eye. Plantations of olive-trees are rare; here, in
                    short, every kind of vegetation dwindles for want of water. In most cases the
                    rivers carry but little water in comparison with the extent of the land and the
                    number of considerable mountain chains. The causes of this great deficiency are
                    principally the extreme dryness of the atmosphere; the inconsiderable cover of
                    snow on the mountains, and its short continuance; the absence of forests and
                    great moors on the heights; and the comparatively inconsiderable breadth of the
                    mountain ranges. The southern and southwestern part of Spain, which comprehends
                    Andalusia, Granada, and Murcia, is very different from that just described. On
                    the opposite side of the Sierra Morena the whole land has a more southern as
                    pect, which announces itself not only by the vegetable, but likewise by the
                    animal kingdom. The great difference of climate is produced by the southern
                    situation, the exposure of the acclivity on the south and southwest to the
                    African winds, and the strong reflection of the solar rays from the lofty naked
                    mountain-walls. The mountain ranges are more closely aggregated, the valleys
                    more deeply cut; and there is also a greater difference in the rocks and in
                    their position, so that extensive tablelands cannot be formed. The south of
                    Spain thus possesses not only a much higher temperature, one fit for the orange
                    and the palm, but also a more varied and more favourable soil for cultivation.
                    In East Valencia and Murcia, in the south of Andalusia and the Algarves, in
                    Western Alemtejo and South Estremadura, the rich and varied vegetation rivals
                    that of the fertile plains of Syria. In Andalusia frosts are unknown, and the
                    snow, if it ever falls, melts the moment it touches the soil; so that it is not
                    surprising that, in the cultivated districts, the Spa niards, so famous for
                    their maritime expeditions of yore, should have introduced many vegetables from
                    remote parts of the world, thus giving a perfectly tropical appearance to the
                    country. There is, however, a deficiency of moisture, but it seems only to
                    affect the growth of some of the lower species of plants.</p>
                <p>Passing over such productions of the soil as are only interesting to the
                    botanist, we shall enumerate those which come under the cognizance of the
                    husbandman. Spain may be reckoned one of the most fruitful countries of Europe,
                    and it presents a great variety of products. Wheat, secale, barley, maize, and
                    flax, are cultivated in almost all the provinces, but still not in crops
                    sufficient for home consumption. Oats are neglected, barley being given to the
                    cattle instead of that grain. Oil and soda are the principal products of the
                    southern shores of the Mediterranean; the others are sumach, and different
                    esculent plants of an admirable quality. In the same part of the country are
                    fields of saffron, plantations of rice, which stretch out like so many plains,
                    and the cotton shrub thrives as on its native soil. The mulberry trees are very
                    luxuriant, and their leaves afford rich nourishment to the bombyx, which easily
                    accounts for the superior quality of the silk. In the south of Spain there is an
                    immense variety of the most delicious fruits, not only such as are common in
                    temperate climates, but many which naturally belong to the tropical regions. The
                    sugar cane grows near the cotton plant, and numerous olives fur nish the oil
                    which forms so important a branch of commerce. Kali, from which barilla is
                    extracted, is produced in great abundance in Valencia; anise, maize, and
                    different dye stuffs in Murcia; and the honey of Cuenza is still as celebrated
                    as it was in the time of the Romans. Among the vegetable products we may briefly
                    mention chestnuts and a variety of other nuts, the corktree, palm, lemon,
                    banana, date, pomegranate, fig, citron, cheremoya, laurel, bay, cypress, almond,
                    and strawberry tree; potatoe and other culinary vegetables; forests of oak,
                    pine, and other trees, chiefly in Catalonia, the Asturias, Galicia, and the
                    Sierra Morena.</p>
                <p>Extensive valleys covered with rich pastures are found in Navarre, and numerous
                    herds are fattened on them. In the Asturias considerable forests still exist,
                    chiefly of <hi rend="italic">evergreen</hi> oaks, from which naval timber is
                    obtained. But of all the vegetable productions of Spain, the vine is the most
                    important, the lands being almost everywhere favourable to its culture. The
                    excess of the vintage above the quantity consumed in the country forms a
                    considerable branch of the export trade, and it is capable of being greatly ex
                    tended. The best wines are those of Peralta in Navarre; Ribadavia and Betanzos
                    in Galicia; Mansanares and Val de Penas in La Mancha; Xeres or Sherry, San
                    Lucar, and Rota, in Seville; Cabra, Lucena, and Campine, in Cordova; Malaga in
                    Granada; and lastly, Alicant in Valencia. Sherry wine is produced in great
                    quantities in the plain of Xeres, and a considerable portion is exported to this
                    country. Mr Jacob estimates the quantity of this wine annually produced at
                    40,000 pipes, of which 15,000 are exported, mostly to England. The finest wine
                    is produced in Malaga, but not in large quantities.</p>
                <p>Mr Swainson thus describes the zoology. “The native zoology has been so little
                    investigated, that nothing beyond a meagre list could be furnished of indigenous
                    animals. In the mountains of Asturias the ibex is not uncommon, and the Alpine
                    squirrel <hi rend="italic">(Sciurus Alpinus)</hi> is only found in the Pyrenees.
                    In the southern parts, bordering on the African shore, a few species of warblers
                    have recently been found, which are as yet unknown to the rest of Europe. The
                    European bee-eater frequents the vicinity of Gibraltar in large flocks during
                    the season of migration. Among the domesticated animals, the horse and sheep
                    deserve particular notice, as having been long celebrated throughout Eu rope.
                    The best horses are generally about four feet six or eight inches in height;
                    they have all the fire, docility, grace, and action of the beautiful Arabians of
                    Barbary, and there can be no doubt of these noble animals having been introduced
                    by the Moors and crossed with the native breed. Those of Andalusia, Granada, and
                    Estremadura, are the most distinguished. At Zeres are found two perfectly
                    distinct races; the one, which possesses the fine qualities above mentioned, is
                    still preserved in all its purity at Chartreux. The other race is larger,
                    stronger, less elegant, and used for common purposes. But little care has
                    latterly been bestowed in keeping up the more noble breed, so that fine horses
                    are not so common in Spain as formerly. The mule in so mountainous a country is
                    particularly useful, and, with the ass, is principally used for conveying goods
                    into the in terior. The breeds of the latter are very fine, anti are hardly
                    excelled by those of Egypt. Spain is still celebrated for its Merino race of
                    sheep. The flocks are kept constantly travelling during the greater part of the
                    summer, but are carefully pent up in winter. This race, subdivided into breeds,
                    is extended over the greater part of Spain, but those of Cavage and Negrate are
                    the best. A third breed, the Sowan, appears more hardy, and passes the winter in
                    Estremadura, Andalusia, and New Castille. These three constitute what is called
                    the Transhumante, or travelling race, to distinguish them from the Estautes, or
                    those of a some what interior breed, which do not migrate. The best fleeces are
                    those which appear almost black on their sur face, caused by the dust adhering
                    to the peculiar greasy pile; for it is invariably found that such fleeces are of
                    the purest white beneath.” There is a very large breed of oxen in the country
                    round Salamanca; but the cattle of Spain have been much neglected, the
                    mountaineers deriving all their milk and butter from goats. Fine cattle, how
                    ever, are reared in the Asturias; and pigs are very common on the mountains of
                    the same province. The wild boar, the wolf, the bear, and different kinds of
                    deer, are still found in Spain, but these are gradually becoming extinct. The
                    chamois and the lynx still find shelter in the Pyrenees and<pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:chi.28490924&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=592" xml:id="kp-eb0720-0592-0518"/>
                    the mountains of Cuenza. The wild animals of the southern part of Spain are very
                    similar to those of the north of Africa.</p>
                <p>Spain has long been celebrated for its richness in minerals, and large veins of
                    various metals are still found in several parts of the country. Gold and silver
                    mines were formerly worked; but they have been given up, although grains of
                    these metals are still found. Lead is found in considerable quantities; the
                    principal veins, as the lead-glance veins of Sinares, are found in granite. The
                    colossal deposit of galena, which yielded 600,000 quintals of lead in 1829, lies
                    in irregular masses in a limestone formation. The principal mines are near
                    Tortoza in Catalonia; nt Zoma, Benasques, and Plan in Aragon; in Estremadura, in
                    Murcia, in Old Castille, in Seville; and at the district of Linares, in Jaen.
                    Mercury is also found, and at Almaden there is a rich mine of this valuable
                    mineral, which is wrought in the clay slate. Iron ore occurs in very large
                    quantities, principally in the northern provinces. In the Pays Basque, the has
                    formation is very rich in iron ore; and at Solomostro, near Bilboa, enormous
                    deposits of carbonated iron are found. Veins of copper, antimony, and sulphur,
                    are occasionally discovered, but not in such quantities as to be worth working.
                    Coal also exists in considerable quantities in many provinces; and this mineral
                    is gaining in importance every year, from other fuel becoming scarce.</p>
                <p>Although Spain possesses all the advantages of climate, and the soil is generally
                    fertile, the agriculture of the country is in a state of deplorable
                    backwardness. A variety of causes has been assigned for this, but the principal
                    cause is what has been appropriately termed the curse of the Mesta. This is a
                    privilege granted to the proprietors of flocks to conduct their sheep into
                    different provinces for the sake of pasturage. In their progress the sheep
                    commit considerable depredations on the crops. The law of entail, which exists
                    in Spain in its worst form, is also supposed to hinder improvement in
                    agriculture; but perhaps the most serious obstacle to improvement is the want of
                    internal communication, and the indolence of the rural population. The farms are
                    generally small, and the farmers of a district live together in villages. There
                    is no rotation of crops, and the wheat, after a slight ploughing, is sown at the
                    commencement of the rains. The operation of thrashing and cleaning the grain is
                    performed in the open air, and the grain is left in the fields or concealed in
                    caves till sold. Implements of husbandry are of the rudest description; fanners
                    are un known except about the seacoast, and the spade is still in use in some of
                    the mountainous parts of the country. The most careful cultivation is to be
                    found in the <hi rend="italic">huertas of</hi> Granada, Murcia, and Valencia,
                    which are well irrigated by the waters of the Xenil, Segura, and Xucar. Rice is
                    produced in Valencia, and a mild red pepper is the chief vegetable cultivated in
                    Murcia. These three provinces are considered as the gardens of Spain, and
                    annually yield three and four crops of vegetables, maize, and a mild red pep
                    per. In spite of this fertility, however, it is calculated that the entire lands
                    of Spain do not yield more than from one and a half to two per cent. to the
                    proprietors. Some improvements have recently been introduced, but even now
                    scarcely a fourth of the surface of the country is applied to any profitable
                    use. A far greater extent of land is devoted to pasturage than is required for
                    the maintenance of the cattle; and only about a twelfth of the superficies is
                    occupied by wood. In Biscay, agriculture has made many improvements; and in
                    spite of the disadvantages of soil, the population of this district is more
                    numerous, and grain cheaper, than in the fertile plains to the south and east of
                    Seville; which, if properly cultivated, might supply all Spain. “The kingdoms of
                    Old Castille and Leon,” says a writer in the Foreign Quarterly Review, vol. v.
                    “are justly considered the granaries of Spain. They have their outlets in the
                    north by various ports from Gijon to St Sebastian, the principal being Santander
                    and Bilboa. The provinces of Burgos and Palencia are the nearest points from
                    which these ports get any considerable supply; the distance being from 130 to
                    140 English miles from each. The elevated and rich <hi rend="italic">campos</hi>
                    which extend from Logroño to Burgos, and thence on each side of the Arlanza and
                    Pisuerga, and along the Cauvion, and numerous other streams which water the
                    provinces of Palencia, Valladolid, and Zamora, yield immense quantities of
                    wheat; and further to the west, and on the south side of the Douro, the
                    provinces of Toro and Salamanca may be considered as forming a portion of the
                    richest wheat country in Spain, or perhaps in the world. The crop is often so
                    abundant for a series of years, that the produce of the fields at a distance
                    from the villages is some times allowed to rot on the ground, the expense of
                    conveying it home being considered beyond its value. It was calculated that the
                    accumulated surplus of four or five successive years, in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >silos</hi> and granaries of these plains, amount ed at the close of the harvest
                    of 1828 to 6,000,000 of fane gas, or 1,200,000 Winchester quarters. The ordinary
                    cost of carriage does not exceed seven or eight shillings for every hundred
                    miles; but the means of transport are so defective and so badly organized, that
                    when any extraordinary demand for exportation takes place, the rates advance
                    accordingly. Thus, in September 1828, the usual price was seven or eight
                    shillings; but in consequence of extensive demands from France and England, it
                    rose two months after to fourteen shillings and sixteen shillings per quarter.
                    The grain of Spain is of the finest quality, that of Andalusia bearing a price
                    ten or fifteen per cent. higher than that of any foreign grain brought to the
                    markets of Cadiz. In spite of her facilities for agriculture, it is remarkable
                    that Spain regularly imports, upon an average, 400,000 quarters of grain. This
                    may arise from the want of proper means of transporting grain from one province
                    to another, and not from any deficiency in the produce of the country.” Several
                    of the provinces, such as Galicia, Asturias, part of Leon, Santander, Biscay,
                    and the kingdom of Navarre, barely produce sufficient for the consumption of
                    their inhabitants. Catalonia does little more than maintain the half of its in
                    habitants; Valencia exports rice, but both it and Murcia import wheat; Cuenza,
                    Guadalaxara, Segovia, Avila, and Madrid, produce less than their consumption.
                    The pro vinces of Old Castille, part of Leon, Estremadura, part of Andalusia and
                    Toledo, produce such an abundance that they might supply all the deficiencies of
                    the other parts of Spain, and also export to foreign countries in seasons of
                    plenty. Miñano calculates the gross amount of agricultural produce in 1826 at
                    L.76,965,000, and the net produce at L.28,403,666. The same authority estimates
                    the number of cattle, &amp;c. in the kingdom in 1826 as follows: horned beasts,
                    2,944,885; horses, 400,495; mules, 223,646; sheep, 18,687,159; goats, 5,187,668;
                    asses, 641,788; swine, 2,728,283; beehives, 1,697,593.</p>
                <p>The manufactures of Spain are in a very depressed state, although some thriving
                    manufactories exist, principally on the seacoast. The manufacture of silk was
                    formerly the grand staple of trade, and although now much depre ciated, it is
                    calculated to furnish employment for nearly 16,000 persons. Numerous
                    manufactures of various kinds have been established in Catalonia within the last
                    twenty years; those of silk and cotton are the most extensive, and are in a
                    thriving state. The looms of Valencia are calculated to employ at the present
                    day nearly 3000 persons, and produce tissues, gauzes, and ribbands, equal to the
                    French manufactories. The silk manufacture of Talavera de la Reyna and Saragossa
                    are still in high repute. The latter province also produces cloth, which is much
                    in request. Galicia annually imports 20,000 hundredweight of flax, which is
                    conveyed to Santiago, and distributed throughout<pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:chi.28490924&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=593" xml:id="kp-eb0720-0593-0519"/>
                    the villages of this province to be converted into linen, and sold in the
                    Castilles. In the north, Bilboa and Santander, in the south, Seville and Cadiz,
                    are the great entrepôts for the exportation of wool, which is also spun and
                    manufactured into cloth in Catalonia and Barcelona. These manufactures, however,
                    are by no means sufficient for the inhabitants, and almost every species of
                    manufacture is import ed. In Catalonia there are numerous manufactories of
                    coarse cloth, which enjoy a monopoly; coarse cloths of fo reign manufacture
                    being almost prohibited by a heavy tax. The finest cloth is manufactured in
                    Valencia, and the trade is in a flourishing state, employing nearly 10,000
                    hands. Tanning is the most active branch of manufacture in the northern
                    provinces. Potteries are numerous, but the articles produced are generally of an
                    inferior description. There is a royal porcelain manufactory at Madrid, the
                    produce of which is very superior, but it costs the government more than it
                    returns. Hat and paper manufactories have also been established, and have met
                    with considerable success. The manufacture of arms forms a part of the trade of
                    Spain, but the quantity made is by no means great. There are two large factories
                    in Biscay; at Abaceti and Toledo swords are made; at Segovia, firearms; and at
                    this latter place, as well as at Seville and Placencia, there are good
                    founderies. Seville carries on a considerable trade in leather, a species of
                    which, prepared with gall-nuts, is in much request. Ferrol and Vittoria possess
                    considerable tanneries; and the former has an establishment where varnished
                    leather is made. Iron manufactories are very numerous in Biscay, but none of
                    them is conducted on an extensive scale. In almost every village in this
                    province some kind of iron ware is manufactured; horseshoes, fusils, locks, and
                    bedsteads being the chief articles, which are sent to the interior. Cast iron
                    utensils are prohibited from being imported into Spain; but this regulation does
                    not seem to be attended with any great advantage, for there is only one smelting
                    manufactory at Bilboa. Several other iron manufactories have been established
                    throughout the country, the principal being at Pederoza and Martulla in
                    Andalusia; but it does not appear that they have met with any degree of success.
                    Iron ore is prohibited from being exported, but considerable quantities are
                    nevertheless sent to France. Manufactures are much checked in Spain by the
                    system of monopoly, several of the largest manufactories being in the hands of
                    the government, and consequently ill conducted.</p>
                <p>The commerce consists chiefly in the exporting of wines, wool, brandy, fruits,
                    silk raw and manufactured, lead, iron, mercury, barilla, and a few other
                    articles, amounting in all, according to a government return in 1826, to the
                    value of L.1,584,000. Iron, in bars, is exported in considerable quantities from
                    Bilboa, Cumana, and Vittoria, chiefly to Bayonne and Bordeaux. Malaga and
                    Alicant wines are also important branches of commerce; and the coarse wines of
                    Murviedro are extensively exported. The export of dried fruits gives activity to
                    the ports of Alicant, Malaga, Seville, and Valencia; and the latter town is
                    famous for its dyes. The imports of Spain consist of sugar, salt fish, spices,
                    wood, rice, butter, cheese, hides, wool, and cotton, and al most every
                    manufactured article. The transport of salt from Cadiz and Torrevieju, for the
                    fisheries of Galicia, is an important branch of commerce, and, along with the
                    fisheries themselves, employs a great number of hands, producing the best
                    sailors, and giving activity to the towns and villages on the coast, which is
                    seldom seen in the interior. The net produce of commerce and manufactures was
                    estimated by Miñano in 1826 at L.14,660,000. It is difficult to arrive at any
                    correct estimate of the value of the ex ports and imports of Spain, from the
                    want of official documents; and even when these are obtained, little reliance
                    can be placed on them. The following is from an official document published in
                    1826.</p>

                <p>Banking is almost unknown in Spain, the principal mer chants doing the business
                    of bankers. There are no substitutes for cash in ordinary transactions, bills of
                    exchange being principally used; but these do not pass from hand to hand as
                    cash, except by special arrangement. The difficulty of transmitting specie is
                    the cause of these bills being much used; merchants preferring rather to pay a
                    premium than run the risk of losing the specie altogether. The rate of exchange
                    of course varies with the supply of bills in the market, and also with the
                    character of the houses offering the paper. Most of the bills are at short
                    dates, generally within one month. Some are as short as two days; and these are
                    allowed eight days’ grace, unless the word <hi rend="italic">fixed</hi> is
                    written on them. Interest generally varies from three to four and a half per
                    cent. on discounting bills, but this mode of negotiation is not much practised.
                    Interest on mercan tile transactions is understood to be fixed at six per cent.,
                    and three per cent. on mortgages; but the law is easily evaded, there being no
                    penalty inflicted on those who charge more than the legal interest. There are no
                    bankers with whom money can be lodged; and it is customary for people rather to
                    horde up their money than to run the risk of its being lost in the hands of
                    merchants.</p>
                <p>In internal communication, Spain lies under great dis advantages, both from the
                    mountainous nature of the coun try, and the obstructed navigation of the rivers.
                    In the hands of an enterprising people, these difficulties might soon be
                    overcome. The roads and canals are not numerous, and, if we except the principal
                    highways, are but imperfectly kept. The two roads which run from Madrid to
                    Burgos, the one through Valladolid, and the other through Aranda de Douro, are
                    kept in good condition; but the great eastern roads are<pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:chi.28490924&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=594" xml:id="kp-eb0720-0594-0520"/>
                    represented as in a wretched state. The road to France by way of Vittoria and
                    Irun is kept in excellent condition, considering the mountainous nature of the
                    country through which it runs. The road to Corunna and Ferrol, through Galicia,
                    is in many places impassable for carriages or carts. That over the Sierra Morena
                    to Seville is well kept. The roads of Catalonia are said to be in better
                    condition than most in Spain. These roads are kept up partly by tolls, and
                    partly by local taxes; but the amount collected is not sufficient for
                    maintaining proper communications. It appears that L.92,400 were expended in
                    repairing and making roads and building bridges in the year 1826, and L.89,240
                    for the same purpose in 1827. The ordinary mode of conveying goods is by means
                    of mules, asses, or small carts drawn by oxen. Stagecoaches are becoming more
                    common; but these can only be used on the great roads, the ordinary cross roads
                    being generally too bad for such conveyance. In Biscay and Navarre the roads are
                    under the superintendence of the provincial administration, and are more nume
                    rous, better constructed, and more carefully managed, than any others in the
                    country.</p>
                <p>The canals are stated to be in a much more deplorable condition than the roads,
                    and although many have been projected by government, none of any importance has
                    been completed.</p>
                <p>The most important is that which was intended to unite the Mediterranean Sea with
                    the Bay of Biscay; but of this mighty undertaking only two portions exist, the
                    canal of Aragon, running parallel to the Ebro, from Saragossa, and that of Old
                    Castille, along the Pisuerga and Carrion, by Placencia. Neither of these
                    portions, however, approaches the sea, and their benefit is therefore limited.
                    The other canals are, that of Castille, which connects the port of Santander
                    with the Duero; the canal of Segovia, which connects that town with the river of
                    the same name; and the canal of San Carlo, which is constructed to give a port
                    to Fortoza.</p>
                <p>The population of Spain presents fluctuations which can only be accounted for by
                    the fact of the internal wars which have so frequently convulsed her, or on the
                    supposition that the returns which have been published are incorrect. It has
                    been gradually increasing for the last two centuries, and latterly at a more
                    rapid progression. It appears that in 1700 the population was estimated at
                    8,000,000. The following table, extracted from M‘Gregor’s Statistics of Nations,
                    gives the population in 1803 as exhibited by the official tables, and in 1827 as
                    given by Moreau de Jonnes in his Statistics, which latter, however, must have
                    exceeded the real numbers, as the population was ascertained in 1837 to amount
                    only to 12,168,572.</p>

                <p>(<hi rend="italic">a</hi>) Official census. (<hi rend="italic">b</hi>) As given
                    by M. Moreau de Jonnes, in his Statistics for 1834. It is generally believed
                    that the census of 1803 is much below the actual number of inhabitants; and
                    according to the returns of 1723 it would appear that in 103 years the
                    population bad increased from 7.925,000 to nearly 14,000,000. It also appears,
                    from the observation of most persons, that the actual population of Spain had
                    increased more slowly than that of any other country, particularly before losing
                    ber South American empire. M. Moreau de Jonnes estimates the population in 1834
                    at 14,060,000. According, however, to a return of the number of senators and
                    deputies to the Cortes from all Spain, corresponding to the population of the
                    provinces, which appeared in the royal decree of 3 August 1837, the exact
                    population of the kingdom was 12,168,572.<pb break="no"

                <p>The population of Spain, according to the royal decree of August 1837, being
                    12,168,572, if we add the 3,528,444 of the colonies, the entire population of
                    Spain and its dependencies will be 15,697,016.</p>
                <p>The Roman Catholic religion exclusively prevails in Spain, and here in all ages
                    it has assumed its most bigoted and intolerant form. The church establishment
                    includes eight archbishops and seventy-two bishops, 2393 canons, and 1869
                    prebendaries, together with an immense multitude of other ecclesiastics, under
                    various denominations. In the year 1835 there still remained 1940 cloisters,
                    containing 30,906 monks. Of these the Franciscans alone possessed 651 cloisters,
                    with 11,232 monks and lay-brothers. But by a royal decree of the above year, all
                    the religious houses which did not contain more than twelve monks were
                    abolished. The number of monasteries thus condemned amounted to 900. Their
                    revenues were applied to the extinction of the national debt. The whole income
                    of the church is valued at L.12,500,000 sterling, and the portion of the income
                    which is consumed by the spirituality exceeds the collective income of the state
                    by about L.2,000,000.</p>

                    throughout the country have been estimated at about 20,000.</p>
                <p>There are numerous public libraries in the more important towns, some of them of
                    considerable extent. One at Madrid contains about 130,000 volumes, numerous manu
                    scripts, and a rich collection of medals. The prohibition, however, of many
                    standard works greatly limits their value.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Finances.</hi></p>
                <p>According to the budget of 11th February 1837, the expenditure amounted to
                    1,929,300,795 reals.</p>

                <p>With regard to the national debt of Spain it is impossible to obtain any thing
                    like a correct estimate. For the last eight or nine years it has continued to
                    accumulate with fearful rapidity, and loan after loan has been negociated. It
                    seems almost impossible that so large an amount as from two millions to two
                    millions and a half sterling, can be annually collected to pay the interest of
                    the national debt in a country already grievously oppressed with taxes, and
                    where trade is in some measure stagnant. The balance of her trade, ever since
                    the loss of her colonies, has been in the ratio of two to one against Spain,
                    while the whole value of her exportable produce, even in the most prosperous
                    periods, has not exceeded three millions and a half; and this is now supposed to
                    be greatly reduced, since the exports to Eng 1and, which is the greatest
                    consumer of her fruits, wine, and wool, have barely averaged for the last four
                    or five years one million sterling. In 1833, the public debts amounted to
                    L.165,000,000, and as the expenditure exceeded the income, and various loans
                    have since been nego ciated, it has now materially increased. Taxation in Spain
                    is very heavy, and is levied with little regard to the well<pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:chi.28490924&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=596" xml:id="kp-eb0720-0596-0522"/>
                    being or comfort of the population. It is grossly unequal and arbitrary, no one
                    ever being able to tell what he may be required to pay; and the greatest abuses
                    exist in its collection. Scarcely one half of the tax laid on the in habitants
                    ever reaches the government, the rest being absorbed by the various officers
                    employed. No fewer than 10,000 persons are employed in collecting the custom
                    duties; and being ill paid, they are open to bribery, and even levy
                    contributions for their own pockets. The same duties are not imposed in the
                    different towns, one merchant being called upon sometimes to pay L.40 of a tax,
                    while an other in a different place may have only to pay L.20. The <hi
                    rend="italic">alcabala</hi> is a tax which is levied upon every article of use,
                    and presses with great severity upon the poor. It was formerly an impost on the
                    transfer of commodities from one hand to another, but is now paid by
                    gate-duties. In towns which are not walled or have no gates, this tax is levied
                    by a calculation of the amount paid by another town of the same size. Tithes
                    are, next to the alcabala, the most oppressive of the taxes; but the clergy do
                    not receive perhaps one half of the amount collected. There is also a tax of six
                    per cent. on the produce of all rented lands; and on the accession of the heir
                    to an entailed estate, the first half year’s rental falls to the government A
                    tax of L.100,000 is levied yearly upon the merchants: the finance minister fixes
                    the amount which each intendancy has to pay, and the intendant the pro portion
                    which each town must pay; and another magistrate assesses the individuals. The
                    revenue from tobacco and salt is considerable, they being monopolies in the
                    hands of government. The amount of salt which each town ought to consume is
                    fixed; and landowners and farmers pay in pro portion to the number of their
                    dependents, and the cattle and sheep which they possess. The clergy pay an
                    annual subsidy, in addition to some other contributions.</p>
                <p>The state of crime shows Spain to be in a very imperfect state of civilization.
                    The administration of justice is extremely slow and uncertain, and indeed all
                    the legislation upon criminal affairs is as bad as possible. The crimes most
                    complained of are those of assassination and robbery; and although these do not
                    prevail now to the extent they once did, the returns show that murder is still a
                    very common crime. The returns for the year 1827 give the number of murders as
                    1223, and attempts at murder as 1773; and this report is very inaccurate, as no
                    returns were sent from either Aragon or Valencia. A person robbed or assaulted
                    is bound over to prosecute; and should he fail to prove the guilt of the
                    criminal, he has to pay all expenses of the suit. Witnesses are liable to
                    imprisonment in case of the prisoner being acquitted; and this preposterous law
                    has a strong and obvious tendency to interrupt the course of justice.</p>
                <p>The poor in Spain are numerous, and begging is considered as no disgrace in many
                    of the provinces. Even stu dents have been known to go on begging excursions
                    during the vacation, labour being in their estimation a greater disgrace than
                    asking alms. There are numerous hospitals in the large towns, chiefly under the
                    management of the clergy. The funds for maintaining them are principally derived
                    from legacies of lands and rents, partly bequeathed by private individuals, and
                    partly by bishops. In the northern provinces the hospitals are supported chiefly
                    by public subscriptions and collections in the churches, the legacies being
                    unimportant. The convents and monasteries support many paupers; the Franciscan,
                    Dominican, and Capuchin orders, although beggars themselves, keeping open table
                    for a certain number of poor. A contribution of L.30,000 is annually made from
                    the public funds, being a portion of the revenue collected by the vicargeneral
                    of the <hi rend="italic">cruzado.</hi> Notwithstanding these institutions,
                    however, the number of beggars is still very great. Only in some of the towns is
                    begging prohibited, and in these the vagrants are employed much in the same way
                    as in our own workhouses.</p>
                <p>The character of the Spaniard is grave, adventurous, romantic, honourable, and
                    generous. He is not inclined to adopt foreign manners, and is possessed of great
                    national pride. He is naturally brave, provided his heart be in the cause which
                    he espouses; but he is easily excited to tumultuary violence, and is very
                    unwilling to submit to the restraints of discipline. In prosperity he is apt to
                    give way to supineness and false confidence; but in adversity which might
                    overwhelm others, he will often display great courage and surprising resources.
                    He is very slow in his operations, and often ruins enter prises by temporizing.
                    In all the provinces except those of the north, the inhabitants are extremely
                    indolent, and pos sess a most invincible hatred of labour. They are fond of
                    amusements, dancing and cards being the favourite re creations. Theatrical
                    exhibitions are not very popular, being generally insipid. They are still
                    attached to the bullfight, but this cruel amusement is not now so common as
                    formerly. It will however prevail as long as the coun try remains in its present
                    state of ignorance. Dancing has acquired a national character; and to this day
                    the Spaniard has many an allegorical dance, borrowed from the Moors. The
                    pleasures of society are chiefly sought at evening parties, where only slight
                    refreshments are presented; and indeed, both in eating and drinking, the
                    Spaniards are remarkably temperate. Music also forms one of their principal
                    amusements, the instrument most generally used being the guitar. Castanets are
                    also extremely common, and are employed with great dexterity and address in the
                    national dances. The music of the country is not remark able, being almost
                    altogether light melodies, with a slight accompaniment from the guitar. Spanish
                    architecture, from its being a mixture of the Moorish and Gothic styles, has
                    somewhat affected the architecture of other countries. The innumerable churches
                    scattered over the country are generally in the Gothic taste, but more light,
                    from its con junction with the Moorish. Many of them are fine edifices; but the
                    most remarkable architectural monument of Spain is the palace of the Escurial,
                    which is built entirely in the Roman or Vitruvian style. Spain has produced few
                    great painters, which is somewhat remarkable, considering the poetical character
                    of the people. Murillo, Velasquez, and Lope de Vargas have acquired a fame which
                    will endure wherever painting is appreciated. There is at Madrid an academy for
                    painting, sculpture, and architecture, and the royal palace and Escurial have
                    galleries; but it does not appear that these arts are much cultivated in the
                    present day.</p>
                <p>The literature of Spain, in the days of her greatness, was almost on a level with
                    that of any other country in Europe; but it has now sunk to a very low
                    condition. The ballad is what the early Spanish writers most excelled in; and
                    this is characterized by romantic fervour, frequently of an oriental character.
                    The language is peculiarly fitted to ex press the dignified and the pathetic,
                    but its solemn dignity frequently seduces the writer into bombast. No language
                    has such a store of ballads as the Spanish; but they are, particularly the early
                    ones, little more than mere relations of chivalrous deeds. The wars with the
                    Moors form the subject of an endless number of these ballads, which the
                    chivalrous nature of the people of Spain during the middle ages brought to a
                    state of excellence unequalled in any country in Europe. The song was the
                    natural growth of the warlike period of Spain, and served to commemorate warlike
                    exploits; but they were of a very simple character until the period of the
                    conquest of Naples, when they assumed a more lyrical form. The national drama
                    has always been peculiar, consisting chiefly of religious comedies founded on
                    the lives of saints. There are however some noble comedies of an historical
                    nature. The perfection of the intrigue is what the Spanish writers chiefly
                    value; but their plots are con<pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:chi.28490924&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=597" xml:id="kp-eb0720-0597-0523"/>
                    structed without any regard to the unities. The drama acquired its greatest
                    celebrity from Lope de Vega and Calde ron. In romance, Spain has accomplished
                    much. The perfection of Spanish prose is to be found in the works of the
                    inimitable Cervantes. After his time, and when the Bourbons ascended the throne,
                    the literature declined with the state, and may be said to have remained ever
                    since in a similar state of inactivity. Spain possesses at the present day few
                    writers known beyond their own country. Jovellanos on political economy, Campany
                    in philology, Llorente in history, Moralez in mathematics, have done much to
                    rouse a spirit of re flection; and Juan Valdez is called the Anacreon of
                    Spain.</p>
                <p>The army of Spain, once the most formidable and best organized in Europe, is now
                    comparatively in a low state. It is, however, represented as the best organized
                    part of her establishment, the pay being regular, and the officers experienced.
                    In the present unsettled state of the country it is impossible to form any
                    estimate of its actual numbers. Besides the regular army, there is a large body
                    of militia called royalist volunteers, who have frequently proved of great
                    service as light troops. The navy now exists only in name; in 1823 there was but
                    one ship of the line, which, being sent out to South America, surrendered to the
                    Peruvian government. (R. R. R.)</p>
