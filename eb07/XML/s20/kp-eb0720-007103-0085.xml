                    significant corrections to the OCR text, predominantly in cases of confusing "c"
                    and "e." Isolates 90 entries that were mistakenly included at the end of prior
                    entries in v1 and v2. Normalizes ordinal numbers. Separates metadata in
                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra
                    space around the <gi>pb</gi> tag. Where a word is hyphenated at a <gi>pb</gi>,
                    the end fragment is now joined to the start fragment, making a machine-readable
                    word.</change>

                    of a circle comprehended between two radii and an arc of the circle.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sector</hi> is also a mathematical instrument, of use in
                    finding the proportion between quantities of the same kind; as between lines and
                    lines, surfaces and surfaces, &amp;c. whence the French call it the <hi
                    rend="italic">compass of proportion.</hi> The great advantage of the sector
                    above the common scales is, that it is made so as to fit all radii and all
                    scales. By the lines of chords, sines, &amp;c. upon the sector, we have lines of
                    chords, sines, &amp;c. to any radius between the length and breadth of the
                    sector when open.</p>
                <p>The sector is supposed to have been invented by Guido Baldo, or Ubaldo, about the
                    year 1568. The first printed account of it was in 1584, by Gaspar Mordente, at
                    Antwerp, who says that his brother, Fabricius Mordente, invented it in 1554.
                    Treatises on its use have been written by Daniel Specle at Strasburg in 1589;
                    also by Thomas Hood at London in 1598, and by Lewin Hulse at
                    Frankfort-on-the-Maine in 1603, who says that it was invented long before by
                    Justus Byrgius. But the honour of the invention was claimed by Galileo, who
                    wrote on its use in 1607, and by Balthasar Capra of Milan. There are also
                    treatises on it by our countrymen Gunter, Forster, and others.</p>
                <p>Before the invention of logarithms, practical men were more easily contented with
                    approximate solutions than they are at present. Now, however, any question that
                    can be resolved by the sector can be about as readily answered by the smallest
                    table of logarithms, and with perfect certainty, as far as the table extends.
                    Hence it is that the sector is not much used, although it is commonly reckoned
                    one of a complete set of mathematical instruments.</p>
                <p>For treatises on its use, see Bion on Mathematical Instruments, translated by
                    Stone; Robertson’s Treatise on Mathematical Instruments; and Adams’s Geometrical
                    Essays.</p>
                <p>Any one possessing a sector will easily understand its</p>
                <p>’ This, however, is denied by Johnson, who affirms that the islanders of all
                    degrees, whether of rank or understanding, universally admit it; except the
                    ministers, who, according to him, reject it, in consequence of a system, against
                    conviction. He affirms, too, that in 1773, there was in the Hebrides a
                    second-sighted gentleman, who complained of the terrors to which he was
                    exposed.<pb break="no" facs="ht:chi.28490924&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=86"

                    section of our treatise on <hi rend="smallcaps">GeoMEtry,</hi> where it is

                <p><hi rend="italic smallcaps"> Sector</hi><hi rend="italic">of a Sphere</hi> is the
                    solid generated by the revolution of the sector of a circle about one of its
                    radii; the other radius describing the surface of a cone, and the circular arc a
                    circular portion of the surface of the sphere of the same radius. Hence the
                    spherical sector consists of a right cone, and of a segment of the sphere having
                    the same common base with the cone. The solid content will therefore be found by
                    multiplying the base or spherical surface by the radius of the sphere, and
                    taking one third of the product.</p>

                    pass through a fixed telescope. There is an instrument of this kind in the
                    observatory at Greenwich, and it is described in Vince’s Practical
                    Astronomy.</p>

                    differ but little from the latitude of an observer. A very fine instrument of
                    this kind, constructed by Ramsden, is now using in the trigonometrical survey of
                    Britain, and is fully described and figured in the Transactions of the Royal
                    Society of London for 1803.</p>
