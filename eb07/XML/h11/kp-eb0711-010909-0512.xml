                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra

                    Esq. a barrister of Lincoln’s Inn, and was born in 1609. He was educated at
                    Oxford, where he made considerable progress in learning; but he was afterwards
                    diverted from his studies by the levities of youth. From these, however, he was
                    recalled by Mr John Glanvill, serjeant-at-law; and having applied to the study
                    of the law, he entered himself of Lincoln’s Inn. Noy the attorneygeneral took
                    early notice of him, and directed him in his studies. Selden also distinguished
                    him; and it was this acquaintance which first led Hale to a more enlarged
                    pursuit of learning, having before confined his studies to his own profession.
                    During the civil wars he behaved so well as to gain the esteem of both parties.
                    He was employed in practice by all the king’s party; and he was also appointed
                    by the parliament as one of the commissioners to treat with the king. The murder
                    of King Charles gave him very sensible regret. However, he took the engagement,
                    and was appointed, with several others, to consider of the reformation of the
                    law. In 1653 he was by writ made serjeant-at-law, and soon afterwards appointed
                    one of the justices of the Common Pleas. Upon the death of Oliver Cromwell, he
                    refused to accept of the new commission offered him by Richard, his successor.
                    He was returned as one of the knights of Gloucestershire in the parliament which
                    recalled Charles II. Soon afterwards he was made lord chief baron of the
                    Exchequer; but he declined the honour of knighthood, till Lord Chancellor Hyde,
                    sending for him upon business when the king was at his house, told his majesty
                    that there was his modest chief baron; upon which he was unexpectedly knighted.
                    He was one of the principal judges who sat in Clifford’s Inn about settling the
                    difference between landlord and tenant, after the fire of London; in which
                    capacity he behaved to the satisfaction of all parties concerned. As chief baron
                    he likewise acted with inflexible integrity. A peer of the highest rank went
                    once upon a time to his chamber, and told him, that having a suit in law to be
                    tried before him, he was then to acquaint him with it, that he might the better
                    understand it when it should come to be tried in court. Upon this the lord chief
                    baron interrupted him, and said that his grace (for he was a duke) did not deal
                    fairly to come to his chambers about such affairs, for he never received
                    information of such causes but in open court, where both parties were to be
                    heard alike. His grace then went away not a little dissatisfied, and complained
                    of it to the king as a rudeness which was not to be endured; but his majesty bid
                    him content himself that he was not worse used, adding, that he verily believed
                    Hale would have used him no better if he had gone to solicit him in any of his
                    own causes. Another remarkable incident happened in one of his circuits. A
                    gentleman who had a trial at the assizes had sent him a buck for his table. When
                    Judge Hale heard his name, he asked if he was not the same person who had sent
                    him the venison; and being answered in the affirmative, told him that he could
                    not suffer the trial ιu go on till he had paid him for his buck. The gentleman
                    answered, that he never sold his venison, and that he had done nothing to him
                    which he did not do to every judge who had gone that circuit; which was
                    confirmed by several gentlemen present. The lord chief baron, however, would not
                    suffer the trial to proceed till he had paid for the present, upon which the
                    gentleman withdrew the record. This upright judge was in 1671 advanced to be
                    lord,, chief justice of the King’s Bench; but about four years after this
                    promotion his health declined, and he resigned his high office in February 1676,
                    and died in December following. This excellent man, who was an ornament to the
                    bench, to his country, and to human nature, was the author of, 1. An Essay
                    touching the Gravitation or Non-Gravitation of Fluid Bodies; 2. <hi
                    rend="italic">Difficiles</hi><hi rend="italic">Nugoe, or</hi> Observations on
                    the Torricellian Experiment;</p>
                <p>3. Observations on the Principles of Natural Motion; 4. Contemplations Moral and
                    Divine; 5. An English Translation of Nepos’s Life of Pomponius Atticus; and, 6.
                    The Primitive Origination of Mankind. At the time of his decease he also left
                    other works, which were afterwards published, viz. 1. Judgment of the Nature of
                    True Religion; 2. Several Tracts, including a Discourse of Religion, under three
                    heads; 3. A Letter to his Children;</p>
                <p>4. A Letter to one of his Sons on his recovery from the small-pox; 5. A Discourse
                    of the Knowledge of God and of Ourselves, first, by the Light of Nature, and
                    secondly, by the Sacred Scriptures. All these, under the title of Hale’s Moral
                    and Religious Works, were published by Thirlwall in 1805, in two volumes 8vo,
                    with a life of the author by Bishop Burnet. Of his Law Tracts one only appeared
                    in his lifetime, viz. London Liberty, or an argument of Law and Reason, 1650,
                    reprinted in 1682. After his death were published, 1. Pleas of the Crown, or a
                    Methodical. Summary, 1678, in 8vo, continued by Jacob, and reprinted in 1716; 2.
                    Treatise on the enrolling and registering of all Conveyances of Land, 1694, in
                    4to, reprinted with additions in 1756; 3. <hi rend="italic">Tractatus</hi><hi

                    >Anglos,</hi> or a Treatise on Hereditary Descents, 1700 and 1735, in 8vo; 4. A
                    Treatise on the original Institution of Parliaments, 1707, republished by
                    Hargrave in 1796, 4to; 5. Analysis of the Law, without date; 6. History of the
                    Common Law of England, in twelve chapters, 1713, in 8vo; 7. <hi rend="italic"

                    of the Crown, 1739, in two volumes folio, edited by Emelyn. There are a few
                    other tracts and opinions of his, which have been published by Hargrave and
                    succeeding writers on law in their collections. Sir Matthew Hale, by his will,
                    bequeathed to the society of Lincoln’s Inn his collection of manuscripts, which
                    he had been nearly forty years in making, and on which he had spared neither
                    labour nor expense.</p>
