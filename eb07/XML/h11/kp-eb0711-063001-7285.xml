                <p><hi rend="smallcaps"/><hi rend="smallcaps">Horticulture</hi> is that branch of
                    rural economy which consists in the formation and culture of Gardens. Its
                    results are culinary vegetables, fruits, and flowers. On one side it is allied
                    to Agriculture, from which, however, it is distinguished by the nature of its
                    products, and by the smaller extent and greater complexity of its operations; on
                    the other side, in its processes of embellishment, it approaches the arts of the
                    Landscape Artist and the Forester, from which, however, it also retires in the
                    comparative minuteness of its details. Respecting the former of these
                    departments of rural art, considered as distinct from Horticulture, information
                    may be obtained in the article on <hi rend="smallcaps">Gardening.</hi></p>
                <p>Like other arts, Horticulture borrows its principles from the general sciences.
                    To Botany it is beholden for the facts and theories of vegetable physiology; to
                    Chemistry for assistance in reference to soils, manures, and artificial heat;
                    and to Meteorology for a knowledge of many circumstances which very materially
                    affect the labours of the gardener. On these subjects, with which the
                    philosophical horticulturist will not fail to make himself familiar, we refer to
                    the various scientific articles in this Encyclopaedia. It is very desirable that
                    such information should be extensively diffused among <hi rend="italic"
                    >practical</hi> men; as it is only from this quarter that much improvement, in
                    our present state of knowledge, can be expected. Truth, however, obliges us to
                    admit, that gardening has been most successfully practised, when treated as an
                    empirical art. Few of those who are minutely conversant with its numerous
                    manipulations have undergone such an intellectual training as to enable them to
                    wield general principles with effect. Many who are not inexpert or unsuccessful
                    while they follow the routine practice (a practice, be it remembered, founded on
                    long experience) egregiously fail, when, with imperfect information, or
                    ill-advised ingenuity, they endeavour to strike out new paths for themselves.
                    The object of the art, too, limits the application of the deductions of science.
                    Its whole business consists in the imitation of Nature, whose processes may
                    indeed be, in some measure, originated, as when a seed is inserted in the
                    ground, or modified, as in the artificial training of fruit-trees, but which may
                    not be entirely controlled, much less counteracted. The principle of vegetable
                    life will not endure interference beyond a certain point, and our theoretical
                    views should be so directed as to interfere with it as little as possible.
                    Observation and experiment are the grand means by which the art has arrived at
                    its present state of advancement: at the same time it is obvious, that an
                    enlarged acquaintance with science will aid us in imitating the processes of
                    nature, will guide the hand of experiment, suggest contrivances, and enable us
                    to guard against error; and above all, will tend to dispel those prejudices
                    which practitioners in the empirical arts are so prone to cherish.</p>
                <p>Gardening, Mr Walpole observes, was probably one of the first arts which
                    succeeded to that of building houses, and naturally attended property and
                    individual possession. Culinary, and afterwards medicinal herbs, were objects in
                    request by every head of a family; and it became convenient to have them within
                    reach, without searching for them in woods, in meadows, or on mountains, as they
                    were wanted. Separate enclosures for rearing herbs were soon found expedient.
                    Fruits were in the same predicament; and those most in use, or the cultivation
                    of which required particular attention, must early have entered into and
                    extended the domestic enclosure. Such may be deemed the leading heads of a
                    conjectural history of the art; and indeed, if we would ascend into remote
                    antiquity, we can have recourse only to conjecture, for although, in the Sacred
                    Writings, and in the earliest profane authors, allusions to gardens occur,
                    little is told us either of their productions or their culture. At the close of
                    the Roman commonwealth, the catalogue of fruits had become considerable, the
                    principles of grafting and pruning were understood and practised, and shortly
                    afterwards, even artificial heat seems to have been partially employed. With the
                    decline of the empire, horticulture also declined or became stationary; but at
                    the revival of learning, it arose from the slumber of the dark ages, encumbered,
                    it is true, by the dreams of the alchymists, the restrictions of unlucky days,
                    and the imaginary effects of lunar influence. From these fetters it was ere long
                    emancipated by the diffusion of knowledge, and it has hitherto kept pace with
                    the general improvement of society. Modified by climate and other circumstances
                    in different countries, its advancement has been various; but nowhere has it
                    made greater progress than amongst ourselves. Introduced into England at an
                    early period, gardening became conspicuous in the reign of Henry VIII. and his
                    immediate successors, and met with considerable attention during the reigns of
                    the Stuarts. In the first half of the eighteenth century, Miller, Switzer, and
                    others, laboured with success in improving the operations, and unfolding the
                    principles, of the art; and these were succeeded by Abercrombie, Speedily, and a
                    host of writers, who added greatly to our stores of knowledge. In 1805 was
                    established the Horticultural Society of London, which was soon followed by the
                    institution of the Caledonian Horticultural Society at Edinburgh; and in their
                    train have sprung up a multitude of provincial gardening societies, all of which
                    have given an impulse to the public mind, and stimulated the exertions of
                    individuals. Experimental gardens have been formed, in which, amongst other
                    things, the important work of distinguishing and classifying the numerous
                    varieties of our hardy fruits has been zealously prosecuted. The mass of
                    information now collected is immense, and the labour expended in its difiusion
                    unwearied. Judging from the literature of the day, and passing downward from the
                    sumptuous Transactions of the metropolitan Society, through the numerous
                    periodicals, to the penny information for the people, we shall scarcely find any
                    art, however nationally important, which receives more attention, or on which
                    the liberality of the wealthy is more abundantly bestowed. The public
                    nursery-gardens, too, both at London and elsewhere, establishments intimately
                    connected with our subject, and which, in a manufacturing nation, are not the
                    least wonderful amongst the applications of skill and capital, prove the extent
                    and perfection to which gardening has advanced. Although, however, there is not,
                    perhaps, in the annals of invention, a chapter of higher interest than the
                    history of Horticulture, our limits do not permit us to enter further into
                    details: we must therefore refer to Loudon’s <hi rend="italic">Encyclopaedia of
                    Gardening,</hi> a work which, for minuteness of exposition, and copiousness of
                    illustration, is unrivalled amongst the didactic treatises of our times.</p>
                <p>We intend to confine our attention almost exclusively to the horticulture of
                    Great Britain, and we shall endeavour to give such an exhibition of its practice
                    as may suit the middle districts of the island. The objects of culture are so
                    numerous, the operations so varied, and the materials so copious, that, in
                    presenting what can claim only the character of a sketch of our subject, it will
                    be necessary to follow a plan of selection. It would be unprofitable to de <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193647298" xml:id="kp-eb0711-7298-0631"/> scribe all the
                    methods of culture in practice; we shall therefore notice such only as are
                    deemed the best.</p>
                <p>The subject naturally divides itself into the Fruit, the Kitchen, and the Flower
                    Garden; but as the first two generally occupy the same locality, or are
                    intermingled with each other, and as every thing connected with their formation
                    is inseparably involved, we shall, to some extent, take them together. Then will
                    follow the Flower-Garden; and by way of conclusion to the whole, a short
                    Calendar.</p>
                <p>FRUIT AND KITCHEN GARDEN.</p>
                <p>In this department are cultivated the articles which are necessary for the supply
                    of the kitchen and the dessert table. It is inclosed within walls, not only for
                    the sake of security and general shelter, but, in our climate, as affording the
                    means of cultivating the finer fruits, by training the trees close to the walls.
                    It is furnished with hot-houses, melon-frames, and similar contrivances, by
                    which the fruits of other climates are subjected to an artificially increased
                    temperature, and thus brought to maturity. The size of a walled garden ought
                    evidently to bear some proportion to the splendour of the mansion-house of which
                    it is an appendage, to the extent of the park, and the means of the family.
                    Where the demand is large, such a garden should comprehend from four to six
                    acres. In many places this extent wall not afford an adequate supply of culinary
                    vegetables, but some of the bulkier crops, such as pease, potatoes, and turnips,
                    may be grown in the exterior fields. From an acre and a half to three acres may
                    be regarded as forming a respectable garden; but, within the limits already
                    mentioned, it is better, in the first formation of a garden, to enclose too
                    large a space than too small a one.</p>
                <p>The productiveness of such an establishment will depend chiefly upon the natural
                    fertility of the soil, and the eligibility of the situation, but also in a
                    considerable degree upon the labour expended upon the culture. Where a garden is
                    <hi rend="italic">underworked</hi> (to use a gardener’s phrase), the finer
                    products must necessarily be scanty, for whatever requires care, requires time;
                    and it not unfrequently happens that a gardener fails in some crop, not from
                    defect of method or skill, but because he has not been able to overtake it, or
                    has been obliged to make his preparations in a hurried and insufficient manner.
                    All circumstances being favourable, a British garden is perhaps unrivalled in
                    fertility by any cultivated spot in the world. A copious supply of esculents
                    flows into the kitchen at all seasons; and after a rich abundance of fruit has
                    been afforded during summer and autumn, the winter stores may be easily
                    prolonged till the early forced fruits come again to the table.</p>
                <p>We shall first treat of the general properties and appendages of the Fruit and
                    Kitchen Garden.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Situation.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> The position of the
                    garden in relation to the mansion-house, properly belongs to the province of
                    Landscape-Gardening, as it obviously should be in keeping with the general
                    features of the park scenery. It may, however, be remarked, that, as a place of
                    interest to every well-informed proprietor, it should be so near as to be
                    conveniently accessible on foot, probably within little more than a quarter of a
                    mile; while it should be so distant as to avoid the possibility of offence
                    arising from gardening operations and the resort of workmen. A position on one
                    side of the house is to be preferred, unless a much more eligible one occur in
                    the rear. Wherever it be placed, it should be so masked by evergreen shrubs and
                    trees, as not to be visible from the principal lawns, or from the walks in the
                    shrubbery and flower-garden. If the surface of the domain be undulated, the
                    garden is almost unavoidably seen from some point or other, and the <hi
                    rend="italic">coup-d’oeil</hi> of the enclosure walls is apt to present the idea
                    of a large box; an unpleasant impression, which should by all means be avoided
                    or lessened by plantations judiciously placed.</p>
                <p>Ground possessing a gentle inclination toward the south is desirable for a
                    garden. On such a slope effectual draining is easily accomplished, and the
                    greatest possible benefit is derived from the sun’s rays. The lower part of a
                    gentle declivity is perhaps to be preferred; but a very low situation should
                    scarcely be chosen, as the subsoil is apt to be damp, fogs often brood over such
                    spots, and frosts are more injurious there than on higher ground. It is
                    beneficial to have an open exposure towards the east and west, so that the
                    garden may enjoy the full benefit of the morning and evening sun.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Shelter</hi> is absolutely necessary; and that afforded by
                    natural objects, such as rising grounds, is the best. Where this is wanting, its
                    place should be supplied by masses of forest-trees, disposed at such a distance,
                    however, as not to shade the wall-trees, perhaps not nearer than 150 feet. The
                    purpose of such screens is to break the force of the winds; and as every
                    situation is, in this respect, liable to some peculiarities occasioned by the
                    general structure of the country, or by the reverberation of aerial currents
                    from adjacent eminences, these peculiarities should be carefully observed and
                    obviated. The idea that crowded plantations increase the warmth of a place is
                    often fallacious; and, in the opinion of many, they do more harm than good, by
                    encouraging blight. The trees employed may be of a varied character, but
                    lime-tree, horse-chestnut, beech, sycamore, weeping birch, and the smooth-leaved
                    wych elm, should prevail. There may also be a proportion of evergreen trees,
                    such as firs, pines, hollies, and evergreen oaks. When these masses of wood are
                    planted at the time the garden is formed, poplars, larches, and other
                    fast-growing trees, should be thickly intermixed to act as temporary trees and
                    nurses, which are afterwards to be weeded out, as the permanent trees more
                    slowly advance to maturity.</p>
                <p>A supply of <hi rend="italic">water</hi> is equally necessary. Where a streamlet
                    can be made to flow through the garden, and keep a central pond constantly full,
                    it will conduce both to utility and amenity. If this cannot be effected, a pipe
                    of sufficient caliber should be led from some neighbouring pond to the
                    hot-houses, and to two or three different stations in the garden. Well or spring
                    water should be exposed in tanks or reservoirs to the action of the sun and air,
                    when it becomes comparatively soft and salubrious for plants. As rain water is
                    found better than any other for this purpose, all that can be collected should
                    be stored and kept for use.</p>
                <p>Connected with the situation is the <hi rend="italic">approach</hi> to the garden
                    from without, a matter requiring some taste and contrivance. If possible, it
                    should be from the south, when the range of glazed houses will be seen at once,
                    and produce a pleasing effect. Sometimes a lateral entrance is very suitable,
                    leading, it may be supposed, from the flower-garden through an intermediate
                    shrubbery, and coming upon the hot-houses in flank. It is delightful to be
                    introduced at once and by surprise into a Slip, as it is called, where on the
                    one hand there is an extent of wall covered with luxuriant fruit-trees in full
                    bearing, and on the other is displayed a rich collection of ornamental shrubs
                    and large perennial border-flowers.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Form.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> The form of a garden, it is
                    obvious, must chiefly be determined by the nature of the situation and the taste
                    of the proprietor. In general, gardens are either squares or oblongs, chiefly,
                    it is presumed, because walls of this configuration contain the greatest space
                    within the least perimeter, a result of very questionable value. They may be of
                    any form, with this limitation, that attention should be paid to facilitating
                    the transport of manures and garden products, for when the grounds are
                    straggling, or complicated<pb break="no" facs="nls:193647311"

                    increased.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Exterior Fence</hi> —Most gardens are encircled by an outer
                    boundary, formed by a sunk wall or ha-ha, surmounted by an invisible wire fence
                    to exclude hares, or by a hedge and paling. Occasionally this sunk wall is
                    placed on the exterior of the screen plantations, and walks lead out among the
                    trees, to give favourable views of the adjacent country. Although the interior
                    garden receives its form from the walls, the ring fence and plantations may be
                    adapted to the shape and surface of the ground. The spaces between the outer
                    fence and the walls are, as already noticed, called <hi rend="italic"
                    >Slips,</hi> and, where circumstances render it eligible, a considerable extent
                    of ground is sometimes included, and appropriated to the culture of small fruits
                    and vegetables. If possible, the gardener’s house should be situate here, as
                    being convenient for him, and as tending to scare depredators.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Walls</hi> —For the production of the finer fruits, such as
                    peaches, apricos, hardy grapes, and most of the delicate French and Flemish
                    pears, the aid of walls is indispensable in our climate. Indeed, in the northern
                    and higher parts of the country, where there is no walled garden, the dessert
                    can seldom consist of more than small fruits, and ill-ripened apples and pears.
                    So valuable in this respect are walls, that it is perhaps a matter of surprise
                    that they have not been multiplied by the erection of slight and cheap
                    structures, such as are common in the peach-gardens in France. The north wall
                    having, in the interior, a south aspect, is of course appropriated to the more
                    tender kinds of fruit-trees; here, it is generally estimated, they enjoy an
                    increased temperature equal to 7° of south latitude; the east and west walls are
                    set apart for fruits of a somewhat hardier character; while the inner face of
                    the south wall, having a north aspect, is well adapted for retarding Morelia
                    cherries and currants.</p>
                <p>The north wall is generally placed nearly perpendicular to the meridian, that is,
                    so as to have the sun directly in front at 12 o’clock. Minute directions have
                    indeed been given to make it face towards 11 or 11∣ <hi rend="smallcaps">a.
                    μ.,</hi> on the ground that thus it would sooner meet the rays of the morning
                    sun; but it does not appear that this arrangement has been the subject of direct
                    experiment, and certainly the arguments, by which the superiority of this aspect
                    is supported, are far from being satisfactory. The east and west walls are
                    commonly placed at right-angles'to that already mentioned, but they may follow
                    the shape of the ground, and if this slope to the south, they descend with the
                    declivity. The south enclosure wall, as affording on the outside a valuable
                    aspect to the south, is deserving of particular attention. It is presumed that
                    the walls are to be covered, both within and without, with trees trained <hi
                    rend="italic">en</hi><hi rend="italic">espalier.</hi></p>
                <p>Different portions of the enclosure wall are always built of different heights,
                    and this variation of height is the more necessary, when the ground approaches
                    to a level. In such a situation, and when the enclosure does not exceed two
                    acres, the north wall may rise to the elevation of 14 feet; the walls on the
                    cast and west may be two feet lower, and the south wall need not exceed 10 feet.
                    In larger gardens, the walls are generally made proportionally higher: on the
                    north, perhaps 16 feet, on the cast and west 14, and on the south 12. In several
                    excellent Scottish gardens planned by Mr John Hay, such as that at Castle
                    Semple, a piece of building is made to project diagonally outwards from the
                    corners where the walls meet at right-angles. This projection is 16 or 17 feet
                    in length. It serves to strengthen the fabric, and, at the same time, breaks the
                    force of the winds which sweep around walled gardens.</p>
                <p>Walls inclined to the horizon have been recommended by Desaguliers and others;
                    but, independently of the theoretical objections which might be urged against
                    them, and which, in actual practice, would probably counterbalance their
                    supposed advantages, they must be extremely inconvenient from their bulk, or the
                    space which they occupy; and hence they have never come into general use.</p>
                <p>Bricks afford the best and the most kindly material for garden-walls. Being bad
                    conductors of caloric, they accumulate heat; they do not retain moisture, and,
                    by their numerous interstices, they furnish every facility for nailing in the
                    twigs of the fruit-trees. Where freestone (that is, sandstone capable of being
                    easily dressed) is abundant, the exterior wall is often formed of coursed
                    masonry, and the interior is faced with bricks. The foundation should, if
                    possible, be formed of stone. Whinstone (that is, either the greenstone or the
                    basalt of mineralogists) forms an excellent material for fruit-walls. It is
                    susceptible of a neat hammer-dressing; it does not readily imbibe moisture, and
                    therefore is not much cooled by evaporation; and being of a very dark colour, it
                    absorbs more solar heat during sunshine than a lighter surface, while at night
                    the radiation from both is nearly the same. Part of the principal fruitwall of
                    the Experimental Garden at Edinburgh is built of greenstone; and the plants
                    trained against it have evinced, by their growth, that they enjoy a superior
                    temperature.</p>
                <p>For the preservation of the walls, a coping is necessary; and it seems a matter
                    of indifference whether it be formed of stones with a rounded surface, or of
                    flat pavement, or of tiles. Probably it should not project more than an inch,
                    though some contend for a larger measure, on the ground of its preventing to
                    some extent the radiation of heat from the tree towards the sky in clear nights,
                    and affording shelter from the perpendicular deposition of dew. Temporary
                    copings of wood are often adopted, and are found to answer every good purpose.
                    They are put on in spring, to protect the tender blossom and embryo fruit from
                    the hoarfrosts, and when danger is past are removed, to give free access to the
                    genial showers and sunshine of summer and autumn.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Hot Walls</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> A considerable
                    proportion of the walls of every good garden, especially in the north, should be
                    constructed with flues, to supply the means of applying artificial heat. The
                    additional expense is trifling; and in colder situations, the aid of this
                    species of wall is nearly indispensable for the regular ripening of peaches,
                    grapes, and figs. The application of fire-heat for a few weeks in spring will
                    secure the setting of the fruit, and the same operation continued for a short
                    time in autumn will suffice to ripen it, and also to prepare the young wood for
                    the next year. The flues may be about twenty inches deep, and should make as
                    many horizontal turns as the height of the wall will allow. One furnace will be
                    enough for a surface fifty feet in length. When the boundary walls do not
                    furnish room sufficient for the production of the finer fruits, one or perhaps
                    two middle walls are built across the garden from east to west, of the same
                    height as the side walls, to which they nearly approach. They are generally
                    ílued, and are sometimes covered, on their southern aspect, with glazed frames,
                    either fixed or moveable. These cross walls add greatly to the capabilities of a
                    fruit-garden, and are useful in affording additional shelter to the small fruits
                    and crops of vegetables.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Espalier-Rails.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> Subsidiary to
                    walls as a means of training fruit-trees, espalier rails were formerly much
                    employed, and they still prevail in many parts of the country. In their simplest
                    form, they are merely a row of slender stakes of ash or Spanish chestnut, driven
                    into the ground, and connected by a slight rod or fillet at top. In some
                    gardens, the perpendicular rods are fastened into two horizontal rails,
                    supported by strong posts, which are battened into stones. Cast-iron rails have
                    also been proposed, J he frame-work is sometimes inclined to the horizon, and
                    sometimes flat like a table, which last, when there is room, ⅛ <pb break="no"

                    Espalier rails, especially the more elaborate sorts, are expensive and formal,
                    and therefore in many instances have given place to dwarf standard trees, which
                    are equally productive, and far more elegant in their appearance.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Soils.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> It is of great importance
                    that the ground selected for a garden should be naturally of a good quality. A
                    hazel-coloured loam, of a light or sandy texture, is well adapted for most
                    crops, whether of fruits or culinary vegetables. As it is more easy to render a
                    light soil sufficiently retentive, than to make a tenacious clay sufficiently
                    porous, a light soil is preferable to one which is excessively stiff and heavy.
                    It is advantageous to possess a variety of soils; and if the garden be on a
                    slope, it will often be practicable to render the upper part light and dry,
                    while the lower remains of a heavier and damper nature. The soil should be good
                    to the depth of two feet, and any necessary additional deepening by manures or
                    otherwise, should not be neglected. The nature of the subsoil demands particular
                    attention. If it be strongly impregnated with metallic substances, or composed
                    of cold till, it will prove pernicious to the roots of fruit-trees, and will
                    scarcely admit of a remedy. A decomposing rock, or a bed of sand, is preferable.
                    Perhaps the best of all is a dry bed of clay, overlying sandstone, which crops
                    out within the enclosure. If the inferior strata be retentive, and if water
                    lodge in any part of the garden, draining should be carefully executed, so as to
                    carry off the superfluous moisture.</p>
                <p>Preparatory to the distribution of the several parts of a garden, it is proper
                    that the ground be trenched to the depth of two feet at least; but the deeper
                    the better. In this operation all stones larger than a man’s fist are taken out,
                    and all roots of trees, and of perennial weeds, are carefully extracted and
                    cleared away. When the soil is not tolerably good to the depth of two feet, it
                    will often be proper to remove a portion of the subsoil; and its place shoulclbe
                    made up by a proportional quantity of turf or fresh loam from the fields. If the
                    subsoil be gravel, and the upper layer sandy, the additional earth should be
                    clayey loam, or the scourings of ditches; but if the original body of soil be of
                    a compact texture, the materials introduced should be mixed with sand, marl, and
                    other light opening substances. When the whole ground has been thus treated, a
                    moderate liming will, in general, be useful. After this, supposing the work to
                    have occupied most of the summer, the whole may be laid up in ridges, to expose
                    as great a surface as possible to the action of the winter’s frost. The
                    draining, trenching, and other operations here recommended, will unavoidably be
                    attended with considerable expense, and this expense will not immediately be
                    followed by any perceptible beneficial result. The lapse of a few years,
                    however, will develope the vast advantages of such a mode of procedure, which,
                    if it have been neglected at first, cannot be practised at a subsequent period
                    but with indifferent success, and not without a great increase of care and
                    labour.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Manures.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> In enumerating the
                    general appendages of gardens, it may be proper to say something of manures, but
                    we do not consider it necessary to enter into minute details on this subject.
                    Where there are extensive melon grounds, an abundance of stable and other litter
                    is required; and this substance, in its partially decomposed state, as afforded
                    by exhausted hotbeds, supplies a manure well adapted to aid the processes of
                    vegetation. Decayed leaves, which are plentiful where there are extensive
                    pleasure-grounds, also form an excellent manure for many purposes. Some
                    practical men prefer composts to simple dungs, or such substances as have
                    undergone fermentation. For fruit-trees turf from rich pastures, mixed with
                    vegetable earth, is perhaps the best stimulant which can be applied. It is
                    questionable whether any sort of trees are permanently benefited by the
                    application of crude manures to their roots; and it is certain that many have
                    been irremediably injured by this practice. But whatever caution may be
                    necessary in their use, the prudent horticulturist will find it expedient to pay
                    particular attention to the collection of manures. He cannot go on long without
                    them; for ground which is exhausted by continual cropping, requires to be
                    continually repaired.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Internal Arrangement of Gardens</hi> A considerable por tion of
                    the north wall, or of the cross-wall, is covered in front with glazed
                    structures, called hothouses, or forcing houses. To these the houses for
                    ornamental plants are sometimes attached; but the last are more appropriately
                    situate in the flower garden, when that forms a separate department. It is well,
                    however, that every other thing connected with the forcing, whether of fruits or
                    flowers, should be concentrated in one place. The melonry and other smaller
                    pine-pits, should occupy some well-sheltered spot in the slips, or on one side
                    of the garden, and, if possible, in the neighbourhood of the stable-yard.
                    Adjoining to this may be found a suitable site for the compost ground, in which
                    various kinds of soils may be kept in store, and composts may be prepared.</p>
                <p>Extensive gardens, in exposed situations, are often divid- * ed into compartments
                    by hedges, so disposed as to break the force of winds. Where these are required
                    to be lofty yet narrow, holly, yew, or beech is preferred; but if space be no
                    object, common laurel-bay is one of the most beautiful plants that can be
                    employed for this purpose. Smaller hedges may be formed of evergreen privet, or
                    of tree-box. These subordinate divisions, though often neglected, are worthy of
                    attention; for, in addition to shelter, they furnish shade, which, at certain
                    seasons, is peculiarly valuable.</p>
                <p>The laying out of the area of the garden in walks&gt; borders, and compartments,
                    may be regulated very much by the shape of the ground, and the taste of the
                    owner. In general, a gravel walk six or eight feet broad, is led quite around
                    the garden, both within and without the walls. A walk of similar dimensions is
                    often constructed in the centre of the garden in the direction of the glazed
                    houses, and this is sometimes crossed by another at right-angles. At times these
                    walks are led diagonally from the corners. The space between the wall and the
                    walk that skirts it, is called the wall-border, and is commonly from fifteen to
                    twenty feet broad. On the interior of the walk there is usually another border
                    five or six feet broad, which is generally occupied by fruit-trees trained to
                    espalier rails, or by dwarf standard trees. The middle part of the garden is
                    divided into rect·· angular compartments for the raising of the various culinary
                    crops. These compartments may be divided by rows of moderate-sized fruit-trees,
                    or of gooseberry and currant bushes. It is advantageous to have several small
                    beds, in which to cultivate the less bulky articles, such as basil, sage,
                    tarragon, &amp;c. which, in large spaces, are apt to be overlooked or
                    neglected.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Wall-Borders.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> The preparation of
                    borders for fruit-trees is a matter of the utmost importance, and no pains
                    should be spared in this essential operation. Where borders are not in good
                    condition, the care and toil of the most experienced gardener will avail but
                    little to the production of fruit. The first object is effectual draining. The
                    next, if the subsoil be indifferent, is the formation of a bottom impervious to
                    the roots of trees. This is sometimes done with stone-shivers and lime-rubbish,
                    or with coal-ashes and clay, compacted by treading with the feet, and beating
                    with the back of a spade, Loudon recommends successive layers an inch thick of
                    clean gravel, pulverized earth, and then gravel, well watered and firmly
                    compressed by means of a heavy roller. Good soil to the depth of two feet and a
                    half, or three feet, is placed over this impervious bottom. Three-fourths rich
                    loam, and one-fourth light sandy earth, form a mixture congenial to the
                    generality of fruit-trees, <pb break="no" facs="nls:193647337"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0711-7337-0634"/>In selecting the soil, regard may be had to the
                    particular trees which are to cover each portion of the wall. Thus a heavy soil
                    may be allotted to pears and plums; loam of a medium character, inclining to be
                    strong, to peaches; and a lighter earth for cherries and figs. Above all, care
                    should be taken to render the borders sufficiently rich and substantial. Whilst
                    every skilful horticulturist can in various ways reduce the luxuriance of his
                    trees, nothing can compensate for extreme poverty in the soil. The same
                    principle will dictate moderation in cropping wall borders with culinary
                    vegetables; a practice in which gardeners are apt to exceed, from a desire to
                    furnish very early crops of pease, turnips, cabbage, or potatoes.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Orchards.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> In most large gardens
                    dwarf standard trees may be planted, sufficient to afford a supply of fruit for
                    an ordinary family. Where this is not the case, it is desirable that there
                    should be a separate orchard. A situation similar to that of a garden, and the
                    same preparatory operations, are necessary: but a simple hedge will, in most
                    situations, suffice for a fence. The trees may here be on free stocks and high
                    standards, and the taller growing pears and apples are best suited for a large
                    orchard. Thorseby in his Diary, under date of March 1702, mentions, as a
                    novelty, an orchard “kept in the new order of dwarf trees,” evidently intimating
                    that dwarf standards were introduced from Holland by the Prince of Orange at the
                    time of the Revolution. When an additional supply of culinary vegetables is
                    required, they may be cultivated in the orchard; and then the trees should be
                    planted in rows, with considerable intervals between the rows, otherwise the
                    close quincunx order is preferable. In any circumstances, the trees should not
                    be choked up with currant and gooseberry bushes, as is common in market gardens.
                    On the margin of the orchard may be planted Walnuts, Chestnuts, Filberds, and
                    any other fruit-trees less commonly cultivated, or the fruit of which is not
                    much in demand. The whole should be effectually screened from the prevailing
                    winds, by rows of forest trees, at a sufficient distance, however, to prevent
                    shading, or the robbing of the soil.</p>
                <p>FRUIT GARDEN.</p>
                <p>We shall first direct our attention to the culture of hardy fruits, or of such
                    as, in our climate, do not, to an extensive degree, require the assistance of
                    artificial heat. But before proceeding to a minute detail of the management of
                    the different varieties, it may be proper to attend to some of the operations
                    which are common to all.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Preliminary Operations.</hi></p>
                <p>These may be classed under the heads Propagation, Planting, Training, and the
                    Protection of Blossom.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Propagation by Seed</hi> Although fruit-trees are furnish ed
                    with all the natural means of reproduction, it is not in general expedient to
                    attempt to propagate them by the sowing of seed. This method is found to be
                    equally tedious and precarious, requiring the labour of a good many years, and
                    very seldom producing an exact copy of the fruits from which the seeds are
                    taken. All our present admired fruits are seminal varieties obtained from the
                    wild inhabitants of the forests; they have been trained into an artificial
                    condition; and when sown, seem to have a tendency to resume their original
                    constitution. In the peach-orchards of America, for instance, which are planted
                    with the kernels of choice sorts, there are seldom more than a few trees
                    affording fruit fit for the table: the produce of the majority is so worthless,
                    that it is employed for feeding the hogs. Notwithstanding this embarrassing
                    circumstance, there are some considerations which render this mode of
                    propagation at once interesting and important to horticulturists. It is the only
                    way by which we can procure new kinds to supply the place of those which are
                    falling into decay; and it is a great means of adapting the tender sorts to the
                    rigour of our climate. It is well known that some of the favourite cider apples
                    of the seventeenth century have become extinct, and others are fast verging into
                    decrepitude; and hence the conclusion has been drawn, that all our present
                    fruits, as they arc artificial in their constitution, are also limited in their
                    duration. Each variety springing from an individual at first, however extended
                    by grafting or budding, partakes of the qualities of the individual: and where
                    the original is old, there is inherent in the derivatives the tendency to decay
                    incident to old age. It is assumed that all the individual trees of any given
                    variety, such as the golden pippin, or the grey leadington, are in a lax sense
                    equivalent to <hi rend="italic">one individual.</hi> By careful management, the
                    health and life of this composite individual may be prolonged; and grafts
                    inserted into vigorous stocks, and nursed in favourable situations, may long
                    survive their parent tree; still there is a sure progress towards extinction,
                    and the only renewal of the individual, the only true reproduction, is by sowing
                    seed. It is admitted by those who have paid attention to the subject, that this
                    curious principle of vegetable economy holds true, at least so far as regards
                    fruit-trees.</p>
                <p>Sir Knight, to whom this ingenious theory is due, conceived the idea of supplying
                    the lack of old varieties by semination. It further occurred to him, that
                    advantage might be taken of that tendency which plants exhibit on repeated
                    sowings, to adapt themselves to the climates in which they are raised, so that
                    trees of warmer countries may thus become habituated to colder regions. He
                    therefore devoted much of his attention to the production of improved and robust
                    varieties; and his zeal and labours have been rewarded by the Acton Scott Peach,
                    the Ingestrie and Downton Apples, and many others, in almost every sort of hardy
                    fruit. Mr Knight entertained the opinion, deduced, we may presume, from
                    experiment, that more is to be expected from hybrid varieties, than from the
                    mere reproduction of old kinds; he therefore had recourse to the nice operation
                    of dusting the pollen of one kind on the pistil of another. He opened the
                    unexpanded blossom of the variety destined to be the female parent of the
                    expected progeny, and, with a pair of small-pointed scissors, cut away all the
                    stamens, while the anthers were yet unripe, taking care to leave the style and
                    the stigma uninjured. When the female blossom, thus prepared, naturally
                    expanded, the full blo <hi rend="superscript"> l</hi> wn blossoms of the other
                    variety destined to be the male parent were applied. Mr Knight has often
                    remarked in the progeny a strong prevalence of the constitution and habits of
                    the female parent: in this country, therefore, in experimenting on pears, the
                    pollen of the more delicate French kinds, such as crasannc and chaumontelle,
                    should be dusted upon the flowers (always deprived of stamens) of the muirfowl
                    egg, the grey achan, the green yair, or others, that are hardy, or of British
                    origin.</p>
                <p>As this is a subject of interest, we may state some of the precautions adopted by
                    Mr Knight and his followers, in conducting their experiments. It is, in the
                    first place, a rule to employ seeds of the finest kinds of fruit, and to take
                    them from the largest, ripest, and best-flavoured specimens of that fruit. When
                    Mr Knight wished to procure some of the old apples in a healthy and renovated
                    stifte, he prepared stocks of such good sorts as could be propagated from
                    cuttings, he planted them against a south wall in rich soil, and then grafted
                    them with the kind required. In the following winter the young trees were taken
                    up, their roots retrenched, and then replanted in the same place, by which mode
                    of treatment they were thrown into bearing when only two years old. Not more
                    than a couple of apples were allowed to remain on each tree, and these m
                    conse<pb break="no" facs="nls:193647350" xml:id="kp-eb0711-7350-0635"/>quence
                    attained a larger size and more perfect maturity. The seeds were then sown, in
                    the hope of procuring an equally excellent and more vigorous offspring. In the
                    case of cross-impregnation, every seed, though taken from the same fruit,
                    produces a different variety, and these varieties, as might be anticipated,
                    prove to be of very various merit. In general those seeds are to be preferred
                    which are plump and round. An estimate of the value of the seedlings may be
                    formed, even during the first summer of their growth, from the resemblance they
                    bear to those of highly cultivated and approved trees. The leaves of the
                    promising seedlings improve in character, becoming thicker, rounder, and more
                    downy every season. Those whose buds in the amiual wood are full and prominent,
                    generally prove more productive than those whose buds are small and shrunk into
                    the bark. Early flowering and hardy blossoms are desirable characters. It has
                    been observed, that even after a seedling tree has commenced bearing, its fruit
                    has a tendency to improve as the tree itself acquires vigour, so that, if, in
                    the first season, there is any considerable promise, a great improvement may be
                    expected in succeeding years.</p>
                <p>The slowness with which seedlings reach the bearing state, has been the subject
                    of complaint among horticulturists, and indeed is the principal reason why this
                    mode of propagation has not been more frequently practised. According to Mr
                    Knight, the pear requires from twelve to eighteen years to reach the age of
                    puberty; the apple from five to twelve or thirteen years; the plum and cherry
                    four or five; the vine three or four; the raspberry two years. The peach, he
                    found to bear in two, three, or four years. This period, however, must depend on
                    the soil, situation, and mode of culture. In the warm and highly manured garden
                    of Μ. Van Mons at Brussels, (called Pépinière de la Fidélité), seedling
                    peartrees produced fruit in considerable quantities in the sixth and seventh
                    summers. The great means of accelerating the epoch of bearing, seems to be, to
                    make the trees grow vigorously when young. Crude manures are indeed to be
                    avoided; but vegetable earth, and, above all, a liberal supply of rotted turf,
                    are wholesome and excellent stimulants. The seed-bed, and the ground on which
                    the seedlings are transplanted, should be extremely well worked and comminuted
                    with the spade; and should not be too much exposed to the parching rays of the
                    sun, and the action of the wind. Great care ought to be taken to prevent the
                    young plants from becoming stunted. In pruning, the small twigs in the interior
                    should be removed, so as to relieve the tree from the bushy appearance which it
                    frequently assumes. It has been recommended to transfer cions and buds of
                    promising individuals into other trees in a bearing state. This is peculiarly
                    advantageous with respect to the peach and other stone fruits, as it both
                    hastens the period of puberty, and economises the space which must be occupied
                    on the Avail.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Propagation by Cuttings.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi>
                    Gooseberries, currants, figs, vines, and some others, are increased by means of
                    cuttings. An annual shoot is taken off, along with a thin slice, or <hi
                    rend="italic">heel,</hi> as it is called, of the former year’s Avood, which is
                    found to facilitate the production of roots. The cuttings are placed firmly in
                    the soil, at various depths, according to their length, the buds or eyes Avhich
                    Avould thus come beneath the surface having been previously removed. Vines are
                    sometimes propagated from small pieces of shoots having a single bud: Avhen they
                    have to be transmitted to a distance, an inch in length may suffice. Most of the
                    codlin apples may be increased by cuttings; and even large branches of those
                    Avhich produce <hi rend="italic">burs,</hi> may be planted at once, with
                    success. In all deciduous trees, the operation is most advantageously performed
                    in winter.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Propagation by Layers.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> This is not
                    much resorted to in the fruit garden. It is occasionally employed as the means
                    of dAvarfing trees. “Laying,” says Mr Lindley, “is nothing but striking from
                    cuttings which are still allθAved to maintain their connexion Avith the mother
                    plant by means of a portion at least of their stem.” The operation is performed
                    by bending dθAvn a branch to the earth, and pinning it there with pegs. A <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">γcav</hi> inches from the extremity a notch or slit is cut
                    upAvards, generally from the insertion of a bud. Sometimes the shoot is pierced
                    with a number of holes; a wire is bound round it; or even a ring of bark is
                    removed. The object of these expedients is to retard the descending sap, and
                    thus to promote the formation of radicles, or young roots. This is also aided by
                    bending the branch upAvard from the point at Avhich the roots are Avant-ed; and
                    the Avhole branch, except a few buds at the extremity, is covered with soil. The
                    seasons best fitted for these operations, are early in spring and about
                    midsummer, that is, before the sap begins to <hi rend="smallcaps">Aoav,</hi> and
                    after it has completely ascended. One Avhole summer, sometimes two summers, must
                    elapse before the layers be fully rooted.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Propagation by Grafting</hi> When a shoot or young branch of
                    one tree is inserted into the stem or branch of another, and, by the influence
                    of vegetation, is made to coalesce with it, the process is termed grafting. In
                    this manner apple and pear trees, sometimes plum and cherry trees, are
                    propagated. Our attention must be directed to the <hi rend="italic">stocks</hi>
                    into Avhich the shoots or cions, as they are called, are inserted; to the <hi

                    anticipation, such as are used in budding. For <hi rend="italic">apples,</hi>
                    seedlings of the crab apple, layers of the doucin or paradise, and of the

                    varieties of the same species, or species of the same genus as the cion, which
                    have a tendency to lessen the expansion of the engrafted tree. The Paradise or
                    Doucin is the dAvarfing stock for apples, the Quince for pears, the Bullace for
                    plums, and Prunus Mahaleb for cherries. The nature of the soil, in which the
                    grafted trees are destined to groAV, should also have weight in determining the
                    choice of stocks. When the garden is naturally moist, it is proper to graft
                    pears on the quince, because this plant agrees Avith a moist soil, and at the
                    same time serves to check the luxuriance thereby produced. In France, peaches
                    are commonly budded on almond stocks, to adapt them to the dry soils of that
                    country. The seeds from which stocks are to be raised, are generally soAvn in
                    beds in March; but the germination of some kinds is promoted by placing the
                    seed, for a time, in moist sand in a greenhouse. Next season the seedlings are
                    transplanted into nursery rows, in which they are allowed to reach the size
                    necessary for the various forms of fruit-trees hereafter to be mentioned.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">cion</hi> is always a portion of the Avood of the preceding
                    year. As the diseases incident to fruit-trees are transmitted by this mode of
                    propagation, it is desirable that the parents should be as healthy -as possible.
                    In the shy-bear <pb break="no" facs="nls:193647363" xml:id="kp-eb0711-7363-0636"
                    />ing kinds, it has been found beneficial to select shoots from the fruitful
                    branches. The cions should be taken off some weeks before they are wanted, and
                    half-buried in the earth, as it is conducive to success that the stock should,
                    in forwardness of vegetation, be somewhat in advance of the graft. During
                    winter, grafts may be brought from America, or from the Continent of Europe, if
                    carefully wrapped up in hypnum-moss. If they have been six weeks or two months
                    separated from the parent plant, they should be grafted low on the stock, and
                    the earth should be ridged up around them, leaving only one bud of the cion
                    above ground. Out of forty cions of new Flemish pears, procured by the
                    Caledonian Horticultural Society from Brussels and Louvain, and treated in this
                    way, only one failed.</p>
                <p>Success in <hi rend="italic">grafting</hi> depends almost entirely on accurately
                    applying the inner bark of the cion to the inner bark of the stock, so that the
                    sap may pass freely from the one to the other. They are therefore fitted
                    together and held fast by a slight bandage of matting. To lessen evaporation, a
                    portion of ductile clay is moulded around the place of junction, and is retained
                    until it appears, from the develope-merït of leaves, that the operation has
                    succeeded. The best season for grafting is the month of March; but it may be
                    commenced as soon as the sap in the stock is fairly in motion, and may be
                    continued during the first part of April.</p>
                <p>The most usual mode of grafting is called <hi rend="italic">whip-grafting,</hi>
                    or <hi rend="italic">tongue-grafting,</hi> represented in Plate CCXCHL, Fig. 8,
                    <hi rend="italic">a, a'.</hi> The top of the stock and the base of the cion are
                    cut off obliquely at corresponding angles, as nearly as can be guessed by the
                    eye; the tip of the stock is then cut off horizontally; next a slit is made
                    downwards in the centre of the sloping face of the stock, and a corresponding
                    slit upwards in the corresponding face of the cion. The tongue or upper part of
                    this sloping base is then inserted into the cleft of the cion, and so adjusted
                    that the inner bark may unite neatly and exactly on one side. The junction is
                    then tied up and covered with clay. Several other methods may be mentioned, such
                    as <hi rend="italic">cleft-grafting,</hi> Plate CCXCHL, Fig. 8, <hi
                    rend="italic">b, b',</hi> in which the cion is sloped at the base, and inserted
                    like a wedge into a cleft in the stock. <hi rend="italic">Side-grafting,</hi>
                    Plate CCXCIII., Fig. 8, <hi rend="italic">d, d’,</hi> which resembles
                    whip-grafting, but is performed on the side of the stock without heading it
                    down. <hi rend="italic">Crown-grafting,</hi> Plate CCXCIII., Fig. 8, <hi

                <p>It is evident that the method of performing the operation may be diversified to a
                    great extent. The late Μ. Thouin of Paris described, in the Annales du Museum,
                    nearly fifty <hi rend="italic">greffes,</hi> but little practical utility
                    results from such nice distinctions. It is of greater importance that the
                    horticulturist should be expert in the manipulation of the more common forms,
                    such as those above enumerated. An extensive fruit-garden requires a frequent
                    repetition of the operation, in order to secure proper kinds, and productive
                    branches. At Dalkeith Park, Mr Macdonald, the excellent gardener officiating
                    there, annually inserts on his established trees numerous grafts, and by this
                    means is enabled to overcome the disadvantages of a somewhat unfavourable
                    situation, and to obtain abundant crops of large and beautiful fruit.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Propagation by Budding</hi> —Most kinds of fruit-trees may be
                    propagated by budding; and there are some, such as peaches and apricos, which
                    can scarcely be multiplied in any other manner. It consists in removing a bud
                    with apportion of the bark from one tree, and inserting it in a slit of the bark
                    of another tree. The season for performing this operation is in July or August,
                    when the buds destined for tire following year are completely formed in the
                    axils of the leaves, and when the portion of bark parts freely from the wood
                    beneath. The buds to be preferred are those on the middle of a young shoot.
                    There are many forms of budding, but that which is simplest, and is generally
                    practised in this country, called <hi rend="italic">Shield-budding,</hi> need
                    alone be described. The operator should be provided with a budding-knife, in
                    which the cutting edge of the blade is rounded off at the point, and which has a
                    thin ivory or bone handle, like a paper-folder, for raising the bark of the
                    stock. A horizontal or transverse incision is made in the bark quite down to the
                    wood, and from this incision a perpendicular slit is drawn downwards, to the
                    extent of perhaps an inch. The slit has now a resemblance to the letter T (see
                    Plate CCXCIII., Fig. <hi rend="italic">S,f,f', f")</hi>; a bud is then cut from
                    the tree wished to be propagated, having a portion of the wood attached to it,
                    so that the whole may be an inch and a half long. The bit of wood is then gently
                    withdrawn, care being taken that the bud adhere wholly to the bark or shield, as
                    it is called. The bark on each side of the perpendicular slit being cautiously
                    opened with the handle of the knife, the bud and shield are inserted. The upper
                    tip of the shield is cut off horizontally, and brought neatly to fit the bark of
                    the stock at the transverse incision. Slight ties of moist bass-matting are then
                    applied. In about a month or six weeks the ligatures may be taken away, when, if
                    the operation have been successful, the bud will be fresh and full, and the
                    shield firmly united to the wood. Next spring a strong shoot is thrown out, and
                    to this the stock is headed down in the course of the summer.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Planting.</hi> —-,After propagation, the next care is to
                    transfer the young trees to those places, whether in the open air or against the
                    wall, where they are to remain. It is of some importance that these situations
                    should be considerately selected; for although all fruit-trees admit of repeated
                    transplantation at a subsequent period, they seldom feil to exhibit injurious
                    effects from it. Planting may be performed at any time in the beginning of
                    winter, and in the early spring months; but it is considered that the most
                    advantageous seasons are immediately after the fall of the leaf in autumn, and
                    before the ascent of the sap in spring. The trees should be carefully lifted
                    from the nursery lines, avoiding the mutilation or bruising of the roots; and,
                    to prevent the desiccation of the fibres, they should be planted as soon as
                    possible after being lifted. When they have to be carried to a distance, the
                    roots should be enveloped in moist hypnum-moss. In the ground, which iš presumed
                    to have been previously trenched or otherwise prepared, pits or holes are
                    formed, and the soil is finely pulverized; and in these the trees are placed,
                    their roots being spread Out and intermingled with the earth. Shallow planting
                    is strongly recommended; two or three inches of soil being in general a
                    sufficient covering. On filling up the hole, a surface of at least an equal size
                    is <hi rend="italic">mulched,</hi> that is, covered with dung or litter, so as
                    to restrain evaporation, and preserve moisture. In the case of wall-trees, a
                    space of five or six inches is usually left between the stem at the insertion of
                    the roots and the wall, to allow for the effects of growth. To young standard
                    trees stakes are added, to prevent their roots being ruptured by wind-waving.
                    During the dry weather of the first summer, the trees should be watered from
                    time to time as occasion requires.</p>
                <p>The selection and distribution of the different kinds of fruit-trees is an
                    important and interesting point in the formation of a garden. Regard must
                    necessarily be had to local situation and climate, as the selection ought
                    manifestly to be different for a garden in the south-west of England, and for
                    one in Yorkshire or Scotland; for one near the level of the sea, and for another
                    elevated several hundred feet. The best walls, having a south or south-east
                    aspect, are dedicated to the grape-vine, the fig-tree, the peach, and aprico.
                    The finer varieties of French and Flemish pears <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193647376" xml:id="kp-eb0711-7376-0637"/>require and deserve a good
                    aspect, as also the early sorts of cherries. The later cherries, and the
                    generality of plums, succeed very well either on an east or west aspect. In
                    Scotland, the mulberry requires the protection of a Avail, and several of the
                    finer apples do not arrive at perfection without it.</p>
                <p>The wall-trees which are intended to be permanent are called <hi rend="italic"
                    >dwarfs,</hi> from their being grafted near the ground. Between each of these,
                    trees with tall stems, called <hi rend="italic">riders</hi><hi rend="underline"
                    >in</hi> Scotland, are planted as temporary occupants of the upper part of the
                    Wall. The riders should always be five or six years trained in the nursery, in
                    order that when planted out they may come into bearing as speedily as possible.
                    The distances at which the permanent trees are planted is to be regulated by the
                    known mode of growth of the different sorts, and by the height of the wall. When
                    the walls are about twelve feet high, the following average distances have been
                    recommended :—For vines, 10 or 12 feet; peach and nectarine trees, from 15 to 20
                    feet; fig-trees, 20 feet at least; apricos, from 15 to 24 feet; plums and
                    cherries, from 15 to 20 feet; pear-trees, 20 feet if on quince stocks, and 30
                    feet on free stocks; apple-trees, 12 feet if on paradise stocks, and 15 to 25
                    feet on free stocks. Where the walls are only seven or eight feet high, the
                    distance should be increased by nearly one-fourth, as in this case the want of
                    height must be compensated by greater breadth.</p>
                <p>Apples and pears make the best espalier-rail trees, especially in Scotland. These
                    should be of the more robust sorts, and should be planted at the distance of 15
                    or 20 feet. Cherries and plums are sometimes introduced into the espalier-rail
                    row, but these succeed in those situations only where they would do equally well
                    or better as standards.</p>
                <p>In many excellent gardens, dwarf standards are preferred to espalier-rail trees.
                    They are placed along the inner borders at 8 or 10 feet apart. When proper
                    attention is paid to such trees, the effect is very pleasing, each being in
                    itself a handsome object, and generally clothed with fine fruit. Where the
                    situation is warm, and the climate favourable, a few of such of the finer pears
                    as have hardy blossoms should be planted out in this form. Though they may fail
                    to ripen in some seasons, they will often add greatly to the resources of the
                    fruit-room, their produce being frequently superior in flavour to the fruit
                    grown on walls.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Training.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> Two functions belong to
                    training,—that, namely, which modifies the form of the tree, and that which
                    regulates the bearing wood, and consequently the supply of blossom. The latter,
                    more accurately termed <hi rend="italic">pruning,</hi> being of a varied
                    character, will more properly fall to be considered when treating of the several
                    fruits; at present we shall make a few remarks on the former. The essential
                    properties of training are, that it should be simple, not requiring frequent
                    amputation; that it should be appropriate to the growth of the tree; and that it
                    should be such as to facilitate the production of fruit. The knife is the great
                    instrument in training, and whoever can wield it skilfully, will have a perfect
                    command over his trees: at the same time, it may be laid down as a maxim, that
                    it should be used with some degree of reserve, as nothing is more prejudicial to
                    the health and fruitfulness of all sorts of trees, than severe and injudicious
                    cutting.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Training of Standards.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi>
                    Orchard-trees are generally worked in the nurseries with stems five or six feet
                    high. All that is necessary, in pruning trees of this sort, is merely to cut out
                    the brandies which cross or press upon one another. Bushy heads should be
                    thinned out, and those which are too lax cut back. Three or four leading
                    branches may be selected, to pass ere long into boughs, and form a handsome
                    skeleton for the tree; but it is useless to be finical in this matter, as these
                    branches will soon grow beyond the power of the pruner, and of any artificial
                    system which he may adopt Dwarf standards being more accessible, are more under
                    the dominion of training. When worked on paradise stocks, they may be kept not
                    much superior in size to gooseberry bushes, and in a state of abundant
                    fruitfulness. The more fanciful Dutch modes of training apple-trees, in the
                    cup-and-ball fashion, and after many other curious devices, have never been
                    relished in Britain. In this country, they are generally allowed to grow <hi
                    rend="italic">en buisson,</hi> that is as bushes. For pears, the French forms,
                    <hi rend="italic">en pyramide,</hi> fig. 1, and <hi rend="italic">en
                    quenouille,</hi> fig. 2, are justly gaining ground.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Training of Wall-Trees.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> A
                    fruit-tree planted against a wall is evidently in a constrained and artificial
                    situation, from which it makes continual efforts to escape. Much attention is
                    necessary to repress this tendency, which, were it permitted to act, would
                    disfigure the tree, and neutralize the advantages of a wall, without imparting
                    in their place the freedom of a standard in the open air. To be successful, the
                    operator should be acquainted with the theory of vegetation, should study the
                    mode of growth in different trees, and, above all, remember the purpose of all
                    training, viz. the production of bearing wood.</p>
                <p>One great difficulty is to preserve equilibrium in the growth of die several
                    parts of the same tree: for the attainment of this object, excellent hints are
                    to be found in the <hi rend="italic">Pomone</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Française:</hi> we shall mention only two or three. A shoot will grow more
                    vigorously whilst waving in the air, than when nailed close to the wall; a weak
                    shoot should therefore be left free, whilst its stronger antagonist should be
                    restrained. A shoot diverging slighdy from the perpendicular, will, other things
                    being equal, obtain a more copious supply of sap than one that is laid out
                    horizontally, or is deflected downwards. A luxuriant shoot may be retarded for
                    some time, by having its tender extremity pinched off, and thus allow a weaker
                    brother to overtake it. By these and other expedients, which will suggest
                    themselves to an attentive horticulturist, and by the prudent use of the knife,
                    it will be easy to execute the following forms, which, on account of their
                    simplicity and general excellence, we select out of many to be found detailed in
                    works on gardening.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">horizontal</hi> form (fig. 3.) has long been a favourite in
                    this country, having been strongly recommended in the excellent work of Mr Hitt.
                    There is one principal ascending stem, from which the branches depart at
                    right-angles, at intervals of ten inches or a foot. In trees of ordinary vigour,
                    the vertical shoot is cut back every winter to within fourteen inches of the
                    highest pair of branches: a number of shoots are produced in the beginning of
                    each summer, <pb break="no" facs="nls:193647389" xml:id="kp-eb0711-7389-0638"
                    />out of which three are selected: one is trained in the original direction of
                    the stem, and oné on each side of it, parallel to the base of the wall. By
                    pinching off the point of the leading shoot about midsummer, another pair may be
                    obtained in autumn. In luxuriant trees, the vertical shoot may be left two feet
                    in length, by which means, and by summer pruning, we have known four pairs of
                    branches added in one season. The great object, at first, ought to be to draw
                    the stem upwards: when it has reached the top of the wall, it is made to
                    divaricate into two, and the tree, thus completed as to its height, is
                    henceforth suffered to increase in breadth only. Horizontal training is best
                    adapted to those trees which produce strong shoots, as the Ribston Pippin apple,
                    or the Gansel’s Bergamot pear. For the more twiggy kinds, the form represented
                    in Fig. 4. is more suitable. In this the horizontal branches are eighteen or
                    twenty inches distant, and the small shoots are trained in between them, either
                    on both sides, as below letter <hi rend="italic">a</hi> in the figure, or on the
                    under side and downwards, as below <hi rend="italic">b.</hi> This last is an
                    excellent method of reclaiming neglected trees of this description. Every
                    alternate branch being taken away, and the spurs cut off, the young shoots are
                    trained in, and soon produce excellent fruit. It is rather singular that Thouin,
                    in his account of the <hi rend="italic">Ecole</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >d’Agriculture pratique du Museum,</hi> classes the horizontal form among <hi
                    rend="italic">les tailles hétéroclites ou peu perfectionnées,</hi> and says,
                    that, in consequence of its invariably producing a <hi rend="italic">tête de
                    saule,</hi> that is, a hedge of young shoots at the top, it has been long since
                    abandoned. From this remark, we must draw the conclusion, that in France the
                    theory of training is in advance of the practice.</p>
                <p>The other principal form is called ylzn-traini ng. In this-there is no leading
                    stem, and the t&gt;ranenes are arranged somewhat like the spokes of a fan. Fig
                    5. represents this shape as it commonly occurs in gardens. <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ,</hi> It is difficult to say how, in the case of apple and
                    pear trees, this mode though frequently adopted, is superior or even equal to
                    the horizontal configuration: it is evident, that when the branches reach the
                    top of the wall, where they must be cut short, a <hi rend="italic">tête de
                    saule</hi> is inevitable. It would be better to adopt the modification of the
                    fan shape used for stone fruits (fig. 6); to establish a certain number of
                    mother branches and on these to form a series of subordinate members, chiefly
                    composed of bearing wood. The mother branches or limbs should not be numerous,
                    but well marked, equal in strength, and regularly disposed. The side branches
                    should be pretty abundant, short, and not so vigorous as to rival the leading
                    members. To ensure regularity, training should commence with maiden plants;
                    leaders of equal strength should be selected, and encouraged to grow out
                    longitudinally as much as possible, and all crowding among the inferior shoots
                    should be prevented. In <hi rend="italic">riders</hi> this form passes into the
                    stellar arrangement. The French have made considerable improvements in this mode
                    of training, some of which are noticed, <hi rend="italic">infra,</hi> under the
                    article Peach.</p>
                <p>Intermediate between horizontal and fan training, is the <hi rend="italic"
                    >half-fan,</hi> described in the first volume of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Caledonian Horticultural Society’s Memoirs,</hi> by Mr Smith, gardener at
                    Hopetoun-House, and practised by him with great success. It is nearly allied to
                    the horizontal form, but the branches form an acute angle with the stem, and are
                    supposed thus to favour the equal distribution of the sap. In the winter
                    pruning, three and sometimes four central branches are cut back; the shoots
                    which arise from these are arranged in the fan order, and, as they elongate, are
                    gradually brought into the horizontal position. The tree is finished at top as
                    in the horizontal form. Sometimes, as in fig. 7∙; t*' <hi rend="superscript">
                    0</hi> vertical stems are adopted. For vigorous trees, this figure seems to
                    combine the advantages of both the foregoing varieties. ' .</p>
                <p>The choice of particular modes of training is too often determined by mere
                    fashionable prejudice, which leads to <pb break="no" facs="nls:193647402"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0711-7402-0639"/>the application of the same form to all sorts of
                    trees. Thus the French are apt to reduce every thing to the <hi rend="italic"
                    >fan</hi> system, whilst some Englistι horticulturists are inclined to force
                    trees of the most rambling· growth into the pillory of a <hi rend="italic"
                    >horizontal</hi> arrangement. Such a uniformity cannot possibly be in accordance
                    with nature. The enlightened cultivator will employ various forms, and will
                    determine for himself which is the most appropriate, not only for every species,
                    but even for each particular variety of fruit-tree. By attentive observation and
                    rational experiment, more knowledge in this department may be attained in a few
                    years, than by a whole life spent in routine practice.</p>
                <p>As supplementary to the preceding remarks on training, we may mention some of the
                    expedients for inducing a state of fruitfulness in trees. Of these, the most
                    common is the cutting back of the roots to within three or four feet of the
                    stem; an operation which is generally found efficacious, when barrenness
                    proceeds from over-luxuriance and too copious a supply of sap. To attain the
                    same end, recourse is sometimes had to <hi rend="italic">ringing</hi> the
                    branches or stem, that is, removing a narrow annular portion of the bark. The
                    trees, it is said, are thereby not only rendered productive, but the quality of
                    the fruit is at the same time apparently improved. The advantage is considered
                    as depending on the obstruction given to the descent of the sap, it being thus
                    more copiously afforded, in its elaborated state, for the supply of the buds.
                    The ring should therefore be made in spring, and of such a width that the bark
                    may remain separated for the season. It ought to be observed, however, that none
                    of the stoned fruit-trees are benefited by ringing. Analogous to this practice
                    is decortication, or the removing of the old cracked bark from the stems of
                    apple and pear trees, a practice warmly recommended by Mr Lyon of Edinburgh, and
                    some other cultivators, but which has never been extensively adopted. Sometimes
                    barrenness proceeds from defect of climate and poverty of soil; in which case, a
                    warmer situation and more generous treatment are the most effectual remedies.
                    Fruit-trees should never, if possible, be allowed to become stunted; for in this
                    state they produce only worthless fruit, and acquire a habit which scarcely
                    admits of amelioration.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Protection of Blossom.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> In our
                    variable climate, and particularly in the northern and eastern parts of the
                    island, it is very desirable that the horticulturist should be provided with the
                    means of defending the blossom of his fruittrees from the late frosts in spring.
                    For this purpose, some cultivators partially cover their walls with branches of
                    fir or beech, or the fronds of the common <hi rend="italic">broken</hi> fern <hi
                    rend="italic">(Pteris</hi><hi rend="italic">aquilina),</hi> fastened firmly by
                    several points of attachment, to prevent rubbing. Others recommend frames
                    covered with bunting, osnaburg or similar light fabrics, set in a sloping
                    position in front of the trees. Screens formed of reeds have been used, and
                    nettings of worsted-yarn or of straw-ropes have been employed witn good effect.
                    Whatever contrivance serves to interrupt radiation, though it may not keep the
                    temperature much above freezing, will be found sufficient. Standard fruit-trees
                    must be left to their fate, and, indeed, from the lateness of their flowering,
                    they are generally more injured by blight, and by drenching rains, which wash
                    away the pollen of the flowers, than by the direct effects of cold.</p>
                <p>CULTURE OF HARDY FRUITS.</p>
                <p>We now proceed to the more special culture of the inmates of a British
                    fruit-garden. We shall begin with the more tender, but for details regarding
                    these, we must, to a considerable extent, refer to the forcing department, in
                    which alone many of the finer fruits can be perfected. The nomenclature of the
                    numerous varieties of the principar fruits is still in an uncertain and
                    unsatisfactory state. Mr Thompson, of the Horticultural Garden at Chiswick, has,
                    however, with much discrimination and judgment, settled the synonyms of many of
                    those chiefly cultivated in our gardens; and we shall therefore (when the
                    contrary is not intimated) adopt the names employed in the second edition of the
                    London Horticultural Society’s Fruit Catalogue.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="smallcaps">Grape Vine (</hi><hi rend="italic">Vitis vinifera)</hi>
                    can scarcely be said to be a hardy fruit in our climate. In every case it
                    requires a good aspect; and north of York, a crop of <hi rend="italic"
                    >dessert</hi> grapes cannot be expected without the aid of a hot wall. In the
                    extreme south-west districts of England, indeed, grapes fit for the manufacture
                    of wine, perhaps equal in quality to those in the north of France, might be
                    produced On dwarf standards; and there is abundant historical evidence that
                    productive vineyards once existed in that part of the country.</p>
                <p>In the Lond. Hort. Soc. Catalogue, 182 varieties of grapes are enumerated. Some
                    of these, however, have not as yet been well ascertained; some arc pronounced
                    indifferent, and others worthless. We shall name only a few of those most
                    deserving the attention of the cultivator.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Miller’s Burgundy.</hi> This sort is distinguished by the hoary
                    pubescence of its leaves. It is a black grape, with short compact clusters,
                    small round berries, and clear, high-flavonred juice. It is hardy, ripening
                    completely on a south wall.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Black Damascus.</hi> Bunches large, with round berries and
                    sweet juice. This valuable late variety does not set well, and the bunches are
                    improved by the blossom being dusted with the pollen of some hardy kind.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Frankenthal.</hi> A valuable grape, resembling the black
                    Hamburgh. Bunches moderate in size, berries obovate, flavour excellent. Succeeds
                    best in a warm vinery.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Frontignan</hi> (or <hi rend="italic">Frontignac).</hi> Five
                    varieties under this appellation, and distinguished by the names of <hi
                    rend="italic">black, blue, grizzly, red, white,</hi> are mentioned in
                    horticultural catalogues. They vary in colour and form of the cluster. The
                    berries are round, the skin thick, and the juice of a rich muscat flavour. They
                    are all of the highest excellence.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Black Gibraltar,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Bed Hamburgh</hi> of
                    Lindley. This is an excellent grape, with large clusters, and large dark-red
                    berries, full of a sweet juice.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Black Hamburgh.</hi> This is a well-known grape, of great
                    Value, and perhaps more generally cultivated for the dessert in this country
                    than any other sort. It ought to be in every collection.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Black Lombardy</hi> (or <hi rend="italic">West’s St
                    Peter’s).</hi> Bunches large, berries round, skin thin, with a sweet flavour; an
                    excellent late sort. The fruit will hang on the vines till March.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Boyal Muscadine,</hi> L. Hort. Cat. or <hi rend="italic">White
                    Muscadine</hi> of Lindley. Usual Chasselas of Paris. This, though not a
                    first-rate grape, is a favourite with many. Bunches large, berries white, round,
                    with sweet flavour.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Muscat of Alexandria.</hi> Bunches long, berries white and
                    oval, with a delicious muscat flavour. This most admirable variety requires a
                    high temperature, and should properly have a small vinery for itself.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Pitmaston White Cluster.</hi> This excellent variety sprang
                    from a seed of the small black cluster grape. The bunch is compact, the berry is
                    round, when ripe of an amber colour, bronzed with russet on one side. It comes
                    to perfection on the open wall in England, and is also well suited for
                    forcing.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">White Sweet Water.</hi> Bunch loose, berries round, flavour
                    sweet. It ripens early, generally from the middle to the end of September; and
                    in the south of England it sue-ceeds<pb break="no" facs="nls:193647415"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0711-7415-0640"/> against the open wall. The bunches should be
                    allowed to hang until they be perfectly ripe, when the berries acquire a slight
                    russet colour. It has long been a favourite grape.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Stillward’s Sweet-Water</hi> is a recent variety, of equal
                    merit.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Black</hi><hi rend="italic">Morillon,</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >Burgundy Grape,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Small black cluster,</hi> ripens in
                    England against a south wall.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Black Prince</hi> is of easy cultivation in a common
                    vinery, and the berries are of a pleasant flavour.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Zante,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Corinth Grape,</hi> is
                    often called Zante Currant. In general it is a shy-bearer, and the berries are
                    small; but Mr Gow, gardener at Tulliallan, having fertilized some bunches with
                    the pollen of the Black Hamburgh, found that they set more freely, and that the
                    berries were larger and better flavoured; a hint worth attending to in other
                    cases.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Verdelho.</hi> Bunches loose, colour greenish-yellow, berries
                    small, oval, numerous; when fully ripe, of a rich saccharine flavour. It is the
                    principal grape cultivated in Madeira for making the celebrated Madeira wine.
                    The plant grows vigorously; and Mr Knight has observed of it, that the same
                    degree of shade which would render the greater number of sorts wholly
                    unproductive, scarcely affects the fertility of this; a convenient property,
                    which adapts it for the back wall of a glazed house. The same horticulturist
                    mentions another economical property of the verdelho: it bears plentifully when
                    planted in very small pots: a few pots of it may therefore be introduced among
                    green-house plants in early spring; the almost leafless stems do no injury till
                    the end of May, when some of the more hardy ornamental plants can be set abroad;
                    and during the warm months which follow, when the green-house is otherwise
                    empty, abundant crops of these grapes may be procured.</p>

                    The bunches are large and shouldered, not unlike those of the Black Hamburgh.
                    The berries are of a fine dark colour, with a bluish farina: the pulp adheres to
                    the skin; and though neither highly flavoured nor melting, it is very pleasant.
                    This grape ripens on the open wall near London.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Syrian Grape</hi> is remarkable for the extraordinary size
                    and beauty of its bunches; but it is a late variety, and the berries have not
                    much flavour. This is generally regarded as the kind produced in the valley of
                    Eshcol, a cluster of which was brought to the camp of Israel swung on a staff
                    between two of the spies; not probably on account of its weight, but (as Dr
                    Clarke observes) to prevent the berries from being bruised.</p>
                <p>In addition to the above, the editor of the <hi rend="italic">Land. Bort.
                    Cat.</hi> mentions the following as excellent grapes :—Ciotat, or
                    Parsley-Leaved; Genuine Tokay, or White Morillon; Chasselas Musqué; Chasselas
                    précoce; Elford; Lunel; Mignonne White Cluster; Black Morocco; Black Muscadine;
                    Petersburgh; Raisin des Carmes; White Tokay, and Black Tripoli.</p>
                <p>The kinds commonly grown on the open wall in England are the Miller Burgundy,
                    Esperione, White Muscadine, and White Sweet-Water. In the north of England, and
                    in the south of Scotland, vines always require hot walls. At Erskine-house, on
                    the Clyde, Black Hamburgh grapes are every year produced against a hot-wall,
                    equal in size and flavour to those of the vinery or hot-house. In some gardens,
                    an entire wall is dedicated to vines, but, in general, they occupy only the
                    interstices between other trees. Mr Williams of Pitmaston trained a vine under
                    the coping of a wall to the extent of fifty feet, and bent down the shoots at
                    intervals to fill up the spaces between the fruit-trees, and he found that the
                    grapes were the finer the farther they were distant from the stem. The culture
                    of grapes on a wall does not differ materially from that practised in a
                    moderately worked vinery; we shall, therefore defer any further observations,
                    till we resume the subject in treating of the forcing department.</p>
                <p>»</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="smallcaps">Fig-Tree</hi> (Ficus Carica) is not a great favourite in
                    this country, the fresh fruit not being much relished, and our tables being
                    supplied with a vast abundance of dried figs imported from the Mediterranean.
                    Every good garden ought, however, to contain a few trees, to furnish an
                    occasional dish; and we doubt not that the fresh fruit, if it were more common,
                    and better grown, would be more liked. The foliage of the tree is large and
                    elegant; and the mode of fructification is curious: the pulpy part, which we
                    call the fruit, being, in fact, a common receptacle, and the anthers and
                    stigmata being produced inside. The nomenclature of figs is still very
                    uncertain, and it is with some hesitation that we give the following names
                    :—</p>
                <p>1. Black Ischia. 6. Murrey-coloured or Brown</p>
                <p>2. Black Genoa. Naples.</p>
                <p>3. Large Blue, or purple. 7∙ Pregussata.</p>
                <p>4. Brunswick or Madonna. 8. Lee’s Perpetual, δ. Brown Ischia or Miller’s 9. Early
                    White.</p>
                <p>chestnut fig. 10. Marseilles or Figue blanche.</p>
                <p>Of these the Marseilles, the Early White and Black Ischia, and Large Blue, are
                    best adapted for forcing; the others are suitable for walls. Lee’s perpetual
                    answers well for either mode of culture; but it is not mentioned by Loudon or by
                    Lindley, being probably regarded by them as a sub-variety of the Large Blue.</p>
                <p>Fig-trees may be propagated by cuttings put into flowerpots, and placed in a
                    gentle hot-bed. They are, however, most speedily obtained from layers. The
                    shoots laid down should be two or three years old; and these, when rooted, will
                    form plants ready to bear fruit the first or second year after planting. Suckers
                    ought never to be used.</p>
                <p>In some places in England fig-trees are planted out as standards; and in Kent and
                    Sussex, a few small fig orchards exist. In Scotland a south wall is
                    indispensable, trained to which, in good situations, and when the trees are old
                    enough, they bear remarkably well. The best soil for a fig border, is a rich
                    friable loam, on a subsoil not retentive of moisture, or which has been
                    effectually drained. It is advantageous to have a lofty wall, and the trees
                    should be planted at considerable distances, perhaps not nearer than forty feet,
                    to allow them full space to exhaust their luxuriance.</p>
                <p>It is of the nature of the fig-tree to produce two sets of shoots, and two crops
                    of fruit, in the season. The first shoots generally shew young figs in July and
                    August, but those in our climate very seldom ripen. The late or midsummer shoots
                    likewise put forth fruit-buds, which, however, do not develope themselves till
                    the following spring, and then form the only crop of figs on which we can depend
                    in this country.</p>
                <p>Various modes of training fig-trees have been proposed. Mr Lindley recommends the
                    horizontal form. Mr Knight carries up a central stem perpendicularly to the top
                    of the wall, and then radiates the side-branches horizontally and pendently, in
                    close contact with the wall. Luxuriance of growth is supposed thus to be
                    checked, and the branches thrown into a bearing habit. The finest fig-trees
                    which we have seen in Scotland, are trained in the old fan form. The shoots are
                    laid in, thinly, at full length, and encouraged to extend themselves as fast as
                    possible, precaution, however, being taken to leave no part of the tree bare of
                    young wood. M ach of the pruning is performed in summer by pinching off
                    unnecessary shoots, and the knife is seldom employed, except in removing naked
                    branches, or in cutting back to procure a supply of young wood. Some cultivators
                    break off the points of the spring shoots, in order to produce laterals, but
                    this must be done at an early period, not later perhaps than mid-summer,
                    otherwise the young <pb break="no" facs="nls:193647428"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0711-7428-0641"/>shoots will not ripen <hi rend="subscript"> f</hi>
                    The Rev. G. Swayne recommends rubbing off all the young figs which appear in
                    autumn on shoots of the same year; observing, that for every young fig thus
                    displaced, the rudiments of one, or perhaps two others, are formed before
                    winter, and developed in the following year.</p>
                <p>The winter dressing of the fig-tree takes place immediately after the fall of the
                    leaf. The immature figs which may remain are removed, irregularities are
                    corrected, and the shoots nailed neatly to the wall, λ <hi rend="superscript">
                    7</hi> arious modes of protecting the branches during winter have been adopted.
                    As Argenteuil, where figs are cultivated on standards for the Paris market, the
                    lower branches are bent downwards, and buried about six inches deep in the soil;
                    while the upper branches are tied together, and bound round with straw and
                    litter. Mr Swayne mentions that he wraps up the young shoots with waste paper.
                    Mr Forsyth recommends covering wall fig-trees with the spray of laurel or yew,
                    and then tucking in short grass or moss <hi rend="italic">(]ιypnum)</hi> among
                    the spray. Mr Smith, first at Ormiston Hall, and afterwards at Hopetoun-house,
                    has found (<hi rend="italic">Cal.</hi><hi rend="italic">Hort.</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Soc.</hi><hi rend="italic">Mem.</hi> vol. ii.) a covering of
                    spruce-fir branches to be very effectual. The branches are so placed as to
                    overlap each other, and to form a layer nearly equally thick on every part of
                    the tree. The foliage of the spruce branches remains green till March, and as
                    the light and heat increase, the dried leaves gradually fall off, and admit air
                    and sun to the fig-branches below.</p>
                <p>Mr Monck <hi rend="italic">{Lond.</hi><hi rend="italic">Hort.</hi><hi

                    produces fruit containing both perfect stamens and pistils, and conjectures that
                    this is the cause of the fruit being so often prematurely shed. <hi
                    rend="italic">Caprification,</hi> or assisting the fructifying and maturation of
                    figs, has often been sneered at; but here we see reason in that kind of it which
                    consisted in hanging or shaking the branches of the wild fig <hi rend="italic"
                    >(caprificus)</hi> over the cultivated tree at the time when both were in
                    blossom.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="smallcaps">Peach</hi><hi rend="italic">(Amygdalus</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Persicà)</hi> is a stone-fruit of oriental origin, said to have
                    been brought from Persia by the Romans, about the beginning of the empire; but
                    the precise period of its introduction into our gardens, of which it has long
                    been the pride and ornament, is not well ascertained. There are two principal
                    varieties: the Peach, properly so called, with a downy skin; and the Nectarine,
                    with a smooth skin. These, following the authority of Linnaeus, we consider as
                    one species; and as their culture is precisely the same, we shall speak of them
                    as distinct only when referring to their sub-varieties. Each of these varieties
                    is again divided by gardeners into <hi rend="italic">freestones</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">pêches,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">clingstones</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">pavies,</hi> according as the stone parts freely from the pulp, or
                    adheres to it. We shall here treat chiefly of the freestones, as being most
                    hardy, and fittest for the open wall in Britain.</p>
                <p>Mr George Lindley, whose arrangement is the best that has hitherto been
                    published, enumerates 60 kinds of peaches, and 28 of nectarines. In the
                    Horticultural Catalogue, the names of 183 peaches, and of 65 nectarines, are
                    recorded. We doubt not but that in America, where the trees are commonly raised
                    from kernels, and grown as standards, several thousand varieties and
                    sub-varieties might be collected. To enumerate even the limited number existing
                    in Britain, would far exceed our limits: we shall therefore notice only a few of
                    those which are most distinct, and best adapted to our climate.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Peaches.</hi><hi rend="italic">Red Nutmeg,</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">Avant rouge.</hi> This is one of the earliest peaches, ripening
                    about the beginning of August. The fruit small; colour pale yellow towards the
                    wall, bright vermilion next the sun; pulp white, but red at the core; the juice
                    rich and musky. The tree is an abundant bearer.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Acton Scot.</hi> This was raised by Mr Knight between the

                    on the other side; the pulp rich, juicy, and saccharine; the tree is a good
                    bearer, and not apt to be affected with mildew. It ripens in August.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Spring-Grove.</hi> This is another of Mr Knight’s peaches,
                    raised from the grosse mignonne crossed with the pollen of the nutmeg. It is

                    and of excellent flavour. The tree is a good bearer, but succeeds best on an
                    aprico stock. The fruit ripens in the beginning of September.</p>

                    red at the stone; juice rich and vinous. Tree a good bearer; fruit ripening
                    about the beginning of September. “An excellent peach,” says Mr Lindley, “and
                    ought to be found in every collection.”</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Royal George.</hi> This is a well-known peach, much cultivated.
                    By nurserymen it is often given out as the Red Magdalene; but it is at once
                    distinguished from the Red Magdalene of Miller, by the blossoms being small.
                    Against a good wall it ripens in the beginning of September, even in indifferent
                    seasons. Fruit large, purplish red next the sun, whitish where shaded; flesh
                    white, varied with red next the stone which is free; melting, rich, with an
                    abundant sugary juice. It is also one of the best kinds for a peach-house,
                    fruiting freely, and ripening well. The foliage is, however, rather subject to
                    mildew.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Noblesse.</hi> This has long and deservedly been a favourite in

                <p>For information respecting the best modes of raising new varieties of peaches and
                    nectarines, the reader may be referred to Mr Knight’s papers in the first volume
                    of the Transactions of the Horticultural Society of London. That ardent
                    horticulturist entertains the hope, that, by repeated sowings, the peach may
                    acquire so robust a habit as to be capable of succeeding as a standard in
                    favourable situations in England and Ireland. But with this desirable object in
                    view, we would rather see the number of the kinds diminished than increased; and
                    it would be well for the country, were all the indifferent sorts banished from
                    the nursery catalogues.</p>
                <p>To perpetuate and multiply valuable varieties, peaches and nectarines are budded
                    upon plum or almond stocks. For dry situations, almond stocks are preferable;
                    and for damp or clayey loams, it is better to use plums. The peach border should
                    be composed of alight mellow loam, such as is suitable for the vine and the fig.
                    It should be quite free from all stagnant water, or latent dampness. It need not
                    be of great depth, as the peach tree thrives best, and is most productive, when
                    the roots are near the surface of the ground. In this country, nothing is a
                    greater obstacle to success in peach culture than trenching the borders, and
                    cropping them with vegetables. We believe that, in many instances, all that is
                    required to remedy sickly and unfruitful trees is to bring up their roots within
                    five or six inches of the surface.</p>
                <p>The fruit of the peach is produced on the twiggy shoots of the preceding year. If
                    these be too luxuriant, they produce nothing but leaves; and if too weak, they
                    are incapable of maturing the fruit. To produce these, then, in sufficient
                    abundance, and of requisite strength, is the great object of peach training and
                    pruning. All twiggy trees naturally fall into the fan form; and accordingly this
                    has generally been adopted in the culture of peaches. Some have followed the
                    horizontal arrangement, and Mr Knight has recommended a method, the principal
                    purpose of which seems to be to thwart the usual mode of growth of the tree. In
                    reference to such arrangements we can only say:</p>
                <p>Naturam expelles <hi rend="italic">furca,</hi> tamen usque recurret.</p>
                <p>W e shall first notice the old English method, and then briefly the French, and
                    other new varieties of training.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">old an</hi> form is very nearly that which we have already
                    given <hi rend="italic">{supra,</hi> p. 638,) as a specimen of fan training for
                    twiggy trees, lhe young tree is often procured when it has been trained for two
                    or three years in the nursery, but it is generally better to commence with a <hi
                    rend="italic">maiden</hi> plant, that is, in the first year after it has been
                    budded. It is then headed down to five or six buds, and in the following summer
                    two or four shoots, according to the vigour of the plant, are trained in; the
                    laterals also being thinned out, and properly nailed to the wall. Suppose there
                    are four branches, in the following winter the two central ones are shortened
                    back to produce others, and the inferior ones are laid in nearly at full length.
                    In the following season additional shoots are sent forth; and the process is
                    repeated till eight or ten principal limbs or <hi rend="italic">mother
                    branches</hi> be obtained, forming, as it were, the frame-work of the future
                    tree. These mother branches are occasionally raised or depressed, so as to
                    maintain their <hi rend="superscript"> t</hi> equilibrium, and are as much
                    encouraged to grow outwards as is consistent with the regülar filling up of the
                    tree. The laterals are carefully thinned out (by pinching off with the fingers)
                    in summer; and the remainder are nailed in, to afford subordinate members and
                    bearing wood. When the centre of the tree has been filled up, all the training
                    necessary is merely to prevent the inferior members from acquiring an undue
                    ascendency over the mother branches. It is highly advantageous to have abundant
                    space, and to draw the tree outwards, so that it be thin, but nowhere destitute
                    of young shoots.</p>
                <p>Meanwhile the pruning for fruit has been going on. This consists in shortening
                    down the laterals which had been nailed in at the disbudding, or summer pruning.
                    Their length will depend on their individual vigour, and the luxuriance of the
                    tree. The buds, which are generally double, or rather two together, with a fruit
                    bud between them, seldom occur quite close to the insertion of the shoot.
                    Perhaps two or three pairs are left with a wood-bud at the point to afford a
                    growing shoot, in order to act as its lungs, for it is necessary that there
                    should be leaves above the fruit When the fruit begins to swell, the point of
                    this leading shoot is pinched off that it may not drain off the sap. Any young
                    shoot from the wood-eyes at the base of the bearing branch is carefully
                    preserved, and in the following winter it takes the place of the branch which
                    has borne fruit and is cut out. If there be no young shoot below, and the
                    bearing branch be short, the shoots at the point of the latter are pruned for
                    fruit; but this must be done cautiously; and if the bearing branch be long, it
                    is better to cut it back for young wood. It is the neglect of this which
                    constitutes the principal error of the English fan system as it is usually
                    practised. Several times during summer the trees are regularly examined; the
                    young shoots are respectively topped and thinned out; those that remain are
                    nailed to the wall, or braced in with pieces of peeled willow, and the whole
                    trees are occasionally washed with the force-pump.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Montrueil form</hi> is described at length in the Hór-</p>
                <p>ticultural Tour, p. 429, or in the <hi rend="italic">Cal.</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Hort.</hi><hi rend="italic">Mem.</hi> vol. iv. p. 145. The principal feature
                    constitutes the great principle of all French training, the suppression of the
                    direct channel of the sap. Four, more commonly two, <hi rend="italic"
                    >mère</hi><hi rend="italic">branches</hi> are so laid to the wall that the
                    central angle contains about 90°. The other branches are all treated as
                    subordinate members.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:193647454" xml:id="kp-eb0711-7454-0643"/>
                <p>The form <hi rend="italic">à</hi><hi rend="italic">la Dumoutier</hi> (so called
                    from its inventor, and described at great length by Lelιeur), is merely a re
                    finement on the Montrueil method. It will be sufficient to mention to the
                    experienced trainer (and none other can be expected to execute this form), that
                    the formation of the tree commences with the inferior limbs, and proceeds
                    towards the centre, the branches being lowered from time time, as the tree
                    acquires strength. What is most worthy of notice in this method, is the
                    management of the subordinates in the pruning for fruit. When a' shoot promises
                    blossom, it is generally at some distance from the point of insertion into the
                    old wood, and the intermediate space is covered with wood buds. All the latter,
                    therefore, which are between the old wood <hi rend="italic">a</hi> and the
                    blossom c, in the outer figure, except the lowest <hi rend="italic">b,</hi> are
                    carefully removed by <hi rend="italic">ebour-geonnement.</hi> This never fails
                    to produce a shoot, <hi rend="italic">b</hi> in the inner figure, the growth of
                    which is favoured by destroying the useless spray above the blossoms, and
                    pinching off the points of those which are necessary to perfect the fruit. A
                    replacing shoot is thus obtained, to Avhich the whole is invariably shortened at
                    the end of the year. The branch thus treated is called the <hi rend="italic"
                    >branche</hi><hi rend="italic">de reserve.</hi></p>
                <p>The form <hi rend="italic">à</hi><hi rend="italic">la Siculle</hi> is another
                    modification of the Montrueil training, for an account of which we must again
                    refer to the Horticultural Tour. Fig. 10. will give an idea of the general
                    arrangement of the tree. The two mother branches are laid in very obliquely, and
                    are never shortened. On the subordinate branches only three buds are left, at
                    the winter pruning, one terminal, and two at a considerable distance from each
                    other on the sides of the shoot. This method, probably, is not well adapted to
                    our climate.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Mr Seymour's</hi> form, as described in vols. i. and ii. of the
                    Gardener’s Magazine, approaches more nearly to the French methods than any other
                    practised in this country. It will be seen, however, from the annexed figure
                    (fig. 11), that he does not suppress the direct channel of the sap. This
                    circumstance, although considerable stress seems to be laid upon it, is not
                    essential to the plan, nor is perhaps the best part of it. The principal novelty
                    is, that the· bearing shoots are all on the upper sides of the mother branches,
                    and that these bearing shoots are wholly reproduced once a-year.</p>
                <p>The one side of this figure represents the tree <hi rend="italic">after</hi> the
                    winter pruning, the other side before it has undergone that operation. It will
                    be observed, that on this last side there are pairs of shoots on the upper parts
                    of the mother branches. The lower shoot, that, namely, which has borne fruit, is
                    cut out, and the other is brought down into its place. This replacing shoot is
                    shortened to about eight or nine inches, care being taken to cut at a wood-bud;
                    and at the time of disbudding, the best situate buds, and those nearest the
                    base, are left for the future year’s bearing. To this plan it is objected, by a
                    writer in the Horticultural Register, that the annual excision of the bearing
                    shoots produces a series of rugged and increasingly ugly protuberances at their
                    base and along the upper surface of the principal members; an objection which
                    also militates against Dumoutier’s form. Mr Loudon, on the other hand, declares
                    that Mr Seymour’s mode is the most perfect in theory that has been described.
                    For ourselves, we are inclined to prefer the old fan form, when well executed,
                    as nearest the natural habit of the tree, and as best adapted to our uncertain
                    climate. In the training of peaches, “whatever is best administered is best and
                    there is no doubt that many ingenious gardeners have only partial success,
                    because, from the multiplicity of their engagements, their trees can receive
                    only partial attention.</p>
                <p>For cold and late situations, Mr Knight has recommended the encouraging of spurs
                    on the young wood; such spurs, when close to the Avail, generating the best
                    organized and most vigorous blossoms, and ensuring a crop of fruit. They may be
                    produced, by taking care, during the summer-pruning, or disbudding, to preserve
                    a number of the little shoots emitted by the. yearly wood, only pinching off the
                    minute succulent points. On the spurs thus procured, numerous blossom-buds form
                    early in the follθAving season.</p>
                <p>Peach-trees, particularly in the north of England, and also in Scotland, require
                    protection from atmospherical influences, especially at the period of
                    blossoming. As already noticed, branches of spruce or silver fir, or other
                    spray, are sometimes Avoven into frames, Avhich are fixed in front of the trees,
                    and removed during the day in fine Aveather <hi rend="italic">(Cal. ĬJort.
                    Mem.</hi> i. 276). Canvass or bunting screens are equally effectual, and perhaps
                    more easily moveable. Straw-ropes, straAv-nets, and a variety of other
                    expedients, have been proposed, and may be used according to circumstances. If
                    the screens be applied early in the season, great benefit may be derived from
                    retarding the blossom till the frosty nights of spring be past. If the night
                    frost have been severe, a copious sprinkling of Avater over the Avhole tree,
                    before the influence of the morning sun be felt, has been found by Harrison to
                    be very useful in gradually raising the temperature of the foliage and blossoms,
                    and thus preventing injury from the sudden transition. To trees trained against
                    hot-walls, if fire be used in spring, screens are indispensable; but perhaps
                    hot-walls are most beneficially employed in ripening off the fruit of the late
                    sorts of peaches in autumn; and, what is equally important, ripening the young
                    wood of such sorts.</p>
                <p>The ALMOND-Tree <hi rend="italic">(Amygdalus communis),</hi> a native of China,
                    may be noticed hère rather on account of its <pb break="no" facs="nls:193647467"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0711-7467-0644"/>affinity to the peach and aprico, than because of
                    its importance as a fruit-tree in this country. Every good garden should contain
                    a tree or two trained against a west or east wall, and also a few standards; for
                    in very fine seasons the latter will yield crops, and they are always ornamental
                    in spring from the beauty of their blossoms. The sorts most worthy of notice
                    are:</p>
                <p>Tender-shelled Sweet Almond, or Jordan.</p>
                <p>Common Almond, or Bitter.</p>
                <p>The almond is generally budded on seedlings of its own kind; but for heavy soils,
                    plum-stocks are preferable. The training and pruning of almond-trees on walls
                    are much the same as in the peach or the aprico.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="smallcaps">Aprīcot</hi><hi rend="italic">(Prunus</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Armeniaca)</hi> is a native of the Caucasus and China; it was
                    cultivated by the Romans, and was introduced into England from Italy in the
                    reign of Henry VIII. It has always, and deservedly, been a favourite fruit. The
                    principal varieties are:</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Red Masculine.</hi> Flowers small; fruit small, roundish,
                    yellow, and red; flesh sweet and juicy; stone impervious; kernel bitter. This is
                    a very early sort. The tree is tender, and requires a good aspect.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Breda.</hi> Flowers large; fruit roundish, sometimes almost
                    four-cornered, orange-coloured; juice rich; stone small, impervious; kernel
                    sweet. The true Breda is an aprico of first-rate excellence, and in the south of
                    England the tree bears well as a standard.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Roman.</hi> Flowers large; fruit oblong, compressed, pale
                    yellow; flesh soft; stone impervious; kernel very bitter. The tree is a good
                    bearer, but the fruit is fit only for preserving. It is sometimes called the
                    Brussels,—a name also occasionally given to the preceding.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Moorpark.</hi> Flowers large; fruit roundish, compressed,
                    orange and red; flesh parting from the stone, juicy and rich; stone pervious;
                    kernel bitter. This is generally considered the best apricdt in this country:
                    there are several sub-varieties known under different names, and it scarcely
                    differs from the <hi rend="italic">Abrico Pêche</hi> of the French.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Turkey.</hi> Flowers large; fruit middle-sized, spherical, deep
                    yellow; flesh juicy and rich, parting from the stone, which is impervious;
                    kernel sweet. This is an excellent late variety.</p>
                <p>Besides these, we may mention the Large Early, the White Masculine, Hemskirke,
                    Musch-musch, and Royal. The last is a French variety of recent origin; it is
                    excellent, and ripens earlier than the Moorpark.</p>
                <p>Apricos are propagated by budding on muscle or common plum-stocks. Mr Knight
                    recommends the wilding aprico as a stock for the Moorpark variety. Some
                    gardeners have adopted the horizontal form of training, but the most usual, and
                    certainly the best, is the common fanarrangement. The fruit is produced on
                    shoots of the preceding year, and on small close spurs formed on the two-year
                    old wood. The aprico is a tree of much stronger growth than the peach, and
                    therefore requires more room; this and the peculiarity of the spurs being kept
                    in mind, the observations made on the training and pruning of the peach may be
                    readily applied to this tree. It requires a summer and winter pruning. The
                    former should begin early in June, at which period all irregular fore-right and
                    useless shoots are pinched off; and, shortly afterwards, those which remain are
                    fastened to the wall to become bearers. At the winter pruning, all worn-out
                    branches, and such as are not duly furnished with spurs and fruitbuds, are
                    removed. The young bearers are moderately pruned at the points, care, however,
                    being taken to leave a terminal shoot to each branch. The most common error in
                    the pruning of apricos, is laying in the bearing shoots too thickly.</p>
                <p>The blossom comes early in spring, but is more hardy than that of the peach; the
                    same means of protection when necessary, may be employed. The fruit often sets
                    too numerously; and in this case it is thinned out in June and in the beginning
                    of July, the later thinnings being used for tarts, for which purpose they are
                    excellent. In the south of England, apricos are sometimes trained against
                    espalier-rails, and occasionally planted as dwarf standards; and it is said that
                    in good seasons the fruit from such trees is more highly flavoured than that
                    from walls. In general, however, the protection of a wall is necessary. An east
                    or west aspect is preferred in England, the full south being apt to induce
                    mealiness of pulp. In Scotland, the late varieties require the best aspect that
                    can be afforded.</p>
                <p>The Pι,UM-Tree <hi rend="italic">(Prunus</hi><hi rend="italic">domestica)</hi> is
                    considered by Sir J. E. Smith as a native of England. Many of the best
                    cultivated varieties, however, have been introduced from France. The
                    Horticultural Society’s Catalogue enumerates 274 sorts, though probably all of
                    these are not well ascertained. We shall first notice a few of the best dessert
                    plums, and then give a list of select kitchen sorts.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Green Gage</hi> is the <hi rend="italic">Reine</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Claude</hi> of the French.. Being a great favourite at Paris (as
                    it is every where else), during the ferment of the Revolution, when all
                    allusions to royalty were proscribed, it retained its popularity under the title
                    of Prune Citoyenne. It was introduced into England by the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Gage</hi> family, and the foreign name having been lost, it obtained its
                    present appellation. It is a fruit of first-rate excellence, and exquisite
                    flavour. The tree deserves a place against an east or west wall, where the fruit
                    acquires a larger size, without materially falling off in richness of flavour.
                    Treated as a wall-tree, it seldom bears well till it be old; and it is very
                    impatient of exact training, as indeed most plums are. In warm situations it may
                    be profitably grown on an espalier rail, or as a dw arf standard.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Drap</hi><hi rend="italic">d’ Or.</hi> This is a small yellow
                    plum of high flavour, ripening in the beginning of September. On a light soil
                    the tree is a tolerable bearer; but on a heavy soil it seldom succeeds. The
                    fruit precedes the green gage in ripening, and resembles it in quality.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Coe’s Golden Drop.</hi> A fine large oval plum, excellent
                    either for the tabic, or for preserving. It keeps well; and Mr Lindley informs
                    us, that he has eaten it exceedingly good twelve months after it had been
                    gathered. It requires the best aspect of a wall; and will scarcely answer in a
                    bleak climate.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Precoce de Tours.</hi> An early sort; of a dark-blue colour,
                    with a violet bloom; pulp yellow, and of a very pleasant flavour. The tree
                    succeeds as a standard.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Blue</hi><hi rend="italic">Imperatrice.</hi> A fine late plum;
                    a good bearer, but requiring an east or west wall.</p>

                    very high flavoured variety, resembling, colour excepted, the green gage. It
                    succeeds on standards, but is improved by a wall. The tree is a good bearer.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Washington, L.</hi><hi rend="italic">Hort.</hi><hi

                    Orchard,</hi> p. 268. Fruit rather large, roundish oval, pale yellow on the
                    shaded side, and of a fine glaucous light purple on the exposed side; of
                    excellent quality, scarcely inferior to the green gage. The tree is vigorous,
                    and bears well against a wall, ripening about the middle of August. Being an
                    early plum, it will, in favourable situations, succeed as a standard. It is, as
                    the name imports, of American origin. It ought to be in every collection.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Couper’</hi><hi rend="italic">'s</hi><hi rend="italic">Large
                    Red.</hi> This is described by Mr Barnet of the Experimental Garden, Edinburgh,
                    as of large size, oval; suture deeply cleft on one side; skin of a
                    bluish-glaucous purple on the exposed side, the other side dull red; flesh firm,
                    adhering to the stone; ripens in the beginning of September on a south wall (in
                    Scotland). Although <pb break="no" facs="nls:193647480"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0711-7480-0645"/>this is only a plum of the second quality, yet the
                    tree well merits a place, on account of its great productiveness.</p>
                <p>The following are also first-rate plums: D’Agen, Coe’s Late Red, Downton
                    Imperatrice, Kirke’s, Nectarine, Blue Perdrigon, and White Perdrigon.</p>
                <p>The Cheston, Fotheringham, Goliath, Orleans, Wilmot’s New Orleans, La Royale,
                    Sharpe’s Emperor, Morocco, and some of the Damasks, though generally regarded as
                    only second-rate plums, deserve notice, and should always have a place in large
                    gardens. The Early Violet is an excellent bearer, and strongly recommended by
                    Lindley to be planted in cottage gardens. Lucomb’s Nonsuch plum should not be
                    omitted; for when well ripened, it makes an approach to the green gage in
                    flavour.</p>
                <p>As kitchen and preserving plums we may specify the Damson, Shropshire Damson,
                    Imperial Diadem, Isabella, White Magnum Bonum, Red Magnum Bonum or Imperiale;
                    the Caledonia or Nectarine Plum, a large and handsome fruit; the Mirabelle, St
                    Catherine, Wine Sour, and Bullace.</p>
                <p>The finer dessert plums are propagated chiefly by budding on Muscle or St Julian
                    stocks. They are sometimes grafted, but gum is apt to break out at the place of
                    junction. The damson, wine sour, and other varieties, planted as standards, are
                    generally increased by suckers, which the old plants afford plentifully. For
                    placing against walls, trees which have been trained for two years in the
                    nursery are to be preferred.</p>
                <p>Plum-trees require ample space. On common walls they should be allowed from
                    twenty to twenty-five feet of breadth over which to extend themselves. The
                    horizontal mode of training is adopted by many. The fan form is also very
                    commonly followed, and undoubtedly where there is room, it is the best. The
                    shoots ought to be laid in at full length. The fruit is produced on small spurs,
                    on branches at least two years old. The same spurs continue fruitful for several
                    years.</p>
                <p>Standard plum-trees require only to have a portion of their wood thinned out
                    occasionally while they are young. The hardy kinds grown in this way are very
                    productive, and in some places in the North of England, their produce forms a
                    considerable article of food for several weeks, and also an article of commerce,
                    particularly the wine sour, which is in great request for preserves. It is
                    matter of regret that this branch of fruit culture has not, as yet, met with due
                    attention in Scotland.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="smallcaps">Cherry-Tree</hi><hi rend="italic">(Prunus Cerasus),</hi>
                    is said to have been introduced into Europe from Pontus, by the celebrated
                    Lucullus, A. C. 73. From the “London cries” of Lydgate, it appears that
                    “cherries in the ryse,” or in twigs, were hawked in London at the beginning of
                    the 15th century. Excellent sorts have at various times been introduced from the
                    Continent, and, of late years, several first-rate new varieties have been raised
                    in England. Geans included, the Horticultural Society’s Catalogue enumerates no
                    fewer than 219 varieties; the following may be accounted some of the best.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Early</hi><hi rend="italic">Purple Griotte</hi> may be
                    first mentioned, as being tfιe earliest of all cherries, generally ripening in
                    the end of May. It was introduced from Geneva a few years ago, and is not yet
                    generally known in this country.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">May-Duke</hi> is one of the most common, and, at the same
                    time, one of the most valuable cherries. In fine seasons, and on a good aspect
                    of wall, it begins to colour in May; and in such situations it is generally ripe
                    from the middle to the. end of June. The tree also bears well as a dwarf
                    standard, but against a wall the fruit gets larger, and does not fall off in
                    flavour.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Late Duke</hi> is a rich sweet cherry, with most of the
                    qualities of a May-Duke. It has a very close affinity to the variety called the
                    Arch-Duke, if it be not absolutely the same. On a standard it ripens in August
                    <hi rend="italic">Bigarreau</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Graffion.</hi> This is an
                    excellent fruit, especially when it gets the protection of a wall. In Kensington
                    Gardens are trees of this sort a century old, which still produce abundant
                    crops. In the cherry orchards of England, this sort is now pretty extensively
                    cultivated, the fruit meeting with a ready sale, and vast quantities being
                    required for the London market.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Harrison’s Heart</hi> is nearly allied to the Bigarreau; it is
                    rather of larger size and of fine appearance in the dessert, but inferior in
                    flavour. The fruit has this advantage, that it is not liable to crack in wet
                    weather.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Belle de Clioisy,</hi> an excellent cherry. The fruit come in
                    pairs, red, mottled with amber colour, tender and sweet. The tree bears well as
                    a standard.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Black Tartarian,</hi> or Ronalds’s Black Heart, <hi

                    <hi rend="italic">;</hi><hi rend="italic">Lind.p.</hi> 149- Fruit large, obtuse
                    heart-shaped; flesh half tender. “The quality is good, and in appearance it is
                    one of the finest.” It is a good bearer, and well adapted for forcing.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Waterloo.</hi> Raised by a daughter of Mr Knight, from the
                    Bigarreau and May-Duke. Fruit black, large, obtuse heart-shaped, pulp tender. It
                    ripens in July, and the tree is a free bearer.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Elton.</hi> Raised by Mr Knight from the Bigarreau and White
                    Heart. Fruit large, heart-shaped, pale red, with a sweet delicious juice. The
                    tree is a good bearer and hardy; the fruit ripens shortly after the
                    May-Duke.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Kentish Cherry.</hi> One of the oldest and most prevalent
                    cherries in England, abounding in the orchards of Kent. When ripe, it is of a
                    full red colour, and its subacid flavour is very agreeable. It is commonly grown
                    on standards, and ripens in the end of July. The <hi rend="italic">Hort.</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Cat.</hi> distinguishes this from the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Flemish</hi> or short-stalked, also a good cherry, to which it is certainly
                    closely allied.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Morello.</hi> This is a well-known late cherry, much in
                    request for confectionery. The tree is a copious bearer, and on a south wall the
                    fruit acquires a peculiarly rich subacid flavour. It succeeds perfectly well on
                    a north aspect, where its fruit may be retarded to the end of October.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Amber,</hi> or yellow Spanish, is a late fruit, and useful
                    in prolonging the cherry season till the beginning of September. It requires a
                    west wall.</p>
                <p>Among other excellent varieties may be mentioned the Black Eagle, Black Heart,
                    Bowyer’s Early Heart, Carnation, Downton, Florence, Knight’s Early Black, and
                    the White Heart.</p>
                <p>What are called <hi rend="italic">geans</hi> or <hi rend="italic">guignes,</hi>
                    are cherries less removed from their natural state. They are usually grown as
                    standards, and bear abundantly, particularly when old. The principal sorts are
                    the Amber gean, a plentiful bearer, with sweet tender fruit; and the Lundie
                    gean, a small black cherry of high flavour, which originated at the ancient seat
                    of the Erskines in Forfarshire, but is also sometimes called the Polton gean,
                    from a place near Lasswade in Mid-Lothian.</p>
                <p>It may be noticed that, in the Jardin des Plantes at Paris, the black-fruited
                    cherry-tree, or <hi rend="italic">Guignier,</hi> is considered as a variety of
                    Prunus Cerasus. The forest cherry-tree, P. avium, is named <hi rend="italic"
                    >Merisier;</hi> and, besides varieties with red and with black fruit, there is a
                    marked variety called <hi rend="italic">Bi-garotier.</hi></p>
                <p>The great quantities of pale-coloured cherries yearly sold in the London market
                    are chiefly of the kinds called White Heart and Bigarreau, The dark coloured
                    cherries are chiefly the Courone, which is often passed upon buyers for the
                    Black Heart.</p>
                <p>The stock preferred for cherries is the wild gean. Mr Lindley recommends that
                    dwarf cherry-trees should be grafted, and two or three year-old stocks wall do
                    for them.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:193647493" xml:id="kp-eb0711-7493-0646"/>
                <p>For standard trees the stocks should be at least four years old, and they should
                    be budded or grafted five or six feet from the ground. High stemmed
                    cherry-trees, or <hi rend="italic">riders,</hi> are often temporarily employed
                    to fill up the vacant spaces on newly planted south walls, till the dwarf trees
                    make sufficient progress; for these, stocks six or seven feet high are
                    required.</p>
                <p>Cherries are generally produced on small spurs which appear on the wood of the
                    second year, and these spurs continue productive for an indefinite period. Any
                    form of training may therefore be adopted; but, as the fruit is always finest on
                    young spurs, perhaps fan-training, which admits of the frequent renovation of
                    the bearing branches, is the most advantageous. A succession of young shoots
                    should be laid in every year. For the Morello, which is of twiggy growth, and
                    bears on the young wood, the fan form is absolutely necessary. Whatever method
                    be adopted for general practice, care should be taken not to crowd the branches;
                    nothing is more injurious to the productiveness of the trees than crowding of
                    branches.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="smallcaps">Pear Tree</hi><hi rend="italic">(Pyrus communis)</hi>
                    is. considered by botanists as a native of England. Many cultivated varieties
                    seem to have been introduced by the monks; remains of perry orchards attached to
                    monasteries of the 14th and 15th centuries being not uncommon even in Scotland;
                    and very ancient trees of the finer dessert pears, such as the Colmar and
                    Longueville, occasionally occurring.</p>
                <p>The list of cultivated pears amounts to more than 600 names; but the number of
                    those truly desirable is not large. We shall specify some of the best dessert
                    fruit, following the usual division of Early and Late; the former class being in
                    season in the months of August, September and October, and the latter in
                    November, December, and January. It is to be premised, however, that even within
                    the limits of Britain, climate makes an important difference in the culture and
                    ripening of pears, of which a remarkable and extreme example may be seen in the
                    Chaumontelle,—a fruit which is produced abundantly, and ripened on standards in
                    the west of England, and in the environs of London, while it requires a south
                    wall near Edinburgh,</p>

                    July, acquiring a yellowish green colour; it is sweet, but without much flavour.
                    One tree, or at most two trees, may suffice, It requires a sheltered
                    situation.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Green Chisel,</hi> called also the Hastings, and, in the
                    market, the Green Sugar. This is not a first-rate pear; but the tree is hardy
                    and a great bearer. It ripens in August.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Summer Rose.</hi> A handsome round pear, of a russety red
                    colour, much resembling an apple, flesh white, rich, and sugary. This is an
                    excellent variety, succeeds ο» a standard, and ripens in August.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Jargonelle</hi> of Britain is the <hi rend="italic">Grosse
                    Cuisse Madame</hi> of French horticultural writers, and the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Epargne</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Beau-present</hi> of French practical
                    gardeners. This is the most common and most esteemed of our early autumn pears.
                    Against a wall the fruit attains a large size and a beautiful appearance; but it
                    is not of so high a flavour as from standards or espalier-rails. The fruit does
                    not keep well, and the tree should therefore be planted in various situations to
                    prolong its season, as it is rather difficult, when it disappears, immediately
                    to supply its place. Beautiful dwarf tr <hi rend="subscript"> t</hi> ecs may be
                    formed by grafting on the common white them, which, however, are not very
                    patient of transplanting. The French jargonelle is green on one side and red on
                    the other, and is a fruit of inferior quality.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Ananas d</hi> ’ <hi rend="italic">Ete</hi> is scarcely
                    noticed by our horticultural writers; but it seems a good variety to succeed the
                    jargonelle. In the Experimental Garden at Edinburgh, it ripens on a standard in
                    the second week of September. Mr Barnet describes it as of middle size, about
                    two and a half inches broad, tapering a little towards the stalk, round at the
                    top, eye small, slightly sunk in a cavity; red on the exposed side, green and
                    somewhat russety on the other; flesh white, melting, with a pleasant sweet
                    juice.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Summer Erancréal,</hi> or the <hi rend="italic">Yat</hi> of
                    Holland, may be noticed as another pear to follow the jargonelle, as it ripens
                    about the middle of September. The tree proves, in general, a great bearer.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Longueville.</hi> Some very ancient trees of this variety
                    exist at Jedburgh: and, in the garden of the Regent Murray at Edinburgh, there
                    are several which apparently arc coeval with the times of the Regency. Though
                    the name is now unknown in France, it is conjectured that the tree was brought
                    over from that country by the Douglas, when Lord of Longueville, in the
                    fifteenth century. The fruit is large, of a thick conical shape, green, and of
                    considerable flavour. It ripens in September.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Green Pear of Yair.</hi> This variety is of Scottish
                    origin. The fruit is obovate, green, and of a middle size; flesh juiey and
                    well-flavoured. It is sometimes placed on a wall to succeed the jargonelle; but
                    it is always better from standards. On old trees, in light soils, it sometimes
                    acquires a lemon colour, with a high musky flavour. Ripens in September and
                    October.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Duhamel</hi> is a good autumn pear, with a delicate
                    flavour. It comes in immediately after the green yair, and helps to fill up a
                    gap in the pear season, especially in Scotland,</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Seckle,</hi> of American origin, deserves a place; for the
                    tree is of dwarfish size, and suited for a border standard, and it seldom fails
                    to yield a crop. The fruit is small, but melting and well-flavoured. It does not
                    keep.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">White</hi><hi rend="italic">Doyenné,</hi> This is an
                    excellent sort, when used at its perfection. In warm situations, it is well
                    adapted for dwarf standards. Ripens in September and October.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Red Doyenne,</hi> or, as it is sometimes called, Gray
                    Doyenne, is also an excellent autumn pear, doing best on a quince stock.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Elton.</hi> Capital as a standard, and strongly recommended
                    by Mr Knight. The tree produces healthy wood, and the fruit ripens in September
                    and October.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Early Bergamot</hi> was introduced from France in 1820. It
                    is one of the very best early pears, as the tree bears freely on an open
                    standard.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Autumn Bergamot,</hi> or English Bergamot, has been long
                    known as one of the most highly flavoured pears. It is not the Bergamotte
                    d’Automne of the French, which is liable to canker in this country, while the
                    English bergamot is not liable. In England the tree succeeds perfectly well as a
                    standard; in Scotland, it answers in good seasons, but here it is deserving of a
                    west wall. The fruit is of a depressed globular shape, not large; the flesh
                    juicy, sugary and rich, a little gritty next the core. It ripens towards the end
                    of October, but does not keep.</p>
                <p>To the list of summer and early autumn pears might be added the Musk Robine,
                    Summer Bonchretien, and Williams’s Bonchretien, requiring the protection of a
                    wall; and the Lammas Pear of Scotland, “soon ripe, soon rotten,” which succeeds
                    perfectly well on open standards; Ambrosia, Belle et Bonne, Beurré d’Amalis,
                    Bishop’s Thumb, Caillot Rosat, and the Hazel Pear.</p>

                    Against a wall with a good aspect, and with a fresh soil, the tree is an
                    abundant bearer. Ripens in October and November.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Beurré</hi><hi rend="italic">de Capiaumont.</hi> This is
                    one of the best new Flemish varieties. The fruit is beautiful and
                    well-flavoured. It ripens in October and November. The tree is a great bearer
                    and hardy.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Moorfowl Egg.</hi> There are two varieties, both of
                    Scottish origin, of which the Galston Moor-fowl Egg is the best. The fruit is
                    not attractive in appearance, but it is of admirable quality. The tree is hardy,
                    and should be grown as a standard.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Gansel’s Bergamot</hi> (sometimes called Brocas’ Bergamot).
                    This noble pear, which has scarcely been rivalled, certainly not surpassed, by
                    any of the imported varieties, is of English origin. Its blossoms are too tender
                    to enable the tree to succeed as a standard; but it deserves a wall, and it
                    should be placed on various aspects to prolong its season. The fruit ripens in
                    November and December.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Marie Louise.</hi> This excellent and large pear was raised
                    by the Abbé Duquesne, and named after the Ex-Empress of France. “It is,” says Mr
                    Thompson, “one of the very finest, even as a standard, on which it bears
                    abundantly; it succeeds also well on a north wall.” In Scotland it is the better
                    for an east or west aspect; but on a standard in a sheltered garden at Luffness,
                    East Lothian, the fruit has attained the weight of 15 ounces. It ripens in
                    October and November.</p>

                    was first brought into notice and recommended by the Caledonian Horticultural
                    Society’s deputation in 1817 <hi rend="italic">(Hort.</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Tour.</hi> p. 321). It is perfectly melting and without grittiness, and rich,
                    sweet, and high-flavoured. The tree succeeds either trained against an east or a
                    west wall, or as a standard in any sheltered situation.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Crasanne.</hi> An old French sort, of excellent quality, with a
                    tender and finely flavoured pulp. The tree deserves an east or west aspect on
                    the wall, and it succeeds also on an espalier-rail. The fruit ripens in November
                    and December.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Urbaniste</hi> is a very good variety, of a large size, and
                    ovoglobular shape; skin of yellowish colour, with small russety spots; flesh
                    white, melting, with a sweet well-flavoured juice. In Scotland ripens against a
                    south wall by the beginning of November.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Colmar.</hi> This is a first-rate pear, with a white flesh, and
                    of high flavour. In Scotland the tree requires a south wall. From this the Poire
                    d’Auch of the Continent seems scarcely to differ. It keeps till February or
                    March.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Passe Colmar.</hi> An admirable Flemish variety lately
                    introduced into this country; of excellent flavour; hardier, and a more abundant
                    bearer than the preceding, and more easily ripened. It is in maturity in
                    December and January.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Poire Neill</hi> was raised by Μ. Van Mons of Louvain, about
                    the time of the visit of the Caledonian Horticultural Society’s deputation to
                    Belgium (in 1817)∙ It is a large handsome fruit, with a very white pulp, mellow,
                    and abounding with a saccharine and slightly musky juice. It is in season during
                    the month of October, and should be gathered a few days before it be ripe. The
                    tree succeeds as a standard at Edinburgh, and bears freely.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Easter</hi><hi rend="italic">Beurré.</hi> Fruit large,
                    obovate, green and brown; flesh whitish-yellow, buttery, and extremely
                    high-flavoured. “It is,” says Mr Thompson, “hardy and a good bearer; one of the
                    most valuable Spring sorts, compared with which the early pears of short
                    duration deserve not a wall; its extensive cultivation for a long and late
                    supply is, without hesitation, strongly recommended.” In season from January to
                    March. As the tree ripens its wood readily, it succeeds as a standard, even in
                    Scotland, and yields fruit superior in flavour to that from -the walls.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Beurré</hi><hi rend="italic">Bance.</hi> A Flemish variety

                <p>The following, respecting which our limits will not permit us to go into detail,
                    may be considered as highly valuable sorts as late autumnal and winter pears
                    :—Autumn Colmar, Aston-town, Echassery, Delices d’Hardenpont, Beurré Bose,
                    Beurré Diel, Beurré Spence, Bezi Vaet, Bezi de la Motte, Chaumontelle, Sylvange,
                    Downton, Glout Morceau, St Germain, Duchesse d’Angoulême, Louise bonne, Hacon’s
                    Incomparable, Winter Nelis, Black Auchan, Swan Egg, Doyenné gris, Flemish
                    Beauty, and Napoleon.</p>
                <p>Some excellent new varieties of dessert pears have, of late years, been raised by
                    Mr Taylor, gardener at Dunmore Park, under the directions of the noble
                    proprietor, who is a scientific horticulturist. These have not yet been
                    described or published; but the Dunmore Brown Beurré and Taylor’s Seedling have
                    been found to be of the first quality.</p>
                <p>Of the <hi rend="italic">Kitchen Sorts,</hi> or stewing pears, we may name the
                    Bellisime d’Hiver, Catillac, Uvedale’s St Germain, Warden or Black Worcester,
                    and the Gilogil. These are placed on inferior walls, or upon espalier-rails, or
                    kept as dwarf standards. The Uvedale’s St Germain fruit often attains <hi
                    rend="italic">a</hi> large size, especially against a wall.</p>
                <p>Pear-trees are grafted either on what are called free-stocks or on dwarfing
                    stocks: for the former, which are intended for full-sized trees, the seeds of
                    the wilding pear should be sown; but frequently the pips of the perry pears, and
                    sometimes of the common cultivated sorts, are used. For dwarfing, the quince is
                    preferred; but the white-thorn, as already mentioned, is occasionally employed.
                    Where the space is limited, or the ground is damp, the dwarfing stocks are the
                    more suitable. It is a favourite doctrine with some, that by budding or grafting
                    on quince or hawthorn, pears of too melting and sugary a quality acquire
                    firmness and acidity; to what extent this holds good has not been correctly
                    ascertained, but that the stock exerts a certain degree of influence on the
                    fruit is beyond dispute. Some of the finer pears do not take readily on the
                    quince. In this case double working is resorted to. For example, the Virgouleuse
                    may be easily budded on the quince, and the Beurré d’ Aremberg will afterwards
                    succeed freely on the Virgouleuse. It may be mentioned in passing, that the
                    ancient horticulturists seem to have supposed that a fruit was improved by
                    double working; and that the term <hi rend="italic">reinette,</hi> a name
                    applied to a class of apples, is considered as having been derived from the
                    Latin <hi rend="italic">renata,</hi> that is, a tree grafted upon itself.</p>
                <p>In selecting young pear-trees, some prefer <hi rend="italic">maiden plants,</hi>
                    that is, plants one year grafted; but if good trees, trained for two or three
                    years, can be procured, so much the better. It is important to ascertain that
                    the stock and stem be clean and healthy, and to take great care that no injury
                    be done by bruising or tearing the roots, in lifting and removing. The young
                    trees may be planted at arty time, in mild ŵesther, from the fall of the leaf to
                    the beginning of March. Wall-trees require from 25 to 30 feet of lineal space
                    when on free stocks, and from 15 to 20 feet when dwarfed. Standards on free
                    stocks in the orchard should be allowed at least 30 feet every way, while for
                    dwarfs 15 feet may suffice. Where the trees are trained <hi rend="italic">en
                    pyramide</hi> or <hi rend="italic">en quenouille,</hi> (see p. 637) they inay
                    stand within eight feet of each other. It is very desirable that the pear
                    orchard should be in a warm situation, with a soil deep, substantial, and well
                    drained, or free from injurious latent moisture. Without attention to these
                    circumstances, peartrees seldom succeed.</p>

                <p>The fruit is produced on spurs, which appear on shoots more than one year old;
                    the object of the pruner, therefore, ought to be to procure a fair supply of
                    these spurs. The mode of training wall pear-trees most commonly adopted is the
                    horizontal; but each of the forms already mentioned (p. 638), has its
                    advantages, and is peculiarly adapted to some particular habit of growth in the
                    several varieties. For the St Germain, and other twiggy sorts, we should prefer
                    the fan form; for the Gansel’s Bergamot, and other strong growers, the half-fan,
                    or the horizontal. In the latter forms the trees may often be found fifteen,
                    twenty, or even thirty years old, during which time they acquire an undue
                    projection from the wall, and become scraggy and unmanageable. On the other
                    hand, the finest fruit is produced on young spurs, clearly indicating the
                    necessity of a frequent renovation of the spurs. This would lead us to prefer
                    the fan-form, not, indeed, that which is commonly practised, and represented in
                    fig. 5. p. 638, for in it the spurs are as immovable as in any other
                    arrangement; but rather that recommended for peaches, in which there is a
                    continual renewal of the branches. Or if we did adopt the horizontal form, which
                    has certain advantages, it would be that modification exhibited in the right
                    side of fig. 4. <hi rend="italic">a,</hi> p. 638. This is the method followed by
                    Harrison in treating the Jargonelle.</p>
                <p>The summer pruning of established wall or espalier-rail trees, consists chiefly
                    in the timely displacing or rubbing off of the superfluous shoots, retaining
                    only those which are terminal, or well placed for lateral branches. Where spurs
                    are wanted on the older wood, about two inches of a fore-right shoot are left;
                    and if this be done early, that is before the shoot has become ligneous, it
                    seldom fails to form fruit-buds. In horizontal training, the winter pruning is
                    nothing more than adjusting the leading shoots, and thinning out the spurs,
                    which should be kept close to the wall, and allowed to retain only two, or at
                    most three buds. In fan-training, the subordinate branches must be regulated,
                    the spurs thinned out, and the young laterals, which were loosely nailed in,
                    during summer, must be finally established in their places. No crowding of
                    branches should be permitted. Where horizontal trees have fallen into disorder,
                    they may be renovated in the manner represented by fig. 466, left side, a
                    procedure patronized by Mr Knight: or all the branches may be cut back to within
                    nine inches of the vertical stem and branch, and trained in afresh, as
                    recommended by Mr Lindley.</p>
                <p>When some of the finer pear-trees produce an abundance of blossom, but do not <hi
                    rend="italic">set</hi> well, as not unfrequently happens, artificial
                    impregnation may be partially resorted to; that is, the blossom of some other
                    kind of pear, plentifully provided with pollen, is taken, and the farina is
                    dusted over the best looking blossoms of the unproductive tree.</p>
                <p>Summer and autumn pears should be gathered before they be fully ripe, otherwise
                    they will not in general keep more than a few days. The Jargonelle, as Forsyth
                    rightly advises, should be allowed to remain on the tree, and pulled daily as
                    wanted, the standard fruit thus succeeding the produce of the wall trees. In
                    reference to the Crasanne, Mr Lindley recommends gathering the crop at three
                    different times, the first a fortnight or more before it be ripe, the second a
                    week or ten days after, and the third when fully ripe. The first gathering will
                    come into eating latest, and thus the season of the fruit may be considerably
                    prolonged. It is evident that the same method may be followed with the Brown
                    Beurré, Gansel’s Bergamot, and any other which continue only a short time in a
                    mature state.</p>
                <p>The APPLE-Tree <hi rend="italic">(Pyrus</hi><hi rend="italic">Malus),</hi> under
                    the name of the Crab, is a native of Britain. Most of the cultivated sorts,
                    however, are of foreign origin, and it does not seem probable, that we possess
                    at present any good variety which is more than two hundred years old. The finer,
                    high-flavoured apples are prized for the dessert; the juicy and poignant sorts
                    are in request for tarts and sauce; whilst those of a more austere nature are
                    manufactured into cider. In the second edition of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >London</hi><hi rend="italic">Hort.</hi><hi rend="italic">Society’s
                    Catalogue,</hi> no fewer than 1400 varieties are enumerated ∙ many of them
                    doubtless not well ascertained, but about 175 are pronounced to be first-rate
                    sorts. With such a multitude before us, it would be vain to attempt detailed
                    descriptions: we shall therefore do little more than give a classified list of
                    those most worthy of attention, referring the reader for further information to
                    the Catalogue itself, to Mr Lindley’s <hi rend="italic">Guide to the Orchard and
                    Kitchen Garden,</hi> and to Mr Rogers’ <hi rend="italic">Fruit
                    Cultivator.</hi><hi rend="italic">Table Apples.</hi></p>
                <p>The earliest of these are the following :—The Juneating, or White Geniton, which
                    begins to ripen in the end of July, and, being sugary and slightly perfumed,
                    forms a welcome addition to the dessert. The Early Red Margaret is often
                    cultivated; it is sometimes called Red Juneating, and in Ireland Peach Apple.
                    The Summer Crofton, or WTiite Crofton, is of Irish origin: the tree bears
                    abundantly; and if the fruit be scarcely equal to the Juneatings for the
                    dessert, it is very desirable for culinary purposes in August. The Thorle,
                    originating in the Carse of Gowrie, is an early apple of considerable merit,
                    although not mentioned by Mr Lindley. The Oslin or Arbroath Pippin, and the
                    Early Julien of Clydesdale, also deserve notice. The Summer Golden Pippin, the
                    Red Quarenden of Devonshire, and the Summer Calville, are likewise excellent
                    early dessert apples.</p>
                <p>To succeed these in the autumn we have many fine sorts, such as the Early
                    Nonpareil or Hick’s Fancy; the Red Ingestrie and Yellow Ingestrie, raised by Mr
                    Knight; the Doonside, a capital Ayrshire production; Autumn Pearmain or Royal
                    Pearmain of the London nurseries; Shepherd’s Fame; Baird’s Favourite; Pomme de
                    Niege; and Bourassa; Franklin’s Golden Pippin; Old Golden Pippin; King of the
                    Pippins or Hampshire Yellow; Please Lady; Kerry Pippin, one of the finest Irish
                    apples; and the Cole Apple or Scarlet Perfumed.</p>
                <p>The winter dessert apples are very numerous, so that only a few can be mentioned.
                    The Ribston Pippin has long maintained a pre-eminent character for its rich
                    juiciness and highly aromatic flavour. If the tree be trained to a wall, the
                    fruit is much improved in size and beauty; but Mr Rogers, in his <hi
                    rend="italic">Fruit Cultivator,</hi> is decidedly wrong in thinking that it is
                    heightened in flavour; for, on the contrary, the flavour is deteriorated. The
                    Ribston is an old variety; and there is reason to fear that, like the Grey
                    Leadington (formerly the boast of Scottish orchards), it is verging to decay and
                    extinction. Hubbard’s Pearmain is a Norfolk apple of the very finest quality,
                    and too little known, especially in Scotland; the tree does not grow large, is
                    quite hardy, and an abundant bearer, either as a standard, or when trained to an
                    espalier-rail. The Dutch Mignonne is another admirable dessert apple, too little
                    known or attended to. The Golden Harvey, or Brandy Apple of Forsyth, is a
                    beautiful fruit, and Mr Lindley characterizes it as rich, juicy, spicy, and
                    high-flavoured: the tree is not a large grower, is very hardy, and a great and
                    constant bearer; and no garden, adds Mr Lindley, “capable of containing ten
                    trees, ought to be without one of it.” The Downton Pippin, raised by Mr Knight
                    from the orange pippin of Herefordshire, dusted with the pollen of the old
                    golden pippin, must not be omitted. The tree is a great bearer; the fruit ripens
                    in the end of October and keeps till January; it has a brisk, subacid juice,
                    which becomes saccharine. The fruit should not be gathered until it <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193647532" xml:id="kp-eb0711-7532-0649"/> has acquired a
                    bright yellow colour, and part freely from the tree. To these may be added the
                    Beachamwell Seedling; Borsdorffer; Court of Wick Pippin; Wood’s Transparent;
                    Margil; Newton Pippin; Scarlet Crofton; Golden Pearmain; Scarlet Pear main;
                    Gravenstein; Paradise Pippin; Old Nonpareil; Ross Nonpareil; Scarlet Nonpareil;
                    Golden Rennet; Reinette de Canada; Sykehouse Russet; and the Sam Young, an
                    excellent Irish apple, brought into notice by Mr Robertson of Kilkenny.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Kitchen Apples.</hi></p>
                <p>These are very numerous, and the names of a few of the best can only be given. We
                    begin with the Scottish Hawthornden; though the tree is liable to canker, yet it
                    comes early into bearing, and the fruit is excellent. The Codlins may be next
                    named, particularly the Spring Grove, the Kentish or Fillbasket, the Keswick,
                    the Dutch, and the Manks. Dumelow’s Seedling, the Fulwood, the Green Fulwood of
                    Mr Mathew, the Nonsuch, Minshul Crab, Hanwell Souring, Cat’s-head, Alexander,
                    Brabant Bellefleur, Blenheim Pippin, Hunt-house of Yorkshire, Norfolk Beaufin,
                    and Forman’s Crewe, are all good. Among the best long-keeping apples are the
                    Scottish Gogar Pippin or Stone Pippin; and the Yorkshire Greening and Northern
                    Greening, particularly the latter; Winter Strawberry Apple; Winter Lud;
                    Cambusnethan Pippin; Tower of Glammis; the Alderstone Pippin of East-Lothian,
                    and the Lady Wemyss of Fifeshire. An apple called the French Crab (but which is
                    of considerable size, notwrthstanding this name), keeps firm in pulp till the
                    return of the apple season; and the subvariety of this, called Hambledon’s, is
                    described in Ronalds’ Pomona as still superior.</p>
                <p>Some excellent new varieties of apples have of late years been produced both in
                    England and Scotland. Mr I lardy of Bothkennar, by crossing the Court of Wick
                    Pippin with the Nonpareil, has raised seedlings partaking of the good qualities
                    of both parents, and these have received the warmest approval of the Scottish
                    Horticultural Society.</p>
                <p>It may be mentioned, that information respecting the fruits cultivated for the
                    manufacture of cider and perry, may be obtained in the Pomona Herefordiensis,
                    published by Mr Knight, and illustrated with engravings by the late Mr W.
                    Hooker. Cider is principally made in Herefordshire and Gloucestershire, which
                    are called the cider counties; but much is also produced in Devonshire. For the
                    encouragement of its manufacture in Scotland, premiums have been offered by the
                    Caledonian Horticultural Society, but little good Scottish cider has hitherto
                    appeared.</p>
                <p>Several kinds of stocks are used for apple-trees. The Dutch <hi rend="italic"
                    >Paradise,</hi> propagated by layers, has long been used as a stock for dwarf
                    apple-trees, whether intended for the wall or for standards. The <hi
                    rend="italic">Doucin</hi> of the French seems closely allied to this, if not
                    identical with it. The bur-knot varieties increased by cuttings, or young codlin
                    plants procured from layers, furnish stocks for the trees from which it is
                    desired to raise new seedlings. For common purposes, the stocks raised from the
                    pips of crabs or of cider apples arc preferred. Stocks kept one or two years in
                    nursery lines arc fit for grafting upon; but if a considerably tall stem is
                    wished, they must remain three or four years in the nursery, or till they attain
                    five or six feet of height. In the Dutch nurseries, where apple-trees are
                    trained for some years to the cup-shape, the table, the pyramidal, or the round
                    forms, before they are sold to the public, the trees are repeatedly
                    transplanted; but with us, where such forms are less sought after, the utility
                    of more transplantations than from the seed-bed to the nursery lines, and thence
                    to the garden, may, in Mr Knight’s opinion, be questioned. Any common soil,
                    provided the subsoil be dry, suits the apple-tree. Shallow planting should in
                    all cases be practised.</p>
                <p>The fruit, as in the pear-tree, is produced on Spurs, which come out on the
                    branchlets of two or more years growth, and continue fertile for a series of
                    years. There is, therefore, no material difference in the pruning and training
                    of the pear and of the apple tree. On walls, the horizontal mode of training is
                    commonly followed, as best calculated to repress the vigorous growth of the
                    tree; but for the nonpareil, and other twiggy varieties, perhaps the fan-form,
                    or some modification of the fan-form, is preferable. For standards, where the
                    soil is rich and the growth rapid, all that is necessary in pruning is to thin
                    out the branches, and to prevent their crossing each other. Where there is
                    little luxuriance, and in the case of all dwarfs, it is usefill to shorten the
                    branches occasionally, and to remove useless twigs. Dwarfs on paradise stocks
                    may be treated almost like currant bushes, to the great advantage both of the
                    size and beauty of the fruit. The winter pruning may take place any time from
                    the beginning of November to the end of March. Cankered or diseased wood, and
                    all unfruitful snags or rugged spurs, are then to be neatly cut out.</p>
                <p>If the American blight, or woolly aphis (the <hi rend="italic">Eriosoma Mali</hi>
                    of Leach) make its appearance on a tree, the utmost care should be taken to
                    clean every part of the bark with a hard brush and some searching wash; for,
                    should the insect be left unmolested, it will speedily spread over all the
                    apple-trees in the neighbourhood. Indeed, the pest is so grievous, that the
                    sacrifice of two or three trees is a small price to pay for its removal.</p>
                <p>For the <hi rend="italic">storing of Pears and Apples,</hi> there should be
                    attached to every considerable garden a commodious fruit-room, well ventilated,
                    furnished with fire-places or stoves to exclude frost, and fitted up with a
                    variety of shelves. A northern aspect is the most suitable; and it is also
                    desirable that there should be a dry, cool cellar under it, to be employed in
                    retarding the ripening of some of the fugitive varieties. All the fruit intended
                    for keeping should be plucked with the hand, or with such an implement as the
                    fruit-gatherer invented by Mr Saul of Lancaster. The finer dessert fruits should
                    be laid on shelves made of hard wood, not of fir, and covered with cartridge or
                    writing paper, to prevent their imbibing any taint from the wood. The kitchen
                    fruit may be kept in layers two or three deep, but not in heaps, and should be
                    occasionally examined, when decaying fruit is to be removed. The <hi
                    rend="italic">sweating</hi> of apples and pears, formerly much practised, is now
                    abandoned, as being attended with no useful effects.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="smallcaps">Quince</hi><hi rend="italic">(Pyms</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Cydonia),</hi> allied to the apple, is a native of the south of Germany. It is
                    but little cultivated in Britain. The fruit, which is austere when raw, is used
                    to give flavour and poignancy to stewed or baked apples. The two principal sorts
                    are the Portugal Quince and the Pear Quince, of which the latter is the most
                    productive, while it serves the usual culinary purposes equally well as the
                    other. Quinces may be propagated by layers or cuttings, or by grafting. Two or
                    three trees planted in the slip or orchard, arc in general sufficient. In
                    Scotland, the fruit seldom approaches maturity, unless favoured by a wall.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="smallcaps">Medlar</hi><hi rend="italic">(Mespilus</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Germamea)</hi> is a native of the south of Europe, but has been
                    naturalized in some parts of the south of England. The varieties worth notice
                    are, the Dutch Medlar, with broad leaves; and the Nottingham Medlar, with narrow
                    leaves: of these, the latter is considered the best. The fruit is gathered in
                    November, and kept till it begin to decay, when it is served up in the dessert,
                    and highly relished by some. The treatment recommended for the quince may be
                    applied to the medlar.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="smallcaps">Service-tree</hi><hi rend="italic">(Pyms</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">domestica)</hi> is a native of the <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193647545" xml:id="kp-eb0711-7545-0650"/>mountainous parts of
                    Cornwall, and, though not much cultivated, may here be noticed. The fruit has a
                    peculiar acid flavour, and is used only when thoroughly mellowed by keeping.
                    There is a pear-shaped, and also an appleshaped variety, both of which may be
                    propagated by layers, and still better on seedling plants of their own kind. Two
                    or three trees may have a place in the orchard, or perhaps in a sheltered corner
                    of the lawn. The tree is seldom productive till it have arrived at a goodly age.
                    The fruit is brought to Covent-Garden Market in winter; but it is never seen at
                    Edinburgh. Near Paris, the tree is a good deal cultivated under the name of <hi
                    rend="italic">cormier;</hi> and there are a number of varieties of the service
                    grown in the north of Italy.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="smallcaps">Mulberry</hi><hi rend="italic">(Morus</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">nigra)</hi> is a native of Persia, and in this country requires a
                    warm sheltered situation. The fruit is in request for the dessert during the
                    months of August and September, having a rich aromatic flavour, and a fine
                    subacid juice. Where it is abundant, wine is made from it. In Devonshire, a
                    little of the juice added to full-bodied cider, produces a delicious beverage,
                    called Mulberry Cider, which retains its flavour for many months. The mulberry
                    is propagated from cuttings or layers, but, to expedite the production of fruit,
                    it is useful to march small bearing branches on stocks prepared in flower-pots.
                    Mulberry standard trees succeed only in the southern counties. These require no
                    other training than an occasional thinning out of the branches. They are
                    generally planted on grassy lawns, so that when ripe fruit falls from the higher
                    branches, it can be gathered without having sustained injury. In the middle
                    districts, espalier-rails may be employed, particularly under the reflection of
                    a south wall. In colder situations, the mulberry must be treated as a wall-tree;
                    and it has been recommended that the bearing shoots should be trained
                    perpendicularly downwards. Mr Knight strongly advises the forcing of this fruit
                    in flower-pots, much in the same way as is done with figs. The mulberry as a
                    fruit is little known in Scotland; but a few aged trees exist in old gardens,
                    and, in favourable seasons, afford their fruit.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="smallcaps">Hazel</hi><hi rend="italic">(Corylus Avellana),</hi> one
                    of our indigenous fruits, is the original parent of the Filbert, Cob-nut,
                    Cosford-nut, Frizzled, and other improved varieties. These succeed best on a
                    rich, dry loam, carefully worked, and receiving from time to time a slight
                    manuring. They are generally planted in the slips, but thrive best in a quarter
                    by themselves. The varieties are propagated by layers or suckers; but where
                    there are stocks of the common hazel, the other kinds may be grafted upon them.
                    The Cosford is generally preferred, being thin-shelled and having a kernel of
                    high flavour.</p>
                <p>The neighbourhood of Maidstone in Kent has long been celebrated for the culture
                    of nuts for the London market; and as the best Kentish practice is scarcely
                    known in other parts of Britain, we may enter a little into detail. The young
                    plants are almost always suckers from old bushes, and are planted about ten or
                    twelve feet apart. They are suffered to grow without restraint for about three
                    years, and are then cut down to within a few inches of the ground. They push out
                    five or six shoots; and these in their second year are shortened one-third. A
                    hoop is then placed within the branches, and the shoots are fastened to it at
                    nearly equal distances. In the spring of the fourth year, all the laterals are
                    cut off close by the principal stems, and from these cut places short shoots
                    proceed, on which fruit is expected in the following year. Those which have
                    borne fruit are removed by the knife, and an annual supply of young shoots is
                    thus obtained. The leading shoots are always shortened about two-thirds, and
                    every bearing twig is tipped. In the early spring pruning, a supply of male
                    blossoms is left, and suckers are carefully eradicated. These Kentish
                    nut-plantations somewhat resemble large quarters of gooseberry bushes, few of
                    their trees exceeding six feet in height. The curious reader may be referred,
                    for additional information, to the paper, on this subject by the Rev. Mr
                    Williamson, in the 4th volume of the Transactions of the London Horticultural
                    Society.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="smallcaps">Walnut</hi><hi rend="italic">(Juglans</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">regid)</hi> is a native of Persia, and the south of the Caucasus,
                    and the fruit therefore seldom comes to complete maturity, except in the warmer
                    districts of Britain. Besides the common walnut, there are several varieties
                    cultivated, particularly the Large-fruited or Double Walnut, the Tender-shelled,
                    and the Highflyer, which last is said <hi rend="italic">(Land.</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Hort.</hi><hi rend="italic">Trans,</hi> iv. 517) to be “by far the
                    best walnut grown.” The varieties can be propagated with certainty only by
                    inoculating; but the operation is rather nice, and not unfrequently fails. Mr
                    Knight’s method is described in the London Transactions, vol. iii. p. 133.
                    Plants raised from the seed seldom become productive till they be twenty years
                    old. The fruit is produced at the extremities of the shoots of the preceding
                    year; and therefore in gathering the crop, care should be taken not to injure
                    the young wood. In Kent, the trees are thrashed with rods or poles; but this is
                    a rough, and far from being a commendable, mode of collecting the nuts.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="smallcaps">Chestnut</hi><hi rend="italic">(Castanea</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">vesea),</hi> like the preceding, has long been an inmate of our
                    woods, in which it grows to a great size; but it seldom ripens its fruit in the
                    northern parts of the island. Several varieties, remarkable for their
                    productiveness and early bearing, have of late years risen into notice;
                    particularly Knight’s Prolific, and the New Prolific. These are propagated by
                    grafting upon stocks raised from nuts; and when grafts are taken from bearing
                    wood, fruit may be produced in a couple of years. The tree thrives best on a dry
                    subsoil.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">small fruits.</hi></p>
                <p>The Red, White, and Black Currant, the Gooseberry, the Raspberry, the Strawberry,
                    and Cranberry, are usually cultivated in our gardens, under the title of Small
                    Fruits. Their economical uses in cookery, confectionary, and in the manufacture
                    of home-made wines, attach to them considerable importance, and render a
                    separate, however brief, account of them desirable.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Ribes rubrum,</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">Lin.</hi> includes
                    as its varieties our Red and White <hi rend="smallcaps">Currants.</hi> The
                    principal subvarieties are:</p>
                <p>Common Red, Champagne,</p>
                <p>Red Dutch, Common White,</p>
                <p>Knight’s Sweet Red, Dutch White.</p>
                <p>Red and white currants are readily propagated by cuttings. They succeed in any
                    sort of common garden soil; but seem to thrive best in warm moist situations,
                    where they enjoy an abundance of air. A few plants are sometimes placed against
                    walls, on which they are trained perpendicularly. Currants are sometimes planted
                    in single lines in the borders which separate the plots in the kitchen garden;
                    but it is generally better to confine them to compartments by themselves. In
                    these they are arranged in quincunx order, at six feet between the lines, and
                    six feet in the line. They may be transplanted at any time between the fall of
                    the leaf and the first movement of the sap. They are trained <hi rend="italic"
                    >en buisson,</hi> from single stalks of about a foot in height, care being taken
                    to prevent the main branches from crossing each other. In winter the young

                    on the sides of the branches is shortened down into spurs, from an inch to two
                    inches in length. The leading shoots are left about six inches long. Some
                    careful cultivators reduce the young shoots to about half their length as soon
                    as the fruit begins to colour, an operation which is found to increase the size
                    and improve the flavour of the berries.</p>
                <p>Of <hi rend="italic">Ribes nigrum,</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">Lin.</hi> or black
                    currant, there are several varieties, of which we need mention only the Common
                    Black, and the Black Naples. The latter is the preferable sort. The black
                    currant thrives in a moist, deep soil, and shady situation. Its culture is much
                    the same as that of the other currants, but the young shoots are not spurred.
                    All the pruning necessary is to keep the branches free of each other, and to
                    promote a succession of young wood.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="smallcaps">Gooseberry</hi> —Botanists distinguish two species: <hi
                    rend="italic">Tibes Grossularia,</hi> or rough-fruited gooseberry; and <hi
                    rend="italic">Ribes</hi><hi rend="italic">uva crispi,</hi> or smooth-fruited
                    gooseberry. The gooseberry has always been a favourite fruit in Great Britain,
                    and is said to be produced, in the middle districts, in greater perfection than
                    in any other part of the world. Many very large sorts have originated in
                    Lancashire, where the culture has been carried to a high degree of refinement;
                    but it is to be regretted that <hi rend="italic">weight</hi> seems, absurdly
                    enough, to be regarded, in the prize competitions, as the sole criterion of
                    excellence. Berries of twenty or even twenty-four pennyweights are boasted of;
                    but such are always inferior in flavour. The following are some of those sorts

                <p>Some admirable new varieties have of late years been raised in Scotland,
                    particularly in Perthshire: the Delvine Porcupine and Delvine Ironmonger are not
                    surpassed by the finest of the English productions.</p>
                <p>In forming his collection, the horticulturist should especially select a few
                    early and a few late sorts, and, by properly disposing the bushes in various
                    situations in his garden, he may prolong the fruit season by several weeks. The
                    same object may be further promoted by defending the late sorts from the attacks
                    of wasps, by surrounding the bushes with bunting (the thin stuff of which ships’
                    flags are often made), and by covering up the bushes with mats. This
                    contrivance, however, answers better with currants than with gooseberries.</p>
                <p>The gooseberry-bush affects a loose rich soil, which readily imbibes, but does
                    not retain much moisture. We have seen it succeed perfectly well on little more
                    than pure sand which was free from gravel. It thrives in any common garden soil.
                    Gooseberries, like currants, may be grown in lines or compartments. They are
                    propagated by cuttings, and are transplanted, in open weather, during any of the
                    winter months. They are trained with single stems, from six inches to a foot
                    high; and all suckers, which are apt to spring up from the roots, are carefully
                    removed. Formerly it was the practice in Scotland to spur all the annual wood;
                    but now the black currant system of pruning is more generally and advantageously
                    followed. The ground on which the bushes stand is carefully digged once a-year;
                    and manure, when necessary, is at the same time added. Nothing more is requisite
                    than to keep down weeds, and to prevent the attacks of caterpillars, by picking
                    them off on their first appearance. Gooseberry plants are sometimes trained on
                    walls or espaliers, to accelerate the ripening, or increase the size of the
                    fruit.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="smallcaps">Raspberry</hi><hi rend="italic">(Rubus</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Idaeus)</hi> is, like the preceding small fruits, a native of
                    Great Britain. The principal varieties are:</p>
                <p>Red Antwerp, Common Red,</p>
                <p>Yellow Antwerp, Cornish,</p>
                <p>Barnet, Williams’ Double-bearing.</p>
                <p>Of these, the first two have never been surpassed, and are generally sufficient
                    for all common purposes. Raspberries are propagated from sμekers, which are
                    planted in rows five or six feet apart, and at three feet from each other in the
                    rows. The fruit is produced on small branches which proceed from the shoots of
                    the former year. Every year they throw up a number of shoots from the root,
                    which bear fruit the subsequent year, and then die. In dressing the plants in
                    winter, all the decayed stalks are cut away, and of the young shoots only three
                    or four of the strongest are left, which are shortened about a third. These, as
                    they are too weak to stand of themselves, are sometimes connected together by
                    the points in the manner of arches, and sometimes they are attached to a stake.
                    Perhaps the best support is obtained by fastening the points of the shoots to a
                    slight horizontal rail or bar about four feet high, and placed a foot and a half
                    on the south side of the row s. By this means the bearing shoots are deflected
                    from the perpendicular to the sunny side of the row, and are not shaded by the
                    annual wood. The ground between the rows is well digged in winter, and kept
                    clean. Fresh plantations of raspberries should be made every six or seven,
                    years. The double-bearing varieties, which continue to bear during autumn,
                    require light soils and warm situations. It may be mentioned that the crop of
                    any of the varieties may be retarded by breaking off the points of the bearing
                    shoots at an early period in spring; but, like all other fruits, its flavour is
                    highest when it is allowed to ripen at its natural season.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="smallcaps">Strawberry</hi><hi rend="italic">(Fragaria)</hi> belongs
                    to the same natural family as the raspberry. Amongst the numerous kinds
                    cultivated in our gardens, botanists have distinguished several <hi
                    rend="italic">species,</hi> but as these distinctions imply no difference in
                    culture, and as it is difficult to trace them amid the “sportings” of the
                    hybrids, we shall not pretend to enumerate them. Scarcely any plant more readily
                    slides into seminal varieties; and indeed, till lately, in consequence of the
                    irregular prevalence of local names, their whole nomenclature was a chaos of
                    confusion. At the instance of the Horticultural Society of London, Mr Barnet,
                    now of the Experimental Garden, Edinburgh, undertook a revision of the subject,
                    and, with great acuteness and discrimination, has removed much ambiguity, and,
                    as we hope, has finally settled the names of the existing varieties. His paper,
                    which is well worth the perusal of every student of horticulture, is in the 6th
                    volume of the London Transactions. In the second edition of the Catalogue of the
                    Lond. Horticultural Society no fewer than 112 varieties are enumerated. But the
                    following are sufficient, and an asterisk is prefixed to those most worthy of
                    cultivation in small gardens.</p>

                <p>The strawberry plant is propagated from runners or from seed. When runners are
                    employed, they are sometimes planted in autumn, or rather as soon as they have
                    struck root into the ground. Most commonly, however, they are permitted to
                    remain unseparated from the parent plants till spring; a practice which
                    debilitates the old plants, and prevents the earth between the rows from being
                    stirred. As, upon the whole, spring planting seems preferable, it would perhaps
                    be well to adopt the practice of some gardeners, who are at pains to prick out
                    the offsets, as soon as they are rooted, into beds of rich soil, from which they
                    are transplanted into their proper places early in the spring.</p>
                <p>The desire of new varieties has encouraged the practice of propagating by seed;
                    and Keen, Knevett, and others, have been extremely successful. Mr Knight having
                    observed that the young runners of the alpine strawberry flower and ripen fruit
                    the first year, was led to adopt this mode of reproduction, and has followed it
                    with the happiest success. Early in spring he sows the seed in flower-pots,
                    which are put into a hot-bed; and as soon as the plants have attained a
                    sufficient size, they are transplanted into the open ground. They begin to
                    blossom soon after midsummer, and continue to produce fruit till they be
                    interrupted by frost. Thus Mr Knight is inclined to treat the alpine strawberry
                    as an annual plant. The same practice has been recommended in France by Μ. Morel
                    de Vindé <hi rend="italic">(Cal.</hi><hi rend="italic">Hort.</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Mem.</hi> vol. iii.), but he very properly preserves his plants
                    for three years, sowing every year a successional crop. Mr Keen has applied this
                    method of culture to the wood strawberry, and we doubt not but it might be
                    extended with beneficial effects to the Old Scarlet and others of the less
                    artificial varieties.</p>
                <p>A clayey soil or strong loam is considered as best suited to strawberries. On a
                    sandy or very light soil they seldom succeed; and in close situations, and
                    over-manured ground, most varieties produce little else than leaves. Before
                    planting, the ground is manured and trenched or digged over deeply, and when
                    stiff and compact, is very carefully worked. Keen and others in the
                    neighbourhood of London, grow their strawberries in beds, three rows in each,
                    with an alley between them. The market gardeners of Edinburgh, who, in the
                    culture of this fruit, are perhaps not excelled by any, plant in rows two feet
                    asunder, and from a foot to fifteen inches in the rows. When the weather is dry,
                    the young plants are watered till they be well established. As little fruit is
                    produced the first year, a line of carrots, onions, or other vegetable, is often
                    sown between the rows for one season. In May the runners are cut off, with the
                    view of promoting the swelling of the fruit. During dry weather, careful
                    cultivators water their plants while in flower, and particularly after the fruit
                    is set, and occasionally till it begin to colour. The old practice, from which
                    the fruit derives its name, of putting straw between the rows to prevent the
                    soiling of the fruit, has been recently revived; and where there are lawns, the
                    short cut grass may be employed for the same purpose. As soon as the fruit
                    season is over, the runners are again removed; the straw or grass is taken away,
                    and the ground hoed and raked. In October the runners, the reclining, but <hi
                    rend="italic">not the erect,</hi> leaves are cut away, and the surface of the
                    earth is stirred with a three-pronged fork, great care being taken not to injure
                    the roots. Strawberries may be raised from the same ground for an indefinite
                    space of time, but the plants should be renewed every third or fourth year. In
                    the garden they are generally put in a quarter by themselves, and it should be
                    one fully exposed to the sun and air. The alpine and wood varieties may be
                    placed in situations rather moist and shady, as edgings in the slips, or in rows
                    behind walls and hedges, in which situations they succeed perfectly well, and
                    produce fruit late in the season.</p>
                <p>Strawberries have always been a favourite dessert fruit. They likewise form an
                    excellent preserve; and from their freedom from excess of acid, seem well
                    adapted to the manufacture of native wine. To this purpose they have been only
                    partially employed; but the samples of strawberry wine which we have tasted had
                    more of the vinous flavour, than any other of our home-made wines. The culture
                    of strawberries is the most lucrative part of the employment of the market
                    gardener, at least near large towns. It is not uncommon for him to realize a
                    clear profit of L.30 or L.40, or even more, per acre, of strawberry ground. The
                    greater the diligence and assiduity of the cultivator, the greater will be his
                    returns. It is a common and just remark, that too little labour is, in general,
                    expended upon strawberries, and by the ignorant and unskilful gardener least of
                    all.</p>
                <p>Strawberries are easily forced. The Old Scarlet, Grove End, and Keen’s Seedling,
                    are most suitable for this purpose. They are potted in April, with rich soil,
                    two or three young plants being put into each pot eight or ten inches in
                    diameter. During summer they are kept in a warm situation and encouraged to
                    grow, the flowers and runners being carefully picked off. In the beginning of
                    winter they are sheltered in cold frames, and are afterwards successively placed
                    into hot-beds or forcing-houses, so as to keep up a succession. The air is kept
                    moist, and they are plentifully supplied with water. Where the means are
                    abundant, a moderate supply of fruit may be maintained during the late winter
                    and the spring months.</p>

                    >macrocarporì)</hi> was introduced by the late Sir Joseph Banks, and deserves
                    particular notice, for it is altogether overlooked by Lindley and other
                    horticultural writers. The plant is distinguished by the smoothness of its
                    stems, and the largeness of its fruit. It grows freely, and produces its fruit
                    readily in any damp situation; but where there is a pond, it may be cultivated
                    with the greatest success. On the margin of the pond stakes are driven in, a
                    short way within the water line; boards are so placed against these as to
                    prevent the soil of the cranberry-bed from falling into the water. A layer of
                    small stones is deposited in the bottom, and over these, peat or bog earth,
                    mixed with sand, to the extent of about three or four inches above, and half a
                    foot below the usual surface of the water. Plants of the American cranberry
                    placed on this bed, soon cover the whole surface. There is a variety which is
                    very shy in yielding its fruit, and this should, of course, be avoided. From a
                    bed thirty or forty feet in length by five or six in breadth, a quantity of
                    berries may be procured, sufficient for the supply of a family throughout the
                    year. The fruit is easily preserved in bottles. The native Cranberry <hi

                    >Oxycoccos)</hi> may be treated in the same manner, and in some places is very
                    successfully cultivated. At Culzean Castle, the seat of the Earl of Cassilis, in
                    Ayrshire, the cranberry ground is surrounded by a ditch, the water from which is
                    made to filter through among stones and stakes to the interior, so as to keep
                    the cranberry plants constantly supplied with moisture. In the same garden a
                    second compartment is dedicated to small fruits of this class, having in the
                    centre a rock- <hi rend="superscript"> ι</hi> work planted with Whortle-berries

                <p>THE FORCING GARDEN</p>
                <p>Is only a department, but an important one, of the Fruit Garden. The term <hi
                    rend="italic">forcing</hi> is strictly applicable only to those artificial
                    processes by which vegetation is in a considerable degree accelerated; but in
                    common language it has been applied to all those operations in which glazed
                    frames or houses are concerned, though they may be employed merely in aiding the
                    common progress of nature. For the sake of convenience, we shall adopt the term
                    in its broadest acceptation. After some preliminary observations we shall first
                    speak of the structures, and then of the fruits and vegetables which are
                    cultivated in them.</p>
                <p>The principal object of hot-houses, and other structures of a similar nature, is
                    to produce an artificial temperature and humidity of the atmosphere, which shall
                    resemble, as nearly as possible, the climate in which the fruits or plants
                    naturally grow. A command of heat is obviously a primary requisite. A regulated
                    admission of air, and the presence of a certain degree of moisture, are in the
                    next place necessary. Lastly, without the free access of light, plants become
                    blanched or are destroyed by the moisture which they generate. These, then, are
                    the conditions which limit the form of hot-houses; when these are attained, any
                    form may be adopted which invention can devise, or wealth execute; but every
                    true lover of the art will aim at simplicity, and will deprecate useless
                    expenditure, so often exhibited in this department, as injurious to the
                    character as well as to the progress of horticulture.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Artificial Heat.</hi> Forcing-houses are heated by means of <hi
                    rend="italic">flues</hi> conveying smoke and heated air; by <hi rend="italic"
                    >pipes</hi> conducting steam or hot-water; by so constructing the glazed house
                    as to increase the action of the rays of the sun; and sometimes by the
                    fermentation of vegetable substances.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Flues</hi> are generally constructed of common brick, though
                    occasionally fire-brick is employed in the <hi rend="italic">neck,</hi> or that
                    part of the flue immediately adjoining the furnace. The bricks in the side walls
                    are placed on their edges, and the top covering is of tile an inch and a half in
                    thickness. In districts where sandstone-flag abounds, the covers are often
                    formed of it. Horticultural writers have recommended that flues should be about
                    eighteen inches deep, and of nearly equal breadth; but to obtain the greatest
                    quantity of heat, it clearly appears from the experiments of Mr Stevenson <hi
                    rend="italic">(Cal.</hi><hi rend="italic">Hort.</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Mem.ï.</hi> 143), that, where possible, the breadth should be nearly double the
                    depth. It is advantageous to detach flues as much as possible from the walls of
                    the building which incloses them, in order that the heat may be communicated to
                    the air only. Formerly they were often built, sometimes one above another, with
                    only one side exposed, a practice which, as it occasioned great waste of heat
                    from conduction, has been generally abandoned. When it is necessary to lead one
                    flue above another, or to make it return upon itself, spaces should be left
                    between them, to allow the free emission of caloric from every side.</p>
                <p>With a view to economy of fuel, can-flues and cast-iron cylinders have been
                    proposed, and occasionally adopted, hut their use has not hitherto become
                    general. The arrangement of flues depends upon the nature of the house; it may,
                    however, be remarked generally, that as heated air has a tendency to ascend,
                    they should be placed as near as can be done with convenience to the front of
                    the house, where, of course, the sloping roof is lowest. It is likewise useful
                    to introduce a flue at that part of the structure which is most exposed to any
                    refrigerating influence.</p>
                <p>The furnace is most properly situate behind the house» and is generally covered
                    by a shed. For the most part it is constructed so that the upper part of its
                    arch shall be on a level with the top of the flue; but where a considerable heat
                    is required, as in pine stoves, it is found preferable to sink the furnace, in
                    order to produce <hi rend="italic">a neck</hi> or rise of about a foot and a
                    half in height, which moderates the intensity of the heat on its first entrance,
                    and, by increasing the draught, causes the fire to burn freely. The size of the
                    furnace depends upon the kind of fuel employed. Where coke or charcoal is used,
                    it may be about eighteen inches square; but where small-coal, turf, or peat is
                    to be burned, it should be two feet or even two and a half square, by two feet
                    in height. A large furnace ensures the continuance of the fire, a fact which in
                    practice has received too little attention. To resist the effects of heat, the
                    interior should be lined with fire-brick. The roof should be strongly arched.
                    The door may be about a foot square, and when it is double, as it ought always
                    to be, the outer half should be a little larger than the inner. The grate is of
                    the same breadth as the door, and may extend about two-thirds of the length of
                    the furnace. The ash-pit is equally wide, and from fifteen to eighteen inches
                    deep; it is furnished with a ventilator in the door to regulate the admission of
                    air. In practice the furnace, and especially the ash-pit, should be kept clear
                    of ashes; as by this means, coals of an inferior quality may be burnt with ease.
                    We know an instance in the neighbourhood of Edinburgh, where a number of large
                    furnaces were maintained for several years by the mere refuse of a coal-yard
                    attached to the mansion of a considerable family.</p>
                <p>In Plate CCXC. fig. 1 and 2, are given a longitudinal section and plan of the
                    common garden furnace. It is surrounded by a double wall to prevent the escape
                    of heat.</p>
                <p>Mr Witty has invented a new furnace, which is possessed of valuable qualities. A
                    vertical section of it is given in Plate CCXC. fig. 3. The fuel is supplied by
                    the door at <hi rend="italic">a,</hi> and is pressed down the inclined plane
                    towards the grate <hi rend="italic">c,</hi> by an apparatus placed at the head
                    of it; but this method being complicated, has given way to several
                    modifications, in which the door <hi rend="italic">a</hi> has been found the
                    most useful, the fuel being pressed forward by the common tools used for feeding
                    furnaces: <hi rend="italic">b</hi> is the door for regulating the fuel on the
                    grate <hi rend="italic">c.</hi> In its progress, the whole surface of the coal
                    along the inclined plane is constantly kept in a state of inflammation, the
                    flame having naturally a tendency to burn upwards. In this way the greater part
                    of the fresh coal is carbonised, that is, the gas is separated from it and
                    inflamed, leaving only coke. The strong combustion of the coke at the grate
                    produces heat enough to carbonise the coal, and air enough to inflame the gas.
                    Thiá furnace, therefore, not only consumes the smoke, but effects a considerable
                    saving of fuel.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Steam.</hi> Of late years steam has been applied with success
                    to the production of an artificial climate in glazed houses. It is more genial
                    than fire-heat from flues, being less contaminated, and more equable and pliant
                    in its distribution. In steam hot-houses the plants can scarcely ever be liable
                    to suffer from scorching heat; the air continues pure and untainted, and persons
                    visiting the house are much less liable to be annoyed by the smell of smoke and
                    soot. It is neater in ail its arrangements within doors, and precluding,
                    without, the necessity of more than one furnace, and one chimney top, in a great
                    measure removes the unseemliness of the heaps of coals and ashes with which
                    common furnaces are usually surrounded. In districts where coals are dear, the
                    saving of fuel is an object; and it has been found that seven bushels of coals
                    go as far in keeping up steam heat, as ten bushels do in maintaining an equal
                    temperature in the ordinary way. By merely opening a valve, the house may at any
                    time be effectually <hi rend="italic">steamed,</hi> that is, filled with tłie
                    steam or vapour, and the?</p>

                <p>warm moisture thus applied to the plants, is observed to contribute remarkably to
                    their health and vigour. To counterbalance these advantages, we are not aware of
                    any defects, except such as may arise from the greater complexity of the
                    apparatus, or at least its liability to disrepair and accident.</p>
                <p>Steam is generated in a cast or wrought iron boiler, of an oblong form, furnished
                    with safety-valves, and heated by a smoke-consuming furnace. As in the common
                    steam-engine, the boiler is supplied from a cistern above, and is made to
                    regulate itself by a simple contrivance. In the feed-head is a valve, which is
                    opened by the sinking of a float, which descends in proportion as the water is
                    dissipated in steam; and, being balanced by a weight, whenever a sufficient
                    quantity of water is admitted, rises again, and shuts the valve. As steam may be
                    conveyed, without materially impairing its calorific powers, to the distance of
                    several thousand feet, one boiler is sufficient for heating all the glazed
                    houses which are ever erected together; but a second is generally kept in
                    readmess, to act as an auxiliary in case of accident, or in very severe weather.
                    Steam is conducted from the boiler in a single main pipe, or in two parallel
                    pipes, which, according to Mr Tredgold, may be only one inch in bore. The
                    divarications of the pipes into particular houses are arranged somewhat in the
                    manner of flues, and, indeed, are sometimes placed within these, or on them,
                    when they already exist, as in Plate CCXCIII, fig. 3, below the passage <hi
                    rend="italic">d.</hi> These interior pipes are from three to six inches in
                    diameter, in order to afford a greater radiating surface, and are supplied with
                    sets of valves to admit, regulate, and exclude the heated vapour, according to
                    circumstances.</p>
                <p>The most perfect and extensive examples of steam-apparatus exist at Syon-House,
                    the princely seat of the Duke of Northumberland, near Brentford, and in the
                    nurserygarden of Messrs Loddiges at Hackney. At the latter place, glazed houses,
                    to the extent of almost a thousand feet in length, and forming three sides of a
                    square, are heated solely by steam from one boiler. The boiler is of an oblong
                    shape, measuring eleven feet by four, and is made of mailcable iron. In certain
                    narrow houses, intended by Messrs Loddiges for greenhouse plants, a single
                    steam-pipe is found sufficient. In other houses of considerable height and
                    breadth, or where a higher temperature is required, as in the palm-house, the
                    steam flue is made to describe two or three turns.</p>
                <p>Water, contained in large vessels or pipes, is sometimes heated by steam, and so
                    made the medium of conveying caloric to the atmosphere of glazed houses. Fig.
                    13, Plate CCXC., represents an instance of this arrangement. A small steam-tube,
                    one inch in diameter, enters a water-pipe eight inches in diameter, and
                    twenty-eight feet long, wholly within the forcing-house; it passes into the
                    larger pipe at the centre, and after traversing its ∖yhole length and returning,
                    it issues out immediately below the point at which it entered. It then forms a
                    siphon, by which the condensed water is conveyed away. A more detailed
                    description may be found in the <hi rend="italic">Lond.</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Hort.</hi><hi rend="italic">Mem.,</hi> vol. iii. Applications of it are given
                    in Plate CCXCII., fig. 6, <hi rend="italic">a,</hi> and Plate CCXCIII., fig. 3,
                    below the passage <hi rend="italic">c.</hi></p>
                <p>Steam is sometimes employed to furnish bottom heat. In the garden of Mr Sturge,
                    near Bath, a shallow cistern of water is heated by a steam-pipe, in the manner
                    exhibited in Plate CCXC., figs. 15, 16. The cistern is covered with pavement,
                    over which is a bed of small stones, then ashes or sand, into which the pots
                    containing plants are to be plunged.</p>
                <p>Steam has also been employed to heat flues. Plate CCXC., fig. 14, is a side view
                    and section of a flue filled with small stones or broken bricks, and heated by
                    means of a small steam-pipe passing along the lower part of the flue;.</p>
                <p>Along the upper side of this pipe are a number of small holes, becoming more
                    frequent towards the farther end, to allow the escape of steam: there are,
                    besides, a few perforations in the under side, to clear away condensed water.
                    The flue has a slight inclination to that end of the house from which the water
                    can be most easily drained.</p>
                <p>Similar expedients were long ago employed, in the heating of forcing pits, by Mr
                    John Hay of Edinburgh, a garden-architect of great judgment and experience..
                    Plate CCXC., figs. 17, 18, represent a recent variety of this mode of supplying
                    surface and bottom heat, by discharging steam into flues and chambers filled
                    with stones. The steam is admitted by small pipes running along the central pit,
                    in channels about four inches deep, and of the same width. These channels are
                    crossed by others at right-angles; and at the points of intersection the steam
                    is permitted to escape by two small holes, one on each side of the pipe. The
                    pits must have a water-tight paved bottom, with a declivity of one inch in ten
                    feet. The sides and covers of the channels arc loosely jointed, and are
                    permeable by the steam. Stopcocks are attached to the pipes, so that the supply
                    of vapour can be adjusted. Another mode of adapting steam to the production of
                    bottom heat, may be seen in Mr Macmur-trie’s Pine-Pit, to be afterwards
                    described.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Hot Water.</hi> More recently the circulation of hot water in
                    iron pipes or vessels has been successĥflly employed in producing artificial
                    warmth. The temperature derived from this source has all the properties of
                    steam-heat, with these additional advantages, that it is more steady, not being
                    liable to interruption by the bursting of vessels, and more lasting, as water
                    does not cool so rapidly as aqueous vapour.</p>
                <p>The following explanation of the principle of the hot-water apparatus is given by
                    the late Mr Tredgold, in an excellent paper in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Land</hi><hi rend="italic">Hort.</hi><hi rend="italic">Trans,</hi> vol. vii.
                    “We may select the simple case of two vessels placed on a horizontal plane, with
                    two pipes to connect them; the vessels being open at top, and the one pipe
                    connecting the lower parts of the vessels, and the other the upper parts. If the
                    vessels and pipes (Plate CCXC., fig. 4) be filled with water, and heat be
                    applied to the vessel A, the effect of heat will expand the water in the vessel
                    A; and its surface will, in consequence, rise to a higher level <hi
                    rend="italic">a, a,</hi> the former general level being <hi rend="italic">b,
                    b.</hi> The density of the fluid in the vessel A will also decrease, in
                    consequence of its expansion; but as soon as the column <hi rend="italic">c,
                    d,</hi> of fluid above the <hi rend="italic">centre of the upper pipe</hi> is of
                    greater weight than the column <hi rend="italic">f e,</hi> above that centre,
                    motion will commence along the upper pipe from A to B, and the change this
                    motion produces in the equilibrium of the fluid will cause a corresponding
                    motion in the lower pipe from B to A; and, in short, the motion will obviously
                    continue till the temperature be nearly the same in both vessels; or if water be
                    made to boil in A, it may also be boiling hot in B, because ebullition in A will
                    assist the motion.”</p>
                <p>The figure referred to in the preceding quotation, representing the common tank
                    boiler surrounded by a flue, with a cistern at the extremity of the pipes,
                    exhibits the form in which the apparatus was first erected; but as in this
                    arrangement the process of heating was very slow, and many changes have been
                    made, the cistern has generally been abandoned, and boilers of various
                    configurations have been adopted. In fig. 5, Plate CCXC., a longitudinal
                    section, and in fig. 6, a transverse section, are given, of a flued tank boiler,
                    in which the surface exposed to the heat being increased, the effect required is
                    accelerated, and at the same time a considerable saving of fuel is effected.
                    Fig. 7∙ represents a section of an oblong, close, semi-cylindrical boiler, in
                    which the action of the fire is still more increased. Fig. 8. is a section of a
                    greenhouse boiler, constructed by the Shotts Foundry Company. The fire is placed
                    entirely <pb break="no" facs="nls:193647610" xml:id="kp-eb0711-7610-0655"
                    />within the lower curved surface. This form is easily heated; but as there is
                    no surrounding brick-work or masonry, it speedily cools. It is unnecessary to
                    describe all the numerous modifications of this apparatus; but it may be proper
                    to direct the attention of the reader to the close boiler, fig. 9, i∏ which is
                    shewn how the circulation may be conducted over a door or other obstacle. In
                    this case the upper pipe must not ascend and descend twice: airtubes ought also
                    to be placed in a boiler, and on the highest part of the pipes; and the whole
                    must be made considerably stronger than on common occasions. Fig. 12. is an
                    isometrical elevation of a hot-water apparatus, for a vinery thirty feet long by
                    eleven wide. A is the boiler, as in figure <hi rend="italic">4</hi>; B the upper
                    or delivering pipe; C the principal part of the upper pipe, of a flat form,
                    presenting a greater radiating surface, in proportion to the quantity of heat; D
                    the descending limb; E the returning pipe, of a cylindrical form.</p>
                <p>Mr Fowler has employed the siphon as a part of the hot-water apparatus ,∙ and in
                    his tract on the <hi rend="italic">Thermosiphon,</hi> as he calls it, has shewn
                    how its various modifications may be employed in warming hot walls, as well as
                    in heating glazed houses. The following statement of the principle is given in
                    the Gardener’s Magazine, vol. v. “Any one may prove that hot water will
                    circulate in a siphon, by taking a piece of lead pipe, say of half an inch bore,
                    and four or five feet long, bending it like a siphon, but with one leg a good
                    deal more bent than the other, in order to give the descending water time and
                    space for giving out its heat; and then, filling this tube with water, and
                    placing one hand on each end to retain it full, immerse the extremities in a pot
                    of water over a fire, (Plate CCXC., fig. 11). Supposing the water of an uniform
                    temperature in both legs of the siphon, no circulation would take place; but
                    supposing it to cool sooner in the long leg <hi rend="italic">a</hi> than in the
                    short leg <hi rend="italic">b,</hi> then the equilibrium would be destroyed, and
                    the water in the long leg <hi rend="italic">a</hi> would descend, and draw up
                    water through the short leg <hi rend="italic">b</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and
                    this circulation would continue as long as the water <hi rend="italic">c</hi>
                    was maintained at a temperature above that of the surrounding atmosphere.”</p>
                <p>Mr Kewley’s adaptation of the siphon is one of the simplest and most efficient
                    that has been proposed. In Plate CCXC., fig. 10, <hi rend="italic">a, c, e,</hi>
                    are the two legs of a siphon, through the upper of which the heated water
                    ascends, and by the lower descends. Immediately over the descending bend, a pipe
                    connected with an air-pump is inserted, in order to fill the pipes, or remove
                    the air which collects in the superior limb. Instead of the air-pump, a funnel
                    with air-tight valves is sometimes employed. This mode of circulation has been
                    adopted in some of the principal nursery-gardens -near London.</p>
                <p>Mr Charles H. J. Smith, in a communication to the Scottish Horticultural Society,
                    has clearly shewn that the system of heating by the'circulation of hot water in
                    metallic pipes, is easily applicable, not only to any glazed house constructed
                    with flues, but to any select portion of an existing fruit-wall, although
                    already clothed with peaches, vines, or figs. In the last case, a small furnace
                    and boiler are, of course, placed -at the back of the wall; the expanding water
                    rises to a cistern near the top of the wall; horizontal pipes, making three or
                    four turns, are inserted into the south front of the wall (which is an easy
                    operation, as the wall is usually faced with 'brick); and through these the
                    water circulates, to the great increase of the temperature of the air
                    surrounding the tree. The operation should be accomplished late in the autumn;
                    the tree being carefully unnailed, bent forward, and secured from breaking, and
                    as carefully replaced.</p>
                <p>Mr A. Perkins has constructed an apparatus of small tubes hermetically sealed, in
                    which water circulates, of a temperature varying from 300° to 400° Fahrenheit
                    The contrivance is very ingenious, and has been pretty extensively employed in
                    the neighbourhood of London, in heating warerooms: but as the opinions of
                    horticulturists respecting its merits, as applicable to the forcing garden, are
                    still divided, and as it has not as yet stood the test of much experience, it
                    may be sufficient to give it this cursory notice. For further infφrmation,
                    however, we may refer to the Gardener’s Magazine, vols. viii. and ix.</p>
                <p>To mention <hi rend="italic">the rays of the sun</hi> amongst the sources of
                    artificial heat, may excite a smile; yet it happens that, from the stagnation of
                    air, the reflection of light from walls, and other circumstances, they often
                    produce a very considerable proportion of the increased temperature of a
                    hothouse. This species of heat, however, is materially affected by the admission
                    of the air necessary to the growth and healthy state of the plants. We are not
                    aware of its having been employed as a primary source of heat, except in the
                    case of Dr Anderson’s patent hot-house, in which heated air was kept, bottled up
                    as it were in separate chambers; an arrangement too irregular and unmanageable
                    to be of much utility in our variable climate.</p>
                <p>Vegetable substances in a state of fermentation evolve a considerable quantity of
                    caloric, and are much employed to produce <hi rend="italic">bottom heat,</hi> in
                    hot-beds, pine or melon pits. In a few instances they have been applied to warm
                    the atmosphere of vineries and peach-houses, in which, however, they have been
                    found to be a poor substitute for the other means already explained.</p>
                <p>In the management of artificial heat, some degree of caution is required. All the
                    operations of nature are gradual; and in <hi rend="italic">forcing,</hi> it is
                    well to follow these as the safest examples. The judicious gardener will
                    therefore apply his heat very gradually at first; he will increase it by degrees
                    for several weeks, and, in particular, he will guard against any sudden decrease
                    of -warmth, as nothing is more necessary to success than that the course of
                    vegetation be continued uninterruptedly through foliation, inflorescence, and
                    fructification. He will cause the temperature to increase by day and decrease by
                    night, to rise in summer and fall in winter. He will, in short, imitate as much
                    as possible the natural and varying influence of the sun.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">The admission of Air.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> The
                    deteriorating influence which all living plants are supposed to exert on the
                    atmosphere, must operate with tenfold force in a glazed house, where the
                    proportion of air to vegetable substance is infinitely smaller than under the
                    open sky, and where the corrective agitations of the wind, and the changes of
                    temperature, are much less perceptibly felt. The respiration of plants, and the
                    exhalations of putrescent vegetables, require a constant circulation of the
                    aerial fluid, and this is maintained by means of moveable sashes, and
                    ventilators in the rooι of the house. Of these, sashes seem preferable, as less
                    apt to produce cold currents of air, which are always injurious to vegetation.
                    It is, indeed, a disadvantage that, by sliding down over one another, they
                    diminish the influx of light. In winter, however, when light, from its scarcity
                    in our high latitude, is most valuable, they are seldom drawn down to any
                    extent; and by having all the sashes moveable, the gardener, with a little
                    attention, may correct, in a great measure, any inequality in this respect.
                    Sliding sashes require a depth of rafter which greatly augments the shade in
                    oblique sunshine, an evil which cannot easily be obviated. With fixed roofs, and
                    more especially those which are curvilinear (to be immediately described),
                    numerous ventilators are the only means by which a proper circulation of air can
                    be obtained. Some very intelligent gardeners prefer having all the sloping
                    sashes fixed, and ventilate chiefly by means of large windows at each end of the
                    house, aided by small ventilators in front.</p>
                <p>The quantity of air to be admitted from time to time, must vary with the season,
                    the temperature required to be <pb break="no" facs="nls:193647623"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0711-7623-0656"/>kept up, and the kind of plants cultivated. It
                    should be given and withdrawn by degrees, particularly in the colder portions of
                    the year. The sashes or ventilators, for instance, may be partially open by
                    eight <hi rend="smallcaps">a. μ.,</hi> top air being given before front air;
                    full air may be allowed about ten; a reduction should take place before three p.
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">μ.,</hi> and the whole closed between four and five in the
                    afternoon. In summer less caution is necessary, as in many cases the external
                    air diífers little in temperature from that within the house. Most commonly air
                    is given only during the day, and is excluded at night, with perhaps an increase
                    of fire heat. Judicious horticulturists will sometimes reverse this process.
                    Knowing, for example, that in the West Indies chilly and cold nights usually
                    succeed the hottest days, they will imitate nature, by shutting up the house by
                    day, and throwing it open at night. This practice, however, supported as it is
                    by analogy, is subject to many limitations, and can only be followed in our
                    climate during the summer and autumn months. It is useful, notwithstanding, to
                    remember the principle, though it admits only of partial application.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">The admission of Light.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> In
                    addition to the heat with which natural light is always accompanied, there seems
                    to be another property necessary to vegetation which, from some cause hitherto
                    unexplained, is partly deranged by its transmission through glass. The fact,
                    however, is evident, from the circumstance that plants thrive better near glass
                    than at a distance from it, though the intensity of light is apparently
                    undiminished. Hence gardeners have been anxious to distribute their finer plants
                    in situations as close as possible to the roofs of hot-houses.</p>
                <p>Connected with the admission of light, is the determination of the pitch or angle
                    of elevation of the roofs of glazed houses. It is evidently of advantage that
                    the rays of light should fall upon glass perpendicularly, as loss by reflection
                    is then a minimum, or indeed little or nothing.<note anchored="true"

                    The angle necessary to obtain this result is easily deducible from the sun’s
                    place in the ecliptic. At the equinoxes, the sun’s meridional height above the
                    horizon,-at any point of the earth’s surface, is equal to the complement of the
                    latitude of that place; and hence, in order that the sun’s rays may be
                    perpendicular at that period, it is only necessary to make the elevation of the
                    roof of the hot-house equal to the latitude of the place. The angle for any
                    other season may be obtained by subtracting, from the latitude, the declination
                    of the sun, if at that time to the north of the equator, or by adding it, if to
                    the south. These periods are of course selected in accordance with the time at
                    which the direct rays are most required. Mr Knight proposes a general elevation
                    of 34° for the latitude of London, an angle which corresponds to the 20th of May
                    and the 21st of July. This would afford four months, from the 20th of April to
                    the 21st of August, during which the angle of incidence at mid-day would not at
                    any time amount to 9°, while the deviation at the winter’s solstice would be
                    43°, and the loss of light from reflection would be little more than y <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 1</hi><hi rend="subscript"> δ</hi>. The Rev. Mr Wilkinson
                    recommends 45°, a pitch extremely suitable for early vineries and pine-stoves.
                    In this case the midsummer deviation would be 19°, and the loss ∙^ <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 1</hi><hi rend="subscript"> σ</hi>, and the midwinter
                    deviation 30°, while the loss is nearly the same. From these statements,
                    however, and from an inspection of the table already referred to, it is manifest
                    that much greater exactness has been required in this matter than is at all
                    necessary. The reduction of the opacity of the roof, arising from the breadth
                    and depth of rafters and astragals, is of much greater consequence. Accordingly,
                    in some glazed houses, particularly those constructed of metallic substances,
                    rafters have been omitted altogether; but this kind of structure leads to
                    considerable difficulties in the admission of air.</p>
                <p>We have taken it for granted that the frame-work is composed of wood; and if
                    prime Baltic timber be procured, it will endure for nearly half a century. But
                    in some cases rafters and sashes made entirely of metal, generally either
                    malleable or cast iron, have been employed; and in others, a middle course has
                    been steered, by adopting wooden mortices and metallic tenons. The great
                    objections to the use of metal for rafters and sashes is, that it is too rapid a
                    conductor of caloric, and too liable to contraction and expansion for the
                    alternations of heat and cold; the expansion tending to render the sashes
                    immoveable, and even to loosen the walls; and the contraction being apt to
                    fracture the glass, and to produce openings between the sashes at which
                    hoarfrost may enter.</p>
                <p>In order to secure the greatest possible influx of light, scientific
                    horticulturists have proposed hot-houses with curvilinear roofs. It was remarked
                    by Sir George Mackenzie, to whom the merit of the proposal is primarily due,
                    that if we could find a form for a glass roof, such that the sun’s rays should
                    be perpendicular <hi rend="italic">to some part of it,</hi> not on two days, but
                    during the whole year, that form would be the best. Such a figure is the sphere,
                    and he therefore proposes a quarter segment of a globe or semidome, the radius
                    of which is about fifteen feet. The frame for the glasswork is formed of equal
                    ribs of hammered iron, fastened into an iron plate in the parapet wall, and
                    fixed at top into an iron ring connected with the back wall. There are no
                    rafters or sliding sashes, but air is admitted by ventilators in the parapet and
                    back walls.</p>
                <p>This form of hot-house roofs has been warmly patronised by Mr Knight, who,
                    however, is of opinion, that the house proposed by Sir George Mackenzie is too
                    high in proportion to its length and breadth, and therefore recommends a smaller
                    section of a sphere with a greater radius. His dimensions are forty feet long,
                    fourteen wide in the centre, and, including the front parapet, twelve feet high.
                    Mr Loudon, who, it is understood, was the first that actually erected hot-houses
                    on this principle, has proposed, and in part executed, many other forms. He
                    describes <hi rend="italic">(Encyc. of Gard.)</hi> with great exuberance of
                    invention, the <hi rend="italic">acuminated semidome,</hi> the <hi rend="italic"
                    >acuminated semiglobe,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">semiellipse,</hi> and the <hi
                    rend="italic">parallelogram with curved roof and ends.</hi> With Mr Loudon we
                    should certainly prefer the last mentioned. A considerable number of curvilinear
                    houses have been erected in the southern part of the island, particularly as
                    repositories for ornamental plants, such as in Messrs Loddiges’ nursery-gardens
                    at Hackney, the London Horticultural Society’s garden, the Manchester Botanic
                    Garden, and in various private gardens.</p>
                <p>As far as we are aware, no extensive experimental investigation of the
                    comparative merits of curvilinear houses has hitherto been made. A writer in the
                    Gardener’s Magazine (vol. ii.) found it necessary, during the summer months, to
                    shade his pines growing in such a house, from nine, ten, or eleven o’clock in
                    the morning, to three, four, or five in the afternoon, in order to prevent the
                    plants from assuming a rusty tinge and unhealthy appearance. Another practical
                    gardener complains (vol. v.) that “the circular <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193647636" xml:id="kp-eb0711-7636-0657"/>roof concentrated the sun’s
                    rays so immoderately, that the tops of the vines were actually scorched, even
                    when the doors and ventilators at the back were all open. This was always the
                    case in summer; and in winter, it was with the greatest difficulty, and only
                    with the assistance of mats, that they could keep ont frost; the thermometer
                    frequently indicating only 40° when strong fires were burning.” A considerable
                    portion of the superior lightness of the curvilinear houses is due to the
                    absence of rafters, and as these may also be dispensed in plain roofs, the
                    effect of these ought to be deducted in making a comparison. Perhaps, when every
                    thing else is rightly arranged, there is enough of light in common houses.
                    Scarcely any species of fruit, when cultivated in the open air, is exposed
                    during the whole day to the action of the solar rays, but must unavoidably be
                    shaded at times by leaves and branches. It is difficult to suppose that, in
                    respect to illumination, there is any re <hi rend="superscript"> i</hi>-
                    markable deficiency in pits and glazed houses, in which have been ripened
                    pine-apples and clusters of grapes, at least rivalling, if not surpassing, the
                    produce of the most favoured of their native climes. In the admission of air, in
                    the quantity and convenience of trellises, and in other interior accommodations,
                    it cannot be disputed that the old forms have the advantage.</p>
                <p>It has already been said, that hot-house roofs of the common kind, are sometimes
                    constructed without rafters or moveable sashes. A considerable increase of light
                    is thus obtained; but this benefit is attended with an almost insuperable
                    defect, namely, the difficulty of producing a free and equable circulation of
                    air. It is indeed probable that the common or plain roofed hot-house will always
                    continue the favourite form with gardeners. In it the rafters are arranged at
                    equal distances, and are made of a deep and narrow form, with their under edges
                    rounded off. Nico recommends that they should be made two and one-fourth inches
                    broad, by ten inches deep. Perhaps they might be a little broader and shallower
                    with advantage. The size of the sashes depends on the magnitude of the house;
                    their breadth, however, ranges from three and a half to four feet. Except in
                    very large houses, sashes are always disposed in two tiers, the upper row
                    sliding down over the under one. Where there are ventilators in the front wall
                    or upright glass, the sashes in the upper tier alone require to be moveable,
                    and, for the sake of convenience, they may be made considerably shorter than the
                    others. They are furnished with cords, pulleys, rollers, and weights, though the
                    last, with no very prudent regard to economy, are sometimes omitted. Formerly
                    all hot-houses were constructed with upright sashes in front. One of the most
                    eminent garden architects of the present day (Mr Atkinson), has discontinued the
                    practice; and, except in ornamental structures, it is hard to say why it should
                    not be laid aside altogether. Sueh sashes serve only to weaken the fabric, and
                    increase its expense.</p>
                <p>Formerly the panes of glass employed were of large size; but small panes are
                    found to be more economical, being less liable to break, and more easily
                    replaced. It is believed that a pane seven inches in breadth by six in length,
                    is the cheapest form in which glass can be obtained. In glazing, it is important
                    to keep the overlaps of the panes of small dimensions, perhaps from one-fourth
                    to one-eighth inch in breadth. This diminishes the breakage which arises from
                    the expansion, in freezing, of the water detained between the laps by capillary
                    attraction. As a further preventive, the interstices are sometimes filled with
                    putty, and occasionally with laps of lead or copper. This effects a considerable
                    saving of glass and of heat, but imposes on the gardener the duty of increased
                    attention in preventing the stagnation of air. The frame-work of houses should
                    be well coated with oil-paint; the colour is usually white.</p>
                <p>In closing these preliminary remarks, it is proper to observe, that although the
                    construction of a forcing-house is always a matter of considerable importance,
                    it is not the only, nor even the most important condition necessary to ensure
                    success. Much care in management, skill in pruning, and knowledge in physiology,
                    must be possessed and applied, in order to obtain abundant and regular crops of
                    fine fruit.</p>
                <p>The more minute details respecting the structure of glazed houses, we shall
                    notice along with the peculiar culture required in each; and we shall take them
                    in the following order: The Vinery br Grape-house, the Peachhouse, the
                    Cherry-house, the Fig-house, the Pinery, the Orangery, and the Melonry. The
                    greenhouse and other botanical structures, will come more appropriately under
                    review in treating of the Flower Garden.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="smallcaps">Vinery.</hi><hi rend="italic">Structure.</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">—</hi> The vinery is susceptible of a great variety of form; and,
                    indeed, in this respect, seems more pliable than any other forcing-house. That
                    form, however, which has been most commonly used, is the plane roof with sliding
                    sashes; and such is the success with which it has been employed, and such its
                    convenience for every purpose, that it is not probable it will soon be generally
                    supplanted. The section of the Peach-house, Pl. CCXCI. fig. 4, will give an idea
                    of the usual configuration of the vinery. Fig. 3. of the same plate is a
                    section, and fig. 6. a ground plan of a curvilinear vinery, heated by hot-water.
                    A vinery, with fines and two furnaces, is generally fifty feet long, twelve or
                    fourteen wide within, the height of the back wall being ten or twelve feet.
                    Where there is only one furnace, or where a hot-water apparatus is employed, the
                    length of the house should not exceed thirty-five or forty feet. Small divisions
                    are to be preferred; for where there is a considerable extent of glass, the
                    cultivator, by applying his fires to the different divisions in succession, can
                    prolong the crop from May to December. The parapet wall in front is commonly
                    arched or built on lintels, supported by stone pillars; so that the vines, which
                    are planted inside the house, close by the parapet, may send abroad their roots
                    in search of nutriment. Sometimes the vines are planted without^ and introdüced
                    into the house by slanting apertures in the front wall; but the former method,
                    where possible, is the more eligible. The trellis used for training, is
                    generally formed of w ires drawn across the rafters, at the distance of a foot
                    from each other. Of late the trellis has been divided into portions of a
                    moderate breadth, which are placed vertically under the rafter. This form,
                    exhibited in fig. 1, Plate CCXCI., is called the hanging trellis, and is
                    described at length in the <hi rend="italic">Lond. IJortic. Trans,</hi> vol. vi.
                    It leaves the middle of the sash open to the sun’s rays, and allows the back
                    wall to be covered with bearing wood, a thing which, in other circumstances, can
                    scarcely be done with any beneficial effect. It must, however, be admitted,
                    that, according to the' experience of some, this arrangement is inferior to the
                    common trellis.</p>
                <p>It is of importance that the included soil and front border of a vinery should be
                    fresh and rich, and of a considerable depth. Mr Griffin (in <hi rend="italic"
                    >Land, liortic. Trans.)</hi> recommends as a compost, “one-half of good loamy
                    soil with its turf, one quarter of rich old dung, and one quarter of brick and
                    lime rubbish; the turf well rotted, and the whole well incorporated.” Plants
                    raised from cuttings, and prepared for two or three years in pots, are preferred
                    for the furnishing of a vinery; and when planted inside the house, there should
                    not be fewer than two plants to each sash.</p>
                <p>It is scarcely necessary to enumerate the particular varieties of the grape-vine,
                    as adapted for a vinery, for every good variety deserves a place where there is
                    room, and all those which have∙been already mentioned are occasionally planted.
                    It may be remarked, however, that the kinds should be assorted according to the
                    order of their ripening.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:193647649" xml:id="kp-eb0711-7649-0658"/>
                <p>The early grapes, such as the Muscadines, should be planted in a house by
                    themselves; those of a medium character, the Frotignacs, for example, may occupy
                    a second; while the late Tokay, the Muscat of Alexandria, Nice, Syrian, and
                    others, would be fit inmates for a third. This would produce a regular
                    succession, and admit a uniformity of treatment in each house. Where there is
                    not a suite of vineries, but only one large house, the late varieties should be
                    planted near the entrance of the flues.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Pruning and Training.</hi> Very numerous have been the
                    directions given in reference to these particulars; but we cannot here go into
                    such details, nor is it necessary. The great object is the reproduction of
                    bearing, that is, annual wood, over the whole surface of the house. When this is
                    accomplished, the next matter to be determined is the number of eyes or buds to
                    be left on each shoot, that is, whether we shall adopt the <hi rend="italic"
                    >short</hi> or the <hi rend="italic">long</hi> system of pruning. The former is
                    most allied to the practice of foreign vineyards, and has been most successfully
                    employed in this country. According to this method, all the lateral shoots are
                    cut dowm to single eyes, as described in <hi rend="italic">Lond. Hortic.
                    Trans,</hi> iv. 104. For a particular description of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >long</hi> system, we refer to the same vol. p. 246, or to Loudon’s
                    Encyclopaedia of Gardening, second edition, p. 548. To these references, we add
                    a few general remarks. (1.) In this country, it ought to be the great aim of the
                    gardener to make his vines grow as luxuriantly as possible; for the quality of
                    the grapes, when properly ripened, is generally commensurate with the size of
                    the berries. The borders should therefore be made rich; but they ought to be
                    rather wide than deep, deep planting being adverse to the ripening of the fruit.
                    (2.) In order to secure a proper degree of vigour, vines should be limited in
                    extent, and pruned rather severely than otherwise. To enable us to circumscribe
                    the plants, it would be well to introduce as many separate plants into the
                    vinery as can be done without confusion. For an illustration of this principle,
                    we may refer to the practice of the <hi rend="italic">vignerons</hi> of
                    Fontainebleau, as described in the <hi rend="italic">Pomone</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Française,</hi> or in the <hi rend="italic">Lond. Hortic.
                    Trans,</hi> vol. vii. (3.) From the peculiar mode of growth in the grape-vine,
                    the bearing branches have a tendency to recede from the centre to the
                    extremities, and are often found in abundance only at the top of the trellis.
                    Every young shoot near the front of the house should therefore be carefully
                    husbanded, and cut back by way of reserve. Old wood ought to be removed as
                    frequently as possible; and the skilful pruner will look at least two years
                    before him. Nothing contributes more to regularity in the succession of bearing
                    wood, than simplicity in pruning and training; and therefore all bending, and tw
                    isting, and traversing of branches should be avoided.</p>
                <p>The summer pruning consists in removing with the fingers the useless lateral
                    shoots, and pinching off the tender points of the bearing branches. The extent
                    to which these bearing branches are allowed to run will depend on their vigour,
                    and the position which they hold in the plant. Sometimes it may be needful to
                    leave them ten or twelve feet long, but, in general, two or three feet will be
                    sufficient. The shorter the better. They seldom or never fail to send out
                    secondary laterals from their points: these and the others which succeed them
                    are stopped at the second or even first eye, and the operation is continued
                    until vegetation ceases. When the young grapes begin to swell, the bunches are
                    thinned out, that is, berries are removed wherever they are too much crowded
                    together; and the shoulders or sides of the bunches are supported by slender
                    threads of bass-mat. The quality and weight of bunches should be regarded rather
                    than their number. Nothing seems more contemptible than numbers of small and
                    ill-ripened bunches of grapes, smeared, as they frequently are, with dust and
                    honey-dew. Avarice not unfrequently cheats itself in this matter; and it
                    generally happens in the vinery, as elsewhere, that not he who desires most has
                    most. The ripening, colour, and flavour of grapes on the tree are promoted by
                    removing a portion of the foliage; this is to be done, however, only after the
                    fruit has attained full size.</p>
                <p>The forcing of the earliest vinery may commence in January. At first the
                    temperature may vary from 50° to 55° Fahrenheit in the mornings and evenings.
                    When the buds have burst, it may be raised to 70°, and in the flowering season
                    it may be kept at 75°. At this season it is necessary that the air should be
                    preserved moist by frequent steamings. Upon the appearance of colour in the
                    fruit, the waterings cease, and air is copiously admitted. In the early
                    vineries, it is necessary to continue the fire-heat without intermission: in the
                    later houses this is not required, but it must be used occasionally, even in
                    warm weather, to obviate the effects of damp.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="smallcaps">Peach-house.</hi> —A peach-house, intended to be
                    commanded by one furnace, is generally about forty feet long, ten or twelve feet
                    wide, and fourteen feet high; but these dimensions may be varied considerably,
                    according to the time at which the crop is desired to come into season. For
                    early forcing, perhaps twenty-five or thirty feet in length, and seven or eight
                    in breadth, are sufficient; while a house, in which the operations of nature are
                    only to be slightly accelerated, may be extended to fifty feet. As in the
                    vinery, the front wall is arched, to permit the egress of the roots. Upon this
                    is usually placed a range of upright sashes, which are surmounted by the sloping
                    rafters of the roof. A common form of a peach-house is represented in Plate
                    CCXCI., in which fig. 4. is a vertical section, and fig. 5. is the ground plan;
                    <hi rend="italic">a, a,</hi> are the flues, <hi rend="italic">b</hi> is the
                    table trellis, <hi rend="italic">c</hi> the trellis on the back wall; along with
                    which, a hanging trellis, as in fig. 1, is sometimes employed, although this is
                    not approved of by many. The flue, which is built on pillars, and returns on
                    itself, occupies the centre of the house. The trees arc trained to the two
                    trellises <hi rend="italic">b</hi> and <hi rend="italic">c,</hi> and to the
                    hanging trellis, if such be in use. Against the back wall three or four dwarf
                    trees are planted, with intermediate <hi rend="italic">riders,</hi> the latter
                    being taken out at the end of four or five yςars at furthest. These, with three
                    for the front trellis, make in all nine or ten trees for each house.</p>
                <p>Plate CCXCΠ. fig. 1, represents another form of the peach-house, not so generally
                    used as the former, but of equal if not superior merit. We have supposed it
                    heated by a water apparatus <hi rend="italic">a, a,</hi> but that is not an
                    essential matter, as a common flue is equally admissible. There is no front
                    glass, nor any trellis on the back wall, the trees being planted in front, and
                    trained on a wire trellis <hi rend="italic">b,</hi> attached to the rafters, and
                    covering the whole surface of the roof. As the peach-tree is not found to extend
                    much more than twelve or thirteen feet on the open wall, the length of the
                    rafter, inside measure, need not do more than approach to fourteen feet. It is
                    obvious that in such a house the trees must enjoy an equable, and, from their
                    proximity to the glass, an advantageous degree of light. Besides being planted
                    close to the front wall, they are not exposed to have their roots stunted in
                    passing under flues, and through the interior soil of the house, which, in spite
                    of every assiduity in watering and manuring, becomes hard and impoverished.
                    Further, it has been estimated, that as far as roof and glass are concerned,
                    four or even five such houses may be erected, at the same expense as three of
                    the common form.</p>
                <p>In Holland, peaches are forced in pits resembling the common hot-bed or
                    melon-pit. The trees are trained on a trellis-work near the glass, and the air
                    is heated by the fermentation of dung-linings. The method has been partially
                    adopted in this country, with, however, the use of hot water. When
                    garden-architects shall cease to be anxious <pb break="no" facs="nls:193647662"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0711-7662-0659"/>about making all forcing houses ornamental
                    structures, this will probably be the general form in which early and tender
                    peaches will be cultivated.</p>
                <p>The pruning and training of peach-trees in the peachhouse does not differ
                    materially from the practice out of doors. Fire-heat is commonly applied about
                    the beginning or middle of February; but where there is a large suite of houses,
                    and an extended succession is wanted, forcing, as it then truly becomes, may
                    begin a month sooner. At first the temperature is kept about 45°, but it is
                    afterwards gradually increased to 50° or 55° Fahrenheit.' While the trees are in
                    flower, and till the fruit be set, the house is occasionally steamed, either by
                    sprinkling water on the warm flues, or by admitting the vapour from the pipes,
                    where steam is employed for heating. After this period, the foliage is washed,
                    from time to time, with the gardenengine. When the fruit has stoned, or the
                    kernels have been formed, the temperature is raised to about 60°. Water is now
                    copiously supplied to the border; the fruit is thinned out; the various
                    operations of disbudding and tying are performed, and air is admitted in
                    abundance. After the end of April, little fire-heat is required for the
                    peach-house. The trees often suffer from mildew: the best preventives consist in
                    keeping the borders of the peachhouse clear, and in good condition as to fresh
                    soil, and in observing that nothing be permitted to obstruct the free
                    circulation of air and full admission of sun. ’</p>
                <p>It may here be remarked, that by curious cultivators several uncommon kinds of
                    exotic fruits are occasionally grown with success in conservatories, vineries,
                    hot-houses, or other glazed structures, along with the more regular or usual
                    inmates. Among these may be mentioned . the Lo-quat, <hi rend="italic"

                    >Psidium cattlcianum,</hi> fruits freely in the vinery of the Experimental
                    Garden at Edinburgh: the fruit is round, about the size of a small plum; of a
                    fine claret colour; the pulp soft, only a little firmer than that of a
                    strawberry, and of a delightful subacid flavour, making a most desirable
                    preserve. The Carambola, <hi rend="italic">Averrhoa Carambola,</hi> of the East
                    Indies, has of late been added to our exotic fruits, by Mr Bateman of
                    Knypersley, near Congleton: the fruit is of the size and shape of a duck’s egg,
                    but with longitudinal ribs on the sides; either in tarts or as a preserve, the
                    flavour is described as exquisite. It may be noticed, that, both from the
                    descriptions of intelligent travellers, and from the preserved fruit being sent
                    to Britain, we know that numerous species of exotic fruit-trees exist, which
                    have not yet reached us in a living state; and the introduction of these might
                    form an object of innocent, pleasing, and commendable ambition to enterprising
                    and wealthy horticulturists.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="smallcaps">Cherry-house,</hi> in its general arrangements,
                    resembles the peach-house, with the exception of the front trellis, the place of
                    which is commonly occupied by a stage for pots of early strawberries or kidney
                    beans. The cherry-trees are trained against the back wall: the house should
                    therefore be narrow, and the roof steep. The operation of forcing generally
                    commences early in January, with a very moderate temperature. Air is admitted
                    freely till the flowers begin to expand, when great caution becomes necessary.
                    When the fruit is setting, the temperature is kept as steadily as possible at
                    50°: after it is set, abundance of water is applied to the roots and foliage of
                    the trees. When the fruit is colouring, water is almost entirely withheld, and
                    air is now freely admitted. During the whole process of forcing cherries, any
                    excessive heat from the sun’s rays must be carefully guarded against, by shading
                    or by admitting of air. The kind of cherry usually preferred for forcing is the
                    Common May-duke. A cherryhouse ought to form a part of every large garden
                    establishment; for nothing better distinguishes the tables of the opulent, in
                    March and April, than ripe cherries and strawberries appearing in the dessert at
                    that season of the year.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="smallcaps">Fig-house</hi> scarcely differs in form and management
                    from the Cherry-house, the trees being trained to a back trellis, with the
                    addition, however, of dwarf standard trees in front. At Kew there is a fig-house
                    fifty feet long. Here the second crop is often the most productive. In 1810, we
                    are told the royal tables were supplied with more than 200 baskets of figs, 50
                    of which were from the first crop, and 150 from the second. It is seldom,
                    however, that a separate house is erected for this fruit. The fig succeeds very
                    well as a dwarf standard between the front flues of a vinery, provided the roof
                    be not too closely covered with the foliage of the vines. Of late, small
                    standard figs have very commonly been grown in large pots, fourteen or fifteen
                    inches in diameter, and placed in any of the forcing houses. In this way
                    considerable crops of fruit have been raised. The <hi rend="italic"

                <p>The <hi rend="smallcaps">Orange Tribe</hi><hi rend="italic">(Citrus)</hi> are
                    cultivated in Britain, .rather as objects of curiosity and beauty, than for the
                    purpose of affording a supply of fruit. Commerce with Portugal, Spain, Italy,
                    and China, has brought this class of fruits within the reach of every one; and
                    the copious importations which annually take place, have no doubt discouraged
                    the cultivation of the plants. A few orange trees are nevertheless to be met
                    with in most collections, and in large and sumptuous gardens, it is not uncommon
                    to meet with glazed houses set specially apart for their reception.</p>
                <p>The following brief notices of some of the cultivated species of the genus Citrus
                    are derived principally from Mr G. Don’s General System of Botany and Gardening,
                    a work evincing singular accuracy and unwearied research, and from Μ. Risso’s
                    excellent paper in the <hi rend="italic">Annales</hi><hi rend="italic">du
                    Museum,</hi> vol. xx.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">C.</hi><hi rend="italic">Medica,</hi> the Citron, the Cedrate
                    of the Italians, is a small evergreen tree. The fruit is large, of an oval form,
                    and covered with a rough skin or rind, which is charged with a highly fragrant
                    oil. The citron is generally used in confections. It is supposed to be a native
                    of Media, and will scarcely ripen without protection in Britain. Three
                    subvarieties of citron are described by Risso.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">C. Limetta,</hi> the Sweet Lime. This is rather a tall tree,
                    with diverging branches. The flower is of a fine white colour, composed of five
                    oblong petals. The fruit is globose, with a black nipple-like protuberance at
                    the apex, having a firm rind, and sweet pulp. The colour is pale yellow. It is a
                    native of Asia, but cultivated in Italy. Seven varieties have been
                    described.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">C. Limonum,</hi> the Lemon. The petioles of the leaves somewhat
                    winged; fruit oblong, with a thin rind adhering closely to the very acid pulp.
                    This, like the preceding, is a native of Asia, but is cultivated in the south of
                    Europe. There are numerous varieties.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">C. Aurantium,</hi> Sweet Orange. The petioles almost naked;
                    fruit globose, with a thin rind, and sweet pulp. Risso has enumerated nineteen
                    varieties; of which the principal are, the China, the Portugal, and the
                    Maltese.</p>

                <p>The last has a blood-coloured pulp, with rich juice, and is now in much
                    request.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">C. vulgaris,</hi> Seville or Bitter Orange. The petioles
                    winged; fruit globose, with a thin rind, and bitter juice. This sort is employed
                    in making marmalade, and is also used in medicine. Twelve varieties have been
                    described.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">C.</hi><hi rend="italic">Decumana,</hi> the Shaddock. The
                    petioles broad, with cordate wings; fruit large, weighing from ten to fourteen
                    pounds, with a thick rind. This fruit was carried by Captain Shaddock from China
                    to the British West Indies, where it first acquired the name which it now bears.
                    It is now cultivated not only in the West India Islands, but extensively in
                    South America. Four sorts are enumerated. Of all the Citrus tribe, this has the
                    most beautiful foliage, and it is therefore not improperly selected for filling
                    the back wall of a vinery.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">The orangery,</hi> in this country, seldom differs in form,
                    even where it is a separate structure, from that of the greenhouse. Most
                    commonly the few orange plants which are kept, are grown in pots or boxes, and
                    occupy a place with other exotics on the greenhouse shelves. At some places the
                    orange trees are planted in conservatories erected for the purpose. In the
                    neighbourhood of Paris, the orangeries are little better than dark sheds, in
                    which the trees are kept protected during the winter months, light and air being
                    given when the weather permits. At Woodhall, in Lanarkshire, they are trained
                    against trellisses, under glass, and in this way produce abundant crops of fine
                    fruit. We have there seen a single plant of the St Michael’s orange, twenty-four
                    feet wide and eighteen feet high, clothed with fruit.</p>
                <p>Middle-sized plants are frequently imported from the Italian nursery-gardens, and
                    this is the readiest way of procuring large specimens at a cheap rate. The
                    plants are closely packed in boxes, with some grass or moss around the roots.
                    Upon their arrival they are in a withered and deadlike state, and require
                    considerable care and management to recover them from the effects of the voyage.
                    When propagated in this country, they are budded on citron or Seville orange
                    stocks; the former recommended by Miller as preferable. The seeds of the stocks
                    are sown in pots, and the growth of the seedlings is aided, during the first and
                    second summer, by the application of a slight bottom heat in a hot-bed frame.
                    These are usually budded in August. The late Mr Henderson, gardener at Woodhall,
                    used to graft his trees, employing scions formed of the wood of the second year.
                    He also propagated by cuttings, considering this the quickest mode of obtaining
                    plants. We may add, that this most successful cultivator of the orange tribe
                    made it a rule to keep his trees rather cool, and with plenty of air in mild
                    weather, till the fruit was fairly set; after which he found that he could apply
                    more heat without the risk of the fruit failing.</p>
                <p>The orange tree prospers in a rich, fresh, and rather strong soil; and in this
                    country it is the practice to mix with it a considerable portion of well rotted
                    dung. When grown in pots or boxes, the plant should be shifted, and the earth
                    partly renewed every spring. In summer, copious waterings are given, and the
                    leaves are syringed once or twice a-wcek. The heads are kept thin, and the
                    branches which inconveniently crςss each other are removed. When planted against
                    trellisses, they are trained in the fan form; and in laying in the shoots,
                    allowance is to be made for the size of the leaves in the different species.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="smallcaps">Pine-apple</hi><hi rend="italic">(Bromelia Ananas')</hi>
                    is comparatively of recent introduction into Britain. It was nearly unknown to
                    our horticulturists in the beginning of the eighteenth century; for Thoresby,
                    the antiquary, kept a leaf of the pine-apple in his museum as a curiosity. It is
                    now largely and successfully cultivated in all the principal gardens in this co
                    untr. Its culture requires all the ingenuity, judgment, and watchfulness of the
                    skilful and diligent horticulturist. We shall, therefore, treat of it at
                    considerable length. It derives its name from the general resemblance of its
                    fruit to a large cone of a pine-tree. The fruit is a kind of pulpy strobilus,
                    formed of coadunate berries, and crowned at top with a tuft of fine green
                    pointed leaves. The flavour of the pulp is of the most exquisite kind. The plant
                    is herbaceous, and the fruit-stem, which generall; appears in the second or
                    third year, is surrounded with long serrated leaves, resembling those of some
                    species of aloe. The fruit grown in Britain is considered equal in all good
                    qualities, and generally superior in size, to that reared in tropical countries.
                    The <hi rend="italic">Lond. Hortic. Catalogue</hi> enumerates 56 varieties: of
                    these the following may be deemed most worthy of notice.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Queen Pine</hi> is very generally cultivated. Its frui[ is
                    of a cylindrical or tankard shape, of a yellowish colout inclining to orange,
                    and sometimes weighs three pounds it is, at the same time, of excellent flavour.
                    This kind produces with greater certainty than most others, and the fruit may be
                    easily ripened in fifteen or eighteen months, from the planting of the crown or
                    offset. It is, therefore, the most useful of all the pines. A subvariety called
                    <hi rend="italic">Hip-ley’s Queen</hi> is also excellent.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Black Antigua</hi> has leaves armed with large spines; the
                    flow ers are purple; the fruit cylindrical, averaging five pounds weight. It
                    should be cut a little before it be quite ripe.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Black Jamaica,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Old Jamaica.</hi>
                    In this variety the spines on the leaves are small; the flowers purple; the
                    fruit oblong, averaging about four pounds. This is an excellent kind, and is
                    considered the best sort for fruiting during the winter months.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">New Jamaica</hi> is rather an inferior kind, but is pretty
                    good when ripened in the summer time.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Υ∖u∖Broun-leaved Sugar-loaf</hi> is a capital black variety;
                    and the <hi rend="italic">Enville</hi> a large, shewy, and useful pine.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">St Vincent's,</hi> or, as it is sometimes called, the <hi
                    rend="italic">Green Olive,</hi> has middle-sized spines, purple flowers, and
                    pyramidal fruit, which average about two pounds and a half. It succeeds well to
                    come in as a winter fruit.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">White Providence</hi> has small spines, dark purple
                    flowers, and oblong fruit of a large size, averaging, when well grown, seven
                    pounds weight, and sometimes exceeding twelve pounds. The colour of the fruit is
                    at first brownish-grey, but at ripening it becomes of a pale yellow. The pulp is
                    yellow, melting, and abounds with quick lively juice, but is not equal in
                    flavour to some of the other kinds.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Trinidad</hi> is remarkable for the great size of its
                    fruit, which are said to attain sometimes to the weight of twenty-six pounds.
                    Its average is stated in the <hi rend="italic">Hort.</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Cat.</hi> to be twelve pounds. The spines are middle-sized, the flowers lilac,
                    and the fruit pyramidal. Apart from its magnitude, it is, like the preceding,
                    only a secondary fruit.</p>
                <p>The following may also be named as first-rate sorts: Bagot’s Seedling, Russian
                    Globe, Green King with smooth leaves, Striped Queen, Sierra Leone, Brown
                    Sugar-loaf and Orange Sugar-loaf. And three or four more, though of inferior
                    quality, may be noticed for their beauty, or curiosity, viz. the Blood-red,
                    Otaheite, Scarlet, Welbeck Seedling, and the FIavannah, the fruit of which last
                    keeps long, and has sometimes been imported into this country from Cuba.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Structures for growing Pine-apples.</hi> The ananas plant has
                    generally been found to require cultivation for two or three years before it
                    perfects its fruit: its culture has, m consequence, been divided into three
                    periods,—propagation, successional preparation, and fruiting; and each of these
                    periods has its corresponding structure, viz. the nursing-pit, the
                    succession-house or pit, and the fruiting-house.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:193647688" xml:id="kp-eb0711-7688-0661"/>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">nursing-pit</hi> has occasionally assumed a great variety
                    of forms, respecting which, however, it is not necessary to go into minute
                    detail. For summer use, a large glazed frame, placed upon a hot-bed of stable
                    litter and tanners’ bark, is perhaps the best hitherto devised. The Alderston
                    Melon-pit, and Atkinson’s Melon-pit, described under the head Melonry, are
                    likewise very suitable for this purpose. In winter, it is desirable to have the
                    assistance of fire heat, either from flues, or, what is better, from hot water;
                    though this fire heat is not indispensable.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">succession-pit</hi> performs the same functions as the
                    nursing-pit, but at a more advanced stage of the growth of the plant, and
                    consequently requires an increase of size. With this difference, Atkinson’s
                    Melon-pit does very well for summer use. In colder seasons, we should prefer a
                    pit similar to that represented Plate CCXCII, figs. 2 and 3, in which a
                    hot-water apparatus on the siphon principle is employed. The plants are plunged
                    in <hi rend="italic">a</hi> (fig. 2), being a bed of sand or fine gravel; <hi
                    rend="italic">b</hi> is the boiler; c pipes for supplying the bottom heat; <hi
                    rend="italic">d</hi> exposed pipes for warming the included air. If the common
                    bark-bed is preferred, the pipes c may be omitted. This pit may be fifty feet
                    long, and seven wide. The sashes are raised from without, as in the common
                    hot-bed. This plan is from the pencil of Mr Charles II. J. Smith, a young but
                    very promising gardenarchitect, of whose assistance the writer of this article
                    has had much satisfaction in availing himself in the designing of the plates. Mr
                    Smith also proposes another form of a succession pit, exhibited in Plate CCXCII,
                    fig. 11, entirely heated by hot-water. The surface heat is supplied by pipes in
                    front; the bottom heat is kept up by small pipes from the boiler, passing
                    through cisterns of water extending the whole length of the pit. In this case it
                    would be necessary to apply the heat only during the day. The old
                    succession-house, or that generally in use till within the last fifteen years,
                    does not differ materially from the common pine-stove; but, owing to its great
                    waste of heat, it either is or ought to be entirely laid aside.</p>
                <p>In the <hi rend="italic">fruiting-house,</hi> more room, greater height, and a
                    more powerful temperature, are requisite; and to attain these objects, many
                    varieties of structure have been devised: we shall notice those only which are
                    most worthy of attention. Fig. 4, Plate CCXCII. is a section of Baldwin’s
                    Fruiting-pit. The roof is unequally ridged, the north or shorter side being
                    slated and furnished with ventilators, to admit air. The sashes are immovable,
                    and the laps of the panes are closely puttied. There is a path within, and a
                    single turn of a flue behind. We should prefer the form exhibited by fig. 5. of
                    the same plate, in which there are also ventilators <hi rend="italic">a a,</hi>
                    and a hot-water apparatus surrounding the whole pit. The dimensions of this may
                    be fifty feet long, and nine feet wide; the glass being two feet and a half from
                    the curb of the bark-pit in front, and five feet behind. Fig. 6. is a section of
                    a pine-pit with a curvilinear roof, in which the astragals are parallel. A
                    segment of an elliptical arch somewhat less than a quadrant, the origin of the
                    curve being on the front wall, seems better adapted for a pit than any portion
                    of a circle. This pit is supposed to be heated by a small steam-pipe passing
                    through a large iron tank or cistern <hi rend="italic">a,</hi> filled with
                    water, on the same principle as exhibited in Plate CCXC, fig. 13. A section of
                    the old-fashioned pine-stove is given in Plate CCXCII, fig. 7∙ This is a lofty
                    structure, in the vinery form, with front sashes. It used to be forty or fifty
                    feet long√ and twelve or fourteen feet broad, and was commanded by two flues. In
                    addition to the pine plants in the pit, the roof is also partly covered with
                    vines, a practice justly condemned by Nico. We are also disposed to agree with
                    that experienced writer regarding the disuse of the pine-stove itself. Besides
                    other grievous faults, a single house affords too little room; and it is a
                    matter of experience, that where the stock of pine plants is not extensive,
                    certain and abundant crops or ιruιc cannot be expected. Instead, therefore, of a
                    succession and fřnit-ing-house of the old form, with two fires each, it would be
                    better to have four pits with single fires. There might be two succession-pits
                    of the form of fig. 2. or fig. 11, Plate CCXCII, and two fruiting-pits similar
                    to fig. 5. or fig. 6. These would contain a much greater number of plants than
                    two pine-stoves, would be little more expensive in erection, and, as the number
                    of fires is the same, would not consume much more fuel.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Bottom Heat.</hi> As a substitute for the warmth absorbed by
                    the earth, from the powerful rays of the sun in tropical countries, the pots of
                    pine-plants are generally plunged in a bed of tanners’ bark, decaying leaves, or
                    other fermenting substances. Tanners’ bark is most commonly used. Speechly and
                    Nico prefer leaves shed by hard-wood trees in autumn. Others form the under and
                    greater part of the bed with stable-litter. Whatever substance is employed, it
                    should not be put into the bed until the first violent heat of fermentation has
                    passed; or if circumstances impose a necessity of using it in a recent state, it
                    should be largely mixed with old materials of the same kind. A layer of
                    exhausted bark, ten or twelve inches thick, should be laid on the surface of the
                    bed. In pine stoves, the curb of the bark-pit is usually elevated about three
                    feet above the common level of the house, and has a gentle slope towards the
                    front; in pine-pits, however, it approaches more closely to the glass. The bark
                    is commonly five or six feet deep; but it may be questioned whether this depth
                    is not excessive and unnecessary. A bed about three and a half feet deep would
                    probably be more convenient, and afford a heat sufficient both in intensity and
                    duration for any useful purpose.</p>
                <p>We have already shewn how a system of tubes transmitting steam or hot-water may
                    be made available to the production of bottom heat. There is another method
                    worthy of at least a cursory notice, which is all that we can afford it. Its
                    invention is due to Mr M*Murtrie, and the apparatus is described at length in
                    <hi rend="subscript"> %</hi> the <hi rend="italic">Land.</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Hort.</hi><hi rend="italic">Trans,</hi> vol. vi. His contrivance will be
                    understood by an inspection of his pine-pit, of which a section and plan are
                    given in Plate CCXCII. figs. 8 and 9∙ A shallow bark bed, about two feet deep,
                    rests upon an arched chamber of single brick. 1 is the fire-place; 2 a fire-flue
                    running along the whole length of the chamber 4, which is also kept full of
                    steam by means of the boiler and pipe 3; the apertures 5 admit steam and heat
                    into the air of the pit, and of these there is one, both in back and front,
                    under each sash, capable of being stopped at pleasure. The waste-pipe 6 allows
                    the steam to escape, when the apertures marked 5 are shut-By the return of the
                    flue 2, the atmosphere of the house is heated; and by the joint action of the
                    inclosed part of the flue, and of the steam in the chamber, an abundant and
                    salubrious bottom heat is easily maintained.</p>
                <p>The proper management of bottom heat is a matter of some difficulty, and in this
                    there have been more failures than in any other part of the pine-apple culture.
                    The heat arising from violent fermentation, is greater than the tender roots can
                    bear, and if all watchfulness be not employed, the labour of many months may be
                    blasted in a single day. Mr Knight has discarded bottom heat altogether; but he
                    has not succeeded in convincing others that pine apples can be grown equally
                    well without it. Bottom heat is, however, almost universally kept too high.
                    Perhaps the upper limit of its temperature may be fixed at blood-heat, or at
                    most 100°, while the under or winter limit may be brought down to 70° or 75°.
                    Gardeners are accustomed to judge of the heat of the bed, by means of long
                    sticks pushed into it; these are occasionally drawn out and felt by the hand,
                    and a rough guess at the temperature is thus ob tained. A far preferable method
                    is to employ a slow thermometer slightly cased in wire.</p>

                <p><hi rend="italic">Soil.</hi> Various nice and minute directions have been given
                    respecting composts for ananas plants. Any compost, however, will be found
                    suitable, which is at once rich, fresh, and simple. Perhaps a mixture of the
                    top-spit, including the turf, of an old pasture, and about a half of good,
                    well-rotted dung, combines these qualities as completely as possible. When it is
                    necessary to lighten these materials, a compost of decayed leaves, and a little
                    sand, may be added. It is of importance that the compost, whatever it may be,
                    should be prepared a considerable time beforehand, and frequently turned over.
                    It should be broken with the spade, but not screened; and when used, it should
                    not be too moist. Pine-apple plants are found to shew fruit more readily in a
                    rich light soil, than in strong loam, but do not produce large fruit. In
                    selecting his compost, the cultivator must make his selection between these
                    advantages. At all events the soil must be rich; it can scarcely be too rich.
                    “The pine,” says an intelligent writer in the Gardener’s Magazine, vol. ix. “is
                    a gross feeder, and will thrive in vegetable manure, however rich and fresh.”
                    Liquid manures have been applied; but these, however useful when recent, prove
                    deleterious in a fermented state.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Propagation.</hi> The ananas is propagated by planting the
                    crowns or tufts which grow on the fruit, or the suckers which appear at the base
                    of the stem. These, when removed from the fruit or the stem, are laid aside for
                    a few days, till the scar at the place of separation have dried or healed, a
                    precaution to prevent their rotting; after which they are potted immediately.
                    Sometimes late in the season, they are merely thrust into exhausted tan, without
                    pots, where they remain till the following spring. In general the offsets should
                    be as large as possible. Speechly did not break off his suckers before they were
                    twelve or fourteen inches long, and he reserved only the largest crowns. These
                    large suckers and crowns grow with greater rapidity, and come sooner into fruit,
                    than those of smaller size: and in this, in truth, consists the principal secret
                    of what has been called the short method of culture, by which fruit is obtained
                    in a much briefer space of time than usual. The soil employed in propagation is
                    rather lighter than that afterwards applied. The pots may be from three to six
                    inches in diameter, and, to promote draining, should contain at bottom a layer
                    of shivers or clean gravel. For some time the plants are shaded from the rays of
                    the sun, and in about eight or ten days they receive a little water. As already
                    stated, the older and more common routine of pineapple culture embraces a period
                    of three years; but recent improvements have reduced these to two years, or even
                    to eighteen months. This has given rise to two modes of preparatory management,
                    which we shall notice separately, premising that the treatment in the
                    fruiting-house is the same in both.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Triennial Course.</hi> The plants which were potted in autumn,
                    are kept in the nursing-pit during winter, with a mild temperature, a slight
                    bottom heat, and a sparing allowance of water. About the beginning of April they
                    are transferred into larger pots, and are commonly shifted into hotbeds or pits
                    heated with stable dung, in which they are found to prosper exceedingly. Air is
                    given every day, and is copiously admitted, as soon as the sun’s rays have
                    acquired considerable power. During summer the average morning temperature may
                    be from 70° to 7 5° Fahrenheit, but in sunshine it may be allowed to rise to
                    85°, 9θ <hi rend="superscript"> o</hi>, or even more. The heat is maintained by
                    adding occasional linings of stable litter, and, when it is exhausted, the
                    plants are transferred into other beds or pits, more recently made up, and in
                    which fermentation is going on. In flued nursing-pits the management is
                    precisely the same. The bottom heat is aided by fresh additions of tan. As
                    nothing is to be dreaded from damp where there is a command of fire-heat, more
                    copious waterings may be given, and the plants may be syringed over head, or
                    slightly steamed, by throwing water on the flues. It is not very common to shift
                    the plants in the nursery during summer; but it is a good ride to have recourse
                    to that operation as often as the roots begin to mat on the sides of the pot.
                    Before the end of autumn, the young plants become vigorous. The lower part of
                    the stalk should then be thick, the centre or funnel formed by the leaves should
                    be upright, open, and rather short, and the leaves themselves not long nor very
                    numerous, but broad, stiff, succulent, and free from contortion and deformity.
                    Towards the end of autumn, the plants are taken into the succession-pit, which,
                    in fact, is only a nursing-pit on a large scale. The temperature for winter
                    should be about 60°. About the middle of March, they are shifted into pots nine
                    or ten inches in diameter. At this period, it is not uncommon, in compliance
                    with the recommendation of Abercrombie and the other older authorities, to cut
                    away the whole of the roots, and to re-pot the plant somewhat in the capacity of
                    a sucker. The reasons alleged for this extraordinary practice are, that the
                    pine-apple plant is continually pushing out roots at the surface, while those
                    below are rapidly dying; that the soil, in the course of three years, becomes
                    completely exhausted; and lastly, that this treatment prevents premature
                    starting in the course of the second year. This last reason is very
                    questionable, and it assumes that ananas plants <hi rend="italic">must</hi> be
                    treated for three years before they produce fruit. There is some force in the
                    other reasons, but they do not prove the absolute necessity of the practice.
                    Roots may be pruned without being removed altogether. The earth may be shaken
                    almost entirely away, and replaced by fresh compost, at the expense of only a
                    few fibres. Again, if, at every shifting, a small portion of the earth be taken
                    from below, as florists treat auriculas in pots, at the end of two years
                    scarcely any portion of the original soil will remain. The grand objection to
                    the operation is, the great and unnecessary check to vegetation, and the
                    consequent stuntedness of habit, which, in succulent plants of such an age, is
                    scarcely remediable. That it is possible to grow ananas without cutting away the
                    roots, is consistent with our own observation, and is borne out by the testimony
                    and practice of Griffin, Appleby, and other distinguished cultivators. When the
                    roots are removed, the plants must be shaded for some time, and be watered
                    sparingly, till they begin to grow freely. The summer temperature should be
                    comparatively warm, the range being from 65° to 70° of fire-heat, or during
                    night, and from 70° to 85° solar heat. Abundance of air is admitted, and the
                    plants are set widely, that they may have room to swell below, and become stout
                    and bushy.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Biennial Course.</hi> The method of culture which we have
                    denominated the biennial course, was first brought into notice by Abercrombie,
                    and more recently has been strenuously recommended by Baldwin. Its chief feature
                    is the acceleration of the growth of the plants by the application of higher
                    temperatures than it was formerly supposed they could bear. They are, in fact,
                    made to attain the growth of two summers in one.</p>
                <p>About the beginning of March, the most forward of the plants potted over winter,
                    or the suckers kept in tan, are taken out, the earth or tan shaken away, and the
                    roots shortened. They are then put into pots about five inches in diameter,
                    which are plunged into frames or pits heated with tan or stable litter. They are
                    shaded as usual, and after they begin to grow, receive moderate waterings. When
                    the roots appear around the balls of soil, which will be about the middle of
                    June, the plants are again shifted into larger pots, from six to seven inches in
                    diameter, and, if the heat be declining, are removed into other pits or beds. In
                    the beginning of August they are transferred into larger pots, in which, unless
                    they are intended for <pb break="no" facs="nls:193647714"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0711-7714-0663"/>early spring forcing, they stand during the
                    winter; and in February they are finally shifted into pots twelve or fourteen
                    inches in diameter. For spring forcing, the last shifting takes place in
                    October, and the pots may be two inches narrower. At every shifting the ball of
                    earth is preserved entire. From March the temperature is gradually increased;
                    little air is admitted, even in strong sunshine, and a lively bottom heat is
                    kept up by means of repeated linings. When there is danger of burning the roots,
                    the pots are partially drawn up, or even set upon the surface of the tan. The
                    following table will give an idea of the temperature (Fahrenheit’s thermometer)
                    and its progressive increase:</p>
                <p>During Night. During Day.</p>
                <p>March 60° to 70° 70° to 80 <hi rend="superscript"> a</hi></p>

                <p>June 80 — 85 100 — 120</p>
                <p>After the beginning of July, the heat is allowed to de cline by degrees, until it
                    arrive at the winter temperature of 60°. It is to be understood, however, that
                    these temperatures regard only stable dung or tan heat; and that too applied to
                    crowns, as the larger suckers seldom require more than 100°. Where fire-heat is
                    used, and it should always be through the medium of hot-water, the nocturnal
                    temperature should onlyapproach towards 80°; and there should be some expedient
                    for the <hi rend="italic">slow</hi> immission of steam into the atmosphere of
                    the pit. During the whole summer care is employed to prevent the plants from
                    being <hi rend="italic">drawn,</hi> and for this purpose they are allowed much
                    space, and are placed as near the glass as possible. In August and September
                    abundance of air, and more copious supplies of water, arc given. In winter the
                    chief care is to preserve the roots from damping off, and for this reason,
                    though it is not the common practice, we should prefer winter pits having at
                    least the command of fire-heat.</p>
                <p>This mode of <hi rend="italic">driving,</hi> as it has been significantly called,
                    is applicable only to the varieties called the Queen, and Ripley’s New Queen.
                    The large growing sorts require a longer period. For this reason it is desirable
                    that both courses of culture should be carried on at one time. The large
                    varieties might be consigned to the triennial course, while the vacancies in
                    either might be made up from the other. That this is practicable, at least in
                    gardens where there are two fruiting houses, may be seen from the tabular
                    compendium of culture given below.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Fruiting-House.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> About the
                    beginning of August, the plants, now two years old, are shifted for the last
                    time. The pots are from twelve to fourteen inches in diameter, and the balls are
                    preserved entire. About eight or ten days previously, the bark-pit of the
                    fruiting-house has been cleared out, the old tan screened, if necessary, and
                    fresh material supplied. The pots are then plunged into the bark as deeply as
                    can be done with safety, and the plants are so treated as to keep them in a
                    growing state during the whole of autumn. In winter, the nocturnal temperature
                    is kept at 60°; but towards the end of January it is gradually raised to 70°.
                    This rise, however, should follow, and not precede or be a cause of, the vernal
                    growth of the plants. About the middle of February, the second fruiting-house
                    may be prepared, for the reception of the plants in the biennial succession pit.
                    These are existing in a mild temperature, and start during the general progress
                    of the season.</p>
                <p>That period at which pine-apple plants first shew their fruit-stalks, or, as it
                    is technically termed, <hi rend="italic">start,</hi> is the most critical in
                    their whole culture. It is generally desirable that this should happen at a
                    certain age, and at a particular season; but these are circumstances over which
                    the cultivator can scarcely be said to have a direct control, and accordingly,
                    while the most successful can hardly deem themselves beyond the reach of
                    failure, the less skilful are almost sure to err. We are not aware that the <hi
                    rend="italic">rationale</hi> of starting has been investigated on the principles
                    of vegetable physiology; and it is certain that the most absurd practices have
                    been resorted to, in order to force the plants into fruit. We pretend not to
                    give a theory: but a few practical remarks may be of advantage. It is evident,
                    then, that the plant must be of a certain age, or at least of a certain
                    magnitude, before it will start freely or to good purpose. Suckers of the first
                    year are wholly taken up with the production of roots and foliage; and if any of
                    them happen to start, they exhibit little more than a tuft of leaves where the
                    fruit should be. In the second year a Queen pine is capable of producing a
                    perfect fruit; and in the third year the New Providence and other large
                    varieties arrive at puberty. The solid part of the stem is then observed to have
                    increased in bulk, and to have ascended considerably above the soil. It is of
                    more practical importance, however, to remark, that the fruit-stalks do not
                    appear until the pot is filled with roots. Apparent exceptions there may be to
                    this principle, but in every case where it does not hold good, the plant will be
                    found to be diseased, or the roots to have been violently destroyed. The grower
                    should therefore take care that the roots shall have nearly occupied all the new
                    soil before the end of autumn, and that in the course of the winter the tender
                    fibres be not exsiccated by drought, or rotted by excessive moisture. Again, it
                    is probable that at starting there is a peculiar check in the growth of the
                    plant, which causes it to divert the sap from the formation of leaves, and, like
                    most other vegetables in straitened circumstances, to provide the means of
                    reproduction, by throwing out flower-buds. This diversion of the sap is
                    influenced by the quantity of vigorous fibres, for it is observed that when,
                    from some accident, plants not well furnished in this respect, do shew fruit,
                    they bestow the greater part of the sap upon the leaves. Further, it is not a
                    mere suspension of vegetation, otherwise fruit would be produced by every plant
                    which has had the roots cut from it in the manner noticed above. Lastly, it is
                    probable that the proper check consists in a transition from growth, however
                    slight, to a temporary suspension of vegetation, which again is followed by a
                    copious flow of the sap, circumstances which, as might be easily shewn, occur
                    both in the winter and summer starting. If these imperfect observations be
                    correct, it follows that starting is a natural process, requiring certain
                    conditions in the state of the plant, and therefore not to be forced by violent
                    treatment, or any sudden changes in temperature and watering.</p>
                <p>After the plants have shewn fruit, they are never shifted; but the surface soil
                    may be removed, and replaced by a little fresh and rich compost. Water is
                    supplied from time to time as necessity requires; but it is impossible to give
                    any definite rule on this subject. The observant gardener will soon, from
                    experience, discover the proper measure. Water should never be given in a colder
                    state than the average temperature of the house; when, therefore, there is no
                    tank within the house, the watering-pots should be filled, and left in the house
                    for some time before the •water be applied. Fire-heat is kept up either
                    continuously or at intervals, during the greater part of the season. It should
                    always be moderate, never exceeding, by itself, 7θ <hi rend="superscript">
                    o</hi> ∙ During sunshine, the temperature may range from 70° to 100°. The
                    greater proportion there is of the latter the better. Whilst the fruit is
                    swelling, care must be taken to carry on the growth of the plant with equability
                    and moderation. Violent checks are pernicious: they debilitate the stalk, and
                    cause a stringiness in the fruit. As the fruit approaches maturity, water is
                    gradually withheld, lest the flavour should be injured. Pine-apples should be
                    cut a short time before they attain complete maturity. The <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193647727" xml:id="kp-eb0711-7727-0664"/>larger varieties will keep
                    only a day or two; the smaller varieties a week or more.</p>
                <p>The following tabular compendium is from Abercrombie, altered, however, in some
                    of its details, to suit the idea of two crops a-year. To execute this plan, two
                    fruiting-houses or pits, and one succession-pit, would be required, together
                    with a variety of hot-beds, or pits for the nursing department. It is necessary
                    to premise, that crowns and suckers are usually potted soon after they are taken
                    off, and that August 15. may be considered the date at which the whole
                    operations of potting should be finished. When there is only a biennial course,
                    it commences from about February 14.</p>

                <p>I he <hi rend="smallcaps">Melonry</hi> —a department deriving its name from the
                    melon, the principal plant cultivated in it—is an important appendage of the
                    forcing garden. After noticing some of the most necessary apparatus employed in
                    it, we shall treat of the melon, cucumber, &amp;c., and their culture
                    respectively.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">common hot-bed frame</hi> is most usually employed, and is
                    so well known, as scarcely to require description. It is a rectangular box, with
                    sliding sashes, which are single, in pairs, or in threes. The length of the sash
                    is five or six feet, and its breadth about three feet and a half. The back of
                    the frame is about double the height of the front, and the slope is set towards
                    the south. When used, it is placed on a bed of fermenting stable litter, from
                    three to six feet in thickness, according to the purpose to which it is to be
                    applied, or the severity of the season.</p>
                <p>The Alderston Melon Pit, of which fig. 6, Plate CCXCIII. is a section, is partly
                    above and partly below ground. The front and back walls <hi rend="italic">a,
                    a,</hi> are of brick, supported on piers or stone pillars: <hi rend="italic">b,
                    b,</hi> are spaces inclosed within outer walls, and covered with boards to
                    contain linings, which communicate, without any object intervening, with the
                    fermenting substances in the interior of the pit. These spaces may be two feet
                    wide: the interior pit should seldom be more than six feet in breadth. A
                    principal quality of this structure is its neatness and cleanliness. <hi

                <p>West’s Melon and Cucumber Pit is also built of brick. It has, Plate CCXCIII. fig.

                <p>Atkinson’s Melon Pit, Plate CCXCII. fig. 10, is a brick structure. The back wall
                    <hi rend="italic">a</hi> and the end walls are four inches thick, built in the
                    pigeon-hole fashion, that is, with square interstices between the bricks. The
                    front wall <hi rend="italic">b</hi> is double: the interior portion is brick in
                    bed, the exterior brick on edge, with piers under each rafter. The included

                    experience of the Horticultural Society of London, has been found “far superior

                <p>The extent of the melonry must depend upon the size of the garden, and the amount
                    of the demand. Where there is a large family, and especially where pine-apples
                    are cultivated (to the forwarding of which some portion of the melonry may
                    frequently be auxiliary), sixty or seventy sashes may be considered as a
                    moderate complement.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="smallcaps">Melon</hi><hi rend="italic">(Cucumis</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Meld)</hi> has long been cultivated in Britain, but the period of
                    its introduction and its native country are not well ascertained. The plant is a
                    tender annual, requiring considerable care and skill to rear it in perfection;
                    but it repays the labours of the horticulturist by affording a large, and to
                    most persons a highly palatable fruit. The varieties are numerous, and, from
                    their tendency to sport or vary, are rather fugitive in their duration. Many of
                    the old favourites have disappeared, and those at present in vogue will
                    doubtless take the same course, or will at least assume new forms, while they
                    retain their old names. In these circumstances, it is deemed unnecessary to
                    enter into minute description, or to do more than give a list of the sorts at
                    present deserving of cultivation. It may be premised, that they all belong to
                    the species usually called the Musk-Melon. The Water melon <pb break="no"

                <p>It is important that none but such seeds as have been procured from approved
                    genuine specimens of the several sorts should be sown. In general, the fresher
                    or more recent that garden seeds are, the better; but the case is different with
                    the melon. Here it is desirable that the seeds should have been kept in a dry
                    state for some years: it is found that plants produced from recent seeds push
                    too vigorously, sending their shoots to a great length before they shew a single
                    fruit; while those from old seeds are less luxuriant in growth, but more
                    fruitful.</p>
                <p>The melon succeeds best in a strong, rich soil. A compost, formed of two-thirds
                    of rotted turf, and one-third of old cow-dung, will be found very suitable. This
                    should be prepared for a year or two before it be employed in the melon
                    frame.</p>
                <p>There are generally several, perhaps three, successive crops of melons raised in
                    large gardens. It is seldom expedient to sow before the middle or end of
                    January, and sometimes it is soon enough a month later. A seed-bed capable of
                    receiving a frame with a single sash is previously prepared. This bed, composed
                    of fermenting stable litter, should be of considerable thickness, perhaps about
                    five feet. Immediately upon its formation, the frame and sash are placed on it,
                    and they are kept close till the heat begin to rise, when the hot vapour is
                    permitted to escape. Three or four days after the bed has been formed, it is
                    covered over to the depth of three inches with earth prepared beforehand. Rich,
                    light, dry earth, is best adapted for this purpose; and that it may be dry
                    enough, it is proper to use such as may have been protected from rain during
                    winter. A few small flower-pots are filled with the same earth, and kept in the
                    hot-bed, that the soil in them may acquire a suitable temperature. The seeds are
                    then sown in the flower-pots, and covered half an inch deep; after which the
                    pots are plunged a little way into the earth of the bed.</p>
                <p>When hot vapour rises copiously, fresh air is admitted by raising the sash a
                    little. The frame is covered every evening by sunset with mats, and is again
                    exposed in the morning about nine o’clock, sooner or later according to the
                    state of the weather. A single mat is sufficient at first, as the heat in the
                    bed is generally strong. In two or three days after the seed has been sown, the
                    plants appear, when the glasses are raised a little, to admit fresh air, and
                    permit the escape of vapour. Unless this be done, the plants are apt either to
                    damp off or become yellow and sickly. To guard against the casualties of the
                    season, and the chance of miscarriage, it is proper to make two other sowings at
                    short intervals, so that, if any accident befall the first plants, the others
                    may supply their place. Two or three days after the plants have come up, they
                    are transplanted into other small pots, only two or three being put in each pot.
                    If the earth be very dry, it is now moistened with a little tepid water. The
                    pots are then plunged into the earth, and much care and watchfulness are
                    employed to prevent the roots from being scorched. When the transplanted
                    seedlings begin to grow, they are watered occasionally in the warmest part of
                    the day. As the heat of the hot-bed declines, it is supported by linings,
                    applied from time to time, around its outer surface. The lining should not
                    exceed fifteen or eighteen inches in thickness, and should rise above the level
                    of the bed, upon the sides of the frame.</p>
                <p>About a month after the seeds have been sown, hot-beds or pits are prepared for
                    the reception of the young plants. For the first crop, it is generally found
                    that hot-beds are preferable. These are formed about three feet and a half
                    thick, and of such extent as to receive several frames of two or three lights
                    each. The same precautions with respect to vapour, and other matters connected
                    with the fermentation, are observed as in the seed-bed. When the violence of the
                    heat has begun to subside, the surface of the bed is covered, to the depth of
                    two inches, with dry, light earth; and under the centre of each sash, a conical
                    heap of the same soil is raised to the height of ten inches. By the following
                    day, the earth generally acquires a sufficient warmth, and the bed is ready for
                    the reception of the plants. The pots containing the young plants should be well
                    watered the day previous to their being <hi rend="italic">ridged out,</hi> to
                    make the ball adhere together, and come out of the pot entire. After the tops of
                    the hillocks of earth have been flattened a little, in the centre of each a hole
                    is made capable of containing one of the balls of earth which is to be turned
                    out of the pots. Some of the pots containing the strongest plants are selected,
                    and the young melon-plants are plunged out, with balls entire, into the ridges
                    or hillocks already mentioned. After this operation has been performed, they
                    receive a gentle watering. The sashes are replaced, and for some time, unless
                    the vapour be strong, little air is given. Care is taken to prevent the tender
                    fibres from being scorched. When the roots begin to show themselves through the
                    surface of the hillocks, a quantity of fresh earth is applied all around them,
                    and in a week or fortnight after, the whole surface of the bed is covered nearly
                    as high as the top of the hills.</p>
                <p>When the plants have got two or three rough leaves, the top of the stalklet,
                    which now begins to elongate, is pinched off, and from the axillae of the leaves
                    lateral shoots are soon shot forth. These are fastened down with pegs, and are
                    so disposed as regularly to cover the surface of the bed. These laterals will
                    sometimes show flowers at the second or third joints; if they do not, they are
                    topped in their turn, and afford laterals, which seldom fail to be fruitful. As
                    these runners advance, they are trained along the surface, and all weak useless
                    shoots are removed. This should be done frequently, as it is found injurious to
                    cut out a great quantity of shoots and foliage at one time. No plant, as has
                    been shown by Mr Knight <hi rend="italic">(Hortic. Trans,</hi> vol. i.), is more
                    beholden to its leaves, both as respects health and flavour of fruit, than the
                    melon.</p>
                <p>It is seldom proper to leave more than one fruit on each shoot, and in the large
                    kinds perhaps not more than four or five fruit should be left on one plant. When
                    the fruit begins to swell, a slate or piece of tile is laid under each, to
                    separate it from the damp soil of the bed. During the process of growth, the
                    fruit is usually turned about once a-week, to expose all sides to the rays of
                    the sun; but, in turning, care must be taken not to twist the foot-stalk, as
                    this would destroy the fruit altogether. At this period water is given with
                    moderation, and abundance of air is admitted. The fruit should be gathered
                    before it be quite ripe. Its approaching maturity is known by the appearance of
                    a number of cracks near the footstalk, and by the emission of a rich odour. It
                    is cut in the morning, and is kept in a cool place till served up; if this
                    precaution be not attended to, there will be a considerable deficiency of
                    flavour.</p>
                <p>The average heat required for the successful growth of melons is about 70°
                    Fahrenheit. In the common hot-bed, this is maintained by defending the bed
                    during the night, and by applying linings from time to time. In pits heated by
                    hot-water circulation, this is easily effected at any season; and were it not
                    that the included air is apt to become too dry, especially in winter, when much
                    heat is required, such pits would doubtless supersede the hot-bed frame
                    altogether. At present the old methods, partly it may be from custom, <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193647753" xml:id="kp-eb0711-7753-0666"/> are still
                    principally employed. It is unnecessary to give minute directions respecting the
                    management of melons in pits; as, in these, the mode of procedure recommended
                    for hot-beds, with some trifling variations, will also prove successful.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="smallcaps">Cucumber</hi><hi rend="italic">(Cucumis sativus),</hi>
                    like the melon, is a tender annual, requiring the assistance of artificial heat.
                    It properly belongs to the class of culinary vegetables, being used in salads
                    and pickles, and has long been cultivated in this country. Its culture, however,
                    requires the closest attention of the gardener. The sorts commonly grown
                    are,</p>
                <p>The Early Frame, Green Turkèy,</p>
                <p>Long Prickly, White Turkey,</p>
                <p>Short Prickly, White Spined.</p>
                <p>Of these, the long and short prickly are well suited for ridges in the open
                    air.</p>
                <p>The culture of early cucumbers so much resembles that of the melon, that it would
                    be useless repetition to enter into minute details. The cucumber, indeed, is
                    somewhat the hardier, and therefore in summer requires less heat; but in every
                    other respect the management of the plants is precisely the same. The first crop
                    of cucumbers is generally sown in the end of December, or the beginning of
                    January; a second in March, and a third in June. In summer, cucumber plants,
                    after they have been fairly established, require scarcely any other attention
                    than to thin them out occasionally, and to supply them with water.</p>
                <p>Cucumbers, particularly the prickly sorts, are often raised in the warmer months
                    under hand glasses. A cavity is made in a border in front of a wall or other
                    warm place, and is filled with hot dung. This dung is covered with earth, and
                    two or three plants are put into it, and sheltered with a hand-glass. They are
                    watered and dressed from time to time; and by this means a sufficient supply of
                    small cucumbers, or <hi rend="italic">girkens,</hi> is obtained for
                    pickling.</p>
                <p>In the southern counties of England, pickling cucumbers are easily raised without
                    any artificial heat, being sown in drills in the open ground. The earth is made
                    fine and level, and shallow circular hollows are formed with the hand, a foot
                    -wide, and half an inch deep in the middle. The distance between each hollow is
                    three feet and a half, and the distance between the rows five or six feet. Eight
                    or ten seeds are deposited in each cavity. This is done in the beginning of
                    June. When the plants appear, they are thinned out to three or four, the weakest
                    or least healthy being rejected. They are watered occasionally, according to the
                    state of the weather. The cucumbers are gathered chiefly from the middle to the
                    end of August. Vast quantities of these open ground girkens are taken to the
                    London market. The village of Sandy, in Bedfordshire, has been known to furnish
                    10,000 bushels of drilled cucumbers in one week.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Gourds,</hi> species or varieties of the species of the
                    genus <hi rend="italic">Cucurbita,</hi> may be grown like drilled cucumbers, or
                    trained against walls or on pales. Though occasionally used as esculents, they
                    are regarded chiefly as curiosities. The <hi rend="italic">Succada,</hi> or
                    vegetable marrow, is a very useful sort, and in request for the table, being
                    eaten stewed with sauce or mashed like turnips. It may be raised in an exhausted
                    melon-frame or pit; or it may be sown under a hand-glass, and afterwards
                    transplanted into a good aspect, and trained against a wall or trellis.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="smallcaps">Mushroom</hi><hi rend="italic">(Agaricus</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">campestris),</hi> though not properly an inmate of the melonry,
                    may appropriately enough, from the nature of its culture, be taken along with
                    the plants grown in this department of the garden. It is a well-known fungus, a
                    general favourite, and esteemed a delicacy during winter and the spring
                    months.</p>
                <p>Mushrooms used to be grown in ridges or prepared beds, in sheds, or covered with
                    litter in the open air. Of late years, the Russian form of the mushroom-house
                    has been introduced into Britain by Mr Isaac Oldacre, and is now in very general
                    use. Its arrangement may be seen by inspecting the back part of the vinery fig.
                    3, Plate CCXCI. Two tiers of boxes, three in each tier, and supported by a
                    strong frame-work, are constructed round the whole house, with the exception of
                    the spaces occupied by a door and two windows. The boxes may be from two feet
                    and a half to three feet and a half broad, and about a foot deep. The house is
                    supposed to be heated by hot-water circulation. In the centre <hi rend="italic"
                    >d</hi> is a narrow pit, by which the house may be worked by means of fermenting
                    litter instead of the hot-water, or in which rhubarb stalks, &amp;c. may be
                    forced. The windows are furnished with shutters to regulate the admission of
                    light, and are moveable, to permit the ingress of air.</p>
                <p>Mushrooms are propagated from what is technically called <hi rend="italic"
                    >spawn,</hi> which is a collection of vegetable threads pervading dried dung or
                    other similar substance, having the smell of mushrooms, and apparently the
                    fungus in its undeveloped state. It may be obtained from old pastures, decayed
                    mushroom beds, or purchased from nurserymen in the form of <hi rend="italic"
                    >bricks</hi> charged with spawn. When once obtained, it may, like leaven, be
                    indefinitely preserved. If not otherwise procured, it may be produced, or in a
                    manner generated, by placing quantities of horse-dung and rich earth in
                    alternate layers, and covering the whole with straw, to exclude the rain and
                    air. Mushroom spawn commonly appears in the heap in about two months after the
                    dung and earth have been laid together. The droppings of stall-fed horses, or of
                    such as have been kept on dry food, are found preferable for this purpose.</p>
                <p>The old method of growing mushrooms has been referred to above; and, as it has
                    some conveniences, particularly for those who have not extensive apparatus, it
                    may be proper to give some account of it. The beds are formed of horse-droppings
                    which have been laid out for some time without having fermented, and may be made
                    two or three feet broad, and of any length. A layer of dung about eight or ten
                    inches thick is first deposited, and covered with light dryish earth to the
                    depth of two or three inches; then another layer of dung of the same thickness,
                    covered like the former; and lastly a third layer, with its covering. The whole
                    should grow narrower as it advances in height. When the bed is finished, it is
                    covered with straw to protect it from rain, and from the parching influences of
                    the sun and wind. In ten days the bed will be ready for planting or spawning.
                    Pieces of spawn bricks are inserted in the sloping sides of the bed, about four
                    or five inches asunder. A layer of fine earth is then placed over the bed, and
                    the whole is covered with a thick coat of straw. When the weather is temperate,
                    mushrooms will appear in about a month after the bed has been made; but at other
                    times, a much longer period may elapse. The principal things to be attended to
                    are to preserve a moderate state of moisture, and a proper degree of warmth; and
                    the treatment at different seasons must vary accordingly.</p>
                <p>Of the many other methods of raising mushrooms, Mr Oldacre’s, already referred
                    to, may deserve to be particularised. In forming the compost, he procures fresh
                    short dung from a stable, or from the path of a horse-mill. To this is added
                    about a fifth part of sheep-droppings, or of the cleanings of a cowhouse, or of
                    a mixture of both. The whole ingredients are thoroughly mixed and incorporated.
                    A stratum of the prepared mixture, about three inches thick, being deposited in
                    the boxes already described, is beat together with a flat wooden mallet. Another
                    layer is added, and beat as before; and this is repeated till the beds <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193647766" xml:id="kp-eb0711-7766-0667"/> be rather more
                    than half a foot thick, and very compact. The boxes are then placed in the
                    mushroom-house, or any out-house where a slightly increased temperature can be
                    commanded. A degree of fermentation generally takes place; but if heat be not
                    soon perceptible, another layer must still be added, till sufficient action be
                    excited. When the beds are milk-warm, or between 80° and 9Q <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 0</hi> Fahrenheit, some holes are dibbled in the mass to
                    receive the spawn. The holes are left open for some time; and when the heat is
                    on the decline, but before it be quite gone, a piece of spawn-brick is thrust
                    into each opening, and the holes are closed with a little compost. A week
                    afterwards the boxes are covered with a smooth coating, an inch and half thick,
                    of rich mould mixed with about a fifth part of horse-droppings. The apartment is
                    now kept as nearly and equably at 55° Fahrenheit as circumstances will allow.
                    When the boxes become dry, a little soft water may be sprinkled over them, but
                    sparingly and with circumspection. The more that free air can be admitted, the
                    flavour of the mushrooms is the better; but the exclusion of frost is
                    indispensable. If a number of boxes have been prepared at first, a few only at a
                    time may be covered with mould and brought into bearing, the rest being covered
                    and cropped in succession, as mushrooms may be in demand.</p>
                <p>Mr Edward Callow, in a tract on the artificial growth of mushrooms, describes a
                    method in which the pits are wrought by means of dung heat. His structure
                    somewhat resembles Atkinson’s melon-pit, only the roof is covered with thatch,
                    and a suite of air-flues is formed within the interior of the pit, with branches
                    crossing the principal bed which occupies the floor. Linings of fermenting
                    litter are applied on the exterior of the house at the back and front. The
                    atmosphere of the pit, in the earlier stage, is kept at 55° to 65° Fahrenheit,
                    and when the bed is in full bearing, about 70°. The other details of this method
                    scarcely differ from those of Mr Oldacre’s.</p>
                <p>KITCHEN GARDEN.</p>
                <p>In this department those plants are cultivated which, after being subjected to
                    various culinary processes, are used as articles of food. They may be enumerated
                    in the order of their importance, each, for the sake of precision, being
                    accompanied by its botanical name.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Cabbage Tribe.</hi></p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Brassica</hi><hi rend="italic">oleracea,</hi><hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Lin.</hi> is a plant indigenous to our rocky shores; but no
                    one, seeing it waving in its native habitat, could possibly anticipate that it
                    would ever appear in our gardens, disguised as the ponderous drumhead or
                    sugar-loaf cabbage, or on our tables as the delicate cauliflower and broccoli.
                    The cultivated varieties are numerous; but the following are the most
                    important.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Common White</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">Cabbage.</hi> The
                    economical uses of this vegetable are well known. Its principal subvarieties are
                    the following:</p>
                <p>Small Early Dwarf, East Ham,</p>
                <p>Early May, Large Sugar-loaf,</p>
                <p>Dwarf Vanack. Drumhead,</p>
                <p>Early York, Scotch,</p>
                <p>Chinese, Tronchuda.</p>
                <p>The first three are adapted for early crops; the next three for use in the end of
                    summer and autumn, and the others for winter. The leaf-stalks of the Tronchuda
                    are used like sea-cale.</p>
                <p>The Cabbage is propagated from seed, which may be sown in beds four feet wide,
                    and covered over with a thin layer of earth. The proper seasons for this
                    operation are file middle of August, the beginning of March, and Midsummer. By
                    observing these times, and employing different sorts, the succession may be kept
                    up through the year. For the early spring crops, the late sown plants are in
                    October transferred from the seed-bed to some open and well manured ground,
                    where they are arranged in rows two feet asunder. The principal supply may be
                    put out in February, affording the larger sorts more width between the rows. The
                    crops sown in spring are planted out in May and June. For subsequent culture,
                    all that is necessary is, to keep the ground clear of weeds, and to draw up the
                    soil about the stems. In some situations watering in summer is beneficial.</p>
                <p>The cabbages grown late in autumn and in beginning of winter are denominated <hi
                    rend="italic">Coleworts,</hi> from a kindred vegetable no longer cultivated. The
                    object is to have them with open or slightly closed hearts. Two sowings are
                    made, in the middle of June and in July, and the seedlings, when they acquire
                    sufficient strength, are planted out in lines, a foot or fifteen inches asunder,
                    and eight or ten inches in the rows.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">The Red Cabbage,</hi> of which the large or Dutch red is the
                    common variety, is much used for pickling. It is sown along with the white
                    varieties in August and in spring, and the culture is in every respect the
                    same.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="smallcaps">Savoy.</hi> This variety, like the preceding, forms into
                    a close head, but is distinguished by the wrinkling of its leaves. It is a very
                    useful vegetable during the winter months. The principal subvarieties are the
                    Early Green, the Yellow, and the Winter, of each of which there are various
                    forms. The seed is sown in autumn and in the end of spring, and two plantings
                    may take place, in April, and in June or July.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Brussels Sprouts.</hi> This vegetable is allied to the
                    foregoing, but does not close or cabbage. From the axillae of the stem-leaves
                    proceed little rosettes or sprouts, which resemble savoy cabbages in miniature.
                    The seed should be sown in spring, and the seedlings planted out before
                    midsummer, during showery weather. In October the plants should have additional
                    earth drawn to their roots, to firm them, and save them from being destroyed by
                    frost. The earliest sprouts become fit for use in November, and they continue
                    good, or even improving in quality, till the month of March following. Mr Van
                    Mons of Brussels mentions <hi rend="italic">{London Hortic.Mem N&lt;A.</hi>
                    iii.), that by successive sowings the sprouts are there obtained for the greater
                    part of the year. In spring, when the plants have a tendency to run to flower,
                    their growth is checked by lifting them, and replanting them in a slanting
                    direction, in a cool shady situation.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Open Kale.</hi> The principal subvarieties are:</p>
                <p>German Greens, or Curlies, Buda Kale,</p>
                <p>Scotch Kale, or Green Borecole, Jerusalem Kale,</p>
                <p>Purple, or Brown Kale, AVoburn Kale.</p>
                <p>Delaware Greens,</p>
                <p>Of these the three first are considered the most valuable, and are the sorts
                    chiefly cultivated in this country. The seed is sown at various times from
                    February to May, and the seedlings are planted out in moist weather during
                    summer, in rows two feet asunder. The Buda Kale is sown in May, planted out in
                    September, and being hardy, affords a supply in the following spring.</p>
                <p>Of the <hi rend="smallcaps">Turnip-rooted Cabbage,</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >Kohl-rube,</hi> there are two varieties, one swelling above ground, the other
                    in it. There is nothing peculiar in the culture, unless that, in the case of the
                    first mentioned, the earth should not be drawn so high as to cover the globular
                    part of the stem, which is the part used. The seed may be sown in the beginning
                    of June, and the seedlings transplanted in July; they are thus fit for use at
                    the. approach of winter.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Cauliflower.</hi> This variety is cultivated for the sake of
                    the flower-buds, which form a large dense cluster or head, and afford one of the
                    most delicate products of the <pb break="no" facs="nls:193647779"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0711-7779-0668"/>kitchen-garden. There are three subvarieties, the
                    Early, the Late, and the Reddish-stalked; but these seem to present scarcely any
                    well-marked distinction.</p>
                <p>The sowing, for the first or spring crop, is made in the latter half of the month
                    of August; and, in the neighbourhood of London, the growers adhere as nearly as
                    possible to the 21st day. A second sowing takes place in February on a slight
                    hot-bed, and a third in April or May.</p>
                <p>The cauliflower being tender, the young plants require protection in winter. For
                    this purpose they are sometimes pricked out in a warm situation ąt the foot of a
                    wall with a southern exposure, where, in severe weather, they are also covered
                    with hoops and mats. A better method is to plant them thickly in the ground
                    under a common hot-bed frame, and to secure them from cold by coverings, and
                    from damp, by giving air in mild weather. For a very early supply, it is useful
                    to be at the pains of potting a few scores of plants; these are to be kept under
                    glass during winter, and plunged out in spring, defending them with a
                    hand-glass, and watering them when needful. Sometimes, as in marketgardens,
                    patches of three or four plants are sheltered by hand-glasses throughout the
                    winter in the open border. It is advantageous to prick out the spring-sown
                    plants into some sheltered place, before they be finally transplanted and
                    committed to the open ground in May. The later crop, the transplantation of
                    which may take place at various times, is treated like early cabbages.
                    Cauliflower succeeds best in a rich soil and a warm situation. After planting,
                    all that is necessary is to hoe the ground, and draw up the soil about the
                    roots.</p>
                <p>It is found that this vegetable, being induced to form its large and crowded
                    clusters of flower-buds in the autumn, may be kept in perfection over winter.
                    Cauliflowers which have been planted out in July, will be nearly ready for use
                    in October. Towards the end of that month, the most compact and best shaped arc
                    selected and lifted carefully with the spade, keeping a ball of earth attached
                    to the roots. Some of the large outside leaves are removed, in order that the
                    plants may occupy less room, and at the same time, any points of leaves that
                    immediately overhang the flower are cut off. Where there are peach-houses or
                    vineries the plants may be arranged in the borders of these, together, but
                    without touching. Or they may be placed in the same manner in hot-bed frames: In
                    mild dry weather the glass frames are drawn off, but they are kept close in
                    rain; and in severe frost they are thickly covered with mats. In this way
                    cauliflower may be kept in an excellent state for several months.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Broccoli</hi> has a close affinity to cauliflower, being,
                    like it, of Italian origin, and differing chiefly in the greater hardiness of
                    its constitution. The subvarieties are numerous, and exceedingly diversified.
                    The following are those which are in most repute at present. The first five
                    produce their buds in autumn, the others in spring:</p>
                <p>Purple Cape, Cream-coloured,</p>
                <p>Green Cape, Sulphur-coloured,</p>
                <p>Grange’s Early, Spring White,</p>
                <p>Early Purple, Late Purple,</p>
                <p>Early White, Late Danish.</p>
                <p>Of the autumnal sorts there should be two sowings, one in the middle of April,
                    and one in the middle of May. As the plants acquire strength they are shifted
                    into the open ground, where they are placed in lines two feet apart. The Cape
                    varieties are of great excellence, being of a delicious flavour when dressed;
                    but on account of the plants being apt to start into flower, their cultivatioyι
                    has in many places been neglected, With proper management, however, this
                    tendency may be overruled. The first sowing may be made on any border of light
                    soil, scattering the seed very sparingly. In about a month the plants may be
                    transferred directly into a quarter consisting of sandy loam, well enriched with
                    rotten dung. The greater part of the second crop should be planted in pots
                    likewise directly from the seed-bed. These pots are to be sunk in the open
                    ground till the heads be formed; and in the end of November they are to be
                    placed under a glass frame, where very fine broccoli may be produced during the
                    severest weather of winter. Mr Ronalds of Brentford recommends <hi rend="italic"
                    >(London Hortic. Ťrans.</hi> vol. iii.) that the Early White, which is also a
                    very fine sort, should be sown on a hot-bed, and treated like the secondary crop
                    of cauliflower.</p>
                <p>The spring varieties are extremely valuable, as they come at a season when the
                    finer vegetables are scarce. They are sown in the middle of March or the
                    beginning of April, and afford a supply from March to May inclusive of the
                    following year.</p>
                <p>To obtain seed of the Brassica tribe, true specimens of the different varieties
                    should be selected, in such a state of advancement as that they will flower as
                    early as possible in spring. They should be planted in an open situation, and
                    kept as far apart from other kinds of the same tribe as may be. As they are very
                    liable to <hi rend="italic">cross</hi> or hybridize, it is perhaps better,
                    except in the case of some favourite variety, to procure supplies from a
                    respectable seedsman, from whom they are almost uniformly to be had genuine, the
                    extensive seed-growers being at great pains to prevent intermixture of
                    crops.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Leguminous Plants.</hi></p>
                <p>Of the <hi rend="smallcaps">Pea</hi><hi rend="italic">(Pisum</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">sativum),</hi> there are two principal varieties, the Field or
                    gray hog pea, and the Garden Pea. The latter alone requires our attention here.
                    Its chief subvarieties are:</p>
                <p>Early Frame, Knight’s Tall Marrowfat,</p>
                <p>Early Charlton, Dwarf Marrowfat,</p>
                <p>Bishop’s Dwarf" Prussian Blue,</p>
                <p>Dwarf Marrowfat, Prussian Green,</p>
                <p>Tall Marrowfat, Leadman’s Dwarf,</p>
                <p>Imperial, Sugar.</p>
                <p>The first three are suitable for early crops, and the others for successional
                    supplies. In the sugar pea, of which there are two sorts, the tall and dwarf,
                    the inner filmy lining of the pod is absent, and the young legumes are used like
                    kidney-beans.</p>
                <p>The first crop of pease is sown about the beginning of November, in front of a
                    south wall; and these, after they have appeared above ground, are defended by
                    spruce-fir branches, or other spray, throughout the winter. In January and
                    February other sowings are made, and sometimes the seed is put into flower-pots
                    and boxes, and the young plants afterwards plunged out in spring. From the end
                    of February moderate sowings should be made twice a month till the middle of
                    August, thus ensuring a supply of successive crops of delicate green pease. For
                    the latest crops the early frame and the Charlton are the best. Pease are sown
                    in rows from three to five feet asunder, according to the height which the
                    different sorts are known usually to attain. As they grow up the earth is drawn
                    up to the roots, and the stems are supported with stakes, a practice which, in a
                    well kept garden, is always advisable, although it is said that the early
                    varieties, when recumbent, arrive sooner at maturity.</p>
                <p>The early crops come into use in May and June, and by repeated sowings, the
                    supplies are prolonged to November. Pease grown late in autumn are subject to
                    mildew, to obviate which, Mr Knight has proposed the following method. The
                    ground is dug over in the usual way, and the spaces to be occupied by the future
                    rows of pease are well soaked with water. The mould on each side is then
                    collected, so as to form ridges seven or eight inches high, and these ridges are
                    well watered. On these the <pb break="no" facs="nls:193647792"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0711-7792-0669"/>seed is sown in single rows. If dry weather at any
                    time set in, water is supplied profusely once a-week. In this way the plants
                    continue green and vigorous resisting mildew, and not yielding till subdued by
                    frost.</p>
                <p>Of the <hi rend="smallcaps">Garden-bean</hi><hi rend="italic">(Faba
                    vulgaris),</hi> amongst many varieties may be mentioned:</p>
                <p>The Early Mazagan, Green Genoa,</p>
                <p>Early Lisbon, Windsor,</p>
                <p>Dwarf Fan or Cluster, Green Windsor,</p>
                <p>Long Pod, White-blossomed.</p>
                <p>The Mazagan and Lisbon are sown in November, and are defended during winter in
                    the same manner as early pease, but they are more difficult to preserve. The
                    same sorts should be sown again in January and February. In March the Dwarf
                    Cluster and Long-pod may be put in the ground for a general crop, and
                    subsequently the Windsor and White-blossomed. The latter is a variety of
                    considerable merit, and when the pods are taken at an early stage, they have
                    little of the peculiar bean flavour, or only enough to render them pleasant.
                    During the growth of the bean crop, all the culture that is necessary is, that

                <p><hi rend="subscript">;</hi> The first four are the earliest; the others are more
                    productive, and better fitted for a general crop. As the plant is of tropical
                    origin, our climate is scarcely sufficient for the extensive cultivation of the
                    ripe beans, which are the principal object in France and Italy. The immature
                    legumes are chiefly used in this country.</p>
                <p>It is seldom advantageous to sow kidney-beans in the open ground before the
                    middle or end of April; after which period successive sowings may be made every
                    fourteen days to the end of July. The plants are grown in rows two feet apart,
                    and the earth is carefully drawn to the roots. Kidney-beans are well adapted for
                    forcing, in hot-beds, or in hot-houses; the climate of the peach-house, when it
                    can be obtained, being considered the best. The sowings may begin in January;
                    they are made in pots, and a supply may be thus obtained in the months of March,
                    April, and May. The dwarf speckled is commonly used in hot-houses, and the early
                    white in hot-beds.</p>

                    rend="italic">tuberosum).</hi> This well-known plant is a native of the elevated
                    regions of equatorial America. It was introduced into Europe about the middle of
                    the 16th century, but remained little known or regarded till within the last
                    hundred years: it is now so generally cultivated, as to have effected almost an
                    economical revolution in this country. Most of the original British sorts were
                    derived from Ireland. Its multitudinous varieties now set enumeration at
                    defiance, and many are indeed appearing and disappearing every year. The culture
                    of the late sorts properly belongs to the farm, and when the gardener has to
                    take them under his care, he will find it best to adopt such as are common in
                    the agriculture of the district. Of the early kinds, most of which are supposed
                    to have originated in Lancashire, the following may be esteemed the best:</p>
                <p>Early Royal Dwarf, Early Frame,</p>
                <p>American Early, Early Kidney,</p>
                <p>Early Ash-leaved, Walnut-leaved Kidney.</p>
                <p>Potatoes are commonly propagated by dividing the tubers, leaving to each segment
                    one or two eyes or buds. The sets are then planted by the aid of the dibble or
                    spade, in rows at a distance varying from fifteen inches to two feet. It has
                    been suggested by Mr Knight <hi rend="italic">(London II</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >ortie.</hi><hi rend="italic">Trans.</hi> vol. vii.), and his views have been
                    amply confirmed by experiment, that by planting whole tubers, and at greater
                    distances, a larger produce will be obtained. Mr Knight proposed to leave four
                    feet between the rows, a distance which, except with the larger varieties, was
                    found to be too great. An experienced horticulturist in Scotland states, that by
                    planting whole tubers, and by leaving in the case of dwarfs two feet, and in the
                    tall varieties two feet and a half, between the rows, a return from one-third to
                    one-half more was obtained than could be had from the old method. Of course a
                    greater quantity of tubers are required for planting, but these bear no
                    proportion to the great increase which results; and besides, early potatoes at
                    the planting season being unfit for eating, there is little economy in sparing
                    them.</p>
                <p>The earliest crops should, if possible, be placed in a light soil and in a warm
                    situation, and are planted about the middle of March. Sometimes the eyes of the
                    tubers are made to spring or vegetate on a hot-bed, and the plants are put out
                    as soon as the leaves can bear the open air. Perhaps it is better, as
                    recommended by Mr Saul of Lancaster <hi rend="italic">( Gardener’s Mag.</hi>
                    vol. ii.), to promote incipient vegetation in some warm place, as a house or
                    greenhouse, by laying a woollen cloth or some other covering over them. When the
                    sprouts are about two inches long, he plants them out towards the end of March,
                    and thus procures young potatoes in seven or eight weeks. A secondary planting
                    of tubers should be made before the middle of April. When the stems are a few
                    inches above ground, the earth should be drawn to them; an operation, however,
                    which, while it improves the crop, delays its maturity for two or three weeks.
                    Mr Knight recommends removing the flowers as they appear, and states that by
                    this means the produce is increased by a ton per aere. The fine early varieties,
                    however, scarcely produce any flowers.</p>
                <p>An important faet in the cultivation of the potato was observed about the year
                    1806, by the late Mr Thomas Dickson of Edinburgh, viz. that the most healthy and
                    productive plants were to be obtained, by employing as seedstock unripe tubers,
                    or even by planting only the wet or least-ripened ends of long-shaped potatoes;
                    and he proposed this as a preventive of the well-known disease called the <hi
                    rend="italic">Curl.</hi> This view has been confirmed by Mr Knight. An
                    intelligent writer in the <hi rend="italic">Gardener’s Magazine</hi> (vol. ii.
                    p. 171) states a method by which sprouting of the eyes is accelerated. He takes
                    up the seed potatoes a considerable time before they are ripe, and exposes them
                    for some weeks to the influence of a scorching sun. The resulting crop is at
                    least a fortnight earlier; but it is not said how this practice affects the
                    curl.</p>
                <p>The forcing of early potatoes on hot-beds has long been practised; but it is
                    attended with considerable trouble and expense. Small supplies of young waxy
                    tubers are now often produced during winter, in boxes placed in a
                    mushroom-house, or in a common cellar, if free from frost. In October, old
                    potatoes are placed in layers, alternating with a mixture of tree leaves and
                    light 'mould. Vegetation soon proceeds; and there being no opportunity for the
                    unfolding of stems and leaves, the energies of the plants are ex pended in the
                    production of. young tubers. Before mid <pb break="no" facs="nls:193647805"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0711-7805-0670"/>winter these often attain the size and appearance
                    of early potatoes; but they are much inferior, being watery and of little
                    flavour.</p>

                    >(Helianthus</hi><hi rend="italic">tuberosus),</hi> or tuberous-rooted
                    sunflower. This plant, which is a native of Brazil, derives its epithet <hi
                    rend="italic">Jerusalem</hi> from a corruption of the Italian <hi rend="italic"
                    >Girasole,</hi> a sunflower, and <hi rend="italic">Artichoke</hi> from the

                    rend="italic">bottoms</hi> of the artichoke. It is propagated by means of its
                    tubers in the manner of potatoes. In March they are planted out in rows three or
                    four feet asunder, and in autumn the new tubers are fit for use. For the sake of
                    convenience, it is advantageous to store them, though the roots are hardy enough
                    to bear the winter frosts. Some, indeed, allow them to remain in the ground, and
                    dig them up when required. In this way a sufficient number of sets are generally
                    left in the ground, and the stalks are thinned into rows in summer; but this is
                    a slovenly mode of treatment, and seldom produces well-flavoured crops.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="smallcaps">Turnip</hi><hi rend="italic">(Brassica Rapa),</hi> like
                    the potato, has, to a great extent, migrated into the fields, and become the
                    care of the husbandman more than of the gardener. The following are the most
                    esteemed garden sorts:</p>
                <p>Early White Dutch, Early Yellow Maltese,</p>
                <p>Early Stone, Dutch Yellow,</p>

                    >(Brassica</hi><hi rend="italic">Napus</hi><hi rend="italic">v.</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">esculenta)</hi> is occasionally cultivated, and more frequently
                    the <hi rend="italic">Swedish Turnip (Brassica</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >campestris</hi><hi rend="italic">v. Napo-brassica,</hi> L.), which is a most
                    excellent winter sort, though it belongs more properly to the farm. For early
                    crops, the white Dutch is the principal variety; the other white sorts, and the
                    beautiful yellow Maltese, are useful in summer and in the beginning of autumn.
                    The yellow Dutch being capable of enduring any degree of frost, affords the best
                    winter supplies.</p>
                <p>Turnips succeed best in a rich, well-worked soil, of a light or medium quality.
                    The first sowing is made about the end of March, in a warm situation; and it is
                    usual to put in additional sowings, once a fortnight or three weeks, till the
                    end of August. The early crops are sown <hi rend="italic">broadcast,</hi> and
                    the later in drills. After the plants have shewn a rough leaf or two, they are
                    thinned out, being left at the distance of eight or ten inches in the drill; and
                    the ground is hoed and kept free from weeds. As turnips which have stood the
                    winter throw up their seed-stalks early in spring, after which their roots
                    become stringy, and are much deteriorated, it is useful to store the turnips in
                    winter, keeping them in a close place, and covering them with straw.</p>
                <p>The young plants, while in the seed-leaf, are often destroyed by a small beetle
                    called the turnip-fly <hi rend="italic">(Haltica nemorum).</hi> Many remedies
                    have been proposed: it has been found beneficial to dust the rows with
                    quicklime; but perhaps the best precaution is to sow thick, and thus insure a
                    sufficient supply both for the insect and the crop.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="smallcaps">Carrot</hi><hi rend="italic">(Daucus Carota)</hi> is one
                    of our native I mbelliferae, but has been much transformed by cultivation. The
                    best varieties are the Early Horn and the Orange Carrot, the former for early,
                    the latter for general cultivation. The carrot loves a light, deep, fresh soil,
                    in which it may be at liberty to push down its long spindle-shaped roots. A few
                    Early Horn carrots may be sown in February on a moderate hot-bed. In the
                    beginning of March, the same sort may be sown in the open air. In April, the
                    orange variety may follow as a general crop: it succeeds best in drills. In many
                    old gardens the early plants are liable to the attacks of a small grub, the
                    larva of some insect; it is therefore a useful precaution to sow a moderate crop
                    of the Early Horn variety in July. After sowing, it is only necessary to thin
                    the plants and keep them clear of weeds. The roots are stored in winter in the
                    manner of turnips.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="smallcaps">Parsnep</hi><hi rend="italic">(Pastinaca sativa)</hi> is
                    now less cultivated than it was in Catholic times, when it was a favourite
                    accompaniment to dried fish in Lent. To some its flavour is not agreeable; but
                    it is a very nutritious vegetable, and of easy digestion. Like the carrot, its
                    root is long and tapering, differing chiefly in being of a whitish colour. Its
                    culture is also very much the same.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Red Beet</hi><hi rend="italic">(Beta vulgaris)</hi> is a
                    biennial plant, a native of the shores of the south of Europe. The boiled root
                    is eaten cold, either by itself or as a salad: it is also often used as a
                    pickle. The varieties are numerous, but the most common are the Long-rooted, the
                    Short or Turnip-rooted, the Bassano, and the Green-topped. There is a fine
                    French variety called Castelnaudary, from a town in Languedoc; but as yet it is
                    little known in this country.</p>
                <p>Red beet prospers in a rich, deep soil, not recently manured, and which has been
                    well pulverized by the spade. During April the seeds may be sown in drills,
                    fifteen inches asunder, and the plants are afterwards to be thinned to eight
                    inches from each other in the lines. In the northern parts of the island, the
                    roots are stored in winter, care being taken not to break them or cut off the
                    leaves too closely, as they bleed when injured.</p>

                    spring; but it succeeds better by annual sowings, which may be made in
                    April.</p>

                    in gardens, and are now less cultivated than they deserve. The roots are used in
                    soups, and sometimes as dressed side dishes. They are sown in lines, and treated
                    like the crops of red beet or parsnep.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="smallcaps">Radish</hi><hi rend="italic">(Raphanus sativus)</hi> is
                    a native of China. There are two principal varieties, the spindle-rooted and the
                    turnip-rooted radish; and of these the subvarieties are numerous. The following
                    may be mentioned:</p>
                <p>Early Frame Scarlet, White Turnip,</p>
                <p>Short-topped Scarlet, Yellow Turnip,</p>
                <p>Scarlet Salmon, White Spanish,</p>
                <p>Long White, Black Spanish.</p>
                <p>The first two and the white turnip radish are best suited for early crops; the
                    scarlet salmon for summer, the yellow turnip for autumn, and the white and black
                    Spanish for winter.</p>
                <p>Some cultivators sow their earliest crop in November, in a warm situation, at the
                    foot of a wall or in front of a pinery, and continue sowing once a-month, if
                    weather permit, during winter. Others grow their first radishes under frames,
                    aiding vegetation by a slight bottom heat. As the season advances, successional
                    supplies are sown once a fortnight. From the middle of July to the middle of
                    September, the turnip-radishes are sown from time to time; and on the approach
                    of frost they may be stored up in sand like carrots, and kept throughout
                    winter.</p>

                    root, somewhat in the manner of the potato; but they are of small size, seldom
                    exceeding that of a walnut. By cultivation, however, by manuring, laying down,
                    earthing up, watering, and other helps known to horticulturists, considerable
                    increase of size in the tubers may be effected. From the mode of culture adopted
                    by the most intelligent gardeners, we conclude that a rich light soil is the

                    useful to forward the plants in a hot-bed, in the way practised with early
                    pease, so as to have them ready to transplant by the middle or end of May; that
                    in planting out, they should be inserted in a sloping position, so that a
                    considerable portion of the stem may be covered by the soil; that earthing up,
                    or drawing up additional soil to the stems in June and July is important; and
                    that laying down the stems horizontally in August, and covering them slightly
                    (to the depth perhaps of two inches) with mould, tends greatly to promote the
                    productiveness. It should be observed that the tubers continue to swell in size
                    till November, or till stopped by frost. It is believed that the largest tubers,
                    having full eyes or buds, yield the strongest plants; and therefore a portion of
                    the largest should always be reserved for seed-stock. Cut sets of these large
                    tubers are, by some cultivators, preferred to whole tubers. The rest, from the
                    size of a filbert to a walnut, go to the cook. We may remark, that till the
                    plant become more common, the very smallest tubers should not be thrown away,
                    but should be carefully preserved, for increasing the extent of the oxalis bed
                    the following season. The mode of dressing for table is simple. The tubers,
                    after being cleaned, are boiled for about ten minutes, or till they be slightly
                    softened; and they are then served up -with white sauce. Some persons merely put
                    them into boiling water for a few minutes; then, pouring off the water, transfer
                    them to a covered saucepan; and place the pan upon hot cinders, drawing some of
                    these near to the lid: in this way the tubers are rendered more dry or mealy.
                    They are of excellent quality and pleasant flavour; somewhat resembling a new
                    potato, with the additional zest of a nut or kernel. The oxalis comes from the
                    same country that afforded us the invaluable potato, and has been extolled as
                    likely to rival it; but this it will never do: a dish of oxalis will form an
                    agreeable variety and adjunct, but no more; bearing to the potato such relation
                    as sea-cale does to asparagus. It may be added, however, that the oxalis crenata
                    is, in other respects, a useful vegetable. The leaves may be used as salad, and
                    form, indeed, the principal salad at Lima. The shoots and young branches are
                    found to make a pleasant purée, having the wood-sorrel flavour; and the larger
                    stems have been used in tarts, in the manner of rhubarb-stalks, and been found
                    more tender.</p>

                <p>The <hi rend="smallcaps">Onion</hi><hi rend="italic">(Allium Cepd)</hi> is too
                    well known to require description: it has been cultivated in this country from
                    time immemorial. Among the varieties may be enumerated:</p>
                <p>Strasburgh, Silver-skinned,</p>
                <p>Deptford, White Portugal,</p>
                <p>Globe, Blood Red,</p>
                <p>James’s Keeping, Potato Onion.</p>
                <p>Besides these, the Welsh Onion or Ciboule <hi rend="italic">(Allium</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">fistulosum,</hi> L.), a native of Siberia, is sometimes grown for
                    scallions. For a general crop, the Strasburgh and Deptford varieties may be
                    esteemed the best. The White Portugal grows to a large size, but does not keep
                    well. The silver-skinned is chiefly used for pickling.</p>
                <p>The onion affects a light, rich, well worked soil, which has not been recently
                    manured The principal crop may be sown in the course of the month of March,
                    according to the state of the weather and the dryness of the ground. Onions are
                    grown in beds, four or five feet in width, and are regularly thinned, hoed, and
                    kept free from weeds. About the beginning of September the crop is ripe, which
                    is known by the withering of the leaves; the roots are taken up, and, after
                    being well dried, are stored in a garret or loft, where they may be perfectly
                    secured from damp.</p>
                <p>Towards the end of August a secondary crop is sown, to afford a supply of young
                    onions or <hi rend="italic">scallions,</hi> as they are called, in the spring
                    months. The Strasburgh and White Portugal may be used for this purpose. Those
                    which are not required for the kitchen being allowed to stand, if the flower-bud
                    is picked out on its first appearance, and the earth is stirred about them,
                    frequently produce bulbs equal in size and quality to the large ones that are
                    imported from the Continent.</p>
                <p>Some eminent horticulturists have strongly recommended the transplanting of
                    onions. Mr Knight sows the White Portugal onion in spring under the shade of a
                    tree, where they remain of a diminutive size. They are kept over winter, and are
                    planted out in the succeeding spring. Mr Brown collects all the minute bulbs of
                    the ordinary crop, and uses them in the same way. Mr Macdonald, Dalkeith Park,
                    confines his operations to one summer. He sows in February on a slight hot-bed,
                    or sometimes merely under a glass frame. In the first or second week of April,
                    according to the state of the weather, he transplants the young seedlings in
                    rows, eight inches asunder, and at the distance of four or five inches in the
                    row. Previously to planting, the roots of the seedlings are dipped in a puddle
                    of one part of soot to three parts of earth, an expedient which is found to
                    secure the transplanted onions from the wire-worm. Onions thus treated attain a
                    large size. We have seen autumn-sown onions submitted to a similar management
                    with great success.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="smallcaps">Potato Onion</hi> is propagated by the lateral bulbs,
                    which it throws out, under ground, in considerable numbers. It is planted about
                    mid-winter, and ripens in summer. Its flavour is strong, and not unpleasant; but
                    the plant being rather delicate and troublesome in cultivation, is not likely to
                    supersede the common onion.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="smallcaps">Pearl Onion,</hi> of recent introduction, and hitherto
                    little known, produces clusters of small bulbs at the root. These little bulbs
                    are of a fine white Colour, like the silver-skinned onion, and very fit for
                    pickling.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="smallcaps">Leck</hi><hi rend="italic">(Allium</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Porrum)</hi> is a native of Switzerland, but has probably been cultivated in
                    this island for many centuries. The varieties are the narrow-leaved or Flanders
                    leek, the Scotch or flag leek, and the broad-leaved or tall London leek. Of
                    these the Scotch leek is considered as the most hardy.</p>
                <p>Lecks are sown in beds in spring; and in June or July are planted out in rows
                    fifteen or eighteen inches apart, and six inches asunder between the rows. The
                    tips of the fibrous roots are trimmed before planting. When the weather is
                    moist, it is found beneficial merely to lay the plant into the hole made by the
                    dibble, without closing the earth upon it, the stem being by this means
                    encouraged to swell out and fill the hole.</p>

                    gravies, and is sometimes put into pickles. It is propagated by off-sets, which
                    are commonly planted in September or October. Some recommend the mixing of soot
                    with the manure as a protection against ma'ggots, by which this plant is greatly
                    infested. Autumn planting, however, is found the best expedient, as the bulbs
                    are ripe before the larvae commence their depredations.</p>

                    and is a native of Western Asia. It has long been cultivated for the sake of its
                    succulent leaves, which, when properly dressed, form a pleasant and nutritious
                    article of food. There are two varieties; the round-leaved or smooth-seeded, and
                    the angular-leaved or prickly-seeded. The latter, as being the most hardy, is
                    used for the winter crop.</p>
                <p>The first sowing is made in August, in some sheltered situation; the plants, as
                    they advance, are thinned, and the ground is hoed. In the beginning of winter
                    the outer leaves become fit for use; in mild weather, successive gatherings are
                    obtained, and, with proper management, the crop may be prolonged to the
                    beginning of May.</p>
                <p>To afford a succession crop, the seeds of the roundleaved variety should be sown
                    in the end of January, and again in February <hi rend="superscript"> 7</hi> and
                    March. From this period it is proper to sow small quantities once a fortnight,
                    summer spinach lasting only a very short time. The open spaces between the lines
                    of cauliflower, and others of the cabbage tribe, will generally afford enough of
                    room for these transient crops. They are generally sown in shallow drills, and
                    are thinned out and weeded as may be required.</p>

                    cultivated for the leaves, which are used as spinach. The midribs and stalks of
                    the great white beet, when separated from the leaves, are stewed and eaten as
                    asparagus, under the name of Swiss Chard. The culture does not differ materially
                    from that of the red beet.</p>

                    It is an excellent substitute for spinach; and if well watered, it will continue
                    to afford large quantities of succulent leaves during the hottest weather. It is
                    sown in a pot placed in a melon-frame in March: the seedlings are transplanted
                    into small pots, and kept under cover till the beginning of June, when they are
                    plunged out at two or three feet apart, and treated somewhat like gourds. In
                    gathering the leaves, care must be taken not to injure the leading shoots.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Quinoa Spinach</hi><hi rend="italic">(Chenopodium
                    Quinoa).</hi> This vegetable is a native not only of Chile, but of the table
                    land of Mexico It is described and figured by Ruiz and Pavon, and Humboldt
                    informs us, that in Mexicothe leaves are universally used as spinach or greens,
                    and the seeds in soups, or like rice, so that quinoa there vies in utility with
                    the potato itself. Although the plant had been known in Britain for a number of
                    years, it was only during the autumn of 1834 that any considerable portion of
                    seed was ripened or saved in this country. This was accomplished at Boyton in
                    Wiltshire, by Mr Aylmer Bourke Lambert, the well known patron of botany and
                    horticulture. Considering the elevated region in America in which the quinoa is
                    successfully cultivated, there can be no doubt that its herbage will be freely
                    produced in this country; but it seems probable that, in order to secure the
                    ripening of seeds, it may be requisite to place some plants close by a wall
                    having a south or south-west aspect, as is practised with seeding onions; more
                    especially since we are warned by Willdenow, that, in Germany, “semina sub dio
                    non semper perficit.” There are two varieties, the common white-seeded or green
                    quinoa, and the dark-seeded or red quinoa, the former seemingly the more hardy,
                    or at least germinating most freely.</p>

                    their names.</p>

                    rend="italic">(Asparagus officinalis)</hi> is a perennial plant, a native of the
                    shores of Britain, where it occurs sparingly, and of the steppes in the east of
                    Europe. Though somewhat unpromising while in a state of nature, it affords, in
                    cultivation, an esculent of considerable value, and is therefore grown
                    extensively both in private and in sale gardens. The principal varieties are the
                    <hi rend="italic">red-topped</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">green-topped,</hi>
                    of which the latter, while it is less succulent, is considered the better
                    flavoured. There are numerous subvarieties, such as the Battersea, Gravesend,
                    Giant, &amp;c·, which differ only slightly or not at all from those already
                    mentioned.</p>
                <p>Asparagus, growing naturally on loose sand, loves a light deep soil, through
                    which it may be able to shoot its long stringy roots. Two feet and a half is
                    considered a desirable depth, but in France the ground is sometimes prepared, by
                    sifting, to the double of that depth. A considerable portion of well-rotted dung
                    or of recent sea-weed is laid in the bottom of the trench, which may be from two
                    to three feet deep; and another top-dressing of manure should be digged in
                    preparatory to planting or sowing. The older horticulturists used to grow their
                    asparagus in beds four or five feet wide, with intervening alleys of about
                    eighteen inches in breadth. At present, in Scotland, it is customary to sow or
                    plant in rows from three to four feet asunder; a method which, in every way, is
                    found to be most convenient. Except where the garden is new, when, of course, it
                    is advantageous to procure a supply of ready grown plants, it is thought
                    preferable to keep up the stock of asparagus by sowing.</p>
                <p>The sowing is made in March, in slight drills; and, as a portion of the seed
                    often fails to germinate, it is a good precaution to employ about double the
                    quantity of seed that may be ultimately necessary. If the plants come up too
                    thickly, they may be thinned out towards the end of the first summer, to the
                    distance of about six inches in the rows. The ground is hoed, and kept clear of
                    weeds. It is a common practice to take slight crops of onions, lettuce,
                    cauliflower, or turnip, between the lines of asparagus during the first, and, if
                    the rows be wide, also in the second year. The young heads or stalks, the part
                    used, should not be cut before the third spring, and they arŭ not in perfection
                    till the fourth or fifth.</p>
                <p>The asparagus quarter can scarcely be over manured. The proper time to perform
                    this operation is in the end of autumn, when the annual flower-stalks are
                    removed, preparatory for winter. When beds are employed, their surface should be
                    stirred with a fork; a layer of well-rotted hot-bed dung is then laid on, and
                    the whole covered with a sprinkling of earth from the alleys. If the plants are
                    grown in rows, the manure is simply dug in by means oř a three-pronged fork,
                    care being taken not to injure the roots. This operation is repeated annually.
                    No other culture is required; but it is necessary to observe a due moderation in
                    reaping the crop, as the shoots, when much cut, become progressively smaller and
                    less valuable. Hence a considerable quantity of ground is required for the

                    of this vegetable, and it is a general rule never to gather it after pease have
                    come into season.</p>
                <p>Asparagus readily admits of being <hi rend="italic">forced.</hi> The most common
                    method is to prepare, early in the year, a moderate hot-bed of stable litter,
                    and to cover it with a common frame. After the heat of fermentation has somewhat
                    subsided, the surface of the bed is lined with turf, to prevent the escape of
                    vapour; a layer of light earth or exhausted tan-bark is put over the turf, and
                    in this the roots of plants five or six years old are closely placed. The crowns
                    of the roots are then covered with two or three inches of soil. A common
                    three-light frame may hold 500 or 600 plants, and will afford a supply for
                    several weeks. After planting, linings are applied when necessary, and air is
                    occasionally admitted. Care must be taken not to scorch the roots. Where there
                    are pits for the culture of late melons or succession pine plants, such as the
                    Alderston pit, or the succession pit with the hot-water circulation, they may
                    advantageously be applied to this purpose.</p>
                <p>It has been recommended <hi rend="italic">(Lond. Hortic. Traits,</hi> vol.'v.) to
                    force asparagus on the ground on which it grows. Perhaps the best method is that
                    suggested by Mr Spiers in vol. iv. of the Gardener’s Magazine. The seed is sown
                    in beds four feet eight inches w ide, and there are four rows of plants, eleven
                    inches asunder in the bed. The beds are lined by a pigeon-hole brickwork two
                    feet deep, an operation which we presume need not be performed till immediately
                    before forcing, that is, when tłie plants are at least four years old. In
                    October, when the stalks are cleared away, the surface is covered with littery
                    straw. When forcing is commenced, the brick-lined trenches are filled with hot
                    stable-dung, well beaten, to about eighteen inches above the surface of the
                    ground. The bed is also covered with prepared dung. In about twelve days, when
                    the buds have begun to appear, the latter covering is removed, glazed frames are
                    placed upon the brick-work, a little fine soil is sifted over the plants, the
                    linings in the trenches are raised higher, and the whole treated like a common
                    hot-bed. In this way, we are informed, excellent supplies may be obtained, and
                    the plants may be forced every year.</p>
                <p>Before leaving this subject, it may be mentioned, that about Bath, the young flow
                    er-spikes of <hi rend="italic">Ornithogalum py-renaicum,</hi> found native in
                    that neighbourhood, are used like asparagus, under the name of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Prussian grass.</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">Sea-kale (</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Crambe</hi><hi rend="italic">maritima)</hi> is a perennial plant, growing
                    spontaneously on the shores of the southern parts of the island. The roots are
                    spreading, the leaves waved, glaucous, and covered with a fine mealy bloom, and
                    the stalks rise to about two feet high, bearing white flowers which smell of
                    honey, followed by seed-pods, each containing a single seed.</p>
                <p>The country people in the west of England have long been accustomed to use in
                    spring the young shoots, which, by passing through the sand and gravel on which
                    they grow, are somewhat blanched and rendered tender. In conformity with this
                    practice, the cultivation formerly recommended consisted merely in covering the
                    beds on the approach of spring with a little dry earth or sand, in order to the
                    blanching or intenerating of the shoots. These were cut as they appeared in
                    March and April. Now, however, the blanching is not only much more completely
                    effected, but simple means have been devised for supplying the table for half
                    the year, including all the winter months. It has, within these few years,
                    become a vegetable of common ocr currence in the markets both of London and
                    Edinburgh.</p>
                <p>Sea-kale seems partial to a light dry soil. If manure be added, it should consist
                    of sea-weed or leaves of trees. The plants may be propagated by offsets, or
                    small pieces of the roots having buds or eyes attached to them; but the most
                    eligible method is by seed. We have seen very tolerable blanched stalks produced
                    by plants only nine months old from the seed, and after two summers, seedling
                    plants will have acquired sufficient strength for general cropping. The sowing
                    is made in March, the seeds being deposited in patches of three or four
                    together, the patches being arranged in lines three feet apart, and two feet in
                    the line. In order to secure a succession, and to obviate the bad effects of
                    forcing, it is proper to sow a few lines of sea-kale every year.</p>
                <p>Various modes of blanching the shoots have been resorted to. In the first volume
                    of the <hi rend="italic">Memoirs of the Caledonian Horticultural Society,</hi>
                    Sir George Mackenzie describes a very convenient method. The sea-kale bed is
                    merely covered, early in spring, with clean and dry oatstraw, which is removed
                    as often as it becomes dry and musty. The shoots rise through the straw, and are
                    at the same time pretty well blanched. Others employ dried tree-leaves for this
                    purpose. Another method practised by many gardeners consists in placing over
                    each plant a flower-pot of the largest size inverted; but convenient <hi
                    rend="italic">blanching-pots,</hi> with moveable lids, have been constructed for
                    the express purpose. It may be proper to provide from thirty to sixty such pots;
                    and it may be expected that each pot will, on an average, furnish a dish and a
                    half of shoots during the season.</p>
                <p>With the aid of these pots, sea-kale is <hi rend="italic">forced</hi> in the open
                    border in the way now to be described. In the latter end of autumn a bed of
                    vigorous sea-kale plants is dressed, that is, the stalks are cut over, and the
                    decayed leaves are removed. The ground is, at the same time, loosened about the
                    eyes, and a thin stratum of gravel or sifted coal-ashes is laid on the surface
                    to keep dowm earth-worms. A pot with a moveable cover is placed over each plant
                    or each patch of plants. Stable-litter is then closely packed all round the
                    pots, and raised up to about a foot above them; the whole thus assuming the form
                    and appearance of a large hot-bed. When fermentation commences, a thermometer
                    should be occasionally introduced into a few of the pots, to ascertain that the
                    temperature within does not exceed 60° Fahrenheit, and the depth of the litter
                    is to be regulated accordingly. The vegetation of the included plants is
                    speedily promoted; so that, in the space of a month or six weeks, the shoots
                    will be ready for cutting, which, being thus excluded from the light, are most
                    effectually blanched, and are exceedingly tender and crisp. By means of the
                    moveable lids, the plants are examined and the shoots gathered without
                    materially disturbing the litter. By commencing at various times, a supply for
                    the table can be readily furnished from the middle of November till the middle
                    of May.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="smallcaps">Artichoke</hi><hi rend="italic">(Cynara</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Scolymus)</hi> is a perennial plant, a native of the south of
                    Europe, and is a well known inhabitant of our gardens. It resembles a thistle on
                    a large scale. In France, the entire head or whole leaves of the involucre of
                    the artichoke are eaten, when in a young and tender state, <hi rend="italic">en
                    poivrade,</hi> or with pepper, salt, and vinegar; but in this country the only
                    parts used are the base of the leaves of the involucre, and the immature floral
                    receptacle, or phoranthium, commonly called the <hi rend="italic">bottom,</hi>
                    freed from the bristly seed-down which has been called the <hi rend="italic"
                    >choke.</hi> The varieties are the conical or French, the globe or red
                    artichoke, and the dwarf globe. Of these the first is the highest flavoured, the
                    second is well adapted for a general crop, and the third is prolific, and
                    occupies little room.</p>
                <p>The artichoke loves a deep cool dry soil. It is propagated by parting the roots
                    in April, the sets being planted in rows four or five feet asunder, and two feet
                    apart in the rows. The young plants generally afford a crop which succeeds that
                    of old plants; and for this reason a new plantation<pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193647857" xml:id="kp-eb0711-7857-0674"/> is made in some gardens
                    every year. During summer the plants are kept clear of weeds, but require little
                    other attention. In November the decayed stems and leaves are removed, and the
                    ground cleared. In some gardens the earth is ridged slightly around the roots,
                    in order to defend the stools from the frost. This, however, is done more
                    effectually by a litter of straw, or of the refuse of the stable-yard, of the
                    depth of a foot, drawn close round the base of the leaves. In April this litter
                    is taken away, the stocks are examined, and two or three only of the strongest
                    shoots are permitted to remain. The offsets, which are carefully removed, afford
                    materials for a young plantation. The ground between the rows is digged over. At
                    this time manure may be applied; well-rotted hot-bed dung, and above all
                    sea-weed, being considered preferable.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="smallcaps">Cλrdoon</hi><hi rend="italic">(Cynara</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Cardunculus)</hi> is a perennial plant, a native of the south of
                    France and Spain. It has a close resemblance to the artichoke, but surpasses it
                    in size. The edible part, or <hi rend="italic">chard,</hi> as it is called, is
                    composed of the blanched and crisp stalks of the inner leaves. Besides the
                    common sort there is a prickly variety, known in France by the name of the
                    Cardoon of Tours. The common artichoke is also used for the production of chard.
                    Cardoons are found to prosper on light deep soil. The seed is sown annually
                    about the middle of May, in shallow trenches, like those for celery, and the
                    plants are thinned out to ten or twelve inches from each other in the lines. In
                    dry weather water is copiously supplied, not only to increase the succulence of
                    the leaves, but to prevent the formation of flower-stalks, which render the
                    plant useless. In autumn the leaves are applied close to each other, and wrapped
                    round with bands of hay or straw, the points of the leaves only being left free.
                    Earth is then drawn up around the leaf-stems to the height of fifteen or
                    eighteen inches. Sometimes cardoons are blanched by a more thorough earthing up,
                    in the manner of celery, but in this case the operation must be carried on from
                    the end of summer. During severe frost the tops of the leaves should be defended
                    with straw or litter.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="smallcaps">Rampion</hi><hi rend="italic">(Campanula
                    Rapunculus)</hi> is an English native biennial, the roots of which, under the
                    name of <hi rend="italic">ramps,</hi> are used as a salad, or boiled like
                    asparagus. It is but little cultivated in this country. The seed is sown
                    broadcast, about the beginning of June, in a cool situation, and the young
                    plants arc merely to be thinned and kept clear of weeds. On the approach of
                    frost, the roots, which somewhat resemble small radishes, are stored in sand,
                    and will keep fresh and firm till spring.</p>

                    a native is unknown. Some suppose it to be a seminal variety of the native <hi
                    rend="italic">L.</hi><hi rend="italic">virosa,</hi> a poisonous plant, “which,”
                    says Professor Lindley, “would not be more remarkable than the fact, that the
                    indigenous celery is one of our strongest poisons.” Besides its well known uses,
                    it may be mentioned that the late Dr Duncan senior, of Edinburgh, prepared from
                    its milky juice, a medicine denominated <hi rend="italic">Lactucarium,</hi>
                    similar in its action to opium, but capable of being administered in cases where
                    that powerful drug is inadmissible. There are two principal varieties, the Cos
                    or upright, and the Cabbage-lettuce. The subvarieties are numerous; we may
                    mention the following:</p>
                <p>Early Forcing Cos, White Cabbage,</p>
                <p>Green Cos, Brown Dutch Cabbage,</p>
                <p>White Cos, Imperial Cabbage,</p>
                <p>Cilicia, Grand Admiral.</p>
                <p>By proper care fresh lettuce may be had throughout the whole year. The first
                    sowing is made in January, in some sheltered situation, or under hand-glasses,
                    or in tebruary on a gentle hot-bed. The seedlings are transplanted as soon as
                    the weather will permit. A second sowing may be made in the beginning of March,
                    and another in April. Besides the ordinary compartments, the seedlings may be
                    planted on celery ridges, between rows of slight crops of other vegetables, and,
                    in short, in any odd corner which may occur. To obtain a winter supply, a sowing
                    is made in August or September, and the plants are pricked out in October, along
                    the bottom of walls, or under glazed frames.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Endive (</hi><hi rend="italic">Cichorium</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Endivia)</hi> is an annual plant, a native of China, from which it
                    was introduced in 1548. It is the lettuce of winter, the blanched hearts being
                    used for salads and in soups. The varieties are, the Broad-leaved Batavian, the
                    Green Curled-leaved, and the White Curledleaved. A sowing may be made in the
                    beginning of June, and another in July, the seeds being scattered very sparsely,
                    that the plants may not come up in clusters. The seedlings are transplanted into
                    a rich soil, and are arranged in rows twelve or fifteen inches asunder, and at
                    the distance of ten inches in the row. Sometimes they are planted in drills to
                    facilitate the operation of blanching. The later crop should be placed in a
                    sheltered situation, where it may be able to withstand the winter. When the
                    plants have reached their‘maturity, the leaves are gathered up, and tied
                    together an inch or two below the tips, and afterwards about the middle of the
                    plant. In two or three weeks they are found sufficiently blanched for use. In
                    winter it is necessary to draw the earth quite up about the leaves. At that
                    season, too, the plants may be inserted into a sloping bank of earth, or
                    blanched in boxes in the mushroom-house, or in a cellar.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Succory</hi><hi rend="italic">(Cichorium Intybus)</hi> is an
                    indigenous plant, the cultivation of which may be said to have been introduced
                    by the foreign refugees during the French revolutionary war. By the French it is
                    much esteemed as a winter salad, and, when blanched, is known by the name of <hi
                    rend="italic">Barbe du Capucin.</hi> When intended for winter use, the seed is
                    sown in May or June, commonly in drills, and the plants are thinned out to four
                    inches apart. If the first set of leaves grow very strong, owing to wet weather,
                    they are cut off perhaps in the middle of August, about an inch from the ground,
                    so as to promote the production of new leaves, and cheek the formation of
                    flower-stems. About the beginning of October the plants are raised from the
                    border; all the large leaves are cut off; the roots are also shortened. They are
                    then planted pretty closely together in boxes filled with rich light mould, and
                    watered when needful. When frost comes on, the boxes are protected by any kind
                    of haulm. As the salad is wanted, they are removed into some place having a
                    moderately increased temperature, but with little light, such as a mushroomhouse
                    or cellar off the kitchen. Each box affords two crops of blanched leaves, and
                    these are reckoned fit for cutting when about six inches long. The roots of this
                    plant, it may be added, have been employed as a substitute for coffee-beans, and
                    in Flanders, and some parts of France, a portion of them is very often mixed
                    with coffee.</p>

                    last of which is cultivated for the sake of its tuberous roots. Parsley loves a
                    light rich soil. It is sown in drills about the beginning of March, and the seed
                    lies some weeks in the ground before the plants appear-As they grow up they are
                    thinned out, and they are defended by branches or other coverings from hard <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193647870" xml:id="kp-eb0711-7870-0675"/> weather in
                    winter. The Hamburg variety being cultivated for its roots, is sown about the
                    same time in a well trenched soil, in drills a foot apart, and it is thinned to
                    about nine inches in the rows. In the beginning of November the roots are taken
                    up and stored in sand.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Celery</hi><hi rend="italic">(Apium graveolens)</hi> is a
                    native biennial, an inhabitant of the sides of ditches near the sea. In its wild
                    state it is of an acrid nature, and of a coarse, rank flavour; but by
                    cultivation it is improved into one of the most agreeable salads. There are two
                    principal varieties; <hi rend="italic">celery</hi> properly so called, with
                    upright stalks and fibrous or slightly tuberous roots; and <hi rend="italic"
                    >celeriac</hi> with large turnip-shaped roots. Of the former, the principal
                    subvarieties are, the Italian, the Red Solid, and the White Solid, of which the
                    second and third are the best.</p>
                <p>Celery is usually sown at three different times: on a hotbed in the beginning of
                    March, and in the open ground in March, and again in April. The seedlings, when
                    about two inches high, are pricked into rich soil, in which they are allowed to
                    stand till they are four or five inches high. The first crop is defended by
                    frames or hand-glasses, and is planted wide to admit of being lifted with balls
                    of earth adhering to the roots. Towards the end of May trenches for blanching
                    the celery are prepared. These trenches are three and a half or four feet apart,
                    fifteen inches wide at the bottom, and about a foot below the natural level of
                    the surface. The soil at the bottom of the trench is carefully digged and
                    manured, and a single row of plants is placed in each trench. Sometimes where a
                    large supply is required, the trenches are made six feet wide, and after a
                    similar preparation, rows fifteen or eighteen inches apart are planted across
                    the trenches. As the plants advance in growth, earth is laid up about the stalks
                    of the leaves, an operation which is repeated at the end of every ten or fifteen
                    days, care being taken not to choke the plants. As the celery approaches
                    maturity, scarcely any thing but the tips of the leaves appear above the ridges,
                    and, when lifted, the stalks are found to be completely blanched. Successional
                    crops should then be planted out. Celery loves a rich light soil and an
                    abundance of moisture. '</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Celeriac,</hi> or turnip-rooted celery, is treated at first
                    like the early crop of common celery. In the beginning or middle of June it is
                    planted out in a flat bed, in drills fifteen inches apart. A single earthing
                    afterwards suffices. Its large round roots are used in soups, and are much
                    relished by some. It is, however, more attended to in France and the Low
                    Countries than in Britain.</p>

                    annua! plants, and are eaten only when very young. In winter they may be raised
                    on a slight hot-bed, in spring under hand-glasses, or in drills near a south
                    wall, and in summer, when they should be sown once a fortnight, in drills, in
                    any cool shady situation. Table mustard, which is made from <hi rend="italic"
                    >Sinapis</hi><hi rend="italic">nigra</hi> L., belongs rather to the department
                    of agriculture. Durham mustard, which is distinguished for its poignancy, though
                    not remarkable for fine colour, is said to be made principally from the seeds of
                    the common yellow field mustard or charlock, <hi rend="italic">Sinapis</hi><hi

                <p>Of <hi rend="smallcaps">Rhubarb</hi><hi rend="italic">(Rheum)</hi> several
                    species and many varieties are cultivated for the purpose of supplying materials
                    for tarts, the foot-stalks of the leaves being well adapted for that purpose,
                    and coming into use at a most convenient season. R. <hi rend="italic"
                    >rhaponticum</hi> and <hi rend="italic">palmatum</hi> were the species first
                    employed, and are still occasionally used; but the sorts now preferred are
                    seminal varieties, mostly allied to <hi rend="italic">R. hy-</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">bridum</hi> and <hi rend="italic">R.</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >undulatum..</hi> The following are the most worthy of notice:</p>
                <p>Wilmot’s, Elford,</p>
                <p>Gigantic, Buck’s.</p>
                <p>Of these, the talented editor of the <hi rend="italic">Horticultural
                    Register</hi> decidedly prefers the first two, the former as being excellently
                    suited for forcing, the latter as growing to a great size, without rankness.
                    They may be multiplied by dividing the roots, and this is the common practice;
                    but they thrive much better when grown from seed. Mr Paxton recommends sowing on
                    a slight hot-bed in spring, and transplanting out in rows in the month of May.
                    No stalks are gathered from them for the first two years, but in the third
                    season they are fit for use. A portion of the crop is allowed to come on under
                    the general influence of the season; but much also is forced, which may be done
                    in a variety of ways. Some treat it like sea-kale, covering the root allowed to
                    remain in the ground with a large pot or box, and wrapping it round with litter.
                    Others take up the roots in autumn, pot them, and force them in vineries or
                    hot-beds. Perhaps the best method is to procure long narrow boxes of a moderate
                    depth, and to place them, packed full of roots, in a mushroom-house or cellar,
                    where there is a considerable temperature. The rhubarb soon throws up its
                    stalks, and these being partially etiolated, possess a delicacy and flavour
                    superior to those grown in the open air. It is easy, by varying the time of
                    subjecting the boxes to the increased temperature, to keep up a succession of
                    rhubarb stalks, from the period at which kitchen apples become scarce or begin
                    to lose their flavour, till green gooseberries come into season.</p>
                <p>The following annual plants are occasionally used in cookery, or as salads: <hi

                    officinalis. These may be sown in spring, or in the beginning of summer, in any
                    fresh light sods. In general a small quantity will suffice.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Common Sorrel,</hi> Rumex acetosa; and the <hi

                    parting their roots. They thrive in any cool shady situation.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Capsicum</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Chili,</hi> Capsicum

                    tender annuals from tropical climates. Both are sown in hot-beds in spring, and
                    after being transplanted and nursed in separate pots, are planted out, the
                    former in a warm border, and the latter against a wall. In Scotland the Capsicum
                    will scarcely mature its fruit without the aid of glass.</p>

                    been for a long period, though not extensively, cultivated in our gardens. They
                    are easily raised from seed. With these may be associated the beautiful
                    perennial, <hi rend="italic">Fennel,</hi> Anethum Foeniculum, used in salads and
                    sauces. It may be propagated either by parting the roots, or by seeds, which

                    some warm situation. In Scotland, they are mostly treated as tender annuals, and

                    in garnishing; but they ought never to be used, as they too often are, for

                <p>THE FLOWER GARDEN.</p>
                <p>The cultivation of flowers, if not the most useful, is at least one of the most
                    pleasing occupations of the horticulturist, and has generally shared largely in
                    his attention. It is probable, that at first, flowers, as objects of curiosity,
                    were confined to a few patches or borders in the garden, as is still the case in
                    many old places; but in the progress of the art, and the diffusion of taste,
                    separate departments were allotted to them under the name of Flower Gardens.
                    After some general remarks on style and situation, we shall treat of the
                    component parts of flower gardens, their various decorations, and of
                    floriculture.</p>
                <p>The designing of flower gardens unquestionably belongs to the fine arts,
                    involving in it, the exercise of invention, taste, and foresight. Its principles
                    are more vague and evanescent than those of any of the sister arts. The hand of
                    the designer is not here guided by the imitation of Nature, for his work is
                    wholly artificial in its arrangements and appliances; neither does utility come
                    in, as in architecture, to supply a form and frame-work, which it is. the
                    artist’s part to adorn. “As flower gardens,” says Mr Loudon, the best authority
                    on this topic, “are objects of pleasure, the principle which must serve as a
                    guide in laying them out, must be taste. Now, in flower-gardens, as in' other
                    objects, there are different kinds of tastes; these embodied are called styles
                    or characters; and the great art of the designer is, having fixed on a style, to
                    follow it out unmixed with other styles, or with any deviation which would
                    interfere with the kind of taste or impression which that style is calculated to
                    produce. Style, therefore, is the leading principle in laying out flower
                    gardens, as utility is in laying out the culinary garden. As objects of fancy
                    and taste, the styles of flower gardens are various. The modern style is a
                    collection of irregular groups and masses, placed about the house as a medium,
                    uniting it with the open lawn. The ancient geometric style, in place of
                    irregular groups, employed symmetrical forms; in France, adding statues and
                    fountains; in Holland, cut trees and grassy slopes; and in Italy, stone walls,
                    walled terraces, and flights of steps. In some situations these characteristics
                    of parterres may, with propriety, be added to, or used instead of the modern
                    sort, especially in flat situations; such as are inclosed by high walls; in
                    towns, or where the principal building or object is in a style of architecture
                    which will not render these appendages incongruous. There are other characters
                    of gardens, such as the Chinese, which are not widely different from the modern;
                    the Indian, which consists chiefly of walks under shade, in squares of grass;
                    the Turkish, which abounds in shady retreats, boudoirs of roses and aromatic
                    herbs; and the Spanish, which is distinguished by trellis work and fountains;
                    but these gardens are not generally adapted to this climate, though, from
                    contemplating and selecting what is beautiful or suitable in each, a style of
                    decoration for the immediate vicinity of mansions, might be composed preferable
                    to any thing now in use.” It may, however, be remarked, that the flower garden
                    properly so called, has generally been too much governed by the laws of
                    landscape gardening, and these often ill-understood, and misapplied. In the days
                    of “clipped hedges and pleached alleys/’ the parterres and flower-beds were of a
                    description the most grotesque and intricate imaginable. At a subsequent period,
                    when the natural and die picturesque became the objects of imitation in the
                    park, there appeared the most extravagant attempts at wildness in the garden.
                    The result has been unfortunate. It is not meant that when there are merely a
                    few patches of flowers by way of foreground to the lawn, they should not be
                    subordinated to the principles which regulate the more distant and bolder
                    scenery; but wherever there is a flower garden of considerable magnitude, and in
                    a separate situation, it should be constructed on principles of its own. In such
                    a spot, the great object must be to exhibit to advantage the graceful forms and
                    glorious hues of flowering plants and shrubs; and it is but seldom that mere
                    elegancies in the forms of compartments, and other trickeries of human
                    invention, can bear any comparison with these natural beauties. To express the
                    peculiar nature of garden scenery, as distinct from the picturesque in
                    landscape, Mr Loudon has invented the term <hi rend="italic">gardenesque</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">;</hi> and, whatever may be thought of the term itself, it is very
                    desirable that the distinction should be preserved.</p>
                <p>Two varieties of flower gardens have chiefly prevailed in Britain; one, in which
                    the ground is turf, and the pattern, so to speak, is composed of a variety of
                    figures cut out of the turf, and planted with flowers and shrubs; and another,
                    when the flower-beds a <hi rend="superscript"> l</hi> re separated by gravel
                    walks, without being interspersed with grass at all. The choice of one or other
                    of these varieties ought greatly to depend upon the situation. When the flower
                    garden is to be seen from the windows, or any other elevated point of view, from
                    which the whole or the greater part of the design may be perceived at once,
                    perhaps the former should be preferred. Where the surface is irregular, and the
                    situation more remote, and especially where the beauty of flowers is the chief
                    object of contemplation, the choice should probably fall on the latter. This
                    variety, too, seems preferable, on the principle of contrast, where there are
                    large lawns in the outer grounds, in order that <hi rend="italic">kept</hi> (or
                    smoothly mown) grass may not be found every where.</p>
                <p>Respecting the situation of the flower garden, no very precise directions can be
                    given, as it must be influenced by the nature of the lawns, and of the site of
                    the mansion to which it is attached. Generally speaking, it should not be at any
                    great distance from the house; and in places where there is no distant view of
                    importance, it may be constructed under the windows. In retired scenes, it is
                    delightful to step out of the drawing-room into compartments of flowers, in the
                    vicinity of a greenhouse or conservatory. On the other hand, when the park is
                    spacious, and the prospects extensive and picturesque, it is perhaps better that
                    the flower garden should be at some distance, say not more than a quarter of a
                    mile, and out of sight of the house, but with an easy access in any sort of
                    weather; an arrangement which would give an agreeable termination to a short
                    walk, a desirable matter in most cases, for it has been often remarked that many
                    parts of <pb break="no" facs="nls:193647896" xml:id="kp-eb0711-7896-0677"
                    />extensive grounds remain unvisited, because they afford no remarkable object
                    to attract the attention.</p>
                <p>The particular form of a flower garden is equally beyond the inculcation of
                    specific rules. Indeed, it may be of any shape, and, except where the dimensions
                    are extremely limited, the boundaries should not be continuously visible. The
                    taste of the proprietor or designer, and the capabilities of the situation, must
                    determine not only the external configuration, but also the arrangement of the
                    interior parts. By judicious management, it may be made to pass through
                    shrubbery, gradually assuming a more woodland character, and groups of trees,
                    into the park on the one hand, and into the kitchen garden or orchard on the
                    other. In most cases, even when it is in the vicinity of the mansion-house, the
                    flower garden should be encircled with some sort of fence, in order to convey
                    the idea of protection, as well as to furnish security to the vegetable inmates
                    of the parterres, it being impossible to carry on floriculture to any great
                    extent in open places which are accessible to hares and rabbits. In detached
                    localities, the fences may be made sufficiently strong to preclude the intrusion
                    of every species of vagrant; and these it is not difficult to mask with shrubs
                    and trees. A north wall of moderate extent and moderate elevation, is often
                    desirable, as affording space for ornamental climbers, and half-acclimatized
                    exotics, and as forming a <hi rend="italic">point</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >d’appui</hi> for the conservatory and other botanical structures, Such a wall
                    may be surmounted with urns and other architectural ornaments, and screened at
                    some little distance behind by trees. The other fences may be of wire-work,
                    generally called <hi rend="italic">invisible,</hi> or of wooden rails, or of
                    holly hedges with rails.</p>
                <p>Formerly the flower-beds were made either circular, straight, or in curves, and
                    were turned into knots, scrolls, volutes, and other compartments; and this taste
                    prevailed, perhaps, in some measure from a desire on the part of the contrivers,
                    to compensate by their ingenuity for the paucity of the ornamental plants which
                    they then cultivated. Now that the riches of Flora have poured into our gardens,
                    a simpler taste has obtained. Of the figures in fashion at present in the
                    lawn-flower-garden, perhaps the kidneyshape and its varieties occur too
                    frequently. It is needless as well as impossible to specify the numerous
                    configurations of flower-plots, for they abound in kaleidoscopical variety. Good
                    taste will suggest that those only should be associated which harmonize well
                    together; and it is better to incur the hazard of an apparent monotony, than to
                    excite wonder by incongruous combination. When the figures are separated by
                    turf, it is necessary that the little lawns or glades should have a certain
                    degree of breadth, as nothing has a worse effect than over-crowding. A multitude
                    of little figures should also be avoided, as they produce what Mr Gilpin calls
                    <hi rend="italic">spottiness,</hi> and which, as he has correctly pointed out,
                    is a grievous deformity. In this sort of flower garden, it is desirable that a
                    gravel walk should skirt along at least one side of the principal figures; in
                    our humid climate, the grass would otherwise render them inaccessible with
                    comfort during a great part of the year. In those gardens in which turf is
                    wholly or partly excluded, the compartments should be of a larger and more
                    massive character. Narrow borders, bounded by parallel straight lines and
                    concentric curves, should be avoided. The centres of the figures should be
                    filled with tall-growing shrubs, and even with an occasional low evergreen tree,
                    such as a yew or a holly. The walks, arranged in long concave curves, may
                    communicate here and there with one another. A dial, a few seats and arbours,
                    with an urn or two or a vase, may be introduced with good effect. It is to be
                    regretted that few good specimens of this species of flower garden have hitherto
                    been executed in Britain.</p>
                <p>Amongst the accompaniments of the flower garden may be mentioned the Rock-work.
                    This consists of variously grouped masses of large stones, generallysuch as are
                    remarkable for being figured by water-wearing, or for containing petrifactions
                    or impressions; and into the cavities between the stones, filled with earth,
                    alpine or trailing plants are inserted. In proper situations, a small piece of
                    water may be introduced, for the culture of aquatic plants. One of the walks is
                    sometimes arched over with wire-work, and covered with ornamental climbing
                    shrubs, forming a delightful promenade in the glowing days of summer. A separate
                    compartment, generally of a regular figure, is set apart for roses, under the
                    name of the Rosary. A moist or rather a shady border, with bog earth, is devoted
                    to that class of shrubs, commonly, but not very accurately, designated “American
                    plants.” In extensive places, a separate “American Garden” is often formed, in a
                    locality which, if not damp, has at least the command of water, occupying
                    generally some warm corner of the park.</p>
                <p>Some writers have advocated the formation of Winter and Spring Gardens in
                    separate localities; but we are not aware that their ideas have ever been
                    embodied to any great extent. It is proposed that in the winter garden should be
                    assembled all the most beautiful evergreen shrubs and plants, together with the
                    few flowers that bloom during the winter months. The situation, it is
                    recommended, should be well sheltered, and open only to the warm rays of the
                    sun, which are peculiarly grateful in our cold winter seasons. However
                    attractive this scheme may be in theory, it seems doubtful whether it would be
                    very successful in execution. Masses of evergreens have a sombre and monotonous
                    effect, even in winter, unless occasionally broken and varied by deciduous
                    trees. The contrast of their leafless neighbours relieves the intenseness of
                    their gloom, and sets off their brilliancy. Though a winter garden, the very
                    name of which is chilling, is perhaps not very desirable by itself, the object
                    to be attained in it should be kept in view in the formation of the park or
                    flower garden. We can easily suppose a particular section of the latter to
                    contain a predominance of evergreens, and to possess the principal characters of
                    a Winter Garden, without the formality of its name and purpose. In the immense
                    variety of situations, it is not difficult to imagine a sloping bank, for
                    instance, facing the sun, with a long walk skirting its base, the lower side of
                    which might be adorned with a border or narrow parterre planted with arbutus and
                    periwinkle, whilst the slope is covered with the higher evergreens, and the
                    summit of the acclivity is crowned with groups of deciduous trees, interrupted
                    by a few straggling firs, through which the wind, unfelt below, might sigh its
                    melancholy music. Again, the Spring Garden, which need not be of very great
                    extent, may take refuge in the vicinity of the greenhouse or conservatory, with
                    which it is naturally allied.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Soil.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> A variety of soils is
                    required in the flower garden, to suit the very different kinds of plants that
                    fall to be cultivated. To florists’ flowers particular compounds are assigned,
                    and these shall be mentioned when treating of the flowers themselves. <hi
                    rend="italic">American plants</hi> require a peaty earth, varying from boggy
                    peat to almost pure sand. Alluvial peat, that is, boggy earth which has been
                    washed away and incorporated with white sand, is to be preferred: peat, cut from
                    its natural bed and only partially decomposed, is of no value at all, or is
                    positively prejudicial to plants. In collecting soil from the surface of a muir,
                    it is proper to take no more than the upper turf or sod, with the peat adhering
                    to it, and only from the driest parts of the muir, where, besides the common
                    heath, fescue-grasses occur. Where this cannot be procured, a good substitute is
                    found in vegetable mould, that is, decayed leaves swept from lawns or woods, and
                    allowed to lie in heaps for a few years. For the general purposes of the flower
                    garden, a light loamy soil is advantageous; and where the natural covering is
                    thin, or requires making up, recourse should be had to the <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193647909" xml:id="kp-eb0711-7909-0678"/>surface-earth of old
                    pastures, which, especially when incumbent on trap-rocks, is found to be
                    excellent. It is expedient to have a large mass of this material in the compost
                    yard. The turf, and the surface-soil adhering to it, should be laid up in a
                    rough state, in which way it is continually ameliorating by the decomposition of
                    the vegetable matters, and the action of the air.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Garden Walks.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> During the
                    prevalence of the Dutch taste, grass-walks were common in our gardens; but,
                    owing to their frequent humidity in our climate, they have in a great measure
                    disappeared. Their disuse is perhaps to be regretted, as in some situations,
                    particularly behind lengthened screens of trees, or in gardens from which grass
                    has been in a great measure excluded, an example or two of them would be
                    agreeable. It is justly observed by Sir William Temple, that <hi rend="italic"
                    >“</hi><hi rend="italic">two</hi> things peculiar to us, and which contribute
                    much to the beauty and elegance of our gardens, are the gravel of our walks, and
                    the fineness and almost perpetual greenness of our turf and therefore no trouble
                    should be spared in securing excellence in these respects. In old times grass
                    walks were formed with much care. After the space which they were to occupy had
                    been digged and levelled that it might subside equally, a thin layer of sand or
                    poor earth was laid upon the snrŕàce, and over this a similar layer of good
                    soil. This arrangement was to prevent excessive luxuriance in the grass. In
                    selecting the seed, all annual, wiry, and coarse sorts of grass should be
                    avoided. Perhaps a mixture of Roughish Meadow-grass (Poa trivialis), Sheep’s
                    Fescue-grass (Festuca duriuscula and Festuca ovina), and Crested Dogstail grass
                    (Cynosurus cristatus), is about the best that could be selected. Poa nemoralis
                    is well adapted for shaded situations.</p>
                <p>Gravel-walks, in this department, are formed precisely in the same manner as
                    those in the kitchen garden. It may, however, be remarked, that a multitude of
                    gravelwalks, particularly when narrow, have a puny effect. All the principal
                    lines should be broad enough to allow at least three persons to walk abreast;
                    the others may be narrower. Much of the neatness of walks depends upon the
                    material of which they are made. Gravel from an inland pit is to be preferred;
                    though occasionally very excellent varieties are found upon the sea-coast. The
                    gravel of Kensington and Blackheath has attained considerable celebrity; and.is
                    frequently employed in remote parts of the kingdom, the expense being lessened
                    by its being conveyed to different sea-ports as ballast for ships. In summer a
                    gravel-walk requires hoeing and raking from time to time, to clear it from weeds
                    and tufts of grass. After this operation, or even after a simple sweeping, it is
                    rolled down with a handroller; and this is repeated as often as the surface is
                    ruffled. Nothing contributes more than frequent rolling to the elegance and
                    convenience of garden walks.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Edgings.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> Walks are generally
                    separated from the borders and parterres by a variety of plants planted closely
                    in line. By far the best edging is afforded by the Dwarf Dutch Box (Buxus
                    sempervirens var). It is extremely neat, and, when annually clipped, will remain
                    in good order for many years. It may be planted at any season, except when in
                    full growth or in mid-winter. Excellent edgings are also formed by Sea Pink
                    (Statice armeria) and Double Daisy (Bellis perennis). Dwarf Gentian (Gentiana
                    acaulis) and London Pride (Saxifraga umbrosa) are also sometimes used. Indeed,
                    any low-growing herbaceous plant, susceptible of minute division, is fitted for
                    an edging. Among the great variety occasionally employed for this purpose may be
                    mentioned, the Pansy (Viola tricoor), the Dwarf Bell-flower (Campanula pumila),
                    the Cowslip, Polyanthus, Auricula, Hepatica, Veronica fruticulosa, and Erica
                    carnea. Edgings may also be formed of spars of wood, narrow pieces of sandstone
                    flag, or even of slight bars of cast iron. In shrubberies and large
                    flower-plots, verges of grass-turf, about a foot in breadth, make a very
                    handsome border to walks. These should not be allowed to rise high above the
                    gravel: an inch and a half may be assigned as the limit they should not exceed.
                    The grass is kept short by repeated mowings, and the edges arc defined by
                    clipping with shears, or cutting with a paring iron.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Shrubs.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> Much of the beauty of the
                    pleasure garden depends upon the proper selection and disposition of ornamental
                    trees and shrubs; and it is to be regretted that this department of the art has
                    often been greatly neglected. In many gardens we still find only a few
                    evergreens, and a parcel of rugged deciduous species, introduced probably before
                    the age of Miller. No wonder is it, therefore, that we sometimes hear of the
                    insipid scenes of the shrubbery. Nevertheless, shrubs are highly elegant in
                    themselves, and they afford a most efficient means of diversifying garden
                    scenery. Of the many beautiful species now to be had in Britain, and affording
                    the materials of exquisite decoration, we can mention only a few. For extensive
                    lists and for much general information, we may once more refer to the work of Mr
                    Loudon.</p>
                <p>Of Evergreens, besides the Common Laurel (Prunus Laurocerasus) and the Portugal
                    Laurel (P. Lusitanica), we may notice the American Arborvitae (Thuja
                    occidentalis), as adapted to large masses of shrubs; and the Chinese Arborvitae
                    (T. orientalis), whose size and mode of growth fit it for smaller compartments.
                    The different varieties of Rhamnus Alaternus, and the species of Phillyrea and
                    Juniperus, have long and deservedly been favourite evergreens. The Sweet Bay
                    (Laurus nobilis), in favourable situations, rises into a handsome shrub or low
                    tree, and may convey to the student of the classics an idea of the Delphic
                    laurel. The Strawberry tree (Arbutus Unedo), a native of Ireland as well as of
                    the south of Europe, will always find a place as one of the most elegant of
                    plants, equally beautiful as regards foliage, flower, and fruit: nor should its
                    countryman, the Irish Yew, ascending like the pillared cypress, be forgotten.
                    The Cypress itself, though rather a denizen of the park, may be sparingly
                    introduced. The Laurustinus (Viburnum Tinus), with blossoms approaching the snow
                    in whiteness, enlivens the winter season, when nothing else is in flower in the
                    shrubbery. The Swedish and Irish Junipers deserve a place. Different species of
                    Daphne will not be forgotten; it may be sufficient to enumerate pontica,
                    collina, Cneorum, and hybrida. As extremely low evergreens, we may mention
                    Gualtheria procumbens and Shallon, Polygala Chamaebnxus, and Astragalus
                    Tragacantha; but these would probably be better placed among what are popularly
                    called American plants. Of the more tender evergreens, we should name the
                    Andrachne (Arbutus Andrachne), a beautiful shrub, but liable to be injured by
                    severe frosts. The Broad-leaved Myrtle (Myrtus Romana), in warm places, and with
                    the aid of a covering in the depth of winter, may be made to clothe the walls
                    with its brilliant verdure for eight months in the year, and with its white
                    flowers for some weeks in the end of summer. Aucuba Japonica, and Buxus
                    Balearicus, are handsome shrubs, of a somewhat stronger constitution: the former
                    is very ornamental in dull shady places, where no other shrub will grow. The
                    beautiful tribes of Cistus and Helianthe-mum, some of which are quite hardy, are
                    admirable for adorning sloping banks.</p>
                <p>Amongst the shrubs that require a peaty soil, or at leasts damp and shady
                    situation, the splendid genus Rhododendron holds the principal place. Of the
                    larger species may be mentioned R. Ponticum, Catawbiense, and maximum, with
                    their many beautiful varieties. In early spring, R. Däuricum expands its
                    blossoms among the first of flowering shrubs. Nor should we overlook R.
                    punctatum, hirsutum, ferrugineum, and Chamaecistus, of humbler growth, <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193647922" xml:id="kp-eb0711-7922-0679"/> but not inferior
                    in beauty. With these the closely cognate genus of Azalea, with its
                    multitudinous species and varieties, disputes the palm of elegance. The pale and
                    drooping Andromedas are scarcely of inferior interest. The hardy Heaths,
                    particularly Erica carnca, tetralix, and stricta, Menziesia polifolia and
                    coerulca, and the Canadian Rho-dora, combine to bring up the rear of this
                    department of Flora’s train. .</p>
                <p>The deciduous flowering shrubs are too much neglected in many gardens. They are
                    seldom well managed, either in point of arrangement or in the evolution, by
                    pruning, of picturesque effect. Very often they are huddled together
                    promiscuously, and grow up into the shape of huge sheaves of rushes. With
                    judicious management, there is not a finer object in the vegetable kingdom than
                    the common Lilac (Syringa vulgaris), or the hybrid Varin (S. Rathoma-gensis).
                    Even the old Guelder-Rose (Viburnum Opulus) is worthy of the poet’s eulogy; the
                    “scentless rose,” which he describes as “tall,”</p>
                <p>“And throwing up into the darkest gloom, Of neighbouring cypress, or more sable
                    yew, H er silver globes, light as the foamy surf That the wind severs from the
                    broken wave.”</p>
                <p>It would lead us into disproportioned detail to specify a tithe of those shewy
                    shrubs which should be dear to every floriculturist. Suffice it to name Ribes
                    sanguineum, Daphne mezereum, Spartium of many species, Cytisus, Amygdalus, and
                    Pyrus. The Ribes speciosum, or Fuchsia-flowered gooseberry, seems to require the
                    protection of a wall, but deserves it. The fine suffruticoe plant Paeonia
                    Moutan, requires the most sheltered position in the shrubbery, where, in May and
                    June, its flowers excel all others in magnificence. From such a list as that
                    published by Mr Loudon, any one might form such a collection as, when properly
                    ιrranged, would produce all the variety and beauty expected from the
                    shrubbery.</p>
                <p>There are many fine climbing shrubs, such as the species of Clematis, and of
                    Loniccra or Honeysuckle. Others, though not precisely of this class, are much
                    beholden to the shelter of a wall, such as the beautiful Magnolia conspicua, and
                    Edwardsia tetraptera and microphylla. Among those of recent introduction, may be
                    noticed Glycine Sinensis and Eccremocarpus scaber. The numerous species or
                    varieties of Fuchsia, when planted against a wall, or even in the open ground,
                    and shaded with an occasional covering in winter, convey to us a better idea of
                    the riches of Chilian vegetation, than when they are confined to the shelves of
                    the greenhouse. Many roses are also well adapted for walls, such as the
                    varieties of Noisette, Boursault, and the different species from China.</p>
                <p>A separate compartment, called the Rosary, is generally devoted to the
                    cultivation of roses. It is often of an oval form, with concentric beds, and
                    narrow intervening walks of grass or gravel, but it may assume any configuration
                    which is suited to display this favourite plant. Of the thousand varieties of
                    roses which exist in the nurseries, we pretend not to give any selection. It
                    may, however, be remarked, that in planting the Rosary, care should be taken to
                    classify the sorts according to the sizes and affinities, otherwise the effect
                    will be much impaired. The climbing sorts may be advantageously introduced,
                    being trained to pillar-like trellises. When the rosary is extensive, it is
                    judicious to intersperse some of the most showy hollyhocks; for thus the beauty
                    of the quarter is maintained in the later months of autumn, when the roses are
                    chiefly past. Of late years, quantities of standard roses have been imported
                    from the Continent. These are the finer sorts, budded on tall stocks of the wild
                    species, such as R. villosa and canina. They are well adapted to stand singly on
                    the little lawns in flower-gardens, or to break the uniformity of low flower
                    borders.</p>
                <p>All shrubs nearly may be propagated by layers, some by budding or grafting, many
                    by separating the roots. In planting, shrubs may be arranged either singly or in
                    masses: the latter method is perhaps the most efficient in the production of
                    effect, but it should not be very servilely adhered to, as it is apt to beget
                    monotony. Some kinds should never appear in masses: The white Portugal broom,
                    for instance, when so arranged, gives a limy tint to a garden. Perhaps it is
                    better that groups should contain a predominance of one shrub, set off by a few
                    others of a contrasting figure or colour, than that they should be entirely
                    homogeneous.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Herbaceous Plants.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> Common
                    perennial flowers, whether strictly herbaceous or bulbous, afford the principal
                    materials for floral decoration. Botany supplies, as it were, the colours for
                    the picture, and gardening grinds and prepares them for use. The painting is
                    continually varying, and new shades are arriving and departing in succession.
                    The least consideration of the subject will suggest the rule, that in planting
                    flowers they should be arranged according to their stature, otherwise many of
                    the most beautiful little flowers would be lost among their taller compeers. The
                    lowest plants should therefore stand next the margin of the border or parterre,
                    and they should increase in height as they go back. To produce a full shew, a
                    profusion, just not amounting to crowding, is requisite. The flower-plots should
                    present a regular bank of foliage and blossom, rising gradually from the front;
                    but as this might convey an idea of too great precision, a few <hi rend="italic"
                    >staring</hi> plants, on the same principle as those employed in greenhouses,
                    should be thinly scattered over the surface. These may be shrubs, or any tall
                    showy plant, such as Bocconia cordata, Papaver bracteatum, Gladiolus Byzantinus,
                    or Lilium candidum, The management of colour is more difficult. When the length
                    of the flowering season is considered, it will be obvious that it is impossible
                    to keep up the show of a single border or plot for six months together, and
                    consequently that much of the labour employed in mixing colours is misspent,
                    since plants, as they are commonly arranged, come dropping into flower one after
                    another; and even where a certain number are in bloom at the same time, they
                    necessarily stand apart, and so the effects of contrast, which can be perceived
                    only among adjacent objects, are entirely lost. To obviate this defect, it has
                    been recommended that ornamental plants should be formed into four or five
                    separate suites of flowering, to be distributed over the garden. Not to mention
                    the more vernal flowers, the first might contain the flora of May; the second
                    that of June; the third that of July; and the fourth the tribes of August and
                    the following months. These plants should be kept in separate compartn⅛ents,
                    arranged either singly or in masses; but the compartments themselves should be
                    so intermingled, as that no particular class should be entirely absent from any
                    one quarter of the garden. The May parterres should, however, chiefly occur in
                    the vicinity of the greenhouse or conservatory, or, when these are absent, in a
                    warm sunny situation. The flowerings of June and July, as being highly shewy,
                    should occupy the most conspicuous parts of the garden. The autumnal perennials,
                    not being so imposing, may retire into the more secluded situations, as they arc
                    supplanted by the superior brilliancy of the annuals, which fill the vacant beds
                    of florists’ flowers, or are scattered over the faded chimps of May and
                    June,</p>
                <p>Before attempting to plant, the floriculturist would do well to construct tables
                    or lists of flowers, specifying their respective times of flowering, their
                    colours, and altitudes. These tables, when skilfully used, would prevent
                    mistakes, produce a greater facility of execution, and put the colours nearly as
                    much under control as they are on the painter’s pallet. To diversify properly
                    and mingle well together the reds, whites, purples, yellows, and blues, with all
                    their <pb break="no" facs="nls:193647935" xml:id="kp-eb0711-7935-0680"
                    />intervening shades, requires considerable taste and powers of conception; but
                    if success is not attained in the first attempt, inaccuracies should be noted,
                    and rectified at the proper time next season. Certain series of colours have
                    been given, but these it is needless to mention, as it is quite immaterial
                    whether the first flower in a row be red or white. The principal object is to
                    preserve an agreeable contrast; and as at particular seasons a monotony of tint
                    prevails, it is useful at such times to be in possession of some strong glaring
                    colours. White, for instance, should be much employed in July, to break the
                    duller blues and purples which then preponderate. The orange lily, too, is very
                    effective at that season. On the other hand, yellows are superabundant in
                    autumn, and therefore reds and blues should then be sought for.</p>
                <p>Besides mere vividness of colour and elegance of form, there are other qualities
                    which render plants desirable in the flower-garden. Whoever has visited a
                    botanic garden, must have been sensible of an interest excited by the curious
                    structure or by the scarcity of some plants. Even quaintness of form is
                    deserving of attention. The -writer of this article has seen Allium fistulosum
                    (the common Welsh onion) making a conspicuous figure in a flower-garden; and he
                    remembers well a plant of sea-kale (Crambe maritima), which the good taste of
                    the owner had introduced into the parterre, to the great disturbance of the
                    ideas of the gardener. At the same time, it must be admitted that such
                    expedients should be employed with reserve. No handsome plant should be rejected
                    because it is common, nor any inconspicuous weed preserved merely because it is
                    scarce. The flower-gardener should have a small nursery for the propagation of
                    finer plants, to be transferred into the borders as often as is required.</p>
                <p>We shall enumerate merely the. names of a few of the most shewy flowers, adapted

                    Pentstemons from the Columbia Priver, the Verbenas and Calceolarias from South
                    America, and the Po-tentillas and Geraniums from Nepal, have in a great measure
                    changed the face of our flower gardens. While our riches have increased, the
                    difficulty, as well as the necessity, of making a selection have increased
                    also.</p>
                <p>Most herbaceous perennial plants are propagated by parting the roots, or by
                    cuttings; but some most conveniently by the sowing of seed.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Biennial Plants.</hi> Plants whose existence is limited to two
                    years, in the latter of which they flower and then decay, are called biennials.
                    Many of them possess considerable beauty; and by their easy propagation, and
                    rapid growth, they afford a ready means of decorating borders. The following may
                    be considered most worthy of notice: Agrostemma coronaria; Antirrhinum majus;
                    Hedysarum coronarium; Lunaria biennis; Campanula media; Oenothera sinuata,
                    biennis; Verbascum formosum, Hesperis matronalis, Scabiosa atropurpurea,
                    Mathiola simplicicaulis. When a very desirable variety is procured, such as the
                    striped Antirrhinum majus, attention should be paid to the striking of cuttings
                    during the summer, as the only means of continuance.</p>
                <p>Biennials are sown in beds in the end of spring, and are generally transplanted
                    in the course of the autumn, into the places where they are intended to stand,
                    that they may be confirmed before winter, and shoot up readily into flower in
                    the following summer.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Annual Plants</hi> —Many of the annuals species, though of
                    fugitive duration, are possessed of much beauty of hue and elegance of form.
                    They are further valuable from their pliability, so to speak, and the
                    promptitude with which they may be used. They are besides of easy culture, many
                    requiring nothing more than to have the seeds sown in the spot where they are to
                    grow. Annuals may be divided into three classes, the <hi rend="italic"

                    which they are to occupy; the <hi rend="italic">half-hardy</hi> succeed best
                    when aided at first by a slight hot-bed, and then transplanted into the open
                    air; the tender are kept in pots, and treated as greenhouse or stove-plants, to
                    which departments they properly belong. It is scarcely necessary to remark that
                    the <hi rend="italic">hardy</hi> and <hi rend="italic">half hardy</hi> sorts may
                    be grown either in patches or in beds, and are subjected to all the rules which

                <p>We have been able to enumerate only a small selection of species, out of a
                    multitude which is continually receiving accessions. Many of the sorts mentioned
                    above have been introduced during the last ten or fifteen years; and we doubt
                    not that, in an equal period from the present, many more will come into
                    notice.</p>
                <p>Before leaving this part of the subject, it may be proper to mention, that it is
                    now the practice of some florists to grow and treat as annuals, or rather as
                    biennials, great quantities of the more hardy Pélargonia, Verbenae, Salviae,
                    Fusehiae, Hemimeris, and other genera. Mr James Smith at Hopetoun House, every
                    season propagates, by cuttings or seeds, several hundreds of these plants. Grown
                    in moderate-sized pots, they are kept in frames or cold vineries during winter.
                    About the end of May, or as soon as there is no longer any apprehension of
                    injury from frost, the plants are taken out of the pots and plunged into the
                    open ground, in any warm sunny spot or elump in the flower garden. If the stems
                    are long or naked, they are pegged to the earth. Towards the middle of July they
                    begin to grow vigorously, and in August or September present, in luxuriance, at
                    least, if not in magnitude, a better representation of their native vegetation
                    than we see elsewhere in our gardens. Upon the approach of frost, they are, with
                    the exception of the Fuschias, left to their fate, as it is easier to propagate
                    new ones than to preserve the old. These plants, with the fine new annuals, and
                    the gorgeous Dahlias, give a splendour to the autumnal flower garden which in
                    former times it did not possess.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Florists’ Flowers</hi> This technical appellation has been
                    restricted to certain flowers, which have been especial favourites with
                    florists, and have consequently received a large share of their attention.
                    Though possessed of great individual beauty, few of them are calculated to make
                    a shew at a distance, and the arrangements requisite for their culture do not
                    harmonize well with the general disposition of a flower garden. It is,
                    therefore, desirable, particularly when considerable refinement is aimed at,
                    that a separate garden, or a separate section of the garden, should be set apart
                    for their culture. The more robust or less valuable varieties, however, which
                    are often as shewy as the most esteemed, may be introduced into the general
                    parterres. We shall notice the most considerable, in the order in which they
                    naturally attract attention.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">The Hyacinth,</hi> Hyacinthus orientalis, one of the most
                    beautiful and fragrant of the spring flowers, is a native of the Levant, where
                    it occurs abundantly, in form not unlike our common harebell. It has long been a
                    favourite in the East: but has been brought to its present artificial perfection
                    in Holland, chiefly since the beginning of last century. Many years ago it was
                    successfully grown in the vicinity of Edinburgh, by Justice, one of the most
                    ingenious horticulturists of his time: but it must be confessed that, in the
                    culture of this flower, the British florists have never attained to the eminence
                    of the Dutch, principally, however, as is alleged by some, from want of
                    attention and pains-taking. According to Miller, the catalogues of the Haarlem
                    florists used to enumerate' 2000 sorts, some of which sold as high as L. 200 a
                    bulb: they are now less numerous, and much less expensive.</p>
                <p>Hyacinths are either single, semidouble or double, and exhibit a great variety of
                    tint. In a fine flower the stalk should be tall, strong, and upright; the
                    blossoms numerous, large, and suspended in a horizontal direction; the whole
                    flower having a compaet pyramidal form, with the uppermost blossom quite erect;
                    the plain colour should be clear and bright; and strong colours are preferable
                    to pale; when colours are mixed they should blend with elegance.</p>
                <p>The hyacinth delights in a rielι light sandy soil; and it is chiefly owing to the
                    want of these qualities in his composts, that the British florist fails in the
                    growth of this beautiful plant. The Dutch compost, as given by the Hon. and Rev.
                    Mr Herbert in the <hi rend="italic">London Hortic. Transactions</hi> vol. iv.,
                    is the following: One-third coarse sea or river sand; one-third rotten cow-dung
                    without litter; and one-third leaf mould. The natural soil is removed at least
                    two feet deep, and the vaeant space filled up with compost, previously prepared
                    and well mixed. These materials retain their qualities for six or seven years,
                    but the Dutch do not plant hyacinths upon the same place for two years
                    successively. In the alternate years they plant it with narcissus or crocus. We
                    may mention that, in the finest lied of hyacinths which we have seen in
                    Scotland, a considerable portion of the soil was composed of <hi rend="italic"
                    >sleetch,</hi> a sort of sandy and marly deposition from the ooze on the shores
                    of the Forth.</p>
                <p>A ecording to Mr Main <hi rend="italic">(Villa and Cottage Florists’
                    Directory,</hi> p. 84.J St Crispin’s day, the 25th of October, is the best time
                    to plant the bulbs. They arc arranged in rows, eight inches asunder, there being
                    four rows in eaeli bed; or, if more convenient, they may be placed in rows
                    across the bed. The bulbs are sunk about three or four inches deep, and it is
                    recommended to put a small quantity of clean sand below and all around them. As
                    the roots are liable to be injured by frost, it is usual to cover the beds with
                    decayed tan-bark, with litter or with awnings. The first may be considered the
                    neatest during winter, but an awning is nearly indispensable in spring when the
                    lingering colds prove exceedingly hurtful to the young flowerstems. The awning
                    may be made of coarse sheeting or duck. As the flower-stems appear, they are
                    tied to little rods, to keep them upright and preserve them from accident. In
                    order to perfect the colours, the rays of the sun are admitted in the morning or
                    in the evening, but the glare of mid-day and the cold of the night, are both
                    excluded. When the season of blossom is over the awning is removed, or only
                    replaced to keep off heavy rains. Much of the success, in the culture of this
                    flower, depends on the subsequent management of the bulbs. It is the practice in
                    Holland, about a month after the bloom, or when the tips of the leaves assume a
                    withered appearance, to take up the roots, and, cutting off the stem and the
                    foliage within half an inch of the bulb, but leaving the fibres, to lay the
                    bulbs sideways on the ground, covering then} with half an inch of dry earth.
                    After three weeks, they are again taken up, cleaned, and removed to the
                    store-room. In this country it is more common to allow them to stand till the
                    leaves be withered, and then to take them up at once. In the store-room the
                    roots should be kept dry, well-aired, and apart from each other.</p>
                <p>Where forcing is practised, a few hyacinths may be forced in deep flower-pots
                    filled with light earth, and, when coming into flower, transferred to the
                    greenhouse, which they enliven at the deadest season of the year. In chambers,
                    they <pb break="no" facs="nls:193647961" xml:id="kp-eb0711-7961-0682"/>are grown
                    in water-glasses made for the purpose; or, with still greater advantage, in
                    boxes filled with damp hypnum moss.</p>
                <p>New varieties of hyacinths are procured by sowing the seed; but this is a tedious
                    process, and seldom followed in this country. The established sorts are
                    propagated by offsets or small bulbs, which form at the base of the parent bulb.
                    Almost all the hyacinths cultivated in this country are imported from Holland,
                    and the quantity of roots annually introduced must be very considerable.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Tulip,</hi> Tulipa Gesneriana, is a native of the East,
                    whence it was introduced in Europe about the middle of the 16th century. Gaudy
                    as it is, it has no proper corolla, but only a calyx of six coloured sepals.
                    About the year 1635 the culture of the tulip was very engrossing; and, indeed,
                    the rage for possessing rare sorts had become so great in Holland, as to give
                    rise to a strange species of gambling, known to the collectors of literary and
                    scientific anecdotes by the name of Tulipo-mania, which has tended to bring
                    unmerited discredit on this fine flower. At present the finer tulips are mostly
                    of moderate price, and, though not to be met with in every garden, have yet some
                    ardent cultivators.</p>
                <p>There are some varieties, such as the early Due Van Thol, the Clarimond, the
                    Parrots, and the Double Tulips, which belong, properly speaking, to the general
                    cultivator. In this country, the florists’ tulips are arranged under four
                    classes. 1. The <hi rend="italic">Bizarres,</hi> which have a yellow ground
                    marked with purple or scarlet. 2. The <hi rend="italic">Bybloemens,</hi> with a
                    white ground marked with violet or purple. 3. The <hi rend="italic">Roses,</hi>
                    with a white ground marked with rose-colour. 4. The <hi rend="italic">Self</hi>
                    or <hi rend="italic">Plain-coloured</hi> tulips, which are of one uniform
                    colour, and are chiefly valued as breeders. The Byblβemen class includes most of
                    those tulips which are held in highest esteem ill this country.</p>
                <p>The properties of a fine late tulip, as specified by Mr Hogg, are the following,
                    somewhat abridged. The stem should be strong, erect, thirty inches high: the
                    flower large, of six petals (sepals), which should proceed almost horizontally
                    at first, and, turning up, should form an almost perfect cup, with a round
                    bottom, rather widest at top. The three exterior petals should be rather larger
                    than the three interior ones: the limbs of the petals should be rounded, and
                    freed from every species of, serrature. The ground colour of the flower at the
                    bottom should be clear white or yellow; and the various rich-coloured stripes,
                    which are the principal ornament of a fine tulip, should be regular, bold, and
                    distinct at the margin, and terminate in fine broken points, elegantly feathered
                    or pencilled. There are other refinements upon which florists are not quite
                    agreed: and it must be confessed, that their standard of excellence is somewhat
                    factitious; for, to an uninstructed eye, though practised in the contemplation
                    of other sorts of beauty, a tulip, which by them is looked upon as worthless,
                    will often appear as fine as the choicest variety in the select bed.</p>
                <p>Tulips prosper in a light sandy soil, richly manured with well rutted cow dung.
                    Twenty inches depth of soil should be removed, and the vacant space filled up
                    with compost. Some put alternate layers of light soil and cow dung. The bed
                    should be filled up with compost about the middle of October, and in a
                    fortnight, when the soil has subsided, the bulbs are planted in rows, distant
                    eight or nine inches, and at the depth of about three inches. A little clean
                    sand may be put around the bulbs. After planting, the bed may be covered over
                    with tan, or with a hooped awning, as in the ease of hyacinths. In spring, it is
                    necessary to shield the leaves and flower-stalks -from frost, and also from
                    heavy rains; and, when in bloom, the flowers must be sheltered from the sun’s
                    rays, by which they are speedily injured. After the sepals have fallen, the
                    seed-vessels are broken off close by the stem, to prevent the plant from
                    exhausting itself in perfecting seed, and to direct its energies to the forming
                    of the new bulb. When the leaves have withered, the bulbs are taken up, dried,
                    and stored until the planting season come round.</p>
                <p>Tulips are readily propagated by offsets, which are taken off from the parent
                    bulbs, and nursed in separate beds till they be full grown. New varieties are
                    raised from seed; they are from five to seven years old before they flower, and,
                    if raised from promiscuous seed, they often turn out worthless. Early in the
                    18th century, the distinguished Scottish cultivator, Sir James Justice (already
                    mentioned as a most successful cultivator of hyacinths), was eminently
                    successful in raising fine seedling tulips; and some skilful florists of our own
                    day, such as Mr Strong of Brook Green, and Mr Oliver of Edinburgh, succeed in
                    breaking their seedlings into colours equal to the finest bybloemens of Holland.
                    They save the seeds from the first-rate sorts, the stigma of the intended parent
                    flower having been fertilized with the pollen of some other fine variety.
                    Seedling tulips, it may be remarked, present this anomaly for the first two or
                    three years, that they form their new bulbs several inches below the old ones,
                    so that an inexperienced cultivator is sometimes apt to miss them at the time of
                    lifting.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Ranunculus</hi> (R. Asiaticus) is, like many of the other
                    florist’s flowers, a native of the Levant, where it is a favourite of the Turks.
                    It has sported into innumerable varieties, and those now in cultivation in this
                    country are mostly of British origin. The plant is of small stature, furnished
                    with decomposite leaves, and rising from a root formed by a bundle of little
                    tubers. . ∙.</p>
                <p>According to the canons of floral criticism, the properties of a fine double
                    ranunculus are the following: The stem should be strong, straight, and from
                    eight to ten inches high, supporting a large well-formed blossom at least two
                    inches in diameter, consisting of numerous petals, the largest at the outside,
                    and gradually diminishing in size as they approach the centre of the flower,
                    which should be well filled up with them. The blossom should be of a
                    hemispherical form; its component petals imbricated neither too closely nor too
                    much separated, and having rather a perpendicular than a horizontal direction.
                    The petals should be broad, and have perfectly entire well-rounded edges; their
                    colours should be dark, clear, rich or brilliant, either consisting of one
                    colour throughout, or be otherwise variously diversified on an ash, white,
                    sulphur or fire-coloured ground, or regularly striped, spotted, or mottled in an
                    elegant manner.</p>
                <p>The ranunculus requires a stronger and moister soil than most other flowers.
                    Maddock prefers a fresh, strong, rich loam. Hogg recommends a fresh loam, with a
                    considerable portion of rotted cow or horse dung. The Rev. Mr Williamson (Hort.
                    Trans, vol. iv.) uses a stiff clay loam, with a fourth of rotten dung. “The bed
                    should be dug from eighteen inches to two feet deep, and not raised more than
                    four inches above the level of the walks, to preserve the moisture more
                    effectually: at about five inches below the surface should be placed a stratum
                    of two-year-old rotten cow dung, mixed with earth, six or eight inches thick;
                    but the earth above this stratum, where the roots are to be placed, should be
                    perfectly free from dung, which would prove injurious if nearer. The fibres will
                    draw sufficient nourishment at the depth above mentioned; but it the dung were
                    placed deeper, it would not receive so much advantage from the action of the
                    air.” Other florists have recommended to put the manure at least two feet and a
                    half below the surface of the earth. The principal object, however, is to
                    maintain throughout the bed a genial moisture; and this is to be done by
                    avoiding all hot gravelly earths, and particularly soils that are apt to cake.
                    The tubers are planted late in autumn or early in spring, in rows five or six
                    inches apart, and three or four inches separate <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193647974" xml:id="kp-eb0711-7974-0683"/>in the rows. They should be
                    so close that the foliage shall cover the surface of the bed, for in this way a
                    salutary degree of shade and moisture is preserved. The autumn planted roots
                    must be sheltered from frost by old tan or hooped mattings. When in flower, the
                    plants are covered with an awning. When the leaves wither, the roots are taken
                    up, dried, and stored.</p>
                <p>Scarcely any florists’ flower is more readily propagated from seed, or sooner
                    repays the care of the cultivator. The seed is obtained from semi-double sorts,
                    which are often of themselves very beautiful flowers. It is generally sown in
                    boxes in autumn or spring. We have often seen it committed with success to the
                    open ground. The young plants thus raised flower, often in the second, and
                    always in the third year.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Anemone</hi> of the flower garden includes two species,
                    Anemone coronaria, a native of the Levant, and A. hortensis, a native of Italy.
                    These have long shared the attention of the florist, and in his arrangements
                    have generally been associated with the ranunculus, resembling it in its natural
                    affinities and mode of culture. The single and semi-double flowers are
                    considered nearly as fine as the double ones. The sorts are numerous, but at
                    present are seldom distinguished by names. In a fine double anemone, the stem
                    should be strong, erect, and not less than nine inches high. The flower should
                    be at least two and a half inches in diameter, consisting of an exterior row of
                    large well rounded petals, in the form of a broad shallow cup, the interior part
                    of which should contain a number of small petals, mixed with stamens,
                    imbricating each other. The colours should be clear and distinct, when
                    diversified in the same flower, or striking and brilliant, when there is only
                    one tint.</p>
                <p>The soil and culture are so nearly the same as in the ranunculus, that it is
                    needless to specify them. The plant continues longer in flower, and the leaves
                    often remain so long green, that it is difficult to find a period of inaction in
                    which to take up the roots. It has been recommended, that as soon as the bloom
                    is over, the bed should be screened from rain by mattings until the leaves
                    wither. As the roots are rather brittle, they require considerable care in
                    handling. Anemones are easily raised from the seed. A bed of single anemones, it
                    may be remarked, is a valuable addition to a flower garden, as it affords, in a
                    warm situation, an abundance of handsome and often brilliant spring flowers,
                    almost as early as the snowdrop or crocus.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Narcissus</hi> is an extensive genus, including a great
                    many interesting species and varieties. It belongs, however, rather to the
                    botanicoflorist than to the florist proper; but as it contains many plants of
                    great elegance, it ought to receive more general attention. The Polyanthus
                    Narcissus (N. Tazetta) affords the varieties which are chiefly cultivated by
                    florists. These prosper in a rich light soil, containing a little dung. The
                    roots should not be stirred more frequently than once in three years; and this
                    remark applies also to Narcissus Jonquilla and odorus, the small and large
                    jonquil, of which fragrant plants there should be beds in every flower garden.
                    N. Tazetta, like the hyacinth, may also be grown either in pots or in
                    water-glasses.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Iris.</hi> The species which peculiarly appertain to the
                    florist are, I. Xiphium and Xiphioides, of both of which there are many
                    beautiful varieties. They are of easy culture, succeeding in almost any kind of
                    soil, and requiring to be moved only once in three or four years. The roots are
                    not improved by being kept out of the ground; and perhaps the best method is,
                    upon taking them up and freeing them from their shaggy skins, to replant them
                    immediately.</p>
                <p>Besides these, may be mentioned the Persian Iris (I. Persica), a low
                    bulbous-rooted plant, with delicate blue or violet coloured flowers, and a high
                    degree of fragrance. It has long been cultivated by the Dutch, from whom bulbs
                    are annually procured. It is grown in water, or in pots of nearly pure sand.
                    When planted out, it requires to be guarded from frosts and rain. The
                    Snake’s-head Iris (I. tuberosa, <hi rend="italic">Bot.</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Mag.)</hi> is also a fragrant species, and is more hardy than the preceding. Mr
                    Denson, who has been very successful in the culture of this plant, recommends,
                    in <hi rend="italic">Gard. Mag.</hi> vol. viii., that it should be allowed to
                    stand two or three years in succession on the same spot; when, “in July, take it
                    up and divide the tubers, planting them soon as dug up, six inches deep in a
                    compost formed of half friable mould, and half leaf mould, or old hot-bed dung,
                    rotted to the consistence of soil. Let the situation be a dry bed or border, at
                    the base of a wall, with a southern aspect, and plant the tubers close to the
                    wall, or only a few inches from it.” The Chalcedonian Iris (I. susiana), is the
                    most magnificent species of the genus, and is well worth the labour of the
                    cultivator. Its little stalk, a few inches high, is surmounted by a splendid
                    corolla, the petals of which are nearly as broad as the hand, and are of a
                    purple or black ground, striped with white. It loves a loamy soil, and a sunny
                    exposure, and must be guarded from moisture and frosts in winter. For these
                    three species Mr Loudon recommends the protection of a frame.</p>
                <p>There are many other species which are worthy of a place in a select flower
                    garden, and when well grouped in a peaty earth, form an agreeable appendage to a
                    parterre. Of these we may mention the low creeping I. cristata and pumila, the
                    more aspiring prismatica, flexuosa, virginica, sordida, variegata and Swertii,
                    the taller Sibirica, triflora and ochroleuca, the broad leaved Florentina,
                    Germanica and sambucins⅛ and the stately pallida, which, for simple elegance, is
                    not outshone by any of its compeers. This beautiful family is much beholden to
                    David Falconer, Esq. of Carlowrie, who has introduced some of its most
                    interesting members to the horticultural world in Scotland.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Lily.</hi> Of the genus Lilium there are many species, some
                    of which have not been exhibited to the extent of their capabilities in the
                    flower garden. The old white Lily (L. candidum, L.) after supplying the poets
                    with so much imagery, has retired into the modest station of a common border
                    flower. The flaunting Orange-Lily (L. bulbiferum) may be allowed, if it pleases,
                    to follow its example. L. mar-tagon may occupy the same place. The scarlet
                    Turk’s Cap (L. Chalcedonicum) is worthy of more care, as being more beautiful
                    and more tender. It does not relish being disturbed, and it dislikes peat. On
                    the contrary, the splendid Tiger Lily (L. tigrinum), which propagates rapidly by
                    axillary bulbs, succeeds best in peaty soil. The same remark applies to the
                    rarer L. canadense, and superbum (magnificent species) as well as to L.
                    concolor, Pennsyl-vanicum and others, which ought to be more common in our
                    gardens. L. Japonicum and longiflorum, in which the genus attains its greatest
                    magnificence, unfortunately require a finer climate than ours, and must
                    therefore be grown in pots under glass.</p>
                <p>Omitting <hi rend="italic">Crocus, Fritillaria,</hi> and some other bulbous
                    genera, which are sometimes treated as florists’ flowers, we proceed to one of
                    the prime ornaments of the autumnal flower garden, the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Dahlia,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Georgina,</hi> as it is called by some
                    writers.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Dahlia,</hi> of which there are two species (D. variabilis
                    and D. coccinca), is a native of Mexico from which it was introduced in 1789,
                    but afterwards lost by our cultivators. It was reintroduced in 1804; but it was
                    not till ten years later that it was generally known in our gardens. The first
                    plants were single, of <hi rend="subscript"> ¼</hi> a pale purple colour, and
                    though interesting, as affording a new form of floral ornament, they by no means
                    held forth a promise of the infinite diversity of tint and figure exhibited by
                    their successors. At present the varieties are endless, each district <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193647987" xml:id="kp-eb0711-7987-0684"/> of the country
                    possessing suites of its own, and cultivators occasionally raising at one sowing
                    a dozen or two of sorts, which they think worthy of preservation. The results
                    have been most propitious to the flower garden, from which, indeed, the Dahlia
                    could nearly as ill be spared, as the potato from the kitchen garden.</p>
                <p>The varieties of Dahlia may be classed under the following heads: 1. The <hi
                    rend="italic">Common</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Rose-shaped</hi> form, under
                    which the double sorts first appeared. This is by far the most numerous class,
                    and perhaps the most beautiful. The dwarf sorts arc in most repute. 2. The <hi
                    rend="italic">Anemone-flowered,</hi> having a radius of large petals, and a
                    central disk of smaller ones, somewhat like the double anemone. 3. <hi
                    rend="italic">Globe-flowered,</hi> having small globular flowers, which are
                    extremely double. They possess great intensity of colour, and, rising for the
                    most part above the leaves, make generally as striking an appearance as those of
                    a more massive efflorescence.</p>
                <p>In a fine Dahlia the flowers should be fully double, always filling the centre;
                    the florets should be entire or nearly so, regular in their disposition, each
                    series overlapping the other backwards; they may be either plain or quilled, but
                    never distorted: if, instead of being reflexed, the florets are recurved, the
                    flower will be more symmetrical. The peduncles ought to be strong enough to keep
                    the blossoms erect, and long enough to shew the flowers above the leaves. Bright
                    and deep velvety colours are most admired.</p>
                <p>New varieties are, of course, procured from seed. If sown in flower-pots, and
                    aided by a little heat, the seedlings, speedily planted out, will flower the
                    first season. Estab'lis'hed •varieties are propagated by dividing the large
                    tuberous roots, but in doing so, care must be taken to have an eye to each
                    portion of tuber, otherwise it will not grow. Sometimes shoots of rare varieties
                    are grafted on the roots of others. A good method is to take cuttings close from
                    the roots of the plants, as soon as they shoot up in the beginning of summer,
                    and to strike them in small flower-pots. These will generally flower during the
                    current season.</p>
                <p>Dahlias succeed best in an open situation, and in rich loam; but there is
                    scarcely any garden soil in which they will not thrive, with manure. They are,
                    however, injured by being repeatedly planted on the same spot. They may stand
                    singly like common border flowers; but have the most imposing appearance when
                    seen in masses arranged according to their stature. Old roots often throw up a
                    multitude of stems, which render thinning necessary. As the plants increase in
                    height, they are furnished with strong stakes, to secure them from high winds.
                    Dahlias generally flower till they are interrupted by frost in autumn. The roots
                    are then taken up, dried, and stored in a cellar, or some other place, where
                    they may be secured from frost and moisture.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Auricula</hi> (Primula Auricula) is a native of the Alps
                    and the Caucasus. It has long been an inmate of our gardens; and has generally
                    been a favourite with those florists whose means and appliances arc of a limited
                    kind. Some of the most successful cultivators at present are among the
                    Operatives in the vicinity of Manchester and Paisley.</p>
                <p>Besides the double varieties which have never been in much repute, Auriculas are
                    classed under two divisions: the <hi rend="italic">Selfs</hi> or plain-coloured,
                    and the <hi rend="italic">variegated</hi> or <hi rend="italic">painted</hi>
                    sorts. Professed florists, confine their attention to the latter: it must,
                    however, be confessed, that their criteria of fine flowers are often .arbitrary,
                    and that although many of their favourites are examples of undoubted beauty, the
                    eye of the uninitiated would generally prefer the simpler hues, of the
                    self-coloured flowers.</p>
                <p>The auricula, though now almost wholly an artificial plant, and strangely
                    transformed from its original appearance, still loves a moist soil and shady
                    situation. The florists’ varieties are grown in rich composts, for the
                    preparation of which numberless receipts have been given. We quote that of Mr
                    Hogg, an experienced grower, as stated in his Supplement, p. 166. “One barrow of
                    rich yellow loam, or fresh earth from some meadow or pasture land or common,
                    with the turf well rotten; one barrow of leaf mould, one ditto of cow-dung, two
                    years old at least; and one peck of river, not sea sand. For strong plants
                    intended for exhibition, add to the same composition, as a stimulant, a
                    barrowful of well decayed night soil, with the application of liquid manure
                    before the top-dressing in February, and twice more, but not oftener, in March.
                    A portion of light, sandy, peat-earth may be added, as a safe and useful
                    ingredient, particularly for plants kept in low damp situations.”</p>
                <p>Auriculas may be propagated from seed. It is to "be sown in January or February
                    in boxes, which are kept under cover, and exposed only to the rays of the
                    morning sun. When seed has been saved from the finer sorts, the operation is one
                    of considerable nicety, as it not unfrequently happens that the best seedlings
                    are at first exceedingly weak. They generally flower in the second or third
                    year; and the florist is fortunate who obtains three or four good sorts out of a
                    large sowing. The established varieties are increased by dividing the roots, an
                    operation which is performed in July or in the beginning of August.</p>
                <p>Fine auriculas are grown in pots about six inches in diameter. These are kept in
                    frames, or stages constructed for the purpose. For winter use, perhaps there is
                    nothing better than a common hot-bed frame, as this admits of an exact
                    adjustment of air and temperature, things to which attention is absolutely
                    necessary as the plants approach the flowering season. After the bloom is over,
                    the pots may be placed on stages slightly elevated, and facing the north. Though
                    not absolutely necessary, it is useful to have the power of sheltering them from
                    long continued rains. It is usual every year to shift the plants, shortening the
                    roots, and giving them a large portion of new soil, soon after the flowers have
                    decayed. For more detailed information on this subject, we may refer to the
                    well-known treatises of Maddock and Hogg.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Polyanthus</hi> is supposed to be a seminal variety of
                    Primula vulgaris; and is much cultivated by some florists. Like the auricula, it
                    has sported into many hundred varieties. It is not necessary to give a detailed
                    account of its culture, as it scarcely differs from that of the auricula. The
                    polyanthus, however, is the hardier of the two, and seldom perishes from cold.
                    It may be mentioned that there are several beautiful double varieties of the
                    common primrose, which are deserving of a place in every garden.</p>
                <p>The whole genus <hi rend="italic">Primula</hi> merits the attention of the
                    curious cultivator. P. helvetica and nivalis adorn the flower borders in spring
                    with their abundant trusses of blossom. P. marginata, when planted in a shady
                    situation, is equally lavish of its pale and delicately beautiful flowers. P.
                    viscosa and integrifolia, with their intense colours, are the ornaments of the
                    alpine frame; or, with P. longifolia, farinosa, and Scotica, may be plunged into
                    the margin of the American border. A supply, however, should be kept in pots.
                    Besides these we might name P. cortusoides, Pallasii, Palinuri, and others. The
                    curious P. verticillata, and the splendid P. Sinensis, are inmates of the
                    greenhouse. The florist of simple tastes will love them all.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Carnation</hi> (Dianthus caryophyllus) has long been a
                    favourite flower, not only for the beauty but for the delightful fragrance of
                    its blossoms. It is a native of Germany, and it is occasionally found in an
                    apparently wild state in England. The cultivation of it, however, is by no means
                    easy, and calls forth all the resources of the florist. The varieties, which are
                    very numerous, have been arranged under three heads: <hi rend="italic"
                    >Flakes,</hi> having two colours, with their stripes running quite through and
                    along the <pb break="no" facs="nls:193648000" xml:id="kp-eb0711-8000-0685"
                    />petals; <hi rend="italic">Bizarres,</hi> irregularly spotted, and striped with
                    not few er than three colours; <hi rend="italic">Picoεes,</hi> spotted, with
                    serrated or fringed petals. Mr Hogg, who has written a treatise expressly on
                    this flower, has given a catalogue of nearly 350 bθrts.</p>
                <p>Carnations are propagated by layers or pipings: the former method is most
                    practised, but with some sorts piping, it is said, should be preferred. Layering
                    is performed when the plant is in full bloom. Proper shoots are selected; a few
                    of the lower leaves are then removed; an incision is made a little below a
                    suitable joint passing up through it, and the shoot is then pegged down and
                    covered with some fresh soil, the tip being left above ground. Layers are
                    generally found to be rooted in about a month after the operation has been
                    performed. Pipings are little cuttings, separated at a joint, and planted
                    thickly under bell-glasses on a slight hot-bed. They require great attention,
                    and are precarious in their success, but form excellent plants.</p>
                <p>Numerous directions have been given respecting composts for carnations. We
                    abridge those of Hogg, who is principal authority in this matter. Take three
                    barrows of loam, one and a half of garden mould, ten of horse-dung, and one of
                    coarse sand; let these be mixed, and thrown into a heap, and turned over two or
                    three times in the winter, particularly in frosty weather. Towards the end of
                    November a barrow-load of lime is added while hot, to aid in the decomposition
                    of the soil, and destroy worms. For the varieties which are liable to sport, he
                    recommends a poorer compost.</p>
                <p>The more robust carnations are planted out in beds or singly in the flower
                    garden; but the finer and tenderer sorts are growm in pots of about a foot in
                    diameter. The time of potting is about the end of March. When the flower-stems
                    shew themselves, they are furnished with rods, to which they are tied as they
                    lengthen, to prevent their being broken by the wind or other accident. When the
                    plants begin to expand their blossoms, they are removed to a stage calculated to
                    exhibit their beauties. Some florists attach ligatures of matting to the
                    flower-buds, in order to prevent irregular bursting, and even arrange the
                    petals, by removing distortions with scissars.</p>
                <p>New varieties are raised from seed. The seed of the hardier double or semidouble
                    sorts often affords a very beautiful bed of flowers, and should not be neglected
                    by those who have the command of extensive flower gardens.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Pink</hi> is considered by botanists as merely a variety of
                    the preceding. It is, however, very distinct in its character, and constant in
                    its habits. It is one of the mechanics’flowers, and is cultivated most
                    extensively in the neighbourhood of some of the manufacturing towns. Its simple
                    elegance does credit to the taste of those who select it for their favourite;
                    and it deserves a place in the garden of the highest as well as of the lowest in
                    the land. Pinks are numerous, the growers at Paisley enumerating about three
                    hundred varieties. Those are preferred which have the limb of the petals nearly
                    entire, and are well marked in the centre with bright crimson or dark
                    purple.</p>
                <p>Pinks are mostly propagated by pipings in slight hotbeds or unde; hand glasses;
                    and when proper attention is given to the due admission of air, they generally
                    succeed. Occasionally rare sorts, which are scantily furnished with grass, are
                    propagated by layers. This flower does not require such elaborate composts as
                    some others, but it likes fresh light soils, well manured with decayed cow dung.
                    Not more than two years of blooms should be taken from the same bed, and it is
                    the practice of most florists to have a new bed every year. The flower stalks
                    are supported by small sticks. As in the carnation, ligatures of matting, or
                    collars of card, are sometimes applied to the calyces of the flowers: but this
                    practice, however it may be followed by those who judge according to the
                    technical “criteria of a fine flower,” will scarcely be adopted by any who have
                    an eye for natural beauty.</p>
                <p>The genus <hi rend="italic">Lobelia</hi> may now be regarded as affording a group
                    of florists’ flowers. L. Cardinalis, the cardinal flower, has long been a valued
                    but somewhat rare plant. It is propagated by seed or by off-sets. L, fulgens is
                    a more shewy species, which, when potted and treated as a tender annual, forms a
                    magnificent plant. It also succeeds perfectly well in the open borders. Being a
                    semi-aquatic, it may be preserved during winter in springs or cisterns. We have
                    seen quantities kept most successfully at the mouth of an Artesian spring at
                    Hopetoun House. L. splendens is also worthy of notice. Besides the quaint L.
                    tupa, there are many other species, particularly the blue and yellow procumbent
                    sorts, which merit a place in every collection of fine flowers.</p>
                <p>It would lead us too much into detail to speak minutely of Calceolaria, Phlox,
                    Chelone, Pentstemon, Oenothera, and other genera, which approach the character
                    of florists’ flowers. To have them in perfection, they should be kept in beds by
                    themselves: and we are persuaded that, were a moiety of the care bestowed upon
                    some of the preceding flowers, which are conventionally supposed to belong
                    peculiarly to the florist, expended on them, they would amply repay the labour
                    of the cultivator.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Chinese Chrysanthemum</hi> (Chrysanthemum sinense), from
                    the peculiar culture which it now undergoes, may be considered to belong to this
                    department of flowers. It is a native of China, and though introduced many years
                    ago, its ornamental capabilities have only recently been brought into notice.
                    Flowering in November and December, it fills up, with its many coloured
                    blossoms, the blank of a most dreary season, and affords the means of decorating
                    greenhouses, conservatories, and dwelling-houses, when almost all other means of
                    embellishment fail. Forty varieties have been enumerated by Mr Sabine in the
                    London Horticultural Memoirs, but it is believed that there are many others not
                    yet introduced from China. The Chrysanthemum is hardy enough to live in the open
                    air, but it requires the shelter of a wall, and from the lateness of its
                    flowering, it is only the early varieties that, even n fine seasons, are
                    permitted to unfold their blossoms. It is seen in its beauty only when grown in
                    pots. Yearly plants are preferred. In the beginning of April, cuttings of the
                    last year’s shoots, about three inches long, are put singly into small pots,
                    filled with soil composed of one half bog earth 0 ∙ leaf mould, and one half
                    pure sand. Their growth is expedited at first by gentle heat. In about a month
                    they are rooted and are put into a cold frame, in which they are kept till the
                    beginning of June, when they are put into larger pots, and set out in some airy
                    situation, About this time the tops of the plants are pinched off to make them
                    bushy, but no more side shoots are allowed to remain for flowering than the
                    plants are likely to be able to support. In August they are again shifted into
                    larger pots, filled with strong rich soil, During the whole season, the pots are
                    frequently moved to prevent the roots from striking through, and they are never
                    plunged. Mr Monro of the Lond. Hortiç, Garden, whose method of culture we have
                    been describing, recommends liquid manure to be applied from time to time in
                    summer and autumn. Other cultivators, in order to have a greater succession of
                    flowers, and a variety in the stature of the plants, strike cuttings at two
                    seasons, in March and in May, and propagate by layers in August. In the
                    beginning of winter the plants are put into a cold frame or vinery, and they are
                    brought into a milder temperature as they are wanted. To produce large shewy
                    plants, a few of the. chrysanthemums of the former year may be selected, and,
                    being freed from suckers, and having the mould shaken from their roots, may be
                    repotted and shifted repeatedly during the summer and autumn.</p>

                <p>BOTANICAL STRUCTURES.</p>
                <p>Glazed houses, for the reception and culture of exotic plants, though sometimes
                    placed in connection with similar structures in the forcing department, are now
                    almost universally regarded as appendages of the flowet’ garden. In the hands of
                    architects they have assumed a great variety of forms. We shall confine
                    ourselves to the exhibition of the principle of the most important of these, and
                    shall limit our remarks to the Greenhouse, the Conservatory, and the Stove.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Greenhouse</hi> is intended to afford a winter and partly a
                    summer shelter to the less tender classes of exotic plants grown in pots. Fig.
                    5, Plate CCXCIII., exhibits the old <hi rend="italic">lean-to</hi> greenhouse.
                    The general form of the house is that of a vinery with pretty lofty front glass.
                    The main part of the area is occupied by a stage rising in steps to receive the
                    potted plants. At some height above the front flue is placed a narrow horizontal
                    bench of trellis work to receive small plants which require to be near the
                    light. The interior air is warmed by one or two flues, or other heating
                    apparatus, according to its volume; but a temperature of 45° Fahr, during winter
                    is sufficient. Sometimes greenhouses are constructed with span-roofs and a
                    double stage. They may indeed assume any form which taste can suggest, provided
                    there be a sufficiency of light, and the plants be not too far from the glass.
                    The <hi rend="italic">heath-house</hi> does not essentially differ from the
                    greenhouse, but for it a span roof is certainly preferable.</p>
                <p>In the <hi rend="italic">Conservatory</hi> the chief plants grow in beds of earth
                    sunk in the floor. Fig. .3, Plate CCXCIII. shews the principle of this species
                    of house. The beds marked <hi rend="italic">b</hi><hi rend="italic">b</hi> are
                    filled with a light soil calculated for the plants which are to inhabit them.
                    Fig. 4. represents the front elevation of the roof. Numerous varieties of this
                    structure also have appeared, and some most sumptuous examples have been erected
                    in the gardens of the nobility. With similar restrictions as in the greenhouse,
                    the conservatory may be said to be capable of assuming any form.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Plant Stove</hi> may be either a <hi rend="italic">dry
                    stove</hi> or a <hi rend="italic">bark stove,</hi> or both combined, and is
                    applied to the cultivation of tropical plants which require an elevated
                    temperature. The dry stove may be considered as a greenhouse with a larger than
                    usual apparatus for the production of heat. The bark stove is furnished somewhat
                    in the manner of a pine stove, with a receptacle to contain a bed of fermenting
                    tanners’ bark into which the pots are plunged. In this country, stoves are
                    regarded as belonging rather to the botanic than to the flower garden; they are
                    extremely useful, however, in the latter, for, besides presenting the florist
                    with many unusual forms of vegetation, they afford in summer a variety of
                    beautiful plants, which, when in flower, may be introduced into the
                    greenhouse.</p>
                <p>Sometimes the various botanical structures are combined into one imposing
                    assemblage, as that exhibited in Plate CCXCIII. Fig. 1, the ground-plan of which
                    is given in Fig. 2 of the same plate; <hi rend="italic">a</hi> being a
                    palm-house; <hi rend="italic">b</hi> for New Holland plants; <hi rend="italic"
                    >c</hi> large greenhouse; and the intermediate spaces being occupied by dry
                    stove, heath-house, and greenhouses. This mode is, of course, suited only for
                    places of the first order, where splendour is the object, where every thing is
                    on a great scale, and expense little regarded. In a vast proportion of cases
                    economy must be studied; and in villa gardens the ornamental plant-house is very
                    often attached to the library or the drawing-room. A good plan for such a glazed

                    class of plants have become so numerous, that, in a sketch like the present, it
                    is impossible to give the names of even a limited selection. We may once more
                    refer to Mr Loudon’s tables in his <hi rend="italic">Encyclopedia of
                    Horticulture,</hi> or to his still more copious lists in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Hortus Britannicus,</hi> in both of which works much valuable information may
                    be obtained. The recent increase of species makes the work of selection at once
                    more necessary and more difficult; a work which it must be confessed is often
                    negligently performed. Many of the finer sorts of woody plants are propagated
                    with difficulty, and consequently, being high priced in the nurseries, are
                    possessed in requisite abundance only where there is considerable liberality on
                    the part of the proprietor. On the other hand, the species which strike easily
                    are circulated by gardeners themselves, many of whom, by their own interest and
                    resources, more than half fill their greenhouses without calling for the aid of
                    their employers. To this cause may be ascribed the perpetuation of many mean
                    looking plants, which, if hardy, would scarcely be tolerated in well-kept
                    shrubberies, and certainly ought not to encumber the greenhouse.</p>
                <p>Light mould produced by the rotting of turf from pastures, and reduced with sand
                    if necessary, or enriched with leaf-mould, is well adapted for most greenhouse
                    plants. Some require a mixture of peat earth: others thrive only in pure sandy
                    peat. If more specific directions be wished, we would recommend the reader to
                    have recourse to <hi rend="italic">Cushing’s Exotic Gardener,</hi> or to the
                    more recent work by Sweet, entitled <hi rend="italic">The Botanical
                    Cultivator.</hi> The common means of propagation is by cuttings, inserted in
                    earth or sand, and covered, if necessary, with bell-glasses. A few sorts are
                    increased by grafting or layers. Nearly all may be raised from seed, large
                    quantities of which are annually imported from abroad; and, it may be added,
                    many greenhouse plants ripen their seed in this country.</p>
                <p>Many of these plants require shifting and fresh earth twice a year; all of them
                    should be repotted once a year at least. It is the common practice to examine
                    their roots in spring or the early part of summer, and, removing the matted
                    fibres, to put them into larger pots if necessary. As room is extremely valuable
                    in limited greenhouses, it is desirable that the plants should be kept of a
                    moderate size; and they are, therefore, rather to be under-potted than
                    otherwise. Many of the free-growing plants require to be shifted again in
                    August; at which period of the year, it is considered preferable to repot those
                    which require to be disturbed only once a year. During the summer months, a
                    great proportion of the inmates of the greenhouse are placed in the open air, on
                    a spot paved or laid with ashes, to prevent the entrance of earth-worms into the
                    pots, and not too much exposed to winds. Meanwhile, their place in the
                    greenhouse is occupied by balsams and other tender annuals of a showy character.
                    On the approach of winter the plants are again placed under cover. All that is
                    necessary in the management of the greenhouse in winter, is to keep up a steady
                    but very moderate temperature, to prcelude the access of damp by regular airing
                    in mild dry weather, and to attend to moderate watering where it may be
                    needed.</p>
                <p>Of late years, particular genera of plants have come greatly into vogue, and it
                    would be an omission not to notice some of them. Among the foremost may be
                    mentioned <hi rend="italic">Pelargonium,</hi> with its affinities. This
                    beautiful tribe has varied nearly as rapidly as the Dahlia; to the discomposure
                    of some botanists, whose scientific logic has been brought into jeopardy.
                    Pelargoniums are of easy culture, propagating readily by cuttings, and requiring
                    only to be shifted from time to time. Equal to these in point of beauty of
                    colour, and certainly superior in elegance of form, is the family of Cape
                    heaths, the <hi rend="italic">Ericae</hi> of botanists. Of this genus there is
                    said to be 600 species, considerably more than the half of which exist in our
                    collections. Many heaths <pb break="no" facs="nls:193648026"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0711-8026-0687"/>may be raised from seed, which occasionally ripens
                    in this country: the most common mode of propagation, however, is by cuttings,
                    and this in some species is attended with difficulty. Heaths require a peaty
                    soil, and attention in watering. For further information, we may refer to the
                    excellent little treatise of Mr M‘Nab of the Botanic Garden, Edinburgh, whose
                    success in this department is quite unrivalled, and in whose hands heaths attain
                    a splendour which, we believe, they never reach in the environs of Table
                    Mountain itself. The superb genus <hi rend="italic">Camellia</hi> is the only
                    other that particularly claims our attention. To the elegance of the finest
                    evergreen it unites the beauty of the fairest rose. The Camellia, though a
                    native of Japan, is not particularly tender, but from some peculiarities in its
                    constitution, its culture requires a considerable degree of attention and care.
                    Cuttings of the single red variety strike freely, and upon these as stocks, the
                    finer sorts are grafted by marching or side-grafting; The soil generally
                    employed is a mixture of peat and light loam. Care must be taken not to allow
                    the roots to become matted in the pots. The young plants should be shifted at
                    least once a year; when old, and in large tubs, once in two years will be
                    sufficient. It is found beneficial to apply a certain degree of heat while the
                    plants are growing, and till they form flower-buds for the following season. To
                    have Camellias in perfection, a house with a span roof should be appropriated
                    for their reception. There are some splendid collections of this noble plant in
                    the nursery-gardens in the neighbourhood of London, particularly at Hackney,
                    Vauxhall, and Clapton.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Conservatory Plants.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> These are
                    composed of a selection from the numerous inmates of the greenhouse. They should
                    be naturally of an elegant form, capable in general of sustaining themselves,
                    and somewhat hardy in their constitution. Many of the Australian plants,
                    particularly the Acacias and Banksias, are well adapted for this purpose. The
                    ascending Proteas of the Cape, Clcthra arborea of Madeira, and many others of a
                    similar habit, may likewise take their place in this department. To these may be
                    added a few of the hardier Heaths and Camellias, together with a Myrtle or two,
                    double flowering Pomegranate, Camphor-laurel, Tea-tree, and some of the
                    varieties of the magnificent and consecrated Rhododendron arboreum. Any wall in
                    the interior of the house may be furnished with a trellis, and covered with such
                    climbing plants as Lonicera Japonica, Cobbea scandens, Maurandia semperflorens
                    and Barclayana, and the trailing Pelargoniums. In the management of the
                    conservatory, abundant air should be admitted, and care should be taken not to
                    <hi rend="italic">draw</hi> the plants; that is, not to cause them to become too
                    tall and spindle-formed by over-crowding. They should be so pruned as to keep
                    them comparatively short and bushy; but after all pains have been taken, the
                    sorrowful time at length arrives, when they either disfigure themselves by
                    pressing against the glass, or must submit to the no less distorting process of
                    a violent amputation, To meet such exigencies, it is recommended that, wherever
                    there is also a greenhouse, a few plants should be kept in training for the
                    conservatory, and substituted in the room of any that become unmanageable. After
                    all, the fourth, fifth, and sixth, summers of the conservatory will always be
                    the finest: and when a longer series of years have gone by, and the plants have
                    outgrown the space allotted to them, perhaps the best thing that can be done is
                    to change the whole interior of the house, plants, earth and all. If this
                    operation be anticipated, and for a year or two prepared for, sufficiently large
                    plants may be had in readiness, and the appearance of a well-furnished house be
                    attained in one or two seasons. It is scarcely needful to add, that the neatness
                    which is so desirable everywhere in the flower-garden is absolutely
                    indispensable in the conservatory.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Stove Plants.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> There are many
                    beautiful plants, natives of tropical regions, which are cultivated in our
                    stoves, but which, from the elevated temperature they require, can be only
                    occasionally visited with pleasure. This may account for the fact that stoves
                    are seldom found but in first-rate gardens, even where the price of fuel is
                    inconsiderable. It is unnecessary to be minute respecting <hi rend="italic">dry
                    stove</hi> plants: their culture is precisely that of greenhouse plants,
                    differing only in the degree of heat. Many dry stove plants are succulent, such
                    as Cactus, Aloe and Mesembryanthemum, and of course require an arid soil,
                    composed of a little light loam mixed with lime-rubbish or shivers. One of the
                    most successful growers of the cacti was the late Mr Walter Henderson at
                    Woodhall. The compost which he employed consisted of 1 part rotted dung, 1
                    rotted leaves, 1 heath mould, 1 ļ loam, and 1 coarse sand, all well mixed
                    together; and the pot was nearly one-third filled with shreds, so as to form an
                    effectual drain. Some of the species, such as Cactus speciosus and Cereus
                    flagelliformis, arc improved, and made to flower more freely, by being kept
                    growing vigorously in the greenhouse during summer. The <hi rend="italic">bark
                    stove</hi> plants thrive best in the tepid vapour peculiar to the equatorial
                    climes. In order to furnish bottom heat, a bark pit is prepared, into which the
                    pots or tubs are sunk; and the atmosphere is heated by flues, by steam, or, what
                    is better, by a circulation of hot-water. Along the front glass, and on the back
                    wall, are shelves on which pots may be arranged, according to the necessities of
                    light and shade. On the front shelves are occasionally placed shallow troughs,
                    filled with old tan, leaves, or decayed wood, for the reception of the
                    air-plants and other epiphytes. Small cisterns too are introduced to contain
                    tender aquatics. Along the rafters some of the more elegant species of
                    Passiflora, such as P. quadrangularis, may be trained; and through the branches
                    of some of the woody plants, Cuscuta, Tropaeolum, and other tender climbers, may
                    be allowed to twine themselves. In the pit may be plunged some of the Palms,
                    those princes of plants. In short, there is no end of those numerous tribes,
                    “the potent sons of moisture and of heat,” with which the teeming regions of the
                    equator are filled; and no suite of stoves in this country, however extensive,
                    can come up to the wishes of the botanist. The management of this department of
                    floriculture is laborious and trying to the constitution. A strong heat, both in
                    the bark bed and in the atmosphere, must be maintained; the air must be kept
                    charged with vapour, and the plants require frequent shifting and repotting. For
                    more detailed information as to the management of particular stove plants, we
                    may again refer to Cushing, who, in his <hi rend="italic">Exotic Gardener,</hi>
                    has treated this subject with a skill and fulness that have not been surpassed,

                    the consistence of paint, and laying it on with a brush. One advice we would

                    suspected of attacking blossom or fruit, when they are only picking off

                    important; and much benefit results from occasionally filling them with the
