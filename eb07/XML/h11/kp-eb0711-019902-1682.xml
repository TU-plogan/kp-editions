                    significant corrections to the OCR text, predominantly in cases of confusing "c"
                    and "e." Isolates 90 entries that were mistakenly included at the end of prior
                    entries in v1 and v2. Normalizes ordinal numbers. Separates metadata in
                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra
                    space around the <gi>pb</gi> tag. Where a word is hyphenated at a <gi>pb</gi>,

                <p><hi rend="italic smallcaps"> Hebrew</hi><hi rend="italic">Character.</hi> There
                    are two kinds of Hebrew characters; the ancient, called also the <hi
                    rend="italic">square</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and the modern, or rabbinical
                    character.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Square Hebrew</hi> takes its denomination from the figure
                    of its characters, which stand more square, and <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193641695" xml:id="kp-eb0711-1695-0200"/>have their angles more exact
                    and precise, than the other. This character is used in the text of Scripture,
                    and in other principal and important writings. When both this and the rabbinical
                    character are employed in the same work, the former is used for the text, and
                    the latter for the accessory part, as the gloss, notes, commentaries, and so
                    forth.</p>
                <p>The best and most beautiful characters of this kind are those copied from the
                    characters used in the Spanish manuscripts; next, those from the Italian
                    manuscripts; then those from the French; and, lastly, those of the Germans,
                    whose characters are much the same, with respect to the other genuine square
                    Hebrew characters, as the Gothic or Dutch characters are with respect to the
                    Roman.</p>
                <p>Several authors contend, that the square character is not the real ancient Hebrew
                    character, written from the beginning of the language till the time of the
                    Babylonish captivity; but that it is the Assyrian or Chaldaic character, which
                    the Jews having become accustomed to during the captivity, afterwards retained.
                    They allege, that the Jews, during their captivity, had quite disused their
                    ancient character; so that Ezra found it necessary to have the sacred books
                    transcribed into the Chaldaic square character. These authors also contend, that
                    what we call the Samaritan character is in reality the genuine ancient Hebrew.
                    Of this opinion are Scaliger, Bochart, Casaubon, Vossius, Grotius, Walton,
                    Capellus, and, amongst the ancients, Jerome and Eusebius. It is urged, that the
                    present characters are called Assyrian by the ancient Jewish writers of the
                    Talmud, and therefore must have been brought from Assyria. But to this argument
                    it is replied, that there were two sorts <hi rend="italic">of</hi> characters
                    anciently in use, viz. the sacred or present square character, and the profane
                    or civil, which we call Samaritan; and that the sacred is called Assyrian,
                    because it first began in Assyria to come into common use. It is further
                    alleged, that the Chaldaic letters, which the Jews now use, were unknown to the
                    ancient Jews before the captivity (Dan. i. 4). Moreover, it is inferred from a
                    passage in Second Kings (xvii. 28), where we learn that a Jewish priest was sent
                    to teach the Samaritans the worship of Jehovah, that on this occasion he must
                    have taught them the law; and yet no mention occurs of his teaching them the
                    language or character in which the law was then written, namely, the character
                    which the Samaritans used. But the chief argument is derived from some ancient
                    Jewish shekels, having a legend on one side, “The shekel of Israel,” and on the
                    other, “Jerusalem the holy,” both in Samaritan characters. These shekels, it is
                    said, must have been coined before the division of the two kingdoms of Judah and
                    Israel, or at least before the Assyrian captivity, because the Samaritans never
                    afterwards reckoned Jerusalem holy. On the other side, namely, in favour of the
                    primitive antiquity of the square character, are the two Buxtorfs, Leusden,
                    Calovius, Hottinger, Spanheim, Lightfoot, and others, who urge (from Matthew, V.
                    18) that ,∕o&lt;Z is really the least of the consonants in the present Hebrew,
                    whereas it is one of the largest characters in the Samaritan alphabet; but
                    Walton replies, that if our Saviour here speaks of the least letter of the
                    alphabet, we can only infer that the Chaldaic character was used, in our
                    Saviour’s time, which is not denied by those who maintain the Samaritan to be
                    the original. They also allege that the Jews were too obstinate and
                    superstitious to allow their sacred character to be altered; but if this was
                    effected under the direction and authority of Ezra, the argument will be much
                    invalidated. Further, they maintain that Ezra could not alter the ancient
                    character, because it was impossible to make the alterations in all their
                    copies. This argument, however, is contradicted by fact, since the old English
                    black letter is actually changed for the Roman. They likewise allege that Ezra
                    was not disposed to profane the sacred writings with a heathen character; but
                    this supposes that Ezra was so superstitious as to imagine that there was some
                    peculiar sanctity in the shape of the letters. Moreover, the advocates of this
                    opinion appeal to ancient coins found in Judaea, with a legend in the Chaldaic
                    orAs-syrian character. But the genuineness of these coins is much disputed. The
                    learned Souciet maintains that the ancient Hebrew character is that found on the
                    medals of Simon, and others, commonly called Samaritan medals, but which, he
                    affirms, were really Hebrew medals, struck by the Jews, and not by the
                    Samaritans.</p>
                <p>Buxtorf endeavours to reconcile these two opinions by producing a variety of
                    passages from the Rabbin to prove that both these characters were anciently
                    used; the present square character being that in which the tables of the law,
                    and the copy deposited in the ark, were written, and the other character being
                    used in the copies of the law which were written for private and common use, and
                    in civil affairs in general; and that after the captivity, Ezra ordered the
                    former to be used by the Jews on all occasions, leaving the latter to the
                    Samaritans and apostates. But it can scarcely be allowed by any who consider the
                    difference between the Chaldaic and Samaritan characters, with respect to
                    convenience and beauty, that they were ever used at the same time. After all, it
                    is of no great moment which of these, or whether either of them, formed the
                    original characters; since it appears that no change of the words has arisen
                    from the manner of writing them, because the Samaritan and Jewish Pentateuch
                    almost invariably agree. It is most probable that the form of these characters
                    has varied at different periods. This appears from the testimony of Montfaucon
                    <hi rend="italic">{Hexapla Origenis,</hi> vol. i. p. 22), and is implied in Dr
                    Kennicot’s making the characters in which manuscripts are written one test of
                    their age.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Modern,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Rabbinical,</hi> is a
                    good, neat character, formed of the square Hebrew, by rounding it, and
                    retrenching most of the angles or corners of the letters, to render it more easy
                    and flowing. The letters used by the Germans are very different from the
                    rabbinical character employed everywhere else, though all formed alike from the
                    square character, but in a more slovenly manner than the rest. The Rabbin
                    frequently make use either of their own, or the square Hebrew character, to
                    write the modern languages in. There are even books in the vulgar tongues
                    printed in Hebrew characters, instances of which are seen in the king’s library
                    at Paris.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic smallcaps"> Hebrew</hi><hi rend="italic">Language,</hi> that
                    spoken by the Hebrews, and in which the books of the Old Testament are
                    written.</p>
                <p>The books of the Old Testament are the only compositions to be found, in all
                    antiquity, written in pure Hebrew; and the language of many of them is extremely
                    sublime. It appears; perfectly regular, particularly in its conjugations;
                    indeed, properly speaking, it has but one conjugation, but this is varied in
                    each seven or eight different ways, which has the effect of so many different
                    conjugations, and affords a great variety of expressions to represent by a
                    single word the different modifications of a verb, and many ideas which in the
                    modern and in many of the ancient and learned languages cannot be expressed
                    without a periphrasis.</p>
                <p>The primitive words, which are called <hi rend="italic">roots,</hi> have seldom
                    more than three letters or two syllables.</p>
                <p>In this language there are twenty-two letters, only five of which are usually
                    reckoned vowels; but then each vowel is divided into two, a long and a short;
                    the sound of the former being somewhat grave and long, and that of the latter
                    short and acute. It must however be remarked, that the two last vowels have
                    sounds which differ in other respects besides quantity and a greater or less
                    elevation. To these ten or twelve vowels may be added others, called <hi
                    rend="italic">semi-vowels,</hi> which serve to connect the consonants, and to
                    render easier the transitions from one to another. The <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193641708" xml:id="kp-eb0711-1708-0201"/>number of accents in this
                    language is prodigious. Of these ' there are nearly forty, the use of some of
                    which, notwithstanding all the inquiries of the learned, is not yet perfectly
                    known. We know, in general, that they serve to distinguish the sentences, like
                    the points called commas, semicoons, and colons in our language; to determine
                    the quantity of the syllables; and to mark the tone with which they are to be
                    spoken or sung. It is no wonder, then, that there are more accents in the Hebrew
                    than in other languages, since they perform three offices, which in other
                    languages are called by different names.</p>
                <p>As we have no Hebrew but that which is contained in the Scripture, the language
                    wants a great many words; not only because in those primitive times languages
                    were not so copious as at present, but also on this account, that the inspired
                    writers had no occasion to mention many of the terms which might be in use in
                    the language.</p>
                <p>The Chaldaic, Syriac, and Ethiopic languages, are by some held to be dialects of
                    the Hebrew; as the French, Italian, and Spanish, are dialects of the Latin. It
                    has been supposed by many learned men, that the Hebrew characters or letters
                    were often used hieroglyphically, and that each had its several distinct sense
                    understood as a hieroglyphic. Neumann, who seems to have taken infinite pains to
                    find out the secret meaning of these letters, gives the following explication;
                    x, <hi rend="italic">aleph,</hi> he says, is a character denoting motion,
                    readiness, and activity; ă, <hi rend="italic">beth,</hi> signifies matter, body,
                    substance, thing, also place, space, or capacity, and lastly, in, within, or
                    contained; 2, <hi rend="italic">ghimel,</hi> stands for flexion, bending, or
                    obliquity of any kind; 1, <hi rend="italic">dhaleth,</hi> signifies any
                    protrusion made from without, or any promotion of any kind; rτ, <hi
                    rend="italic">he,</hi> stands for the presence or demonstrative essence of
                    anything; ι, <hi rend="italic">vau,</hi> stands for copulation, or the growing
                    together of things; τ, <hi rend="italic">tsain,</hi> expresses vehement
                    protrusion and violent compression, such as is occasioned by at once violently
                    discharging and constringing a thing, and sometimes the straitening of any
                    figure into a narrow point at the end; π, <hi rend="italic">cheth,</hi>
                    expresses association, society, or any kind of composition or combination of
                    things; ta, <hi rend="italic">teth,</hi> stands for the withdrawing, drawing
                    back, or recession of any thing; <hi rend="italic">',jod,</hi> signifies
                    extension and length, whether in matter or in time; 2, <hi rend="italic"
                    >caph,</hi> expresses a turning, incurvation, or concavity , ⅛, <hi
                    rend="italic">lamech,</hi> stands for an addition, accession, impulse, or
                    adversation, and sometimes for pressure; a, <hi rend="italic">mem,</hi>
                    expresses amplitude, or the amplifying any thing in whatever sense, and in
                    regard to contiguous qualities it also signifies the adding length, breadth, and
                    circumference, lastly, multitude; 3, <hi rend="italic">nun,</hi> signifies the
                    propagation of one thing from another, or of the same thing from one person to
                    another; 0, <hi rend="italic">samech,</hi> expresses cincture and coarctation;
                    V, <hi rend="italic">ain,</hi> stands for observation, objection, or obviation;
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">ð,</hi><hi rend="italic">pe</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >phe,</hi> stands for a crookedness or an angle of any figure; -, <hi
                    rend="italic">tsadde,</hi> expresses contiguity and close succession; ρ, <hi
                    rend="italic">hoph,</hi> expresses a circuit or ambit; ι, <hi rend="italic"
                    >resh,</hi> expresses the egress of any thing, as also the exterior part of a
                    thing, and the extremity or end of any thing; <hi rend="italic">υ, schin</hi> or
                    <hi rend="italic">sin,</hi> signifies the number three, or the third degree, or
                    the utmost perfection of any thing; and n, <hi rend="italic">tau,</hi> expresses
                    a sequel, continuation, or succession of any thing.</p>
                <p>As, according to this explication, the several letters of the Hebrew alphabet
                    separately convey ideas of motion, matter, space, and several modifications of
                    matter, space, and motion; it follows that a language, the words of which are
                    composed of such expressive characters, must necessarily be of all languages the
                    most perfect and expressive; as the words formed of such letters, according to
                    their determinate separate significations, must convey the idea of all the
                    matters contained in the sense of the several characters, and be at once a name
                    and a definition, or succinct description, of the subject; and all things
                    material as well as spiritual, all objects in the natural and moral world, must
                    be known as soon as their names are known, and their separate letters
                    considered.</p>
                <p>The words <hi rend="italic">urirn</hi> and <hi rend="italic">thummim</hi> are
                    thus easily explained, and found to be perhaps the most apposite and expressive
                    words that ever were formed.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Rabbinical</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Modern</hi><hi
                    rend="italic smallcaps"> Hebrew,</hi> is the language used by the Rabbin in the
                    writings they have composed. Its basis or body is the Hebrew and Chaldaic, with
                    various alterations in the words of these two languages, the meanings of which
                    they have considerably enlarged and extended. They have borrowed freely from the
                    Arabic; and the rest is composed of words and expressions, chiefly from the
                    Greek, some from the Latin, and others from the modern tongues, particularly
                    that spoken in the place where each Rabbi lived or wrote.</p>
