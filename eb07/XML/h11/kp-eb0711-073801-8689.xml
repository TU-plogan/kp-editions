                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Nature</hi> has prepared many advantages and pleasures for
                    the use of mankind, and given them the taste to enjoy them, and the sagacity to
                    improve them; but of all the out-of-door amusements that have occupied the
                    modern world, at least the male part of it, nothing has better stood the test of
                    time than the noble diversion of hunting.</p>
                <p>“Of all our fond diversions, A hunter’s is the best;</p>
                <p>In spite of wars, and petty jars, That sport has stood the test.”</p>
                <p>And why has it stood the test? Not merely because the passion for the chase is
                    interwoven closely with our nature; not because it originated in necessity,
                    therefore originated in nature; but because it has been encouraged and approved
                    of by the very best authorities, and practised by the greatest men. It cannot
                    now, then, be supposed to dread criticism, or require support; neither can any
                    solid objections be raised against a reasonable enjoyment of the sports of the
                    field in general, provided what ought to be the pleasing relaxation of a man’s
                    leisure hours be not converted into the whole business of his life. But hunting,
                    above all others, is a taste characteristically manly and appropriate to the
                    gentlemen of Great Britain; and it has likewise another advantage over all other
                    sports of the field, which adds much to its value in this land of liberty, and
                    especially in the present age: it is a kind of Saturnalian amusement, in which
                    the privileges of rank and fortune are laid aside, the best man in the chase
                    being he who rides the best horse, and who is best skilled in the use he should
                    make of his superiority.</p>
                <p>But let us look a little into the origin of hunting, the encomiums passed upon
                    it, and the advantages derived from it.</p>
                <p>We shall commence with the sacred history itself, which describes the first
                    warriors under the denomination of hunters; and not only did the passion for the
                    chase form a kind of society between the dog, the horse, the falcon, and man,
                    but Pliny is quite correct in saying that hunting was not only one of the first
                    exercises of man, but that it gave rise to monarchical states. For example,
                    Nimrod, <hi rend="italic">the first king,</hi> who reigned at Babylon, devoted
                    himself to hunting, and delivered his subjects from the savage beasts that
                    desolated the country; and in the sequel, by making soldiers of his companions
                    in the chase, employed them in extending his empire, and establishing his
                    conquests. In fact, nothing in those days procured a man so much esteem as being
                    an expert sportsman or hunter; and had not Nimrod been a sportsman, he would not
                    have been a king. People submit themselves to government by force, as wild
                    animals do, and not by choice; and he erected himself into a monarch by finding
                    himself stronger than his neighbours. He taught the people to make up companies
                    for <hi rend="italic">the</hi><hi rend="italic">diese;</hi> and, after
                    exercising them for this purpose in the first instance, he led them on by
                    degrees to a social defence of one another, and thus laid the foundation of his
                    authority and his kingdom. It is no wonder, then, that so many of the first
                    kings or heroes of whom antiquity makes mention should be characterised as
                    celebrated hunters, and destroyers of noxious animals; an employment prescribed
                    in the Book of Moses, and deified in the theology of the Pagans. Bacchus is
                    drawn by tigers, because he subdued them; Apollo obtained the laurels that
                    encircle his brow, by killing the serpent Python; and Hercules got his lion’s
                    skin by his exploits in the forest of Nemaea. Diana was worshipped in her
                    temple, the finest the world ever saw, in honour of her skill in destroying
                    noxious animals; even Venus herself took the field, and Adonis was killed in the
                    chase. The Egyptians, also, in their most splendid ages, were much addicted to
                    hunting; and it was the common exercise of the children educated in the court of
                    Sesostris.</p>
                <p>But there would be no end to these examples of the acknowledged benefits of the
                    chase, on the manners and characters of nations. The ancient Persians considered
                    hunting not only as a serious employment, but an excellent preparation for war,
                    in which the same weapons were used as in the chase; and their renowned monarch,
                    Cyrus, was the first sportsman of his day. With the Athenians the passion for
                    the sports of the field was so strong, that Solon was obliged to restrain the
                    ardour for hunting, to prevent the people neglecting the mechanic arts, which it
                    was his wish they should cultivate; and the Lacedemonians, who were warriors by
                    profession, cultivated hunting with incessant care. It was not only their ruling
                    passion, but there is reason to believe they exercised in it the greatest skill;
                    and, as we learn from Virgil, in his third Géorgie, they were celebrated for
                    their breed of speedy dogs. But there is not a nation in wnich it has not been
                    found necessary to restrain by laws the excessive love for the chase; so natural
                    is it to man, and so apt to degenerate into a passion injurious both to health
                    and to society.</p>
                <p>One of the greatest compliments paid to the chase is, its having been considered
                    as a theme worthy the pens of the ablest writers of the most refined periods of
                    the world. Whilst Greece was the nursery and residence of every branch of polite
                    literature, and of all the arts and sciences then known to mankind; whilst every
                    study that depends on the powers of the imagination, or the faculties of the
                    understanding, was there carried to the very summit of perfection; we find
                    Xenophon composing his Kυvsj-ysr/xôř, treating of every description of
                    field-sports. He, according with the custom of the times, opens the subject with
                    fable, and tells us that hunting, which he calls the gift of the gods, and the
                    use of dogs, originated with Apollo and Diana, and that the invention was made a
                    present of to Chiron, who took pupils in the art, each of whom was, in his turn,
                    honoured by the gods (αs ’ β <hi rend="italic">6sωv iτ</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >∣</hi><hi rend="italic">μr</hi><hi rend="italic                     subscript">
                    i</hi><hi rend="italic">(hf).</hi> His real object, however, was to encourage in
                    the youth of his country a taste for the pleasures of the chase, and other manly
                    pastimes, as the best preparation for war, the∙senate, and the world. Whilst he
                    condemns the effeminate man as shamefully useless to his country, he represents
                    the well-trained sportsman as not only mighty in war, but ready to sacrifice his
                    person and his wealth to the public good. As a preparation for war, and
                    particularly the higher branches of the soldier’s profession, we need not the
                    testimony of Xenophon; for our own experience has shown us, that, speaking
                    generally, no man takes a view of a country, at first sight, with equal facility
                    to a sportsman, particularly a sportsman who has been accustomed to follow
                    hounds. Indeed, unless he have what is called in the field, <hi rend="italic"
                    >“</hi><hi rend="italic">a</hi> good eye to a country,” he cannot ride with
                    judgment after hounds in our enclosed or woodland districts; and when the chase
                    is concluded, it is surprising to witness the rapidity with which an experienced
                    fox-hunter sees the points of a country in which he is a stranger, that must
                    lead him towards his wished-for borne. With respect to the other advantages
                    alluded to by Xenophon, he had very good authority for what he asserted of them.
                    The <pb break="no" facs="nls:193648702" xml:id="kp-eb0711-8702-0739"/>Olympic
                    games were established by the Greeks for two distinct purposes: first, to
                    inspire their youth with a love of glory, as well as a taste for manly and
                    invigorating exercises, conducive to contempt of danger, and coolness when
                    exposed to it; and, secondly, with a view of drawing together the leading men of
                    the different states of Greece, which gave them an opportunity of deliberating
                    upon matters of general concern. As regarded the other various occupations of
                    life which a gentleman is called upon to fulfil and do honour to, we may remark,
                    that an irreproachable moral character was a necessary qualification for a
                    competitor at those games or sports. Drawing something like a parallel here,
                    then, we may add, that neither is a sportsman in our own country esteemed, how
                    skilful soever he may be, if his character be tainted with fraud; and we are not
                    unmindful of the advantages derived from the mixture of society in the
                    hunting-field, or of the many valuable and lasting friendships that may be dated
                    from accidental meetings by the cover’s side. But Xenophon wrote in praise of
                    hunting rather perhaps as a soldier than a philosopher, giving it as his
                    opinion, that the exercise of the chase formed the best soldiers in the world;
                    that it habituated men to cold, heat, and fatigue; that it kindled courage,
                    elevated the soul, and invigorated the body; that it retarded the effects of
                    age, and rendered the senses more acute; and, finally, that the pleasure it
                    afforded was a sovereign remedy against all mental uneasiness; in which latter
                    sentiment he is seconded by a modern author of celebrity, who says that “the
                    chase fortifies the heart as well as the body.” Nor is Xenophon the only eminent
                    soldier or philosopher of his renowned country who has written in commendation
                    of hunting. Aristotle wrote a treatise on field-sports, by order of Alexander
                    the Great; and Polybius, one of the greatest soldiers of any age, relates that
                    Maximus restored discipline in the Roman legions, by often exercising them in
                    hunting; and he even goes so far as to celebrate one individual sportsman,
                    Ptolemy Epiphanes, for his dexterity in killing a wild bull. Amongst the poets
                    of Greece, Oppian distinguished himself highly by his poems on hunting. So
                    excellent, indeed, were they considered by his emperor, that he is said to have
                    presented him with a piece of gold for every verse they contained, and thus they
                    acquired the honourable appellation of “the golden verses of Oppian.” Several of
                    the most splendid similes of Homer are taken from hounds in chase, and it is in
                    the manly character of Achilles that we chiefly recognise him as his hero.</p>
                <p>The Romans at one time discouraged hunting amongst the upper orders <hi
                    rend="italic">of</hi> society, from the fear of its becoming a passion which
                    might divert them from their essential duties. But here they committed an error;
                    for, aware or its beneficial effects in forming their people for war, they
                    substituted public exhibitions of animals destroying each other in an
                    amphitheatre, which could only have hardened the heart, without advantage to
                    either body or mind. Yet we find many of their emperors encouraging hunting, and
                    many of their best writers extolling it. The learned and polished Hadrian was so
                    passionately addicted to hunting, and also to horses and dogs, that he erected
                    monu-ínents to the memory of the latter, and built a city on the spot on which
                    he had killed a wild boar, after a desperate encounter with him, and which he
                    called by a word which, being interpreted, signifies Hadrian’s chase. Amongst
                    the celebrated writers of the Augustan age, we may mention two, who, not being
                    themselves sportsmen, could only have, made sporting a subject for their pens,
                    from a sense of the benefits arising from it. Virgil makes his young Ascanius a
                    sportsman as soon as he is able to sit his horse; and he also makes him, at a
                    very early age, the first in the fight <hi rend="italic">(primum bello),</hi> as
                    he had been the first in the field. In the speech addressed to him by the bold
                    Numanus, which cost that hero his life, we have the finest contrast of the evils
                    of effeminate habits with the benefits of manly pursuits, that the pen of a
                    satirist could produce. The words, <hi rend="italic">0 verae</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Phrygiae, neque enim Phryges</hi><hi rend="italic">∕</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">“</hi> Oh, worse than women in the shape of men,” convey the
                    severest rebuke a nation could receive for having made themselves contemptible
                    to their enemies, by the effects of an effeminate life, and pursuits unworthy of
                    men; whereas the advantages of the manly exercises of youth are finely set forth
                    in the vaunting exclamation of this hardy Rutulian. Neither is Horace behind his
                    contemporary poet in his disgust of an effeminate youth. In the twenty-fourth
                    ode of his third book, he beautifully contrasts those softening pleasures which
                    emasculate the mind and enervate the body, with the opposite effects of manly
                    sports and exercises; and, in his justly celebrated Epistle to Lollius, he
                    recommends the chase, not only as a noble exercise, but as contributing to
                    health and peace of mind. His <hi rend="italic">Carmen Soeculare was</hi> also
                    written in honour of manly exercises; and in another of his odes we find him
                    upbraiding a young Roman for giving up the manly exercise of riding; and
                    glancing at the destruction of Troy, and the feminine education of Achilles,
                    seeming to insinuate, that effeminacy was likely to destroy the energies of his
                    own countrymen, as it had those of others. That his apprehensions were not
                    unfounded, a few centuries proved; for the Romans, after the conquest of Persia
                    and other distant kingdoms, participating in their luxurious habits, became as
                    easy a prey to the Goths and Vandals, as the Grecians and other nations had
                    before been to themselves; and, in the decline of the republic, the few
                    victories which they gained were achieved but by the terror of their name. Minor
                    poets have also made sporting their theme. Gratius wrote a poem on coursing. He
                    was contemporary with Ovid, and a sportsman, as the knowledge of his subject
                    denotes. Nemesianus also, three centuries afterwards, wrote some poems on
                    hunting, though they have not been so highly esteemed. But the sports of the
                    field are alluded to by innumerable classic writers, and made the groundwork of
                    their most beautiful allegories and fables, both in verse and prose; and
                    perhaps, after all, the greatest compliment that can be paid to them, as well as
                    the best answer to the assertion that any man can make a sportsman, is to be
                    found in the latter department of literature. We allude to the letters of that
                    accomplished country gentleman and scholar, Pliny the consul, in which he speaks
                    of his prowess in the chase. In one addressed to Tacitus the historian, boasting
                    of a famous day’s sport he had been enjoying, he also boasts of the good effect
                    it had had on his mind, telling him that Minerva accompanied Diana on the hills;
                    and in the eighteenth letter of the fifth book he goes a point beyond this: “As
                    for myself,” says he to his friend Macer, “I am employed at my Tuscan villa in
                    hunting and studying, sometimes alternately, and sometimes both together; <hi
                    rend="italic">but I am not yet able to determine in which of those pursuits it
                    is most difficult to succeed.”</hi></p>
                <p>It is not surprising that hunting should have been the theme of poets, as poetry
                    then ceases to be the language of fiction; neither can the subject itself be
                    deemed unpoetical, as it affords an opportunity to expatiate, not merely on the
                    beauties, but also on the endowments of nature. That the feelings of nature have
                    more of rapture in them than those which are excited through the medium of
                    science, is a fact which cannot, we think, be denied; and thus do we account for
                    the exhilarating passion of the chase. To describe a chase, however, is a task
                    of no small difficulty, and perhaps more so in prose than in verse, as the
                    imagination must be powerfully excited by the transporting scenes on which it
                    has dwelt, and cannot well be restrained in a mere recital of facts. When the
                    noise of the battle is over, powerful must be the pen that could revive <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193648715" xml:id="kp-eb0711-8715-0740"/> the clang of
                    arms, “The chase is done,” sings Ossian; “and nothing is heard on Ardven but the
                    torrent’s roar.”</p>
                <p>Somerville’s poem of <hi rend="italic">The Chase</hi> will live to the end of
                    time; for although it was not faultless in the eyes of the perhaps too rigid
                    Johnson, it is written with the spirit and fire his subject demanded; and many
                    of the instructions it conveys, when stripped of their poetical dress, are
                    esteemed by sportsmen of the present day. “Manners,” says Lord Kames, “are never
                    painted <hi rend="italic">to the life</hi> by any one to whom they are not
                    familiar neither could a man have written the poem we speak of unless he had
                    been himself a sportsman. Indeed his descriptions of hunting the hare, the stag,
                    and the fox, place the objects clearly and beautifully before our eyes, and show
                    that the poet had often witnessed with rapture the scenes to which he devoted
                    his muse. The following passage, descriptive of the feelings of a master of
                    hounds on a hunting morning, is not merely truly natural, but at the same time
                    highly poetical:</p>
                <p>“Hail, gentle dawn! mild, blushing goddess, hail;</p>
                <p>Rejoic’d I see thy purple mantle spread</p>
                <p>O’er half the skies; gems pave thy radiant way, And orient pearls from every
                    shrub depend.</p>
                <p>Farewell, Cleora! here, deep sunk in down, Slumber secure, with happy dreams
                    amused. Me other joys invite;</p>
                <p>The horn sonorous calls, the pack awak’d</p>
                <p>Their matins chaunt, nor brook my long delay:</p>
                <p>Aly courser hears their voice ;—See there! with ears And tail erect, neighing, he
                    paws the ground:</p>
                <p>Fierce rapture kindles in his redd’ning eyes, And boils in ev’ry vein.”</p>
                <p>Although hunting <hi rend="italic">songs</hi> are a species of ancient lyrics, of
                    which the specimens are rare, and in our own country “the songs of the chase” do
                    not appear to include any earlier than the middle of the seventeenth century, we
                    have some of a more modern date that have been highly popular with the public,
                    and no doubt have given the original impulse to many a good sportsman. The power
                    and force of national songs have never been disputed in any age; and he who
                    said, that if he were allowed to compose the ballads of a nation, he would soon
                    alter its form of government, uttered a boast not altogether unfounded in the
                    principles of human nature. Compositions of this kind, then, that tend to
                    encourage a love of manly pursuits and pastimes, and give a relish to a country
                    life, should by no means be thought lightly of by a people who, like ourselves,
                    have ever been conspicuous for our excellence in the one, and our fondness for
                    the other; but which, in the opinion of some, appear to be on the wane, as the
                    natural consequence of our present state of almost excessive refinement. This
                    would be a real cause for regret. The fondness for rural life amongst the higher
                    order of the English has hitherto had a great and salutary effect upon the
                    natural character of their country; and there cannot be found a finer race of
                    men than the country gentlemen of Great Britain. Instead of the softness and
                    effeminacy which characterise the men of rank of most other nations, they
                    exhibit a union of <hi rend="italic">natural</hi> elegance and strength, a
                    robustness of frame and freshness of complexion, which are to be attributed to
                    their living so much in the open air, and pursuing so eagerly the invigorating
                    recreations of a country life. Their hard exercise produces a healthy tone of
                    mind and spirits, as well as of body, accompanied with a manliness and
                    simplicity of manners, which even the follies of a town cannot easily pervert,
                    and can never entirely destroy. Let us, however, hope that the fears on this
                    head are groundless; let us hope that what Horace sighed for, what Cato, Plato,
                    and Cicero recommended, what Bion eulogised, what all the best poets of
                    antiquity sang the praises of (according to the poets, the golden age was spent
                    in the country), and for which kings and emperors quitted their thrones, will
                    never be ill suited to, or considered as beneath the taste of a British country
                    gentleman, iň what circle soever he may move. That the sports of the field are
                    classical, the authority of all ages will vouch for; neither is the man of
                    fashion, or <hi rend="italic">haut</hi><hi rend="italic">ton,</hi> by any means
                    incompatible with the country gentleman and sportsman. On the contrary, how has
                    the character of Paris been handed down to us by the poets? Was he not the
                    finest gentleman, the greatest favourite of the female sex, the greatest beau of
                    his day? Such he is represented to have been; but although a prince, he had been
                    bred a shepherd; and from the robust habits he had acquired in his youth, he was
                    the only man who could stand up against the powerful arm of Dares, the great
                    champion of his day. What was the all-accomplished Pliny, or Lollius whose
                    education Horace had superintended?</p>
                <p>Again; on the score of health, the chief felicity of man, were it not for the
                    sports of the field, the softness and effeminacy of modern manners, in the
                    higher walks of life, would soon exhibit their pernicious effects on forthcoming
                    generations, by depriving them of their natural defence against diseases
                    incident to our climate, by subjecting them to that morbid debility and
                    sensibility of the nervous system which lays the foundation of most diseases, as
                    also depriving them of the courage to support them. And who enjoys the blessing
                    of health equally with the country gentleman and sportsman? Somerville says,</p>
                <p>“In vain malignant steams and winter fogs Load the dull air, and hover round our
                    coasts; The huntsman, ever gay, robust, and bold, <hi rend="italic">Defies the
                    noxious vapour,</hi> and confides In this delightful exercise to raise</p>
                <p>His drooping head, and cheer his heart with joy.”</p>
                <p>Certain is it, the rough sports of the country have been known not only to cure
                    diseases of long standing in the human frame; but the exercise of hunting, <hi
                    rend="italic">with the temperance it enjoins,</hi> absolutely steels the
                    constitution, as the poet expresses himself, against the attacks of the most
                    common of the diseases peculiar to this variable climate. Its effect on the
                    mind, which he also alludes to, is of no less value; for, from the very
                    exhilarating nature of the amusement, it relieves it from dwelling upon its
                    anxieties, from which few persons are free; and it is one of the best cures for
                    the heartach, or any of those shocks which our flesh is heir to :—</p>
                <p>“Dona cano divum, <hi rend="italic">loetas</hi><hi rend="italic">venantibus
                    artes,</hi> Auspicio, Diana, tuo,”</p>
                <p>sang the poet Gratius; and Horace’s description of a sportsman’s return to his
                    family, after the toils and perils of the day, is a true picture of a country
                    life, replete with every possible enjoyment.</p>
                <p>- Objections have been made to encouraging youth in a love of our national
                    field-sports, on the score of their engrossing too much of their time and
                    attention, to the neglect of more necessary attainments. “It is true,” says a
                    Roman historian, “the masters in every branch of learning, whom the accomplished
                    father of Commodus provided for his son, were heard with inattention and
                    disgust; whilst the lessons of the Parthian, or the Moor, in the arts of the
                    javelin and the bow, could not be too often repeated” But where is the pursuit
                    that may not be carried to excess? and yet without zeal no person ever succeeded
                    in field-sports of any kind, much less in hunting. “Whatever thy hand findeth to
                    do, do it with all thy might,” said Solomon; and had not Providence implanted
                    this zeal in man’s nature, he never would have been what man now is, but,
                    comparatively, a useless being. Objections are again made, that the sports of
                    the field, hunting animals with dogs especially, are cruel; but the charge, if
                    proved, does not altogether lie against man. The beasts and birds of the field
                    have been given to him, as well as the way to procure them pointed out to him;
                    or wherefore the almost unsearchable faculties of the dog? Some persons,
                    however, have <pb break="no" facs="nls:193648728" xml:id="kp-eb0711-8728-0741"
                    />thought otherwise: “Is it a labour worthy of man,” says a very celebrated
                    English writer, “to watch from day to day, from night to night, the haunts of
                    our fellow animals, that we may destroy them? To triumph over a poor mangled
                    hare or hind, after we have harassed them up and down the country for many hours
                    together with an army of dogs and men? Is it an exercise becoming the majesty of
                    a rational spirit to run yawling with a parcel of hounds, perhaps a whole day
                    together, after some timorous animal ?” In answer to this it may be urged, that
                    we knew no other method of availing ourselves of them when first they were given
                    for our use; and it may be strongly urged, that the destruction of wild animals
                    was never so speedily, and therefore humanely accomplished, as it is at the
                    present day. A century or two ago, the fox lingered all night in a trap, and
                    then too often was subjected to a lingering, if not an agonizing death. He is
                    now killed by hounds, generally in a short time, if he cannot escape from what
                    may be deemed his lawful pursuers. The buck in the forest of the king, or in the
                    park of the nobleman, is now no longer hunted down by the slow but sure
                    blood-hound, a race nearly extinct, but the unerring eye of the rifle-shot seals
                    his doom on the spot. We agree with the poet, that</p>
                <p>“Poor is the triumph o’er the timid hare but she was given for our use, and must
                    be taken, as Esau took the venison, <hi rend="italic">by hunting her</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">;</hi> and here likewise is an improvement. A hundred years back
                    she was trailed up to her form, the operation perhaps of an hour, with the
                    terror-striking notes of the hounds all that time in her ear; and then pursued
                    for at least two hours more, by animals with not half her speed, but with a
                    power of following her by the foot, which it was nearly impossible to evade. At
                    the present day she is whipped out of her form, twenty minutes generally
                    deciding her fate; and, in consequence of her being now pursued in the forenoon,
                    instead of, as before, just on her return from her walk, she escapes oftener
                    than she is killed. Animals destined to fall by the gun are now nearly certain
                    of meeting with instant death. In addition to the increased skill of our
                    marksmen, the improved formation of the gun enables it to carry destruction with
                    a much surer hand, owing to the force and precision with which it carries its
                    shot. Thus, if the game be stricken, it is stricken to instant death, not
                    wounded and mangled by weak, scattered shot. Another consideration presents
                    itself in the discussion of this subject. Life is said to be “sweet ;” but strip
                    it of intellectual enjoyment, and its sweetness is very considerably abated. But
                    we will go one step farther. The natural death of wild animals must generally be
                    lingering, and often painful in the extreme; they have no relief to fly to, but
                    perish as it were by inches. This being admitted, perhaps the hand that
                    instantly deprives them of life may be deemed the hand of a friend.</p>
                <p>An old English writer on field-sports thus forcibly, though somewhat boldly,
                    expresses himself on the alleged cruelty of hunting the hare to death. “What can
                    be a more convincing proof of God’s infinite wisdom, or even of his indulgence
                    to the sons of men, than the formation of this animal (the bare), which
                    naturally flies from creatures she never beheld in her life, makes use of the
                    most refined politics to escape their pursuits (although she cannot foresee
                    whether they are the effects of love or anger), and yet is forced to leave
                    behind her such particles of matter as betray her flight? Again, of how nice and
                    curious a contexture must be the innumerable pores or pipes of the dog’s
                    nostrils, which serve as so many sheaths, or canals, to convey the said
                    particles to the brains of the hounds, there to animate and put in motion every
                    limb, joint, and muscle of their bodies. How excellent was the Hand that
                    furnished these creatures with such tuneful notes to assemble their fellows, and
                    give tidings to their masters, with such an amazing art to unravel the various
                    windings of the fugitive, with so relentless fury to pursue her to the
                    death.”</p>
                <p>But our sensibilities towards the sufferings of animals are limited, not only in
                    wisdom, but in mercy (for, increase our sensibilities, and who could live ?) and
                    let us not charge a sportsman with cruelty because he is the destroyer of that
                    part of the brute creation which was evidently intended should be destroyed by
                    some one. Sportsmen have existed, and must for ever exist, from necessity. They
                    have extirpated some animals, and culled out such as are serviceable to man, and
                    submit to his will and government. Those that will submit are his friends, those
                    that will not are his foes; and so it was intended to be since the charge was
                    given to Adam, and the subsequent commission to Noah. The sports of the field,
                    indeed, as now followed, are generally allowed to have a tendency to improve and
                    promote a free and generous conduct, as well as that manly spirit which is the
                    very reverse of cruelty; and, in the harmless exercise of our imagination,
                    looking at that law of nature which enjoins the destruction of one animal for
                    the good of another, so far from passing a hard sentence on the sportsman, we
                    think with the poet, that</p>
                <p>“His life is pure, who wears no fouler stain 1”</p>
                <p>No great satisfaction would arise from a reference to the practices of the
                    ancients in the field, who, it appears from Virgil, hunted any thing, from the
                    wild ass to the stag; but, we have reason to believe, without much system, as
                    far as their dogs had to do with it. We conceive the ancient Germans and Gauls
                    to have been the best early sportsmen upon system; and the ancient Britons, who
                    came originally from Gaul, and, according to Caesar and Tacitus, were one of the
                    widely-extended Celtic tribes, introduced, or rather brought with them from
                    Gaul, that ardent passion for the chase for which Great Britain has ever since
                    been remarkable. The Anglo-Norman and early English monarchs likewise all appear
                    to have had a passion for the chase; and although a code of laws relative to
                    hunting was formed by one of the Welsh princes in the twelfth century,
                    containing a list of animals, climbing ones, for example, which does not accord
                    with the present idea of <hi rend="italic">hunting,</hi> we hear nothing of
                    foxhounds <hi rend="italic">per se,</hi> till we find them in the kennel of
                    Edward I., and an item in his wardrobe book of L.21. 6s.^ as the annual expenses
                    of his pack, consisting of six couples. Soon after this period, at all events in
                    the course of the next king’s reign, the diversion of hunting in England may be
                    said to have been first reduced to something like a science; treatises having
                    been written on the subject for the instruction of young sportsmen, as well as
                    rules laid down for the observation and conduct of those who filled the various
                    offices, in the forest, the kennel, and the stable. One of the most curious of
                    these performances, is a manuscript written in the beginning of the fourteenth
                    century, in Norman French, by William Twice, huntsman to Edward II., an ancient
                    translation of which occurs amongst the Cottonian manuscripts. In it are
                    enumerated and described the different beasts that were then objects of the
                    chase in England; and, in the manner of a dialogue, the huntsman is informed how
                    he should blow his horn at the different points of a chase. But the generally
                    rude system of hunting in the earlier days of England had previously been in
                    some measure improved and amended by William the Conqueror, of whom Somerville
                    thus writes :— ’</p>
                <p>“Victorious William to more decent rules</p>

                <p>To cheer the busy hound, whose well-known cry <pb break="no" facs="nls:193648741"

                <p>Edward III. was a great stag-hunter; and even at the time he was engaged in war
                    with France, and resident in that country, he had with him, attached to his
                    army, sixty couples of stag-hounds, and an equal number of harehounds. We also
                    learn from Froissart, that the Earl of Foix, a foreign nobleman, contemporary
                    with King Edward, had one hundred and fifty couples of hounds in his castle. But
                    it does not appear that the fox was much in esteem for the chase by any of the
                    Anglo-Norman sportsmen; for in Twice’s Treatise on the Craft of Hunting, he is
                    classed last of all the beasts of venery, excepting the martern and the roe; nor
                    does Somerville in his poem treat him with the respect that he pays to the stag
                    or the hare. The first public notice of him occurs in the reign of Richard II.,
                    who gave permission, by charter.! to the Abbot of Peterborough, to hunt him.
                    Hunting, however, in all its branches, appears to have advanced steadily till
                    the last century, when it flourished greatly by the encouragement given to it by
                    George III.; and as time improves every art, it has at length, we believe,
                    attained perfection.</p>
                <p>Whatever pastime mankind indulge in, their first endeavour should be to make
                    themselves acquainted with the best means of pursuing it, which will greatly
                    increase the pleasure derived from it. But as the philosopher was laughed at for
                    his offer of teaching Alexander the Great the art of war, so the theory of no
                    pastime is worth any thing unless it be based on practice. And, perhaps, of all
                    sports invented by reason for the use and amusement of mankind, there is none to
                    which theory would avail so little as the noble and popular one of hunting.
                    Indeed, the practical part of hunting, notwithstanding its popularity, is but
                    little known, at least but little understood, from the perplexing difficulties
                    that accompany it; and there is reason to believe it was still less understood
                    before the appearance of a work, in which the whole system is minutely and
                    accurately detailed by an eminent sportsman, and master <hi rend="italic"
                    >of</hi> fox-hounds, of the early part of the last century. It is scarcely
                    necessary to observe, that the work alluded to is <hi rend="superscript"> u</hi>
                    Beckford’s Thoughts upon Hunting, in a series of familiar Letters to a Friend ;”
                    of which it has been said, “they are so truly the effusions of sound judgment,
                    and so replete with the useful remarks of an experienced sportsman, that there
                    is no room for any thing new or additional to be introduced upon the subject.”
                    It is true, this has been considered, and will continue to be considered, as a
                    standard work amongst sportsmen; but as systems and habits change with time, and
                    many of both have been materially changed since Beckford’s day, another work on
                    fox-hunting, also from a practical pen, made its appearance in 1826, and was
                    well received by the sporting world, viz. “Observations on Fox-Hunting, and the
                    Management of Hounds in the Kennel and the Field, by Colonel Cook,” several
                    years a master of fox-hounds; hunting various English counties, but principally
                    the Rodings of Essex, celebrated for the stoutness of its foxes.</p>
                <p>It is oply within a very short space of time that sportsmen have been given to
                    communicate their thoughts, or the result of their experience in the field, to
                    the public, unless under fictitious signatures. In proof, however, of the
                    benefit derived from such contributions to the stock of sporting <hi
                    rend="italic">science,</hi> if such a term will be allowed; and likewise in
                    confirmation of what has been advanced on the subject of change of systems and
                    habits that occurs in the course of time, we will make a few comments on the
                    practices of one of the most conspicuous sportsmen England ever gave birth to,
                    the celebrated Hugo Meynell, Esq. of Quorndon Hall, Leicestershire, and made
                    partially known through the medium of a small pamphlet, entitled “The Meynellian
                    Science, or Fox-Hunting upon System,” by the late John Hawkes, Esq. a personal
                    friend of Mr Meynell’s. That Mr Meynell studied fox-hunting as a science, we
                    believe no one will deny; and that his master-mind was quite equal to the task
                    he imposed upon himself, is also an admitted fact; for he was a man of more than
                    ordinary acuteness, coupled with a close and accurate observation of every thing
                    that passed under his eye; and all this with the benefit of an education
                    perfected beyond the usual extent of that bestowed upon, or, perhaps we may say,
                    submitted to, by young gentlemen of large fortune in his day, having studied
                    nearly three years under a private tutor after he became of age. That he shone
                    beyond all others who had preceded him, in the breeding and management of
                    hounds, is a fact universally admitted, producing, as Mr Hawkes says of them,
                    “the steadiest, best, and handsomest pack of fox-hounds in the kingdom ;” adding
                    also the emphatic remark, that his object was to combine strength with beauty,
                    and steadiness with high mettle. His idea of perfect shape was, short backs,
                    open bosoms, straight legs, and compact feet; and the first qualities of hounds
                    he considered to be fine noses and stout runners, opinions which all found to
                    hold good.</p>
                <p>But there were peculiarities in Mr Meynell’s system of hunting, to which, as
                    detailed by Mr Hawkes, we scarcely know how to reconcile ourselves. For example,
                    he tells us that his young hounds were broken in to <hi rend="italic">hare</hi>
                    in the spring of the year, “to find out their propensities, which, when at all
                    flagrant, they early discovered, and he drafted them according to their defects
                    and in the same page he adds, “after hare-hunting, they were, the remaining part
                    of summer, daily walked amongst riot.” Now we cannot approve of entering hounds
                    to an animal they are not intended to hunt, and are at a loss to comprehend what
                    is here meant by the word “riot,” unless it be hares (as the term generally
                    implies) or deer (which were never found wild in his country), which they had
                    been previously instructed to hunt. Their “propensities,” also, by which is here
                    generally understood their steadiness or unsteadiness, must, under such
                    circumstances, have been rather difficult to pronounce an opinion upon, with the
                    exception of their promising to be true to the line, and not given to skirt. The
                    goodness or badness of nose could of course have been discernible when hunting
                    their own game (the fox), to which, in our opinion, all fox-hounds should be
                    entered. Beckford, we remember, speaks of his huntsman letting his puppies enter
                    to a cat; but we cannot approve of such a practice. ∣</p>
                <p>Early in the autumn Mr Meynell hunted his woodlands, Charnwood Forest’ chiefly,
                    with his whole pack, and then divided them into “the old”and “the young pack;”
                    but, to show the disadvantage of this system, Mr Hawkes says, “the young hounds
                    were hunted twice a week, as much in woodlands as possible, and in the most
                    unpopular districts.” The present plan of mixing young and old hounds together
                    is far preferable to this, not only as they can then take their turn in the good
                    and popular “districts,” but, by having the assistance of older hounds in chase,
                    the younger ones are less likely to do wrong.</p>
                <p>Mr Meynell’s idea of <hi rend="italic">perfection</hi> in hounds, in chase, Mr
                    Hawkes says, “consisted of their being true guiders in hard running, and close
                    and patient hunters in a cold scent, together with stoutness.” Their
                    imperfections, over-running the scent, and babbling, were considered their
                    greatest faults.” To all this every sportsman must assent.</p>
                <p>The following passage contains perhaps rather more of <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193648754" xml:id="kp-eb0711-8754-0743"/>enthusiasm than of fact,
                    although a qualification is given to it in the concluding sentence. “Mr
                    Meynell’s hounds,” says Mr Hawkes, “were criticised by himself and his friends
                    in the most minute manner. Every hound had his peculiar talents, and was sure to
                    have a fair opportunity of displaying them (!) Some had the remarkable faculty
                    of finding a fox, which they would do, almost invariably, notwithstanding twenty
                    or thirty couple were out in the same covert. Some had the propensity to hunt
                    the doubles and short turns. Some were inclined to be hard runners. Some had a
                    remarkable faculty of hunting the drag of a fox, which they would do very late
                    in the day. And sometimes the hardest runners were the best hunters; and
                    fortunate was the year when such excellencies prevailed.”</p>
                <p>“Mr Meynell,” continues Mr Hawkes, <hi rend="superscript"> a</hi> prided himself
                    on the steadiness of his hounds, and their hunting through sheep and hares,
                    which they did in a very superior manner. He'seldom or never attempted to lift
                    his hounds through sheep; and from habit, and the great flocks the hounds were
                    accustomed to, they carried the scent on most correctly and expeditiously, much
                    sooner than any lifting could accomplish.” We are far from advocates for lifting
                    hounds when it can be avoided; but knowing the so often insurmountable
                    difficulties occasioned by flocks of sheep and herds of cattle in the country Mr
                    Meynell hunted, in addition to a crowd of horsemen pressing upon the heels of
                    the pack, we consider that, if, under such circumstances, hounds do not almost
                    instantly recover the scent, the assistance of the huntsman is called for. The
                    “steadiness and docility” of Mr Meynell’s pack, we have reason to believe, were
                    remarkable, and are vouched for by other authority than Mr Hawkes’s. “A most
                    extraordinary instance of discipline in hounds,” says Colonel Cook (p. 202),
                    “occurs to me, which I ought to have mentioned when speaking of that unrivalled
                    sportsman the late Mr Meynell. He met in the Market Harborough (Leicestershire)
                    country, at a small patch of gorse on the side of a hill, in a very large
                    pasture field: the hounds feathered as they went in, and found instantly. The
                    covert being only about two acres, and open, Mr Meynell immediately saw that the
                    fox was in danger of being chopped; he therefore called out to Jack Raven, the
                    huntsman, “Jack, take the hounds away and, at one of his usual <hi rend="italic"
                    >rates,</hi> every hound stopped, and the pack were taken to the hedge side,
                    when Mr Meynell called out three steady hounds, and threw them into the cover.
                    The fox was so loath to break, that the three hounds kept hunting him for ten
                    minutes, in the hearing of all the pack, who lay perfectly quiet at Raven’s
                    horse’s feet, till the fox went away over the finest part of the country; and
                    the moment Mr Meynell gave his most energetic, thrilling holloo (Mr Hawkes
                    speaks of the power of Mr Meynell’s cheering holloa, which, he says, “thrilled
                    through the heart and nerve of every hearer”), every hound flew to him; the
                    burst was the finest that any sportsman ever beheld, and after an hour and ten
                    minutes they killed their fox.” This is doubtless an astonishing instance of
                    command of hounds with a scent before them, particularly so to those persons who
                    are aware of the generally uncontrollable power of the impulse given to them by
                    nature at that particular time; and were it not for the high reputation of the
                    pack alluded to, we should, as we cannot doubt the fact, be inclined to say, it
                    savoured a little of slackness, or, at all events, of a too severe discipline,
                    bordering upon the annihilation of the distinguishing natural properties of the
                    fox-hound, namely, high mettle and dash.</p>
                <p>“Mr Meynell,” adds Mr Hawkes, “was not fond of casting hounds; when once they
                    were laid upon the line of scent, he left it to them; he only encouraged them to
                    take pains, and kept aloof, so that the steam of the horses could not interfere
                    with the scent. It is true, hounds should not be cast, if they can do the work
                    themselves; and if the authority of Mr Meynell could restrain a Leicestershire
                    field of horsemen to keep aloof when his hounds were at check, more time may
                    have been given them to make their own cast; but it must be recollected that,
                    when the hounds are at fault, the fox is not.” Again, “when his hounds came to a
                    check, every encouragement was given to them to recover the scent, without the
                    huntsman getting amongst them, or whippers-in driving them about, which is the
                    common practice of most packs. The hounds were holloa’d back to the place where
                    they brought the scent, and encouraged to try round in their own way, which they
                    generally did successfully, avoiding the time lost in the mistaken practice of
                    casting hounds at the heels of the huntsman. When the hounds were cast, it was
                    in two or three different lots, by Mr Meynell, his huntsman, and whipper-in; and
                    not driven together in a body, like a flock of sheep. They were allowed to
                    spread, and use their own sagacity, at a very gentle pace; and not hurried about
                    in a blustering manner. It was Mr Meynell’s opinion, that a great noise, and
                    scolding of hounds, made them wild. Correcting them in a quiet way was the most
                    judicious method. Whippers-in also should turn hounds quietly, and not call
                    after them in a noisy, disagreeable manner.” In all the foregoing remarks we
                    coincide with the opinions of these two celebrated sportsmen. We think a
                    huntsman should never be nearer than from sixty to a hundred yards of his hounds
                    when they first check; nor can a whipper-in execute his office of turning or
                    stopping a hound at this moment too quietly and discreetly; but no general line
                    of conduct for either the one or the other can be laid down. Some hounds, and
                    especially if they have been pressed upon by horsemen, will not turn to either
                    horn or holloa, without a smack of the whip, or at all events a <hi
                    rend="italic">rate;</hi> nor will the body of the pack, if a little blown, or
                    excited by a previous holloa, always try for their fox so well and <hi
                    rend="italic">quickly</hi> as they should do, if left quite to themselves; or,
                    as Mr Hawkes so properly expresses himself, if left to “their own sagacity.”
                    That a great noise makes hounds wild no one doubts, and the system of holloaing
                    is every year on the decrease. As for the division of the pack into three lots
                    when at fault, that perhaps originated with Mr Meynell; indeed we believe it
                    did; but the practice is now become not uncommon, of its being divided into two,
                    namely, one lot with the huntsman, and the other with the first whipper-in.</p>
                <p>“When hounds are going to the cry,” writes Mr Hawkes, “they should be encouraged
                    in a pleasant way; not driven and rated, as if discord was a necessary
                    ingredient in the sport and music of a finb cry of hounds. Whippers-in are too
                    apt to think their own importance and consequence consist in shouting,
                    holloaing, and unnecessary activity. When hounds can hear the cry, they get
                    together sooner than any whipper-in can drive them. If any hound is conceited,
                    and disinclined to go to cry, he should immediately be drafted.”</p>
                <p>On the subject of blood, that is, killing and eating foxes, we entirely assent to
                    the following remarks: “Blood was a thing Mr Meynell was more indifferent about
                    than most masters of hounds. The wildest packs of hounds were known to kill the
                    most foxes in cover, but very seldom showed good runs over a country. Hounds
                    chopping foxes in cover is more a vice than a proof of their being good
                    cover-hounds. Murdering foxes is a most absurd prodigality. Seasoned foxes are
                    as necessary to sport as experienced hounds.” Our o∖vn opinion of the value of
                    blood to hounds perfectly accords with that which, it appears, was entertained
                    by Mr Meynell; namely, that it is far from a <hi rend="italic">sine qua non</hi>
                    to the well-doing of fox-hounds, or any other hounds, as is apparent at once
                    from the mo <pb break="no" facs="nls:193648767" xml:id="kp-eb0711-8767-0744"
                    />dern system of hunting the stag. If it be possible, the pack are not permitted
                    to break his skin, much more to devour him; still, despite of the rating and
                    flogging they get to prevent their injuring the object they are pursuing, they
                    do pursue it to the last with all their might and main. But let it not be
                    supposed that we set no value on what may be termed well-carried blood. On the
                    contrary, we think the flesh and blood of a fox well found, and handsomely
                    killed, by hounds in the moments of high excitement, must be very beneficial to
                    them. But when chopped in a cover (generally the effect of accident, and not, as
                    Mr Hawkes supposed, of vicious propensity in any individual hound), we consider
                    a round of beef would be a more acceptable present to them; nor is the case much
                    altered when a fox is digged out of an earth, after perhaps an hour’s delay. We
                    remember to have heard Mr Osbaldeston assert, that the best week’s sport he ever
                    had in Leicestershire when he hunted it, was after his hounds had been out nine
                    days in succession without tasting a fox.</p>
                <p>“Mr Meynell’s natural taste,” continues Mr Hawkes, “led him to admire large
                    hounds; but his experience convinced him that small ones were generally the
                    stoutest, soundest, and in every respect the most executive. His hounds had more
                    good runs than any pack of his day. Two very extraordinary ones happened of a
                    very rare description. One was a run of one hour and twenty minutes without a
                    <hi rend="italic">check,</hi> and killed their fox. The other was two hours and
                    fifty minutes without a <hi rend="italic">cast,</hi> and killed. The hounds in
                    the first run kept well together, and only two horses performed it; the rest of
                    the field were unequal to its fleetness. The other run alluded to was performed
                    by the whole of the pack; and though all were up at the death, two or three
                    slackened in their pace just at the last. One horse only went the whole of
                    it.”</p>
                <p>Mr Hawkes thus speaks of the necessary qualifications of hounds to show sport
                    :—“To obtain a good run, hounds should not only have good abilities, but they
                    should be experienced, and well acquainted with each other. To guide a scent
                    well over a country for a length of time, and through all the difficulties
                    usually encountered, requires the best and most experienced abilities. A faulty
                    hound, or injudicious rider, by one improper step, may defeat the most promising
                    run.” It is evident, from the above judicious observations, that an
                    old-established pack of hounds must have great advantages over one of an
                    opposite character. </p>
                <p>We shall finish our extracts from this little pamphlet, which was merely
                    circulated privately amongst the author’s friends, but valued as from the pen of
                    so eminent a sportsman as the late ‘Mr Hawkes proved himself to be, both in the
                    field and on the race-course, where he shone conspicuously as one of the best
                    gentlemen-jockies of his day, with his judicious remark on the conduct of
                    sportsmen who follow hounds. “Gentlemen, and every person who makes hunting his
                    pursuit,” says he, “should learn to ride judiciously to hounds. It is a
                    contemplative amusement; and much good diversion might be promoted by a few
                    regular precautions. The principal thing to attend to is, not to ride too near
                    the hounds, and always as much as possible anticipate a check. By which means
                    the leading men will pull their horses up in time, and afford the hounds fair
                    opportunity to keep the line of scent unbroken. Sheep, cattle, teams at plough,
                    and arable land, are all causes of checks. Thoughtless sportsmen are apt to
                    press too much on hounds, particularly down a road. Every one should consider
                    that every check operates against the hounds, and that scent is of a fleeting
                    nature, soon lost, never again to be recovered.”</p>
                <p>The following is the concluding paragraph, affording a good specimen of the
                    writer’s enthusiastic love of foxhunting, as also of a cultivated mind
                    :—“Fox-hunting,” he asserts, “is a manly and fine exercise, affording health to
                    the body, and matter and food for a contemplative mind. In no situation are the
                    faculties of man more displayed. Fortitude, good sense, and collectiveness of
                    mind, have a wide field for exercise; and a sensible sportsman would be a
                    respectable character in any situation in life. The field is a most agreeable
                    coffeehouse, and there is more real society to be met with there than in any
                    other situation of life. It links all classes together, from the peer to the
                    peasant. It is the Englishman’s peculiar privilege. It is not to be found in any
                    other part of the globe, but in England’s true land of liberty; and may it
                    flourish to the end of time I”</p>
                <p>There is perhaps no part of the material of fox-hunting more interesting than the
                    management of hounds in the kennel, which, we do not hesitate in saying,
                    presents one of the most curious scenes that are anywhere displayed in the whole
                    circle of the transactions of mankind with the inferior animal creation. To see
                    sixty couples of those animals, all hungry as tigers, standing aloof in their
                    yard (as is the practice in some kennels), and, without even hearing, much less
                    feeling, the whip, not daring to move until the order is given to them to move.
                    And what is the order given? why, at the words, “Come over, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Bitches,”</hi> or, “Come over, <hi rend="italic">Bogs,”</hi> every hound of
                    each individual sex comes forward, as the sex it belongs to may be called for,
                    leaving those of the other sex in their places. Then the act of drawing them to
                    the feeding troughs is an exceedingly interesting sight. Often, with the door
                    wide open, and the savoury meat in their view, the huntsman has no use for his
                    whip, having nothing to do but to call each hound by his name, which of course
                    he readily answers to. The expression of countenance, too, at this time, is well
                    worthy of notice; and that of earnest solicitation, of entreaty, we might almost
                    say of importunity, cannot be more forcibly displayed than in the face of a
                    hungry hound awaiting his turn to be drawn. He appears absolutely to watch the
                    lips of the huntsman, anticipating his own name. A view of a pack of fox-hounds
                    likewise in their lodging-rooms, is a most agreeable sight to those who love to
                    see animals in a high state of enjoyment, which no doubt hounds are when
                    reposing on their well littered-down benches after a hard day’s work, and with
                    their bellies well filled. They absolutely appear to feel for each other’s
                    comforts, in placing themselves in situations that enable their fellow-creatures
                    to repose parts of their bodies upon their own, to render their position for
                    sleep and rest more agreeable to them.</p>
                <p>The system of fox-hunting has been much changed since that sport commenced.
                    Almost all foxes were once found by the drag, and the first challenge was loudly
                    cheered in days when the game was scarce. A long drag, however, although a great
                    test of <hi rend="italic">nose,</hi> is by no means desirable, as, if it happens
                    to be down wind, the fox takes the hint, and is off long before the hounds can
                    hunt up to his kennel. It was nevertheless a fine feature in the sport, as the
                    gradual increase of cry, the cheering holloas of the sportsmen, and the crash
                    when the fox was unkennelled, contributed greatly to ennoble the scene, and
                    created, as it were, two climaxes in a chase, when it ended in blood. But
                    another disadvantage attended it. Hounds could not be depended upon, taking the
                    average of scent, to hunt a drag that had become cold; so they were obliged to
                    be out very early in the morning, which was not only disagreeable, as
                    encroaching upon the sportsman’s rest, but was coupled with the disadvantage, at
                    all events with the risk, of finding a gorged fox, too full to run far, much
                    less to run fast. The modern system does not require the drag, as woodland
                    covers are comparatively small to what they used to be; gorse covers made for
                    the <pb break="no" facs="nls:193648780" xml:id="kp-eb0711-8780-0745"/>purpose of
                    holding foxes are easily accessible to hounds accustomed to draw them; and the
                    game is in most countries so plentiful, that if a fox be not found in one cover,
                    he is almost certain to be found in another, and that not far off. The
                    consequence is, no more time is now lost in drawing two or three gorse covers,
                    than the drag of one fox formerly occupied; neither did that always lead to a
                    find. Moreover, at the present hour of finding, there is but little chance of
                    unkennelling a gorged fox.</p>
                <p>It is by some asserted, that what are called woodland foxes are stouter runners
                    than those bred in the artificial gorse and other covers, and we have good
                    reason to believe they are so. But the great objection to large woodlands is the
                    uncertainty of getting a run, from the difficulty of making foxes break from
                    them, as they naturally hang to places which appear to afford them security; and
                    it often happens that hounds, and the horses of the servants, have done a fair
                    day’s work before the run begins. On the other hand, we admit that a fox found
                    in a wood of considerable extent is more likely to show a decidedly good day’s
                    sport, than one found in an artificial cover, and for this reason: he slips away
                    unperceived, eight times out of ten, and consequently has time to look about
                    him, and make his points, ere the chase commences; whereas a fox viewed away
                    from a small gorse cover, within sight of a hundred or two of horsemen, is
                    bullied, frightened, and soon blown, which occasions him to run short; and, of
                    course, if the scent serves, and the hounds are good, he cannot live long, half
                    an hour being as much as can be calculated upon under such circumstances. Gorse
                    covers, however, if not too small,—not under three or font acres, —are
                    indispensable in a hunting country, as foxes are very fond of them for their
                    security against any thing but fox-hounds; and another great advantage attending
                    them is, that they can be placed wherever it may be thought desirable to place
                    them.</p>
                <p>The making of gorse covers requires no small attention, <hi rend="italic">we</hi>
                    had nearly said <hi rend="italic">shill.</hi> The ground is all the better for
                    being trenched to the depth of from a foot to a foot and a half, and it should
                    be made as clean and in as good condition as if it were to be the seed-bed of
                    turnips. The seed should be minutely examined, as it often fails from having
                    lost its germinating properties; and it should be drilled in the ground, and
                    hoed, after the manner of a turnip crop. By keeping it clean by the hoe, it
                    will, if the seed be good, <hi rend="italic">and the land dry,</hi> often hold a
                    fox in the second year, but will seldom fail in the third. Some writers, Colonel
                    Cook among the number, speak of broom being sown amongst gorse. This should
                    never be, as all huntsmen who draw, or run through, broom covers, can vouch for
                    their being decidedly inimical to scent. A novel description of fox-cover came
                    into fashion a few years back in Leicestershire, but is not highly approved of,
                    from the difficulty hounds experience in drawing it. Strong black thorn stakes
                    are driven into the ground endways, at a small distance apart, and the rank
                    grass and weeds growing rapidly over, and entwining with them, form a strong
                    cover the first year; and it is found proof against a fall of snow, which gorse
                    covers are not, and are often forsaken by foxes on that account. All
                    artificially-made covers should be not nearer than half a mile at the least to
                    any house or village; and if on a gently sloping bank, facing the south, foxes
                    will like them better.</p>
                <p>Some sportsmen object to many rides being cut through covers, as they are so
                    often the cause of foxes being headed by the horsemen. The objection in part
                    holds good; but a certain number of rides are necessary in all large covers, to
                    enable the servants to get near their hounds, who might otherwise be disposed to
                    run riot, as they soon discover when they are out of the reach of either rate or
                    whip. Woodlands, with rides in them, are essential to the making of young hounds
                    in all countries; and the finest in England are those of the Duke of Buccleuch,
                    near Kel-tering in Northamptonshire, within the limits of the Pytchley Hunt,
                    with rides, or, speaking more properly, avenues in them, to the extent of
                    upwards of fifty miles.</p>
                <p>When speaking of the disadvantages of large woods, in which foxes are apt to hang
                    or dwell, Colonel Cook recommends killing a fox, and letting the hounds eat him,
                    in the middle of them; which we believe will generally have the desired effect.
                    On the other hand, should a fox be killed in a small cover, he should, if
                    possible, be carried out of it before the hounds break him up, for reasons which
                    are obvious from the foregoing remark.</p>
                <p>The arrangement of earths, and the stopping of them, are matters of no small
                    importance in a hunting country. Artificial ones are sometimes made, but they
                    are reckoned unhealthy for foxes; and the best are those made by badgers, which
                    can always be commanded at pleasure, by turning out those animals in pairs. On
                    the proper and , careful stopping of earths every thing depends; for nothing can
                    be more annoying to sportsmen than to have their fox get to ground, just as the
                    hounds have well settled to the scent of him, with every prospect of a run.
                    There are various methods of stopping earths, but none more secure than by a
                    bunch of gorse, or furze, crammed well into rhe mouth of them, with the stalks
                    pushed inwards. When earths are only slightly stopped, a fox will scratch his
                    way into them; and as this very often happens, it shows the necessity of a
                    careful and experienced earthstopper; and we agree with Colonel Cook in thinking
                    it better to pay for each day’s stopping, rather than annually in the lump,
                    reserving the power to withhold payment in case of evident neglect. The expense
                    of earth-stopping varies according to the nature of the soil, covers, &amp;c.;
                    but in certain countries it amounts to as much as L.200 per annum. It may also
                    surprise some persons to hear, that the rent paid for artificial covers, that
                    is, for the land on which they are made, in one hunt alone, in Leicestershire,
                    amounts to upwards of L.700 per annum.</p>
                <p>The following calculations of the expenses of a pack of fox-hounds, varying, of
                    course, with the extent of them, are given by Colonel Cook, and admitted to be
                    very near the mark; making allowance for the difference in the price of markets
                    at the time he made them, and at others.</p>

                <p>“If you do not attend to the kennel department yourself,” adds the Colonel, “but
                    keep a huntsman, the expense will be at least L.300 more.”</p>
                <p>The only remark we have to offer on the foregoing calculations is, that the
                    author does not allow a sufficient number of hounds for the several days’
                    hunting in the week. For example, we venture to say, that no country could be
                    hunted four times a week with fifty couples of hounds; at all events, fifty
                    couples of hounds equal to that work are very rarely to be found. We agree with
                    the writer, that either four times a week, or even twice, are preferable to
                    three, for keeping hounds in regular work, when sound But on the subject of
                    expenses we have a word or two more to say. Knowing, as we do, that they
                    generally, we believe we may add always, exceed the calculations made by Colonel
                    Cook, and in some instances by double, we consider it rather inconceivable that,
                    in the present depressed state of land property, either noblemen or private
                    gentlemen should be expected or permitted to bear all the chargé of hunting a
                    country themselves, knowing, as we do, the great sacrifices of property and
                    income that have already been made to a perseverance in keeping fox-hounds,
                    unassisted by a subscription. But this cannot go on much longer; nor indeed is
                    it, with some exceptions, fit that it should; and, in support of our assertions,
                    we will quote the sentiments of a writer on this subject, admirably well
                    expressed, in a late number of the New Sporting Magazine.<note anchored="true"

                <p>After hinting at the probable decline of a sport, from this cause alone, which Mr
                    Burke described as “one of the balances of the constitution,”he thus proceeds
                    :—“As to the total abolition of the sport, we anticipate no such event. It is
                    the favourite sport of Englishmen; and that which a man likes best he will
                    relinquish last. Still, with the exception of countries that boast their
                    Clevelands, their Yarboroughs and Suttons, their Graftons, Beauforts, Rutlands,
                    Fitzwilliams, Segraves, Middletons (his lordship is since dead), and
                    Harewoods—their great and sporting noblemen, in fact—we feel assured that,
                    unless something be speedily arranged, half the packs in England must either be
                    curtailed of their fair proportion of sport, or abolished altogether. This is
                    not as it should be. Men are as fond of hunting, at least of riding to hounds,
                    as ever; but though we feel that we may be telling a disagreeable truth to many,
                    the fact is, that most men want to hunt for nothing. The day for this, however,
                    is fast drawing to a close. The breed of country gentlemen who keep hounds—the
                    Ralph Lambtons, the Farquharsons, the Assheton Smiths, the Villebois and
                    Osbaldestons—are fast disappearing, in all probability never to be renewed. True
                    that it is a fine, a proud sight, to see an English country gentleman spending
                    his income on his native soil, and aftbrding happiness and amusement to his
                    neighbours, receiving their respect and esteem in return; but we cannot help
                    feeling, that unless a man has one of those overwhelming incomes that are more
                    frequently read of than enjoyed, it is hardly fair that the expenses of a sport
                    which affords health and recreation to hundreds should fall upon his individual
                    shoulders. Heirs at law will not be hindered by the remoteness of relationship
                    from impugning the conduct of their ancestors; nor will it be any consolation to
                    a son, on coming into possession of an overburdened estate, to know that the
                    difficulties which oppress him were incurred for the purpose of keeping a pack
                    of fox-hounds, by which his father afforded amusement to the country.” It may
                    here be not unappro-priately added, that at the time the above was written
                    (February 1834), three of the best hunting countries in England were vacant,
                    viz. the Quorndon in Leicestershire, the Pytchley in Northamptonshire, and the
                    Oakley in Bedfordshire.</p>
                <p>Fox-hunting is a sort of prescriptive right, which England has claimed from a
                    very early period; and, more than this, it has long been considered that the
                    common law allowed persons to enter the lands of another in pursuit of a fox,
                    the destruction of which was presumed to be a public benefit. This opinion was
                    founded on the celebrated case Grundy <hi rend="italic">v.</hi> Feltham (1, <hi
                    rend="italic">Term. Reports,</hi> p. 334); but in that of Earl of Essex <hi
                    rend="italic">v.</hi> Capel, Summer Assizes, 1809, the legality of hunting foxes
                    over the land of another iš rendered very questionable. This being the case, it
                    is a great compliment to the sport, as no doubt injury of land to a certain
                    amount, though small, is occasioned by it, that it is permitted to the extent to
                    which we see it, in every county in Great Britain; and that an action of
                    trespass is an unusual occurrence, must be considered as still more creditable
                    to the yeomanry and tenantry who live by the occupation of land. On the other
                    hand, however, it must be remembered, that the produce of land is very
                    considerably enhanced by the great demand, as well as extra prices given, for
                    hay, corn, and straw, as likewise by the encouragement to breeding horses; and
                    that, wherever there is a colony of fox-hunters, it is accompanied by a great
                    influx of money, which is expended in the immediate neighbourhood.</p>
                <p>There were formerly three established classes of hunting in Great Britain, each
                    of which had advocates, as it may have been suitable to situation, fortune, time
                    of life, &amp;c.; and although the struggle for superiority has ended in favour
                    of that of the fox, we have reason to believe, that since what are termed “<hi
                    rend="italic">packs of hounds”</hi> have been established, hunting the stag or
                    buck claims precedence of the hare; the hare of the fox; the otter, perhaps, of
                    all. We will then offer a few more remarks upon them, as we have ranked them
                    here.</p>
                <p>Since the stag has ceased to be drawn for, and found in his native majesty, and
                    hunted as a wild animal, “stag hunting” has lost all its interest with the
                    sportsman; and when we say that the chase of no other animal is,’after all, from
                    first to last, so full of interest as that of the stag, the sportsman has some
                    cause for regret. But wild-stag hunting could not have remained one of the
                    popular diversions of Great Britain, for two sufficient reasons. First, from the
                    country being so generally cleared of wood, there would have been a great scarci
                    tyotgame; and, secondly, from the circumstance of the stag being, by his nature,
                    unfit to be hunted during some of the months that sportsmen like to be on the
                    field. The act of harbouring the deer, however, must be considered as amongst
                    the very highest branches of the sportsman’s art, and one which none but a
                    well-practised sportsman could perform. Neither was the hunting to death of the
                    wild stag by any means so easy a task as might be supposed, from the bulk of the
                    animal, which it must be proportionally difficult for him to conceal. On the
                    contrary, like <pb break="no" facs="nls:193648806" xml:id="kp-eb0711-8806-0747"
                    />the harts of Meandros, flying from the terrible cry of Diana’s hounds, the
                    “wise hart,” or <hi rend="italic">cerf</hi><hi rend="italic">sage</hi> as he is
                    termed in ancient hunting, knows how to foil hounds perhaps as well as, or
                    better than, most other wild animals, and is allowed to consult the wind in his
                    course more than any of them. It is also said of him, that he will, when
                    pursued, rouse other deer from their lair, to induce the hounds to run counter,
                    or change; and his device of taking soil, with nothing but the nose to be seen
                    above the water; running down a stream, and seeking for a hard and dry road when
                    pressed; are facts too well established to require comment. But, after all, the
                    subtilty of man in harbouring a deer, and knowing beforehand its age, sex, and
                    size, by the slot and other distinguishing marks which it leaves behind it as it
                    traverses its native forests, is more conspicuously displayed than in any other
                    department of the chase, and is a most satisfactory illustration of “the
                    dominion given to man over every living thing that moveth upon the earth.” We
                    shall then dismiss this part of our subject with the remark, that although,
                    properly speaking, the diversion of hunting the stag is totally extinct in Great
                    Britain, we can vouch practically for the fact, that there is not a nobler sight
                    in nature than that of a full-headed stag roused from his lair by hounds, and
                    majestically trotting before them, snuffing the air as he goes, and appearing to
                    care little for his pursuers, from confidence in his natural powers. That these
                    powers are great, all modern stag-hunters are satisfied of; and those of
                    endurance, when chased, are allegorized in the fable of the Maenalaean stag, the
                    running down of which is said to have occupied Hercules for a year, and was in
                    consequence counted amongst the labours of that hero. That deer are superiorly
                    winded animals, is apparent by the immense height they can leap, just before
                    they die from bodily exhaustion; and it may be accounted for by their being
                    furnished with <hi rend="italic">two</hi> spiracles, or breathing places, one at
                    the corner of each eye. Oppian, the Greek poet, must have supposed, by the
                    following line, that they had <hi rend="italic">four.</hi><hi rend="italic
                    superscript"> w</hi><hi rend="italic">^VirζaSυ[it&gt;i</hi> ∕hvif, <hi

                    nvowrι</hi><hi rend="italic smallcaps"> ĨiuuXoi,”</hi> which was a mistake of
                    the sporting bard; and some writers have made Aristotle say, that goats breathed
                    at their ears, whereas he directly asserts the contrary. The classic writers,
                    however, as well as our own poets, have taken some of their most beautiful
                    similes from the chase of the deer; for example, Virgil’s comparing the flight
                    of Turnus to a stag trying to escape from the toils; and the death of the
                    favourite hind by the hand of the young lulus, a master-piece of pastoral
                    poetry. But the death of the stag has been a favourite theme of our own poets;
                    and both Shakspeare and Thomson have been equally happy in their description of
                    the last moments of the antlered monarch of the forest, the latter
                    particularly:</p>
                <p>“He stands at bay, And puts his last weak refuge in despair. The big round tears
                    run down his dappled face: He groans in anguish; whilst the growling pack,
                    Blood-happy, hang at his fair jutting chest, And mark his beauteous chequer’d
                    sides with gore.”</p>
                <p>The following account of hunting the wild stag in Devonshire, but now nowhere to
                    be seen in England, is from one of Nimrod’s Tours, in 1824:—“The amusement of
                    staghunting appears to be of ancient date in the county of Devon. For many years
                    previous to 1775, the North Devon stag-hounds were kept in a style almost
                    amounting to magnificent, by the then Sir Thomas Acland, Bart., when Colonel
                    Basset took them and kept them to the year 1784. At that period the late Sir
                    Thomas Acland became master of them, and kept them to the year 1793, when
                    Colonel Basset took them again, at his own expense, and hunted them to the year
                    1801 inclusive; when ill health obliging him to part with them, he gave away all
                    but six couples and a half to Lord Soudes. In 1802 Lord Fortescue revived them,
                    by receiving from Colonel Basset the six couples and a half he had reserved, and
                    kept them for that year. In 1803 they were first kept by subscription by Mr
                    Worth, who continued at the head of them till 1810. In 1811 Lord Graves became
                    master of them, also by subscription; but in the spring of 1812 Lord Fortescue
                    determined upon keeping them at his own expense, which he did for seven years,
                    when they were once more established by subscription; and since the year 1819
                    have ' been managed by Mr Lucas, who still continues at their head.”</p>
                <p>The next year after Nimrod visited them, they were given up; but we give the
                    extracts from his account of two days’ diversion with these hounds, on each of
                    which they found a “warrantable” deer. Speaking of the first, he says, “When we
                    arrived within half a mile of the covert in which a stag was harboured, the
                    hounds, till then in couples, were put into a stable, when the celebrated Joe
                    Faulknor, one of the whippers-in, was despatched with two couples of old hounds,
                    for the purpose of rousing the game. One of these, a hound called Leader, was
                    shown to me as a sample of a perfect stag-hound; and they were both said to be
                    so steady, and to know a rate so well, that they will stop if a wrong (not a
                    warrantable) deer be found, and will draw again. It was some time after Joe had
                    got his tufters into covert before we heard any thing but an accidental note
                    from his melodious pipe, which is certainly pitched in the right key. During
                    this interval of suspense, for, as the poet sings,</p>
                <p>“The blood more stirs To rouse a lion than to start a hare,”</p>
                <p>a farmer rode up with a piece of a stick in his hand, which was cut to the size
                    of a <hi rend="italic">slot</hi> he had found in a neighbouring wood. On my
                    measuring it by my hand, I found it to be four inches in length, which,
                    exceeding the usual length, showed it to be the slot of an old and very large
                    stag.” He then proceeds to relate that the harboured stag was roused, but
                    afforded very little sport, on account of the extreme badness of the weather,
                    and total want of scent. Of the find on the second day he thus speaks :—“The
                    stag lay ‘ close couched,’ or he must have been found before. We stood on an
                    eminence which overhung the covert, and therefore could command a view of it. A
                    long silence had prevailed, and we began to wonder wdiat had become of Joe and
                    his tufters, when all on a sudden a holloa was heard, and a hound threw his
                    tongue:</p>
                <p>“The deep-mouthed blood-hound’s heavy bay Resounded up the rocky way;</p>
                <p>And faint, from further distance borne, Were heard the clanging hoof and
                    horn.”</p>
                <p>The rouse, it seems, had taken place in a small covert, a short distance below
                    us, and we could see a stag of noble size, with branching antlers, trotting
                    majestically along in a small opening between two woods, apparently paying
                    little attention to the old hounds behind him. Indeed, at one time, so far from
                    verifying the words of a poet, that <hi rend="italic">pedibus timor
                    addidit</hi><hi rend="italic">alas,</hi> he very coolly broke into a walk, as
                    much as to say, <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> 1 value you not but the staunch
                    old tufters getting nearer to his haunches, obliged him to quicken his pace;
                    and, to the great joy of all present, he put his head straight for a moor twelve
                    miles across.” But this is a subject for poetry; and it is impossible to read
                    even the foregoing short account of rousing the deer with hounds, without
                    calling to our recollection the beautiful lines of the Scottish bard in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Lady of the Lake,</hi> so strictly true to nature :—</p>
                <p>“The antlered, monarch of the waste</p>
                <p>Sprang from his heathery couch in haste;</p>
                <p>But ere his fleet career he took, The dew-drops from his flanks he shook; <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193648819" xml:id="kp-eb0711-8819-0748"/> Like crested
                    leader proud and high, Tossed his beamed frontlet to the sky; A moment gazed
                    adown the dale, A moment snuffed the tainted gale; A moment listen’d to the cry,
                    That thicken’d as the chase drew nigh; Then, as the headmost foes appear’d, With
                    one brave bound the copse he clear’d, And stretching forward free and far,
                    Sought the wild heaths of Uam-Var.”</p>
                <p>Nimrod relates a few incidents connected with this day’s sport, peculiar to
                    hunting the deer. “I had,” says he, “in this run, an opportunity of witnessing a
                    circumstance peculiar to stag-hunting, and that is, <hi rend="italic">hunting in
                    water.</hi> Our deer beat down a river for about half a mile, the hounds
                    following him by scent, which we might wonder how they could avail themselves of
                    in so chilling an element as a rapidly-flowing stream. This, I think, may be
                    called one of the master-pieces of natural instinct.” Again, “Our stag once sank
                    in Breraridge Wood, when he was fresh found; and the crash of those deep-tongued
                    hounds at the time was very fine indeed. I was in hopes we should have viewed
                    him in Castle Hill Park, but we were just too late. When he broke out of the
                    park, he took a ring through some of the neighbouring coverts; when skirting it
                    again, he returned to the place where he was found, and was killed at Bragford,
                    a short distance beyond. He was once what is called ‘ set up’ in the water,
                    where he sank; but breaking out again, he was pulled down by the pack; and when
                    one of the field went up to him to cut his throat, his eye was glazed. He was as
                    fine a stag as ever was seen. He had brow, bay, tray, three on top on one horn,
                    and two on the other; <hi rend="italic">and the weight of his haunch was
                    thirty-nine pounds."</hi> Nimrod laments the want of the French horns that
                    formed part of this establishment, but which, some time before his visiting it,
                    were done away with. The <hi rend="italic">recheat</hi> and the <hi
                    rend="italic">mort</hi> were wanting to make the thing complete.</p>
                <p>A kind of technological dictionary is required to almost all sports of flood and
                    field. Of the technical terms in deer-hunting Nimrod thus speaks :—“What we
                    fox-hunters call the ball or pad of a fox on foot, they term the ‘ slot.’ We
                    drag up to a fox; they draw on the slot, or walk up a deer. We find or unkennel
                    a fox; they rouse or unharbour a deer. A fox runs up and down a cover; a dear
                    beats up or down a covert, or a stream. With us, a fox is headed (turned back,
                    or driven from his point); with them, a deer is blanched. We say, a fox stops or
                    hangs in a cover, in a run; they say, their game sinks. We recover our fox; they
                    fresh find their deer. We run into (kilD our fox; they set up the deer. The fox
                    is worried; the deer is broken up. The fox goes a clicketting; the deer goes to
                    rut. The fox barks; the stag bellows. The bil-liting (excrement) of the one is
                    termed the feument or feumishing of the other. The brush of the fox is the
                    single of the deer. The mask of the fox is the snout or nose of the deer. The
                    view, the foil, the tally-ho, and who-whoop, are common, I believe, to all; but
                    currant jelly and sweet sauce are not in the fox-hunter’s vocabulary.” “There
                    are some expressions here,” continues Nimrod, “which require farther explanation
                    than I am able to afford them; and it is almost presumptuous in me, without any
                    assistance at hand, to attempt giving an opinion on the subject. The word ‘
                    harbour,’ however, is one of common acceptation, and implies a place of refuge.
                    To unharbour a deer has long since been settled by Pliny: ‘ <hi rend="italic"
                    >Excutere feram cubili?</hi> The expression is clear, and falls smoothly on the
                    ear. Not so with ‘ taking soil :’ it savours of filth, and is only applicable,
                    in this sense, to a hog delighting, in the summer months, to wallow in mud or
                    dirty water, previously to going to his bed. To ‘ beat up and down’ is only
                    another way of expressing to run to and fro, and is found in Terence, in the
                    word <hi rend="italic">cursito.</hi> The deer being <hi rend="superscript">
                    t</hi> set up,’ can only be in allusion to his having his throat cut; for Cicero
                    speaks of a man being ‘ set up’ to have that pleasant operation performed :—‘ In
                    cervicibus <hi rend="italic">imponere</hi> dominum.’ The stag roused from his
                    lair has certainly a great superiority over unkennelling the fox. The latter is
                    tame and puny, whereas the former is bold and classical, and quite, in
                    association with the wildness of the forest, of which this animal is the
                    monarch. The lair is but another word for the den; as we read in Virgil’s
                    celebrated contrast of a town and country life, in which he so beautifully
                    describes the manly pursuits of the latter; and likewise in the hunting scene
                    with Dido and Aeneas. The word feument I never heard before, but conclude it is
                    derived from the Greek word <hi rend="italic">recrementum"</hi></p>
                <p>The following is Nimrod’s description of a full-headed deer. “A perfect head, I
                    find, consists of brow, bay, tray, and three on top of each horn; but some have
                    brow, bay, tray, and five,on each horn, though these are rare.”</p>
                <p>Of the powers of endurance of a deer before hounds, as also of his subtilty in
                    foiling them, the same writer thus speaks: “When we reflect on the powers of a
                    stag, and look at his qualities for speed, we cannot be surprised that, when not
                    overladen with flesh, or a ‘ heavy deer,’ as he is then called in Devonshire, he
                    should afford some extraordinary chases. The following well-authenticated facts
                    will speak to their powers of locomotion: ‘ When Sir Thomas Acland kept the
                    hounds, a farmer in the neighbourhood of Holnicoe House saw a stag one evening
                    in his fields, with a particular spot on his side. The next morning he met this
                    same stag running in great distress, with the hounds close at his haunches, and
                    he soon afterwards sank before them. On his asking Sir Thomas where he had found
                    him, he learnt that it was twenty-five miles, as the crow flies, from the place
                    where he was killed. He must therefore have travelled that distance in the
                    course of the previous night.’” Again, on the power of leaping, which we have
                    already noticed, and particularly in allusion to their wind, when otherwise much
                    distressed, we find the following remark: “On my return from hunting on the
                    preceding Tuesday’s hunting,” says Nimrod, “I was shown a leap, in Lord
                    Fortescue’s park, which a hind had taken last season before this pack, after a
                    long,run, and not ten minutes before she sank before them. What makes it more
                    extraordinary is, that, on being paunched, a calf was taken from her almost able
                    to stand. The fence was a stone wall, with a rail on the top of it, not to be
                    broken; and your readers may judge of its height from the following statement,
                    having had no other means of measuring it: My own height is five feet nine
                    inches; the horse I rode is fifteen hands two inches high; the top of the fence
                    was upwards of two feet above the crown of my hat; and it was up a steep bank
                    that she approached it. The stag we ran went up to this fence, but did not
                    attempt to leap it.”</p>
                <p>The natural history of the stag will be given in due course; and we now dismiss
                    the subject of stag-hunting with the remark that, although, from the adverse
                    circumstances attending it in a country like Great Britain, so generally free
                    from large tracts of woodlands, which the red deer delights in, and also so much
                    intersected with streams, real stag-hunting can never be again reckoned amongst
                    the popular diversions in England, a good substitute for it is found in the
                    turning out deer before fox-hounds in the neighbourhood of the metropolis, which
                    has the advantage of affording a certainty of something in the shape of a run,
                    and frequently very long ones, to persons whose time is precious, as well as the
                    opportunity of, in a great measure, selecting the country best suited to the
                    habits and propensities of the game. There are a number of stag-hunting
                    establishments in England, and there has been a royal establishment of this
                    nature throughout several successive reigns. In that of George III. stag-hunting
                    was in high repute<pb break="no" facs="nls:193648832"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0711-8832-0749"/> amongst the nobility and gentry forming the
                    court, as well as of others residing in its neighbourhood. Mr Beckford said
                    little about it, because he knew little: the reason he himself gives; but the
                    following expression in his book relating to it made a deep impression on
                    fox-hunters, who reluctantly acknowledge its truth. “Could a fox-hound,” says Mr
                    Beckford, “distinguish a hunted fox, as the deerhound does the deer that is
                    blown, fox-hunting would be complete.”</p>
                <p>The roe-buck has partaken of the same respite from the chase as the wild red
                    deer, although by the old laws of the forest he was not considered as venison
                    until hunted; and, according to Caesar, the Britons did not eat this animal at
                    all. The fact is, the roe-buck runs so short, after the first ring, that he is
                    said to hunt the hounds, instead of the hounds hunting him; an artifice by which
                    he hopes to elude his pursuers, as, of course, it must produce a confusion of
                    scents. Neither does his cunning end here. When closely pursued in a thick wood,
                    he will bound to one side of a path by a sudden spring, and, lying close down
                    upon his belly, permit the hounds to pass by him without offering to stir. But
                    the beauty of form and elegance of motion of the “favourite roe,” which Solomon
                    has made an emblem of connubial attachment, ought to protect it from the chase,
                    although they do not appear to have done so in the country in which Solomon
                    wrote, as he recommends to the man who has engaged to be surety for his
                    neighbour, to deliver himself “as a roe from the hand of the hunter, and as a
                    bird from the hand of the fowler.” There has been only one pack of roe-buck
                    hounds kept in Great Britain, and that was by a gentleman of the name of
                    Pley-dell, of Whatcombe House, near Blandford, Dorsetshire, lately deceased, in
                    whose covers these animals abounded, as they also do in various parts of
                    Scotland.</p>
                <p>Hunting the <hi rend="italic">otter</hi> was a sport much thought of in England,
                    and is of very early date, chiefly perhaps for the great value formerly set on
                    fresh-water fish, previously to that of the sea being so generally available
                    throughout the country as it has been within the last hundred years, and
                    continues to be still more so. The system of hunting the otter is this: The
                    sportsmen go on each side of the river, beating the banks and sedges with the
                    hounds. If there be an otter near, his “seal” (foot) is soon traced on the
                    shore; and, when found, he is attacked by the sportsmen with spears, when he
                    “vents,” that is, comes to the surface of the water to breathe. If he be not
                    soon found by the river side, it is conjectured he is gone to “couch” inland,
                    for he will occasionally go some distance from his river to feed. He is traced
                    by the foot, as the deer is; and when found, and wounded in the water, he makes
                    directly for the shore, where he maintains an obstinate defence. He bites most
                    severely, and does not readily quit his hold; on the contrary, if he seizes a
                    dog in the water, he will dive with him to the bottom of the river, and will
                    never yield to him whilst he has life. This sport is still pursued in the few
                    fenny and watery districts that now remain in England, and has for a long time
                    been confined principally to those parts where, from local circumstances, the
                    other more noble and exhilarating distinctions of the chase cannot be
                    conveniently enjoyed. An attempt, however, has been recently made to revive it,
                    by a celebrated Oxfordshire sportsman, Mr Peyton, only son of Sir Henry Peyton,
                    Bart., of which attempt we subjoin an account, extracted from the <hi
                    rend="italic">Oxford Journal.</hi> By this, two facts are established; the one,
                    that otter-hunting spiritedly pursued is not a tame diversion; and the other,
                    that the charge against this animal of destroying young lambs and poultry, is
                    not altogether unfounded.</p>
                <p>“We have great pleasure in informing our readers, that a novelty in the sporting
                    world, as far as relates to this county, has recently been introduced by that
                    ardent and indefatigable sportsman, Mr Henry Peyton, namely, a pack of those
                    rare animals, otter-hounds, with which he hunts the country in the neighbourhood
                    of Bicester; so that these midnight marauders and inveterate enemies of the
                    finny tribe, which are numerous in the Cherwell, and streams near Rousham and
                    North Aston, will not repose as heretofore in uninterrupted security. Mr Peyton
                    hunts the pack himself, assisted by a very powerful auxiliary in the person of
                    Viscount Chetwynd. These gentlemen start with their otter spears ere the day
                    breaks, and at half-past five in the morning they may be seen two or three times
                    a week wending their way on foot along the banks of the river, in pursuit of the
                    ‘ furry varmint.’ The pack has had some very excellent runs, one of which
                    continued a distance of twenty-five miles, having been found in the river
                    Cherwell, near to Flights Mill, and hunted through all the turnings of that
                    serpentine stream to his lodgings at Watereaton, where he took refuge amongst
                    the old willows, and succeeded in baffling his pursuers; subsequently to which a
                    capital day’s sport was afforded at North Aston. The hounds found near the mill,
                    and went away in the direction of Nell Bridge; but twisting into the Adderbury
                    Brook, after a chase of about eight miles, he was come up with, when some hard
                    fighting occurred, in which a small terrier, bred by Mr Peyton, greatly
                    signalized himself, being much punished, as indeed were all the hounds, from the
                    determined ferocity of the otter, which was ultimately speared by Mr Peyton. It
                    turned out to be a fine bitch otter, weighing upwards of twenty pounds, and,
                    from the appearance of the dugs, it was conjectured that some of her family were
                    in the vicinity, and consequently the hounds were again laid on, and finally
                    succeeded in killing four fine cubs, weighing on the average eleven pounds each.
                    The farmers of the neighbourhood who were up at the death were quite overjoyed,
                    and nothing would satisfy them but the immediate cutting up of one of the cubs ‘
                    à la reynard, ’ and a distribution of the pads, head, and body, amongst them. It
                    is said that these amphibious fish-merchants, when suffering hunger by reason of
                    a scarcity of fish, will boldly in the season carry away young lambs; so that
                    the farmers, independently of their stream being pilfered of fish, often sustain
                    a more substantial injury, and therefore are much gratified at the opportunity
                    now afforded of in some degree thinning the numbers of these voracious
                    gluttons.”</p>
                <p>The otter-hound is not a distinct kind of hound, the strong rough-haired harrier
                    answering the purpose best, provided he will hunt a low scent, as the game shows
                    no small sagacity, as well as circumspection, in guarding against assault from
                    man or dog. In 1796, on the river Worse, near Bridgenorth, Shropshire, four
                    otters were killed, one of which stood three, another four hours before the
                    hounds; and in 1804 the otter-hounds of Mr Coleman of Leominster, Herefordshire,
                    killed an otter in a mill pond, which is said to have weighed thirty-four pounds
                    and a half; supposed to have been eight years old, and to have consumed a ton of
                    fish or flesh annually, for the last five years. It will be observed, in the
                    list of hounds, there are three more packs kept in England for the purpose of
                    hunting the otter.</p>
                <p>Hare-hunting claims precedence of fox-hunting in the sporting chronology of Great
                    Britain, and we believe of all other countries, inasmuch as a hare has always
                    been esteemed excellent eating, and a fox the rankest of carrion. We gather from
                    Xenophon that it was practised before his day, and he wrote fully upon it above
                    three centuries before Christ, both hounds and nets being then used in the
                    pursuit. Neither can we marvel at hare-hunting being the favourite diversion in
                    all nations given to sporting where the use of the horse in the field had not
                    become common. But we will go a point farther than this, and assert, that <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193648845" xml:id="kp-eb0711-8845-0750"/> how inferior
                    soever may be the estimation in which hunting the hare is held in comparison
                    with hunting the fox, no animal of the chase affords so much true hunting as she
                    does, which was the opinion of the renowned Mr Beckford.</p>
                <p>In our description of the modern harrier (see article <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Hound),</hi> we have termed him the fox-hound in miniature; and we may apply
                    the simile to hare-hunting, which now, as long as the chase lasts, greatly
                    resembles fox-hunting, only on a minor scale. In the modern system, there is no
                    tracking to the seat with the one, any more than dragging up to the kennel with
                    the other; but both animals are now chiefly stumbled upon by accident, and
                    instantly fly for their lives. With the system of hunting also has the kind of
                    hound been altered; there being now no longer occasion for that nice distinction
                    of scent which was wanting to be a match for the windings and doublings a hare
                    was able to make in her course when hunted by the slow and fastidious southern
                    hound, and which was essential to the finding her at all, in countries where
                    hares were scarce, by the perplexing means of a very cold trail. In fact, we do
                    not think we can better elucidate the gradual but great change that has taken
                    place in this highly popular and ancient British diversion, than by the
                    following extracts from a very old work upon sporting called the <hi
                    rend="italic">Gentleman’s Recreation,</hi> published nearly two centuries
                    back.</p>
                <p>“Your large, tall, and big hounds,” says the author, “called and known by the
                    name of the deep-mouthed or southern-mouthed hounds, are heavy and slow, and fit
                    for woodlands and hilly countreys; they are of deep mouths, and swift spenders;
                    they are generally higher behind than before, with thick and short legs, and are
                    generally great of body and head, and are most proper for such as delight to
                    follow them on foot, as <hi rend="italic">stop-hunting,</hi> as some call it;
                    but by most it is termed ‘ hunting under the pole that is, they are brought to
                    that exactness of command, that, in their hottest scent and fullest chase, if
                    one but step before them, or hollow, or but hold up or throw before them the
                    hunting pole, they will stop at an instant, and hunt in full cry after you at
                    your own pace, until you give them encouragement by the word of command; which
                    much adds to the length of the sport and pleasure of the hunters, so that a
                    course oft-times lasts five or six hours.</p>
                <p>“Opposite to the deep-mouthed or southern hound are the long and slender hounds
                    called the fleet or northern hound, which are very swift, as not being of so
                    heavy a body, nor hath such large ears: these will exercise your horses, and try
                    their strength; they are proper for open, level, and champain countreys, where
                    they may run in view and full speed; for they hunt more by the eye than the
                    nose, and will run down the game in an hour, and sometimes in less; that is, <hi
                    rend="italic">a hare</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> but the fox will exercise them
                    better and longer.</p>
                <p>“Between these two extremes there are a middle sort of dogs, which partake of
                    both their qualities, as to strength and swiftness, in a reasonable proportion;
                    they are generally bred by crossing the strains, and are excellent in such
                    countreys as are mixt, viz. some mountains, some enclosures, some plains, and
                    some wood-lands; for they will run through thick and thin, neither need you help
                    them over hedges, as you are often forced to do by others.</p>
                <p>“A true right-shaped deep-mouthed hound should have a round thick head, wide
                    nostrils, open and rising upwards, his ears large and thin, hanging lower than
                    his chaps; the flews of his upper lips should be longer than those of his nether
                    chaps; the chine of his back great and thick, strait and strong, and rather
                    bending out than inclining in; his thighs well trussed; his haunches large; his
                    fillets round and large; his tail or stern strong set on, waxing taperwise
                    towards the top; his hair under his belly rough and long; his legs large and
                    lean; his feet dry and hard, with strong claws and high knuckles. In the whole,
                    he ought to be of so justa symmetry, that when he stands level you may not
                    discern which is highest, his fore or hinder parts.</p>
                <p>“For the northern or fleet hound, his head and nose ought to be slenderer and
                    longer, his back broad, his belly gaunt, his joynts long, and his ears thicker
                    and shorter; in a word, he is in all parts slighter made, and framed after the
                    mould of a greyhound.</p>
                <p>“By crossing these breeds as aforesaid, you may bring your kenel to such a
                    composure as you think fit, every man’s fancy being to be preferred; and you
                    know the old saying,</p>
                <p>‘ So many men, so many minds, So many hounds, so many kinds.’”</p>
                <p>In proof of our assertion, that there is more of true hunting with harriers than
                    with any other description of hounds, we shall point out a few of the
                    difficulties which they have to overcome. In the first place, a hare, when
                    found, generally describes a circle in her course, which is in itself not only
                    more difficult to follow, but it naturally brings her upon her foil, which is
                    the greatest trial for hounds. Secondly, the scent of the hare is weaker than
                    that of any other animal we hunt; and, unlike some, it is always the worse the
                    nearer she is to her end; which accounts for its being better, and lasting
                    longer, when going to her seat, than when running. There is scarcely any scent
                    from a hare until she is in motion; therefore hounds constantly draw over her;
                    and, of course, according to the length of time she has been gone to her seat
                    after feeding, will be the difficulty of hunting her by the trail. In fact, at
                    the most distant part of her previous night or morning’s walk, the most
                    tender-nosed hound in a pack will be scarcely able to own the scent at all. But
                    the grand puzzler of all is, when hounds get upon the counter trail, about the
                    middle of a hare’s work, and the scent lies so equal that it is most difficult
                    to distinguish heel from chase. No such difficulty as this can occur in any
                    other description of hunting, and can only be obviated by the skill and
                    experience of the huntsman in his notice of the working of his hounds. But
                    although this difficulty is alluded to by almost all writers on the chase, we
                    know not where to look for directions to the huntsman at the critical moment. It
                    is true, Mr Daniel, in his <hi rend="italic">Rural Sports,</hi> says, “To find
                    out this, see if your hounds challenge counter; if they double, and carry it on
                    counter, they will soon signify their error by opening singly.” We conceive
                    there is some reason in this remark, but it will not always avail. Hounds,
                    harriers in particular, are fond of a scent; and if they cannot carry it
                    forward, they will turn and hunt it heel; and here it is that the judgment of a
                    huntsman turns to account. One with a keen eye, and <hi rend="italic">a perfect
                    knowledge of his hounds,</hi> may be able to unravel this mystery perhaps six
                    times out of ten; but it is in no man s power to be sure of doing it. His chief
                    guide is in the cry of his pack at this time, which will slacken instead of
                    getting fuller if the scent be heel, as the experience of old hounds adds to
                    their natural instinct the faculty of judging whether it is leading them to
                    their prey or from it.</p>
                <p>The great perfection of modern harriers is the head they carry over a country,
                    the result of the pains now taken in breeding them of the same size and
                    character; whereas, upon the old system, which was all for <hi rend="italic">the
                    pot,</hi> the chief dependence was upon a few couples out of the whole pack, the
                    rest being wheresoever they liked or were able to be in the chase. On the other
                    hand, it may be said modern harriers have not the nose and patience of the old
                    sort, which perhaps they have not; but what they may lose in those respects,
                    they more than gain in another, viz. by being nearer to their game in chase,
                    and, <pb break="no" facs="nls:193648858" xml:id="kp-eb0711-8858-0751"/>by
                    pressing her, not allowing her to make more than half the work she was able to
                    do when pursued by slow hounds. In fact, the want of speed, and tedious
                    exactness, of the southern hound, rendered the warmest scent, after a short
                    time, cold; which may be proved from the fact of an hour being the average time
                    of killing a hare, in former days, with a good scent, and from three to four
                    with what is called a “fair," a “holding,” or a “half scent.” For our own part,
                    speaking as fox-hunters, yet abandoning all prejudices against a sport it is too
                    much the fashion to hold cheap, we consider that, to any man who is a real lover
                    of <hi rend="italic">hunting,</hi> that is, of seeing hounds do their work, and
                    do that work well, a twenty minutes burst over a good country, with a well-bred
                    pack of harriers of the <hi rend="italic">present</hi> stamp and fashion,
                    affords a high treat. To see them to advantage, however, it should be over a
                    country in which the fields are large, and the fences stone walls, like those of
                    Oxfordshire or Gloucestershire; for harriers, being for the most part obliged to
                    meuse, strong hedges prevent their carrying a head in chase, which is the chief
                    beauty in all hunting.</p>
                <p>Somerville has these appropriate lines On the adaptation of hounds to their game
                    :—</p>
                <p>“A different hound for every chase</p>
                <p>Select with judgment; nor the timorous hare O’er matched, destroy; but leave that
                    vile offence To the mean, murderous, coursing crew, intent on blood and
                    spoil.”</p>
                <p>Harriers should not be too large, certainly not more than eighteen inches high,
                    or, by their speed, and, if good withal, they will much overmatch their game;
                    but in a good and open country there should never be less than from eighteen to
                    twenty couples in the field. A strong pack not only adds to the respectability
                    of the thing (at all events, a small one greatly detracts from it), but, in our
                    opinion, more hounds are wanting to pursue an animal that runs short, than one
                    which, like the fox, generally makes for a distant point. The opinion of Mr
                    Beckford is in opposition to us here. He says, “the fewer hounds you have, the
                    less you foil the ground, which you will find a great hindrance to your hunting
                    but it must here be remarked, that in the preceding sentence, this eminent
                    sportsman speaks of the difficulty of getting a strong pack of harriers to run
                    well together; a difficulty which no doubt existed in his day, but is totally
                    overcome in the best hare-hunting establishments of ours. Indeed, we once heard
                    a sportsman declare, and he was a sportsman who had hunted in all the best
                    countries in England, that he had never seen a chase quite complete from end to
                    end, not a single hound being out of place, until he saw it with a pack of
                    harriers over the Cotswold Hills.</p>
                <p>The following passage from Beckford is worthy of his pen, and should be strictly
                    observed by all masters of harriers :—“Harriers, to be good, must be kept to
                    their own game. If you run fox with them, you spoil them. Hounds cannot be
                    perfect unless used to one scent and to one style of hunting. Harriers run fox
                    in so different a style from hare, that it is of great disservice to them when
                    they return to hare again. It makes them wild, and teaches them to skirt. The
                    high scent which a fox leaves, the straightness of his running, the eagerness of
                    the pursuit, and the noise that generally accompanies it, all contribute to
                    spoil a harrier.” We conclude that the writer here alludes to hunting wild
                    foxes, which is now very rarely done with a pack of harriers, at least in a
                    country near to which foxhounds are kept. No master of harriers would do it, who
                    wishes his pack to be perfect; and there are other reasons for his not doing it,
                    which it is unnecessary to mention. But the very best understanding now
                    generally exists between masters of fox-hounds and masters of harriers; and it
                    is a common practice of such of the latter as reside in a fox-hunting district,
                    to await the publishing of the foxhunting fixtures before they make their
                    own.</p>
                <p>The following hints may be useful in hunting the hare. First, respecting the hare
                    herself; hares breed from February to the end of harvest, and are said to live
                    seven years. The buck affords the best sport, particularly <hi rend="italic">in
                    the spring,</hi> when, after one or two rings, he often goes straight on end for
                    several miles. Hence the proverb, “as wild as a March hare.” Some persons
                    pretend to distinguish the sex upon the seat; at all events, the head of the
                    buck is shorter, the shoulders redder, and the ears redder, than those of a doe;
                    he is also larger, and his hind parts are of a lighter colour. If the claws are
                    smooth and sharp, and the ears tear easily, the hare is young.</p>
                <p>The difficulty of finding a hare by the eye is well known. It is an art greatly
                    facilitated by experience, although not one person in ten who attempts it
                    succeeds in it. But here we recognize the Hand that furnished her with such
                    means for her security; as, from the delicacy of her flesh, she is the prey of
                    every carnivorous animal, and her means of defence are confined only to her
                    flight. In going to her form, she consults the weather, especially the wind,
                    lying always, when she can, with her head to face it. After harvest, hares are
                    found in all situations; in stubble fields, hedgerows, woods, and brakes; but
                    when the leaves fall, they prefer lying upon open ground, and particularly on a
                    stale fallow, that is, one which has been some time ploughed; as likewise after
                    frost, and towards the spring of the year. In furze, or gorse, they lie so close
                    as to allow themselves nearly to be trodden upon, rather than quit their form.
                    The down or upland-bred hare shows best sport; that bred in a wet, marshy
                    district, the worst, although the scent from the latter may be the stronger. If
                    a hare, when not viewed away, runs slowly at first, it is generally a sign that
                    she is an old one, and likely to afford sport; but hares never run so well as
                    when they do not know where they are. Thus, trapped hares, turned out before
                    hounds, almost invariably run straight on end, and generally till they can run
                    no longer; and they generally go straight in a fog.</p>
                <p>The chase of the hare has been altered, and rendered less difficult in some
                    degree, by the improvement of the hound used in it. In the first place, she is
                    now so pressed by the pace at which she is hunted, that she has not time, when
                    first started, to visit the works of the preceding night; nor is she, from the
                    same cause, so likely to run her foil. But when making out her foil, hounds are
                    now not let to puzzle over it as formerly, but, if it be not quickly done, are
                    rated forward by a whipper-in, to make good the head; and if that do not
                    succeed, to make it good round the fences. Formerly, when hounds were at fault,
                    the cast was made in a small circle to begin with, and then their huntsman tried
                    wide; whereas they now generally, and especially if the game is supposed to be
                    not far before them, make a wide cast at first, and then contract the circle if
                    the wide cast fails. There is reason in this; for if the hare is on, the wide
                    cast will cross her; and if she is not, she has most likely squatted. The old
                    system was, “avoid a view, if possible.” The modern one rather encourages a
                    view, but no holloaing; for as hares regulate their speed in great measure by
                    the cry of hounds, they are less apt to have recourse to shifts when the cry
                    bursts upon them at once. In fact, to suit the taste of the day, which is to
                    have every thing that moves, fast, it was necessary that the greater part of the
                    system of hunting the hare should be changed. It used to be insisted upon, that
                    harriers should never be lifted as long as they can possibly carry a scent;
                    and,Beckford says, “a hare is not fairly hunted unless the pack be left almost
                    entirely to themselves; that they should follow her every step she takes, as
                    well over greasy fallows as through large flocks of sheep; nor should they be
                    cast, but when nothing can <pb break="no" facs="nls:193648871"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0711-8871-0752"/>be done without it.” This may have been all very
                    well when gentlemen followed hounds on foot, or were content to be some hours
                    killing one hare; or for Mr Beckford himself, who (although he admits having
                    bred an infinity of harriers before he could get a pack to please him) thought
                    hare-hunting should be taken as a ride after breakfast, to get an appetite to
                    dinner.</p>
                <p>But we have reason to believe, if a master of harriers of the present day wished
                    to show his pack to advantage, and could have a choice of a run to display them,
                    he would say, “Give me twenty-five minutes <hi rend="italic">in all</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">;</hi> the first fifteen a severe burst; then a fault, well hit
                    off; and the remaining ten without a turn.” But, it may be asked, wherefore the
                    fault? We reply, because, although the speed of well-bred harriers, for a
                    certain time, if not quite equal to that of fox-hounds, is too much for most
                    hares, as well as for most horses that follow them, yet, after that certain
                    time, say fifteen minutes, wind and power begin to fail, and a short check is
                    useful. Besides, the ability of a pack, in quickly recovering a fault, is more
                    than a counterbalance to their coming to a fault at all, which, with a
                    short-running animal, as the hare is, it is often difficult to avoid, nay,
                    rather to be looked for indeed in every field.</p>
                <p>The difference in the terms used in hare-hunting and fox-hunting is comprised in
                    a few words :—Harriers are cast off, in the morning; fox-hounds throw off. The
                    hare is found by the quest or trail; the fox by the drag. The hare is on her
                    form or seat; the fox in his kennel. The young hare is a leveret; a fox a year
                    old is a cub. The view holloa of the hare is, “Gone away ;” of a fox, “Tallyho.”
                    The hare doubles in chase; the fox heads back, or is headed. The harrier is at
                    fault; the fox-hound at check. The hare is pricked by the foot; the fox is
                    balled or padded. The hare squats; the fox lies down, stops, or hangs in cover;
                    the “who-whoop” signifies the death of each.</p>
                <p>Our ideas of a complete pack of fox-hounds are very soon expressed. For four
                    days’ hunting in the week there should be not much less than sixty couples of
                    working hounds; nor do we think more are necessary, as hounds, like horses, are
                    always better and sounder when in regular work. For three days in the week,
                    forty couples are enough. They should have at their head not only a huntsman,
                    but also a master, each of whom knows his business, and one <hi rend="italic"
                    >clever</hi> whipper-in, and another as clever as you can get him. It is not
                    necessary, because it is not feasible, that they should all be good drawers of
                    covers; but it is absolutely necessary to perfection that they should all get to
                    work as soon as a fox is found, and prove themselves true on the line their game
                    has gone. As to their being quite free from riot on all days, and on all
                    occasions, the man is not yet born wΛo <hi rend="italic">can say with
                    truth,</hi> “my hounds <hi rend="italic">never</hi> run riot.” Nature is seldom
                    extinguished; and as Aesop’s damsel, turned to a woman from a cat, behaved
                    herself very well till the mouse appeared, so will hounds occasionally break
                    away upon riot, particularly when out of sight of the servants, in large covers,
                    or when disappointed by a long blank draw. We conceive a pack of fox-hounds
                    entitled to be called “steady from riot,” if they will bear being put to the
                    following test :—If, when at fault for their fox, in the middle of a large
                    field, a hare gets up in view, and not a hound stirs, nor attempts to break away
                    after her; and this without a word being said to caution them. But it is in
                    chase, with only a holding scent, that a pack of fox-hounds display their
                    excellence. In such a case as this there must be checks; and it being ten to one
                    against their fox running straight, because they cannot press him, now is the
                    time to see them work. Do they carry a good head when the scent is a-head and
                    serves them well? Are they cautious when it does not? And do they turn short
                    when the game has turned right or left, or is gone back? Are they careful not to
                    overrun the scent, and will they stand pressing to a certain degree by the
                    horsemen? But having overrun it, do they stop directly, and make their own cast?
                    Should that fail, do they come quickly to horn or holloa—to their huntsman’s
                    cast? Do they fling for a scent when their huntsman lifts them to points, and
                    not attempt to <hi rend="italic">flash,</hi> or break away, without a scent?
                    When the scent serves well, do they not only carry a good head over a country,
                    but, as their game is sinking, does the head become better? If they do all this,
                    and have speed and stoutness withal, they are equal to any fox in any country,
                    and are worth a thousand sovereigns to a sportsman.</p>
                <p>The number of fox-hounds taken into the field depends chiefly upon country; more
                    being required in that which is woodland, than for an open champaign, or for our
                    enclosed grass districts, such as Leicestershire. Eighteen couples are generally
                    considered as sufficient for the latter; and the strongest woodlands do not
                    require more than from twenty-two to twenty-five couples; and we consider the
                    latter the more common number, in the field, of any pack in any country;</p>
                <p>The average speed of fox-hounds is estimated at ten miles, point blank, over a
                    country, with a good scent, in one hour; that is to say, making allowance for
                    deviations from the straight line, hounds seldom go more than ten miles, from
                    point to point, in that space of time. Mr Beckford has a very judicious remark
                    on this part of his subject. “That pack,” he writes, “may be said to go the
                    fastest that can run ten miles the soonest, notwithstanding the <hi
                    rend="superscript"> -</hi> hounds separately may not run so fast as many others.
                    A pack of hounds, considered in a collective body, go fast in proportion to the
                    excellence of their noses and the head they carry; as that traveller gets
                    soonest to his journey’s end who stops least upon the road. Some hounds that I
                    have hunted with would creep all through the same hole, though they might have
                    leaped the hedge; and would follow one another in a string, as true as a team of
                    cart-horses. I had rather see them, like the horses of the sun, <hi
                    rend="italic">all abreast.”</hi></p>
                <p>There is nothing in the history of our domestic sports and pastimes to inform us
                    correctly as to the date of the first regularly-established pack of fox-hounds
                    kept in England. Neither the holy prioress of St Alban’s, Dame Juliana Bannes,
                    Markham, nor any of the very old writers on such subjects, are able to satisfy
                    us on this point; but, on the authority of the Rev. William Chafiu, in his <hi
                    rend="italic">Anecdotes respecting Cranbourn Chase,</hi> the first real steady
                    pack of fox-hounds established in the western part of England was by Thomas
                    Fownes, Esq. of Stepleton, in Dorsetshire, about the year 1730. “They were,”
                    says the author, who wrote in 1818, “as handsome, and fullyas complete in every
                    respect, as the most celebrated packs of the present day. The owner, meeting
                    with some worldly disappointments, was obliged to dispose of them; and they were
                    sold to Mr Bowes, in Yorkshire, the father of the late Lady Strathmore, at an
                    immense price for those days. They were taken into Yorkshire by their own
                    attendants, and, after having been viewed and much admired in their kennel, a
                    day was fixed for making trial of them in the field, to meet at a famous
                    hare-cover near. When the huntsman came with his hounds in the morning, he
                    discovered a great number of sportsmen, who were riding in the cover, and
                    whipping the furzes as for a hare; he therefore halted, and informed Mr Bowes
                    that he was unwilling to throw off his hounds until the gentlemen had retired,
                    and ceased the slapping of whips, to which his hounds were not accustomed, and
                    he would engage to find a fox in a few minutes, if there was one there. The
                    gentlemen sportsmen having obeyed the orders given by Mr Bowes, the huntsman,
                    taking the wind of the cover, threw off h⅛ hounds, which immediately began to
                    feather, and soon got upon a <pb break="no" facs="nls:193648884"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0711-8884-0753"/>drag into the cover, and up to the fox’s kennel,
                    which went off close before them, and, after a severe burst over a fine country,
                    was killed, to the great satisfaction of the whole party. They then returned to
                    the same cover, not one half of it having been drawn, and very soon found a
                    second fox, exactly in the same manner as before, which broke cover immediately
                    over the same fine country; but the chase was much longer; and, in course of it,
                    the fox made its way into a nobleman’s park, I believe Lord Darlington’s, which
                    was full of all sorts of riot, and it had been customary to stop the hounds
                    before they could enter it, which the best-mounted sportsmen attempted to do,
                    but in vain; the hounds topped the highest fences, ran through herds of deer and
                    a number of hares, without taking the least notice of them; ran in to their fox,
                    and killed him some miles beyond the park; and it was the unanimous opinion of
                    the whole hunt that it was the finest run ever known in that country. An ample
                    collection of fieldmoney was made for the huntsman, much beyond his expectation;
                    and he returned to Stepleton in better spirits than he left it, and told his
                    story as above related, in which we must allow for some little exaggeration,
                    very natural on such an occasion. This pack was probably the progenitors of the
                    very fine ones now in the north. Before this pack was raised in Dorsetshire, the
                    hounds which hunted in the chase hunted all the animals promiscuously, except
                    the deer, from which they were necessarily made steady, otherwise they would not
                    have been suffered to hunt at all in it.” We have good reason to believe Lord
                    Yarborough’s fox-hounds, at Brocklesby Hall, Lincolnshire, were established as
                    far back as the year 1700. The present huntsman and his late father hunted them
                    more than fifty years.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">The Fox.</hi></p>
                <p>The fox makes a conspicuous figure in the natural history of animals; still, in
                    some respects, his character has been over-rated and exaggerated. He is a native
                    of all temperate regions; and although we read of the cur, the greyhound, and
                    the mastiff fox, we consider a fox as a fox, the difference in size, colour,
                    &amp;c. being dependent on either climate or food. It is true, they are larger
                    in some particular parts of England than in others; and it is generally
                    believed, that such as are what sportsmen call “stub-bred foxes,” that is, bred
                    above, and not below ground, are the largest. It is in*this sole instance that
                    the habits of the fox differ from those of the wolf, to whose genus he belongs;
                    the she wolf never bringing forth her young, as the fox does, under ground. But
                    although the general conformation of the fox is the same as that of the wolf,
                    his external form has a greater resemblance to the dog, with whose character
                    also he closely assimilates, when domesticated, in expressions of affection, of
                    anger, or of fear. When minutely examined, and particularly in relation to his
                    predatory life, and, consequently, the dangers to which he is exposed, he will
                    be found to be abundantly endowed by nature with the instinctive faculties
                    requisite for such a life, in addition to the most elegant form an animal of his
                    size is capable of. Foxes copulate in the winter months, and of course bring
                    forth in the spring, on an average perhaps half a dozen cubs at a litter, born
                    blind like the dog; but the period of each depends on the mildness or severity
                    of the winter. Excepting during the season of sexual desire, the fox is a
                    solitary, not a gregarious animal, for the most part passing the day in sleep,
                    and the night in prowling after food.</p>
                <p>The food of the fox is extremely variable; indeed, very few things that have or
                    have had life come amiss to him: but we have reason to believe that rabbits,
                    hares, poultry, partridges, and pheasants, with their eggs, are his favourite
                    repasts; and when these are not to be had, he contents himself with field-mice,
                    black-beetles, snails, and frogs. That he can even exist solely on the latter,
                    was proved a few years ago, by the circumstance of a fox-hound and a fox having
                    been found at the bottom of a dry well, into which they had fallen; the hound
                    had perished from hunger, but the fox had supported his life on frogs. Of those
                    animals and birds which we call game they are without doubt destroyers—of
                    pheasants, it is asserted, twenty-five per cent.; but how it happens that they
                    have been charged with feeding on grapes, we are, as far as our own experience
                    directs us, quite at a loss to determine. The fact, however, is stated by
                    several accredited writers, and has given birth to the fable of the fox and the
                    grapes, the moral of which is a severe rebuke to an envious person who “hates
                    the excellence he cannot reach.” Aristophanes, in his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Equites,</hi> compares soldiers devastating a country to foxes destroying a
                    vineyard; and Galen <hi rend="italic">(De Aliment.</hi> lib. iii. c. 2) tells
                    us, that hunters ate the flesh of foxes in autumn, because they were grown fat
                    with feeding on grapes. There are also two lines in Theocritus <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Idyl.</hi> E. V. 112) which admit of the following version :—</p>
                <p>I hate those brush-tailed foxes, that each night Spoil Mico’s vineyards with
                    their deadly bite.</p>
                <p>He is likewise accused of eating human flesh, and, we have reason to believe,
                    accused justly. In addition to the sentence pronounced by David, in the
                    sixty-third psalm, that the enemies of God and himself should be “a portion for
                    foxes,” we have the following interesting historical anecdote. When the famous
                    Messenian general Aristomenes was thrown into the Ceadas (a deep chasm into
                    which criminals were hurled) by the Lacedaemonians, his life is said to have
                    been preserved by following a fox that was feeding on a dead body, to the
                    aperture at which he had entered, and through which, after enlarging it with his
                    hands, he himself escaped.</p>
                <p>But although the subtilty of the fox has been proverbial from the earliest times;
                    so much so, that our Saviour himself called the tetrarch Herod “a ŕòx,” by way
                    of signifying the refinement of his policy; we do not perceive that, with the
                    exception of a timid prudence on breaking cover, he shows more sagacity in his
                    endeavours to baffle his pursuers than the hare is known to do, if indeed so
                    much. To “catch a weasel asleep,” is a typical designation of an impossibility;
                    but foxes are frequently surprised in their naps by hounds drawing upon them, up
                    wind, particularly when gorged with food. In the faculty of natural instinct,
                    however, they are vastly superior to hares, and equal in this respect to the
                    dog; there being well-attested instances of their being sent, <hi rend="italic"
                    >marked,</hi> upwards of fifty miles in a bag, and, having escaped being killed
                    by hounds before which they were turned out, being retaken in their native
                    woods. But it is in his last moments, when seized by hounds, that the
                    superiority of ’character in the fox over the hare exhibits itself. He dies in
                    silence; but he sells his life dearly; for, revengefully seizing upon the first
                    hound that approaches him, he only relinquishes his hold with the last gasp.</p>
                <p>When first the fox was hunted in Great Britain, he was considered merely as a
                    beast of prey, and killed in any way in which he could be got at, generally by
                    being caught in nets and pitfalls, or killed at earth by terriers; his scent not
                    being considered ŕàvourable to hounds by our forefathers. Although they admitted
                    it to be hotter at hand than that of the hare, their ŕàvourite object of
                    pursuit, they believed it to be sooner dissipated; but perhaps the real cause of
                    their objection was, in the general inequality of speed and endurance in the
                    hounds of their days and a really wild fox; and ŕbxes then were undoubtedly
                    stouter, and able to run much greater distances from point to point, than they

                    their food, as well as being often over-fed. These animals, then, being always
                    destroyed when an opportunity offered, were of course generally scarce; which,
                    added to the great extent of woods and other fastnesses with which England then
                    abounded, accounts for the fact of hunting the fox, unless as a beast of prey,
                    not being in vogue until these objections were removed. But the fox was ever
                    considered as a mischievous animal, and, in one signal instance, is said to have
                    been made an engine of mischief to a vast extent, in carrying fire and flame
                    into the standing corn of the rebellious Philistines. A solution of this
                    account, however, on natural principles, being difficult, it is pretty generally
                    admitted that a mistake in the translation has given rise to it.</p>
                <p>As the preservation of the fox is now more an object in Great Britain than his
                    destruction, it may not be amiss to observe, that a few links of an iron chain,
                    such as an old plough-trace, or a small piece of red cloth, suspended near to
                    the spot on which a hen-pheasant sits, is a certain protection from foxes, of
                    herself, her eggs, or her brood.</p>
                <p>It is asserted by sportsmen of experience, that the scent of foxes varies with
                    the animal; and that a vixen fox which has laid up (brought forth) her cubs is
                    nearly devoid of scent.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Huntsman.</hi></p>
                <p>In the lower ranks of life there are callings which require the exercise of skill
                    and judgment to the very utmost of their extent; and we know of none that comes
                    more directly within this class than that of a huntsman does, of whom it may be
                    said, that in all his operations he has not only to exercise his mental
                    faculties at every step he goes, when unravelling the intricacies of the chase,
                    but actually to tread a path nearly unknown to human reason. <hi rend="italic"
                    >Fimus oratores, nascimur</hi><hi rend="italic">poetae,</hi> is a good
                    definition of the constitutional qualifications of a first-rate poet, at all
                    events of the difficulty of becoming one; and really when those of a huntsman
                    are all summed up, if the life of man be not too short, years of toilsome labour
                    appear to be scarcely sufficient to evince, even to a man of talent, a perfect
                    knowledge of his art. Let us first hear what Beckford says of him, and then we
                    will offer our own sentiments on the subject, which vary little from those
                    entertained by this great authority on all matters of the chase. “A good
                    huntsman,” says he, “should be young, strong, and active, bold and enterprising;
                    fond of the diversion, and indefatigable in the pursuit of it; he should be
                    sensible and good tempered; he ought also to be sober; he should be exact,
                    civil, and cleanly; he should be a good horseman, and a good groom; his voice
                    should be strong and clear; and he should have an eye so quick as to perceive
                    which of his hounds carries the scent, when all are running; and should have so
                    excellent an ear, as always to distinguish the foremost hounds when he does not
                    see them.· He should be quiet, patient, and without conceit. He should let his
                    hounds alone <hi rend="italic">when they can hunt,</hi> and he should have
                    genius to assist them <hi rend="italic">when they cannot”</hi> It is scarcely
                    necessary to observe, that Mr Beckíòrd is here speaking of a huntsman to
                    fox-hounds, his demands on the harehunter being somewhat more moderate; and yet
                    the difficulties he has to combat with are more than obscurely acknowledged.
                    Aware that practice is the key to excellence in every art, and that experience
                    is the great mistress of all human knowledge, he requires age, with its
                    experience, to fit the hare-huntsman for his office, and to be a match for the
                    wiles of the hare; very ludicrously adding, that, “for patience, he should be a
                    very Grizzle.”</p>
                <p>M e do not think we exaggerate when we say, that the picture here drawn of a
                    clever huntsman may, in one degree (of bodily endowments at least), be termed a
                    near approach to human perfection; nor do we hesitate in adding our conviction,
                    that if to the attributes here given him are joined a comprehensive mind and a
                    humane heart, nothing is wanting to make it complete. As the chase is said to be
                    the image of war, “but without its guilt,” let us suppose Mr Beckford had been
                    drawing the character of a soldier, and not a huntsman. Could he have given him
                    higher qualifications than a clear head, nice observation, a good constitution,
                    undaunted courage, a powerful voice, an accurate ear, and a lynx’s eye, together
                    with a quick perception, endowed with quick impulses for acting, so necessary to
                    each? That he should be “fond of his profession,” and “indefatigable in the
                    pursuit of it “sober and exact,” “sensible,” and “good tempered ?” It is not
                    necessary that either a huntsman or a soldier should be a man of letters; some
                    of the best among the former have been scarcely able to read; and there have
                    been but few Caesars who could fight and write; but a good understanding is put
                    to the test by both the one and the other; and although we do not mean to place
                    the servile situation of a huntsman on a level with the honourable profession of
                    the soldier, each requires, in a high degree, a good, sound understanding, and a
                    manly exertion of talent.</p>
                <p>But the office of huntsman to fox-hounds is not always intrusted to servile
                    hands. It has long been the ambition of masters of packs to hunt their own
                    hounds; and although the fashion has become more prevalent within the last
                    thirty years than it was in the earlier days of foxhunting, yet we could bring
                    forward some instances of what are called gentlemen-huntsmen of pretty long
                    standing. His Grace the Duke of Cleveland, and Sir Richard Puleston, Bart, each
                    hunted his own hounds for nearly forty years; and the late William Leche, Esq.
                    of Carden-Hall, Cheshire, was his own huntsman for an equally long period.
                    Coming next to them in chronological order, stand Messrs Ralf Lambton, Musters,
                    Thomas Assheton Smith, Lord Segrave, Sir Bellingham Graham, Bart., Mr
                    Osbaldeston, Mr Nicol, the Earl of Kintore, Mr Smith, late of the Craven, the
                    Honourable Grantley Berkeley, and several more of a more recent date. There can
                    be no doubt that no man enjoys hunting to perfection equally with him who hunts
                    his own hounds; nor can there be any reason assigned why an educated gentleman
                    should not excel, in any ardent and highly scientific pursuit, an uneducated
                    servant; nevertheless, we do not think that, throughout the fox-hunting world in
                    general, gentlemen-huntsmen have been so popular as might have been expected;
                    and in some countries that are hunted by subscription, an exception is taken
                    against the master of the pack being the huntsman. That it is a very laborious
                    office when efficiently executed, both in the kennel and the field, is well
                    known to those who have filled it; but, <hi rend="italic">labor ipse</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">voluptas,</hi> we have seen a pains-taking zeal displayed in the
                    master which we have too often seen wanting in the servant; and we could name a
                    nobleman who used frequently to tell his huntsman, when drawing for his second
                    fox, that he was “thinking more of his dinner than of hunting·”</p>
                <p>In the earliest days of English hunting, gentlemen huntsmen were in high
                    estimation; and a reference to <hi rend="italic">Domesday-book</hi> will show
                    that Waleran, huntsman to William the Conqueror, possessed no less than fifteen
                    manors in Wiltshire, eight in Dorsetshire, together with several in Hampshire;
                    and his name occurs on the list of tenants <hi rend="italic">in</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">capite</hi> in other counties. The same venerable record of
                    antiquity describes the extensive possessions of other huntsmen, bearing the
                    names of Croc, Godwin, Willielmus, gentlemen of consideration in those times, in
                    which, according to Froissart, the ardour of the chase was carried to a pitch
                    since unequalled by the Norman lords, some of them having kept sixteen hundred
                    dogs, and a proportion <pb break="no" facs="nls:193648910"

                    the respect in which huntsmen have been held by kings and legislators. The
                    temperate but brave Agesilaus, and even the luxurydestroying Lycurgus, provided
                    for the bountiful entertainment of their huntsmen on their return from the
                    chase; a pursuit which they believed to be so agreeable to the gods, that they
                    offered the first fruits of their sports to Diana.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">The Duties of a Huntsman.</hi></p>
                <p>The situation of huntsman to a pack of fox-hounds is one of great responsibility,
                    and, if the breeding as well as hunting of them be left to him, a very arduous
                    undertaking. Nor does it end here. There is great call for judgment in feeding
                    hounds to answer every purpose, such as long draws, severe days, and at the same
                    time to go the pace without showing distress, and to come home at night with
                    their sterns up, and looking fresh. Here variety of constitution increases the
                    difficulty; for, to please the eye, hounds should look level in their condition,
                    as well as even in point of size. One hound will not bear to have his belly more
                    than half filled; another will not fill his when he may; and still each must be
                    made equal in strength and wind to the other, to stand hard work and go the pace
                    without distress. A huntsman must have a very watchful eye over their condition,
                    which will be effected by work and weather; and he must be pathologist enough to
                    foresee and provide against the alterations which such circumstances produce. He
                    has need also to be a physiologist, to enable him to exercise a sound judgment
                    in breeding his hounds after a certain form and fashion, which are absolutely
                    essential to their doing well, and at the same time pleasing the eye. Then look
                    at him in the field, with a hundred eyes upon him, and a hundred tongues to
                    canvass all his acts. Here he should be a philosopher.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">In the Field.</hi></p>
                <p>A huntsman is expected to bring his hounds to the cover side in a high state of
                    condition, at all seasons of the year. They should be seen quietly grouped about
                    his horse’s heels, when he is waiting for the hour of throwing off, without a
                    whip stirring, or even an angry word said to them. This is a time when they are
                    often subject to the inspection of strangers, and a first impression goes a
                    great way. When the master gives the word to draw, they should approach the
                    cover at a gentle trot, one whipper-in riding in their front; and when within
                    about a stone’s throw, they may dash into it with as much spirit as they like.
                    Not a word need be said by way of caution, unless it appears to be especially
                    called for, when “gently, there,” by the first whipper-in, and one smack of his
                    whip, will generally have the desired effect. But we like to see the huntsman
                    alive at this moment, as well as his hounds. Homer compares hounds cheered by
                    their huntsman, to troops encouraged by a skilful general; and doubtless there
                    is a similarity in the effect. Putting hounds out of the question, there is
                    something very cheering to the field In the “cheering holloa” of a huntsman,
                    when encouraging his hounds to draw; and it also answers two good purposes.
                    Should a hound get wide of the pack, or hang behind in the cover, or should any
                    of the field be at a loss, which often happens in woodlands, the “pipe” of the
                    huntsman is an unerring guide to all. How necessary is it, then, at all events
                    how desirable, that, like Ajax, he should be <hi rend="italic">βor</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">∣</hi><hi rend="italic">s</hi><hi rend="italic">αγαθός,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">“</hi> renowned for the strength of his voice,” and; we may add,
                    for the melodiousness of it. He should likewise blow a horn well; and if he
                    varies the blast, to make himself more intelligible to his hounds, he will find
                    his advantage in it. We wonder this is not more practised than it is.
                    Independently of the common <hi rend="italic">recheat,</hi> why not have the
                    “view horn” as well as the “view holloa ?” But too much horn, like <hi
                    rend="italic">vox</hi><hi rend="italic">et</hi><hi rend="italic">proeterea
                    nihil,</hi> is bad, making hounds apt to disregard it; yet a huntsman would be
                    sadly at a loss without it, not only in getting hounds away from cover and in
                    chase, but in drawing large covers, in which they will occasionally get wide.
                    Here a twang of the horn saves a huntsman’s voice in bringing them over to him.
                    One short blast is sufficient.</p>
                <p>“He gave his bugle-horn a blast, That through the woodlands echoed far and
                    wide.”</p>
                <p>The following observations on holloaing are from the pen of an old sportsman.
                    They contain hints that it would often be advisable to profit by; and they apply
                    not only to huntsmen, but to the field. “A general rule as to <hi rend="italic"
                    >hallooing</hi> is, never to halloo unless you can give a good reason for so
                    doing. A constant and indiscriminate use of the voice is blanicable in a
                    huntsman; his hounds, by constantly hearing his voice, will soon learn to pay no
                    more attention to it than they do to the singing of the lark, and they will not
                    come to him when they are called. Some huntsmen, in making a cast, try that part
                    of the ground where they can most conveniently ride, instead of that where it is
                    most likely the fox is gone. Others ride on hallooing, without regarding their
                    hounds, while making their cast; their own noise then prevents them from hearing
                    their hounds, who often tak∈ the scent without their being aware of it.”</p>
                <p>“No person should halloo that is not well forward. It signifies little what words
                    you use, as a hound’s knowledge of language is confined to a view halloo, a
                    call, and a rate: it is the tone of the voice, and not the words, that they
                    understand; and hounds will always draw to the voice, if it be not a rate. This
                    shows the impropriety of hallooing behind hounds. In running with good scent, if
                    you are up with the pack, a cheering halloo does no harm; the hounds will not
                    attend to it, and it is expressive of the pleasure of the hallooer. Never cap
                    hounds with loud halloos to a bad scent; capping makes them wild and eager, and
                    should never be done but when the scent is high. Hounds should be brought up
                    gently to a cold scent.” Holloaing to hounds is often necessary, and highly
                    useful when done with judgment; but the word “tallyho” loses many a good run;
                    as, unless a fox is gone clear away from his cover, it occasions him to turn
                    back often into the mouth of the hounds.</p>

                    understandings, that we generally address or converse with brutes in a silly
                    unmeaning manner; which gave rise to the remark, that children, or men who act
                    like children, have animals more immediately under their control than the
                    philosopher who is replete with wisdom. But we may look farther into the subject
                    than this. If the Almighty had not manifested some portion of his attributes by
                    means which are on a level with the capacity of the human race, man must have
                    remained for ever ignorant of his Maker. The power of language, however, between
                    man and man, is prodigiously increased by the tone in which it is conveyed. The
                    vagrant when he begs, the soldier when he gives the word of command, the senator
                    when he delivers an oration, and the lover when he whispers a gentle tale to his
                    mistress, all differ in the key in.which they speak; and it is thus that
                    huntsmen and whippers-in make themselves <pb break="no" facs="nls:193648923"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0711-8923-0756"/>intelligible to bounds. They do not speak to them
                    in an unmeaning manner, or after the manner of children; but in short and pithy
                    sentences, every word of which is law. The method of doing this, however, admits
                    of several degrees of excellence; but the huntsman who is endowed by nature with
                    a-clear, sonorous voice, in a well-pitched key, and knows when to use it with
                    effect, contributes greatly to the enthusiasm of fox-hunting, and no doubt to
                    the success of it.</p>
                <p>Without entering again into the wide range of hunting, we cannot do more than add
                    a few maxims which may be observed by a huntsman in the field. In drawing for
                    your fox, don’t be persuaded always to draw up wind. In the first place, you are
                    in danger of chopping him; secondly, he is sure then to go down wind at
                    starting; and, thirdly, you may drive him into a worse country, or from his
                    point. When found, get after him as quickly as possible if you have a body of
                    hounds with you; if not, you will have a better chance of sport if you can wait
                    till the body come up. This is easily done by a twang of the horn, or a false
                    holloa, if hounds are under good command, and the convenient opportunity be
                    seized upon. Keep near to them in chase, with your eye on <hi rend="italic">the
                    body</hi> of the pack, as well as on such hounds as may be leading; the body are
                    more certain to be right. Next to knowing where a fox is gone, is knowing where
                    he is not gone; therefore, in your cast, always make good the head. This you
                    will do for your satisfaction; but hounds are seldom at fault for the scent
                    a-head,when the chase has been at all warm, that is, on a fair scenting day; for
                    if the fox be gone forward, wherefore the fault? Good hounds will seldom or
                    never leave a scent ahead, unless the ground be stained by sheep or cattle, or
                    when the chase leads over dry ploughed land, hard and dry roads, &amp;c. It is
                    high odds that your fox has turned to the right or to the left; but although his
                    point may be back, he cannot well run his foil, from the number of horsemen that
                    are generally in the rear of fox-hounds. Recollect your first check is generally
                    the most fatal to sport, and for these reasons: Your hounds are fresh, and
                    perchance a little eager; they may have overrun the scent for some distance,
                    owing to their being pressed by the horses, which are also at this time fresh;
                    nor will they always get their heads down as soon as they should do, from the
                    same exciting causes. Again, your check now generally arises from a short turn,
                    the fox having been previously driven from his point, which he now resolves to
                    make; and he will make it at all hazard at certain times. When your hounds first
                    “throw up” (í. e. check), leave them alone if they can hunt; but, disregarding
                    what the “old ones” say on this subject, as inapplicable to these fast times,
                    don’t be long before you take hold of them, and assist them, if they cannot. We
                    would not go from scent to view; yet hounds in these days that will not bear
                    lifting are not worth having. But do all this quietly as well as quickly. Turn
                    your horse’s head towards the line you think your fox is gone; and die first
                    moment you see all their heads up, that is, if they do not hit him off, put your
                    horn to your mouth for one blast or two, and trot away to still more likely
                    points. If your pack will divide when casting, so much the better; but if they
                    arc good for any thing, they will be making their own cast whilst you are making
                    yours, by not keeping at your horse’s heels, but spreading as they go.</p>
                <p>When you have hit upon his point, if a single hound goes off with a good scent,
                    get the body to him as quickly as you can; but not so if the scent be not warm.
                    In the latter case, your hounds will be in expectation of a fresh fox, and will
                    be in a hurry; the hound that is forward will be lifted, and in all probability
                    you will have to seek for the scent again. Go gently, and your hounds, if
                    steady, will settle to it. Likewise, if, when at check, you are holloaed to a
                    spot where a fox has been viewed, <hi rend="italic">stand still,</hi> and say
                    nothing at the moment the first two or three hounds throw their tongues. If you
                    hurry the body on immediately, the scent will often be lost if the fox has been
                    a few minutes gone. If it can be done, give your hounds the wind at a crisis
                    like this. Again, when a fox has been viewed, and you go directly to holloa, do
                    not take your hounds to the extreme distant point at which he was viewed, but a
                    hundred yards behind it; and for this reason. If you take them to the extreme
                    point, and they do not take up the scent at once, you have then to make your
                    cast at a venture; whereas, if you lay them on at that distance behind it, you
                    have somewhat of a guide to that extent, as to the line towards which you should
                    draw them.</p>
                <p>The following further hints may be serviceable, or at all events they relate to
                    hounds at check. In trying back, hounds have this advantage. It is evident the
                    fox has come the line, up to the point where the check occurred; and he must be
                    gone either to the right or the left of it, or back. We make this observation,
                    because so much has been said about the straight running of foxes, which is far
                    from true; and the necessity of persevering in the cast a-head with the fox, and
                    back, on the foil, with the hare. The more hounds spread, within reason, in this
                    backward cast, the better will be the chance of making the check a short one.
                    Again, if at check on a road, or foot-path (the latter not often run over by
                    foxes), when you observe some of your best hounds failing to make it good, on
                    one side of either, it is reasonable to suppose the fox is gone on the other. If
                    your hounds check in a cover in the middle of a run, and the fox is viewed away
                    from it, try and get your hounds together as much as you can in the short time
                    that can be allowed for it, <hi rend="italic">before you cap them to the
                    scent.</hi> It generally ensures a good finish, from two obvious causes. First,
                    hounds get fresh wind; and, secondly, they will have a better chance to carry a
                    good head, which generally ends in blood, and in blood well earned; for the fox
                    is more likely to stand longer, and go straighter, for not having been viewed by
                    hounds when he broke. But the most difficult point for a huntsman to decide upon
                    promptly is, when his pack divides, which division is on the hunted fox. If it
                    happen in cover, his ear is his surest guide, as the cry is louder and stronger
                    on a fresh-found fox, than on one which has been for some time on foot. If when
                    out of cover your pack should split on two separate scents, you should get as
                    near as you can to what you imagine to be the chase, giving view holloas every
                    yard you go; also sending one of your whippers-in to stop the other hounds. Your
                    choice will doubtless be directed by several circumstances. You will first look
                    for your truest and best linehunting hounds, and next, to the points your first
                    fox would be likely to make for; and if your choice fall upon the lot that are
                    going farthest up the wind, the other will be more likely to hear them running;
                    and, should they come to a check, to join cry again perhaps before a whipper-in
                    can get to stop them.</p>
                <p>To the above we add a few general rules. Don’t be dispirited at a succession of
                    bad sport, for it is not within your control, good hounds and sport not being
                    naturally co-existing circumstances. Be as zealous as you please in the field,
                    but temper your zeal with judgment, and don’t weary your hounds by long draws,
                    on days which bid defiance to sport. It was once justly observed, that those who
                    seek pleasure from the chase must ask permission of heaven; and the case still
                    remains the same. Hounds without a scent resemble a man running in the dark;
                    neither can make head against such fearful obstructions; and on stormy days,
                    with a very high wind, if you have influence with your master, persuade him to
                    let you go home after the first failure. It is not generally known what mischief
                    even one such day does to some hounds. Don’t set too high a value on blood, <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193648936" xml:id="kp-eb0711-8936-0757"/> unless well
                    earned; it is the result of want of reflection alone that has set any value
                    whatever upon it, when otherwise obtained. Mob a bad fox in a cover if you like;
                    but never dig out a good one, unless your hounds have almost viewed him into a
                    spout, and you can bolt him before the excitement subsides. Never break ground
                    in a country belonging to another pack of hounds, nor dig for a fox in a moin
                    earth in your own. Many a bitch fox, heavy with young, has been killed by this
                    means in the spring, instead of the one that was hunted and marked to ground;
                    and be assured that sportsmen in general do not estimate the goodness of a pack
                    of hounds by the noses nailed against the kennel door. Lastly, keep your field
                    back from pressing on your hounds in chase, and still more so when in
                    difficulties, as well as you can; but don’t suffer your zeal to carry you too
                    far on this point. Remember the apostolic precept, " <hi rend="smallcaps">be
                    courteous.”</hi></p>
                <p>The modern annals of sporting contain the names and characters of several very
                    eminent huntsmen, whose conduct and abilities would have done credit to any
                    other situation of life to which it might have been their lot to have been
                    called. Considering the responsibility of their office, the severity of their
                    work, and the risks they run, they are not supposed to be too highly paid in
                    wages, say on the average L.100 per annum, besides their board; but, from
                    perquisites, such as annual presents from gentlemen who attend the hounds which
                    they hunt, and drafted hounds sold to other packs, they may realize the like sum
                    in addition.</p>
                <p>The office of whipper-in is, in our opinion, thought more lightly of by the
                    sporting world in general than it deserves to be; and, as we shall show, we have
                    the great Beckford on our side. We never saw a steady pack of hounds without at
                    least one good whipper-in, and we are quite sure we never shall; but we have
                    seen many of these red-coated youths who might have been better employed at the
                    plough-tail— who, like Cicero’s lawyer, belonged rather to the profession than
                    the science. “If he has genius,” says Beckford, “he may show it in various ways
                    ,∙ he may clap forward to any great earth that may by chance be open; he may
                    sink the wind to holloo, or mob a fox when the scent fails; he may keep him off
                    his foil; he may stop the tail hounds, and get them forward; and has it
                    frequently in his power to assist the hounds without doing them any hurt,
                    provided he has sense to distinguish where he is wanted most. Besides, the most
                    essential part of fox-hunting, <hi rend="italic">the making and keeping the pack
                    steady,</hi> depends entirely upon him, as a huntsman should seldom rate, and
                    never flog a hound. In short, I consider the first whipper-in as a second
                    huntsman; and, to be perfect, he should be as capable of hunting the hounds as
                    the huntsman himself. He should not be conceited, but contented to act an under
                    part, except when circumstances may require that he should act otherwise; and
                    the moment they cease, he must not fail to resume his former station.”</p>
                <p>To the above excellent remarks we have very little to add. We only recommend,
                    when a huntsman is casting his hounds, that a whipper-in should turn them to him
                    al ways as gently as he can, and with little noise; by which means they will <hi
                    rend="italic">draw</hi> towards him, trying for the scent as they go; whereas
                    loud and repeated rates and cracks of the whip make hounds fly to their huntsman
                    at this time with their heads up. When they are drawing properly towards him,
                    not a word should be said; a whipper-in riding outside of them will be
                    sufficient.</p>
                <p>It is scarcely necessary to say, a whipper-in, to be perfect, should be an
                    accomplished horseman, as nothing requires a much firmer and nicer hand than the
                    act of following a hound over open ground to flog him. A whipper-in, however,
                    should always hit a hound first, and rate him afterwards, and be able to hit
                    hard when occasion requires it. A riotous fox-hound cannot be trifled with, if
                    he is to be cured of his evil ways; and let the lash fall heavily when
                    necessary, but at no other time. Above all, let the whipper-in have an eye to a
                    skirter: skirting is the least pardonable fault a hound can possess, because he
                    is then deviating from his nature, and has not the force of impulse to plead,
                    which the hound that runs riot has. <hi rend="smallcaps">(b. b. b. b.)</hi></p>
