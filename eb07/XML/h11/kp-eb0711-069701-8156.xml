                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">From</hi> the combination of various causes, the history of
                    no animal is more interesting than that of the dog. First, his intimate
                    association with man, not only as his valuable servant and protector, but as his
                    constant and faithful companion throughout all the vicissitudes of life.
                    Secondly, from his natural endowments, not consisting solely in the exquisite
                    delicacy of one individual sense, that fineness of olfactory nerve by which the
                    earth and air send forth showers of perfumes; not merely combining memory with
                    reflection that soars above instinctive preservation or self-enjoyment; but
                    qualities of the mind that absolutely stagger us in the contemplation of them,
                    and which we can alone account for in the gradation existing in that wonderful
                    system which (by different links of one vast chain, extending from the first to
                    the last of all things, till it forms a perfect whole) is placed, as Professor
                    Harwood elegantly expresses it, “in the doubtful confines of the material and
                    spiritual worlds.” It might have been instinct that enabled Ulysses’s dog to
                    recognize him on his re-landing in Ithaca, after an absence which must have set
                    the powers of memory at defiance; and he recognized him with all the acuteness
                    and affection which instinct boasts; <hi rend="italic">but what caused him to
                    expire at his feet on the sudden dawn of unexpected happiness</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">?</hi> The heart of man could go no further than this; and
                    although perhaps the poet’s fiction is only present to us in this instance, by
                    what name can we call those tender affections, those sincere attachments, those
                    personal considerations, which we ourselves have witnessed in these faithful
                    creatures towards human kind? Virtue alone is too cold a term, as almost every
                    good quality to be found in animated nature is to be found here; and when we
                    reflect upon the miserable existence so often the lot of this kind-hearted
                    animal in this world, and the more than uncertainty that, as Byron says, he will
                    be <hi rend="superscript"> w</hi> Denied in heaven the soul he held on
                    earth,”</p>
                <p>we cannot but feel regret that he should be without his reward. But yet this is a
                    point not exactly decided upon by man ,∙ at least it has been considered as a
                    fit subject for speculation by deep and able thinkers. Mr Locke, for example,
                    doubted whether brutes survive the grave, because ithere is no hint given of it
                    in revelation; but Dr Priestley thought, if the resurrection of the dead be
                    within the proper course of nature, and there be something remaining of every
                    organized body that death does not destroy, there will be reason to conclude
                    that they will be benefited by it as well as ourselves. “The misery,” says this
                    forcible writer, and great moral philosopher, <hi rend="superscript"> &lt;c</hi>
                    some animals are exposed to in this life, may induce us to think that a merciful
                    and just God will make them some recompense for it hereafter.”</p>
                <p>But no animal has met with more variety of respect shown towards him than the dog
                    has. By the law of Moses he was declared unclean, and was held in great contempt
                    by the Jews, as also by the Turks, and kept by both merely for the purposes of
                    scavenging their streets. In every part of the sacred writings, as also in those
                    of Greece and Rome, not only are images introduced from the works of nature, and
                    metaphors drawn from the manners and economy of animals, but the names of them
                    are applied to persons supposed to possess any of their respective qualities.
                    Thus our Saviour, adopting this concise method, applies the word “dog” to men of
                    odious character and violent temper; and, as with us at present, the term of
                    reproach, “he was a son of a dog,” was in common use among the Jews. The wife
                    Abigail (1 Samuel, xxv. 3) “was a woman of good understanding, and of a
                    beautiful countenance; but the man (NabaD was churlish and evil in his doings,
                    and <hi rend="italic">was of the house of Caleb.”</hi> But this last, says an
                    able expounder of the Scriptures, is not a proper name. Literally it is, “he was
                    the son of a dog.” On the other hand, the idolatrous Egyptians held the dog
                    sacred, and worshipped him in their god Anubis, representing the form of a man
                    with a dog’s head, which Juvenal complains of in his fifteenth satire:</p>
                <p>“Oppida tota canem venerantur, nemo Dianam.”</p>
                <p>Anubis, says Strabo, is also the city of dogs, the capital of the Cynopolitan
                    prefecture. “Those animals,” says he, “are fed there on sacred aliments, and
                    religion has decreed them a worship.” This absurd adoration is confirmed by
                    Diodorus Siculus and Herodotus; and Rome having adopted the ceremonies of Egypt,
                    the Emperor Commodus, when celebrating the Isiac feasts, shaved his head, and
                    himself carried the dog Anubis.</p>
                <p>But to proceed to their origin and history. It has been justly remarked, that
                    “all dogs whatsoever, even from the terrible Boar-dog to little Flora, were all
                    one in the first creation and every virtue and faculty, size and shape, which we
                    find or improve in every dog upon earth, were originally comprehended in the
                    first parents of the species, nothing having remained constant but their natural
                    conformation; and all the variety which we now behold in them is either the
                    product of climate or the accidental effect of soil, food, or situation, and
                    very frequently the issue alone of human care, curiosity, or caprice. This we
                    take to be the case with other departments of the creation. For example, we only
                    acknowledge two sorts of pigeons, the wild and the tame. Of the first there is
                    but one, the oenas, or vinago of Ray. Of the last, the varieties are
                    innumerable. The tame and the wild goose are likewise originally of the same
                    species, the influence of domestication alone having caused the tame ones to
                    differ from the parent stock. Notwithstanding, however, the efforts and effects
                    of human industry and skill, there is fortunately a <hi rend="italic">ne</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">plus ultra</hi> in nature which cannot be passed; and as there is
                    a distinct specific difference in all living creatures, a pigeon is still a
                    pigeon, a goose a goose, and a dog remains a dog. Still, although no human
                    device can add one new <hi rend="italic">species</hi> to the works of the
                    creation, and nature is still uniform in the main, as we have already observed,
                    in our remarks on the horse, she is always ready to meet the demands of art, a
                    fact beautifully set forth in these lines of <hi rend="italic">Hudibras</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">:—</hi></p>
                <p>“How fair and sweet the planted rose, Beyond the wild in hedges grows!</p>
                <p>For without art the noblest seeds of flowers degen’rate into weeds. How dull and
                    rugged, ere ’ tis ground And polish’d, is the diamond.</p>
                <p>Though Paradise were e’er so fair, It was not kept so without care: The whole
                    world, without art and dress, Would be but one great wilderness; And mankind but
                    a savage herd, For all that nature has conferr’d.</p>
                <p>This does but rough-hew and design, Leaves art to polish and refine.”</p>
                <p>We have good reason to believe that England (in a great measure from the
                    congeniality of its climate) has long been famous for dogs, which, on the
                    authority of Strabo (lib. iv. p. 199), were much sought after by all the
                    surrounding nations. So high indeed in repute were British dogs amongst the
                    Romans after the reduction of our <pb break="no" facs="nls:193648169"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0711-8169-0698"/>island, not only for excellence in the chase, but
                    fierceness in the combat, that an officer from that country was appointed to
                    reside in the city of Winchester, for the express purpose of collecting and
                    breeding them to supply the amphitheatre, as well as the imperial kennel, at
                    Rome. Nor was this all. As a kind of earnest of our present celebrity in the
                    various sports of the field, all the neighbouring countries, as Dr Campbell
                    remarks, “have done justice to our dogs, adopted our terms and names into their
                    language, received them thankfully as presents, and, when they have an
                    opportunity, purchased them at a dear rate.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    Fulco, archbishop of Rheims, to send some learned ecclesiastics into England, he
                    accompanied his letter with a present of several dogs, being the most valuable
                    he could, in those times, bestow. The congeniality of our climate has
                    contributed much to this excellence, as our dogs, hounds especially, are found
                    to degenerate in most others; which Somerville alludes to in his poem of the
                    Chase.</p>

                </lg>
                <p>We do not benefit much by research into ancient authors on the subject of dogs;
                    for although they have been much written upon, and immortalised in song by
                    Oppian, Claudian, Gratius, and others (Virgil says little about them), yet, from
                    our ignorance of the sort of animal bred in their time, and the use they made of
                    them, <hi rend="italic">as sportsmen,</hi> we can draw no parallel between them
                    and our own that would tend to a good purpose. No doubt the “canis <hi
                    rend="italic">vestigator”</hi> of Columella, and the “canis <hi rend="italic"
                    >odorus”</hi> of Claudian, were of what we term a low-scenting sort, as the
                    epithets applied to them signify; but it would be difficult to pronounce an
                    opinion upon the xatfró^a/, or the aλω- -τε%∕δες, of Xenophon, although the
                    characteristic properties of good hunting hounds are very well and accurately
                    laid down by him in the third chapter of his <hi rend="italic">Kυvn</hi><hi
                    rend="italic superscript"> ι</hi><hi rend="italic">∕ε-τ</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >∣</hi><hi rend="italic">Mζ,</hi> as well as their defects in form, &amp;c.
                    equally clearly exposed; and his observations on these points might be perused
                    with advantage by huntsmen of the present day.</p>
                <p>Great encouragement has been given to the breeding of hounds in England by the
                    various monarchs who have reigned over it. Henry II. was perhaps the first who
                    made himself conspicuous in this department of the sportsman’s occupation,
                    being, as one of his historians says of him, “particularly curious in his
                    hounds, that they should be fleet, well-tongued, and consonous.” The last
                    epithet is in reference to a property not only little regarded, but nearly lost
                    now, namely, the deep tongue of the old English blood-hound, which Shakspeare
                    alludes to in his celebrated description of those “of the Spartan kind</p>
                <p>“ (So flowed, so sanded, and their heads are hung With ears that sweep away the
                    morning dew. Crook-knee’d, and dewlapt, like Thessalian bulls; Slow in pursuit;
                    but match’d in mouth like bells, Each under each :)”</p>
                <p>which would now be considered a disgrace to any man’s kennel, and we believe
                    nowhere to be found, bearing the faintest resemblance to the picture drawn of
                    them by this master-hand.</p>
                <p>In Queen Elizabeth’s time a classification was made by Dr Caius, physician to the
                    queen, in his treatise <hi rend="italic">De Cambus</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Britannicis,</hi> of the different kinds of dogs peculiar to Great Britain; but
                    many of the names (the sleute or sluth hound of the Scotch, for example) having
                    since become obsolete,' they were again classed by Mr Daniel, in his <hi
                    rend="italic">Rural Sports,</hi> which work contains a full and satisfactory
                    historical account of their origin, different crosses, Ac. under the following
                    genealogical heads :—Shepherd’s Dog, Iceland Dog, Lapland Dog, Siberian Dog,
                    Hound, Terrier, Large Spaniel, Small Spaniel, Water Dog, Small Water Dog, Bull
                    Dog, Large Danish Dog, Irish Greyhound, English Greyhound, and Mastiff. Taplin,
                    in his <hi rend="italic">Sporting Dictionary,</hi> expresses his surprise that
                    the Pointer is omitted; but we consider the Pointer as a dog of foreign
                    extraction, and to our early ancestors certainly unknown.</p>
                <p>The original stock from which English hounds have been bred would be very
                    difficult to determine upon; but one thing is certain, namely, that the several
                    sorts with which the country once abounded have been becoming fewer and fewer,
                    in the course of the last hundred years, and now centre in three varieties,
                    namely, the Fox-hound, the Harrier, and the Beagle. The stag-hound is gone, at
                    least there is no pack of stag-hounds now kept in Great Britain, the last having
                    been disposed of and sent abroad, soon after the stag hunting establishment in
                    Devonshire was broken up, a few years ago. The beagle is also become rare; and
                    otter-hounds, such as we may conclude the %αΛ√g∕α∕ of Xenophon to have been,
                    never existed in this country, the dog used in hunting the otter being the
                    common harrier; and perhaps the parent of all, the majestic blood-hound,
                    whose</p>
                <p>“Nostrils oft, if ancient fame s⅛gs true, Trace the sly felon through the tainted
                    dew,” is at present very thinly scattered, here and there only, at keepers’
                    lodges in some of our royal forests. But we more than doubt whether a true
                    specimen of the original English blood-hound exists in England at all at the
                    present day; nor is this a matter of regret, as, unlike the rest of his species,
                    his character is said to be that of decided enmity to man. Strabo describes an
                    attack upon the Gauls by these animals, and likewise says they were purchased in
                    Britain by the Celtae, for the purposes of Avar, as well as those of the chase;
                    but it is doubtful whether the most savage of this race would devour man without
                    being trained to it, which Ave know that they were on a late horrible occasion,
                    when, as stated in Rainsford’s <hi rend="italic">History of St Domingo,</hi>
                    they Avere fed upon blood, and a figure representing a negro, containing blood
                    and entrails of beasts, was the object they Avere led to pursue. In the West
                    Indies, however, the blood-hound, under proper control, has been found useful in
                    tracing runaway negroes, as the sluth-hound of the Scotch was early applied to
                    discover the haunts of robbers; and to the same purpose also on the confines of
                    England and Wales, Avhere the borderers preyed on the flocks and herds of their
                    neighbours, whenever an opportunity offered. Of deer-stealers, who Avere so
                    numerous a century or two ago, they were likewise the terror; and Avell might
                    they have been so, for when once fairly laid upon the foot of one, they seldom
                    failed to hunt up to him. But it is in the civil wars of our own country that
                    blood-hounds are placed in the most conspicuous light, particularly as available
                    to the operations of Wallace and Bruce; and the poetical historians of the two
                    heroes allude to their services to their masters, as well as to the escapes they
                    had from those of their various enemies.</p>
                <p>The distinguishing features of the English blood-hound are, long, smooth, and
                    pendulous ears, with a wide forehead, obtuse nose, expansive nostrils, and deep
                    flewed, with an awfully deep but highly sonorous tongue. The prevailing colour
                    is a reddish tan, darkening to the upper part, often with a mixture of black
                    upon the back. In short, the deep-flewed southern hare-hound, now almost extinct
                    in England, very nearly resembles the English bloodhound in form and colour; and
                    a person may picture to <pb break="no" facs="nls:193648182"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0711-8182-0699"/>himself the latter, by supposing an animal
                    considerably larger than the old southern hound. In height he is from twenty-six
                    to twenty-eight inches, and sometimes more. The blood-hound of the West Indies
                    is also about the same height, but differs much in form. He has small, erect
                    ears, the nose more pointed, and the hair and skin hard. His countenance is ill
                    featured and ferocious; and although not so heavy as the English blood-hound, he
                    is quite as muscular, and very active.</p>
                <p>The distinguishing property of the blood-hound in chase, consists in his never
                    changing from the scent on which he is first laid; and he will hunt by the shed
                    blood of a wounded or dead animal as truly as he will by the foot, which
                    rendered him so useful in pursuit of the deer or sheep-stealer.</p>
                <p>The English stag-hound, now nearly gone, is little more than a mongrel
                    blood-hound; at least it is reasonable to conclude, that the cross which
                    produced him was directly from the En gush blood-hound with some lighter animal
                    of a similar species (perhaps a greyhound, or lurcher) approximating his form,
                    to which conjecture his figure and disposition, as well as his <hi rend="italic"
                    >comparative</hi> inferiority of scent, appear to add strength. It is asserted
                    in the <hi rend="italic">Sportsman’s Cibinet,</hi> that the stag-hound “was
                    originally an improved cross between the old English deep-tongued southern hound
                    and the fleeter fox-hound, grafted upon the basis of what was formerly called,
                    and better known by the appellation of, blood-hound.” But this assertion must
                    have been made without proper reflection; for, in the first place, a cross
                    between the deep-tongued southern and the fox-hound will not produce an animal
                    nearly so large or so Strong as the stag-hound; and, secondly, the stag-hound
                    was known in England long before the foxhound was made use of, or, indeed,
                    before there was an animal at all resembling the one which is now known by that
                    term.</p>
                <p>We confess we regret the prospect of the total extinction of the English
                    stag-hound, who, although his form possessed little of that symmetry we now see
                    in the English fox-hound, was a majestic animal of his kind, and possessed the
                    property peculiar alone to the blood-hound and himself, of unerringly tracing
                    the scent he was laid upon, amongst a hundred others; which evinces a
                    superiority,, at all events a peculiarity, of nose entirely unknown to our
                    lighter hounds of any breed. The want of being able to distinguish the lhunted
                    fox from a fresh-found one is the bane of English fox-hunting; and there are not
                    wanting those who think, that in the breeding of the modern fox-hound, the minor
                    points of high form and blood are more frequently considered than they should
                    be, in preference of a regard to nose.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">The Fox-Hound.</hi></p>
                <p>The English fox-hound of the present day is a perfect living model; but how he
                    has become such, it is in no one’s power to determine. Although we do not like
                    to apply the term of mongrel to an animal we so highly respect, yet there can be
                    no doubt of his being one of a spurious race, engrafted with care on the parent
                    stock, ιamely, <hi rend="italic">the old English blood-hound.</hi> There is, we
                    believe also, no doubt that a century and a half ago there was no animal in the
                    world resembling the present breed of fox-hound; and that the fox, when hunted
                    at all in Great Britain, was hunted by a dog much resembling what is now known
                    as the Welch harrier, rough-haired and strong, but of very far from sightly
                    appearance. As all animals, however, improve under the care and guidance of man,
                    until at length they assume the character of a distinct breed; such has
                    evidently been the case with hounds, the breeders of which have, by going from
                    better to better in their choice of the animals from which they have bred,
                    progressively arrived at the perfection we see in them. And such has been the
                    case with all our domestic animals, the breeders of which have alone attained
                    their ends by the choice of individuals of the highest excellence in their kind,
                    and by a judicious selection of size, form, and qualities likely to produce the
                    result. There can be no doubt, then, but that by pursuing this course throughout
                    a number of generations with the hound, an animal has been produced of what may
                    be called quite a new variety in the canine race, answering the description and
                    purposes of our present fox-hound. But the questions may be asked, Whence the
                    necessity for this change, and forcing, as it were, nature from her usual
                    course? Why not be content with the low-scenting, plodding hounds of our
                    forefathers, which, from the superiority of their nose, not only displayed <hi
                    rend="italic">hunting,</hi> in the strict acceptation of that term, to the
                    highest advantage, but very rarely missed the game they pursued? These questions
                    are satisfactorily answered in a few words; first, as the fox is not now found
                    by the drag, and the number of those animals is so greatly increased, the
                    necessity for this extreme tenderness of nose does not exist; and, secondly, by
                    reason of the blood of the race-horse having gradually mixed with that of our
                    hunters, the sort of hound we have been alluding to was not found to be adapted
                    to their increased speed; and particularly as, in proportion as nature lavished
                    this fine sense of smelling on the old-fashioned hound, was he given to “hang”
                    or dwell upon the scent, thereby rendering the length of a chase (which, to
                    please the present taste, should, like Chatham’s battle, be “sharp, short, and
                    decisive”) beyond the endurance of a modern sportsman. It is true, Mr Beckford,
                    in his <hi rend="italic">Thoughts upon Hunting,</hi> gives an instance of a pack
                    of old-fashioned hounds, which ran in a string, as it were, one following the
                    other, and yet killing twenty-nine foxes in twenty-nine successive runs, each
                    fault being hit off by an old southern hound. But what would our hard-riding,
                    modern sportsmen think of this as pastime? Nevertheless, all who witnessed, as
                    we have done, the style of hunting of the Devonshire stag-hounds, will remember
                    that there was a close similarity between them in chase, and the pack Mr
                    Beckford speaks of. But, as the same eminent author afterwards observes, it is
                    the dash of the fox-hound of the present day that distinguishes him from all
                    others of his genus, and hounds must now “carry a head.”</p>
                <p>The breeding a pack of fox-hounds to a pitch bordering on perfection is a task of
                    no ordinary aifficulty; the best proof of which is to be found in the few
                    sportsmen who have succeeded in it. Not only is every good quality to be
                    regarded, and if possible obtained, but every fault or imperfection to be
                    avoided; and although the good qualities of hounds are very soon reckoned, their
                    faults in shape and performance present a longer catalogue. Independently of
                    shape, which combines strength with beauty, the highest virtue in a fox-hound is
                    not in the exquisiteness of his nose, but in his being true to the line his game
                    has gone, and a stout runner to the end of a chase. But he must not only thus
                    signalize himself in chase; he must also be a patient hunter, with a cold scent,
                    or with the pack at fault. In short, to be a hard runner and a good hunter, and
                    steady on the line, which “a good hunter” implies, constitutes a perfect hound,
                    when combined with good form.</p>
                <p>The faults of hounds, too often innate, can only be cured by education. The
                    greatest of all are, skirting, or not being true on the line, and throwing the
                    tongue improperly; first, without a scent, which is known by the term babbling;
                    secondly, not throwing it at all, or running mute; and, thirdly, on a wrong
                    scent, which is called running riot. The latter, however, is the least vice of
                    the two, because generally curable by the lash; but the fault of skirting is too
                    often innate; at all events, too often incurable. Thus has the breeder of the
                    ‘hound to guard against propensities as <pb break="no" facs="nls:193648195"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0711-8195-0700"/>well as faults; and a late accredited writer on
                    the subject says, “In modem times, the system of hunting is so much improved, so
                    much more attention is paid to the condition of hounds and their style of work,
                    that in this enlightened age a master of hounds thinks it a reflection on his
                    judgment if <hi rend="italic">one</hi> hound in his pack is detected in a
                    fault.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Colonel Cook’s
                    <hi rend="italic">Observations on Fox-hunting,</hi> &amp;c.</p></note></p>
                <p>The selection of dog and bitch to breed from is a nice point for a master of
                    hounds, or his huntsman, to decide upon; but, if he aim at excellence, he must
                    keep his eye on perfection. In no animal is perfect symmetry so desirable as in
                    a fox-hound, for without it there is no dependence on his services, however good
                    may be his nature. We will first describe him in the words of a very old writer,
                    and afterwards in those of Mr Beckford, when it will appear that there is a
                    strong resemblance in the portraits drawn by each. “His head,” says the former,
                    “ought to be of middle proportion, rather long than round; his nostrils wide;
                    his ears large; his back bowed; the fillets great; the haunches large; the
                    thighs well trussed; the ham straight; the tail big near the reins, and the rest
                    slender to the end; the leg big; the sole of the foot dry, and formed like a
                    fox’s, with the claws great.” The latter says, “There are necessary points in
                    the shape of a hound which ought always to be attended to; for if he be not a
                    perfect symmetry, he will neither run fast nor bear much work; he has much to
                    undergo, and should have strength proportioned to it. Let his legs be straight
                    as arrows; his feet round, and not too large; his shoulders back; his breast
                    rather wide than narrow; his chest deep; his back broad; his head small; his
                    neck thin; his tail thick and brushy; if he carry it well so much the better.”
                    Now the hound that would answer to either of these descriptions would disgrace
                    no man’s kennel, and one resembling the latter would be an ornament to it; but
                    with regard to the former, it must be borne in mind, that it is from the -pen of
                    a sportsman who wrote a century and half ago, when, as has been before observed,
                    there is reason to believe no animal in the perfect form of the modern foxhound
                    was to be found in this or in any other country. Judges of the animal, however,
                    will be disposed to think with us, that there is much of the real character of
                    the <hi rend="italic">hound</hi> in the sentence we have quoted from this old
                    writer; such as the long rather than round head; the wide nostrils (Pliny says
                    they should be flat, solid, and blunt); and the dry, fox’s foot. But the “bowed
                    back” appears to spoil all, unless by it is meant that gentle rise in the loins
                    which the judge of hounds admires, and without which, the late Mr Chute of the
                    Vine, in Hampshire, who hunted that country for more than thirty years, gave it
                    as his opinion, no hound was able to maintain his speed for an hour over hilly
                    and <hi rend="italic">ploughed</hi> countries when “it carries ;”—a technical
                    term for the earth clinging to the foot, which it will do after a slight frost
                    on the preceding night; necessarily adding much to the natural weight of the
                    hound. Beckford gives us the modern foxhound, and perfect, with the exception of
                    the mention of one or two material points. “His chest should be deep,” says he,
                    “and his back broad but he has omitted a point much thought of by the modern
                    sportsman, namely, <hi rend="italic">the back ribs,</hi> which should also be
                    deep, as in a strong-bodied horse, of which we say, when so formed, that he has
                    a good “spur-place,” a point highly esteemed in him. Nor is either of these
                    writers sufficiently descriptive of the hinder legs of the hound; for although
                    the “large haunch and well-trussed thigh” of the former denote power and muscle,
                    nevertheless there is a length of thigh discernible in first-rate hounds, which,
                    like the “well let-down hock” of the horse, gives them much superiority <hi
                    rend="italic">of</hi> speed, and is also a great security against laming
                    themselves in leaping fences, which they are more apt to do when they become
                    blown, and consequently weak. ' The fore legs “<hi rend="italic">straight as
                    arrowd</hi> ’ is an admirable illustration of perfection in those parts, by
                    Beckford; for, as in a bow, or bandy-legged man, nothing is so disfiguring to a
                    hound as his having his elbows out, which is likewise a great check to speed. In
                    some countries the round, catlike foot is indispensable, and agreeable to the
                    eye in all; but we would not reject a well-shapen puppy in other respects for
                    somewhat of an open foot, provided his ancles or fetlocks were good, <hi
                    rend="italic">a point we consider of the greatest consequence to all quadruped
                    animals.</hi> The shoulders of the fox-hound should resemble those of the
                    horse—oblique, but at the same time strong; for a narrow chested hound is almost
                    certain to get shaken by hard work, and consequently unlikely to endure beyond
                    his third season.</p>
                <p>As Beckford recommends the small head, we may presume the form and fashion of
                    this point began to be changed in his time, and has, we think, been carried to
                    too great an excess in the fox-hound of the present day, particularly in one or
                    two kennels (the Belvoir, for example), where very short, as well as small
                    heads, are a leading characteristic. For ourselves, we like some length of head
                    in the fox-hound, not being able to divest ourselves of the idea of a cross with
                    the pointer when we see him with a short head and a snubbed nose. Beckford also
                    says the neck should be thin. We would add, <hi rend="italic">moderately
                    thin.</hi> We dislike a thin neck in any animal but the cow or the stag; at the
                    same time we dislike a short, thick neck in a hound. His neck should be
                    moderately long and moderately thick, with the muscles clearly developed; it
                    should rise gracefully out of his shoulders, with a slight curve or crest, and,
                    to completely satisfy the eye, should be quite free from exuberances of flesh
                    and hair on the lower side of it, called by huntsmen “chitterlings” or ruffles,
                    the hound having them being termed “throaty although there are numerous
                    exceptions to this rule, as some of the best hounds England ever saw have been
                    throaty; and although we are aware that one individual instance will prove
                    neither the rule nor its exception, we can go as far back as to Mr Meynell’s
                    famous stallion hound Gusman, for as throaty, and yet as good a fox-hound as we
                    ever remember to have seen. We agree with Beckford, that the “tail,” now called
                    stern, of a hound, should be “thick,” and moderately “brushy and if well
                    carried, it is a great ornament to a fox-hound. But there is one part of it
                    which the master of a pack likes to see nearly deprived of its covering, and
                    that is its tip, which, when in that state, is an infallible proof of a hound
                    being a good, and not a slack, drawer of covers. As a perfect model we refer to
                    the portrait of Nosegay, a hound belonging to the Earl of Kintore. Plate
                    CCXCIV.</p>
                <p>But to return to breeding the fox-hound. In the breeding of some animals, beauty
                    of shape is often dependent on the caprice of fashion, or the taste of the
                    breeder; but in the breeding of hounds no such latitude can be given, for here
                    beauty, or symmetry of shape, is alone in reference to utility, and adaptation
                    of parts to the purposes to which they are to be applied. Yet the breeder of
                    foxhounds has one point further to go; he must, as we before remarked, guard
                    against <hi rend="italic">propensities,</hi> which run in the blood of these
                    animals perhaps stronger than their good qualities, and will sooner or later
                    break out in their work. In the election then of a dog for a bitch, or a bitch
                    for a dog, these matters must be attentively considered; and no man should breed
                    from hounds of either sex that come under any of the following denominations,
                    viz. not of a docile sort, but very difficult to enter to their game; given to
                    run mute; to hang on a scent; or to be skirters; not <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193648208" xml:id="kp-eb0711-8208-0701"/>only not true to the line,
                    but given to run riot either in ’ cover or in chase; and, above all things, if
                    found evidently deficient in nose, and not able to run at head. Good
                    constitution should likewise be looked to; but we would not reject a stallion
                    hound, or a brood bitch, merely for being slack drawers, or for not being always
                    at the head in chase, provided they were well bred, of good form, and true to
                    the line, in cover, and out.</p>
                <p>As to the proper combination of form, that must be self-evident to the breeder of
                    hounds. If a bitch is a little high on her leg, or light, she should be put to a
                    shortlegged, strong dog, and of course <hi rend="italic">vice versa;</hi> if
                    rather light in her tongue, that defect may be remedied by an opposite property
                    in a dog. The defects in legs and feet can only be remedied by such means; and
                    fortunate is it for the owner of an otherwise perfect and excellent bitch, that
                    such remedies are at hand. Length and shortness of frame, as well as coarse
                    points, are all to be obviated and altered in the same way, making allowance for
                    the fact, that the laws of nature are not <hi rend="italic">always</hi> certain.
                    Constitution can likewise be mended by having recourse to that which is good
                    (and none so easily detected as the dog’s); and colour changed if required. In
                    fact, as Beckford says, “It is the judicious cross that makes the complete pack
                    and it was the remark of this practical writer, and therefore high authority
                    amongst sportsmen, that “he saw no reason why the breeding of hounds may not
                    improve till improvement can go no further.” The question may be asked, is not
                    his prediction verified?</p>
                <p>But the act of crossing hounds, as indeed all other animals, although never
                    thoroughly divested of chance, is one of more difficulty than most people would
                    imagine, and one indeed which, by its results, would often baffle, if not
                    puzzle, the profoundest of our modern physiologists. Our space will not admit of
                    our going at length into this intricate subject, but great mistakes, we
                    conceive, have been made by masters of fox-hounds, in breeding too much
                    in-and-in, from nearest affinities, instead of having recourse to an alien
                    cross. This was peculiarly apparent in the packs of two very celebrated masters
                    of fox-hounds, the late Sir Thomas Mostyn, Bart., and the late John Corbet, Esq.
                    of Sundorne Castle, Shropshire (the former of whom hunted Oxfordshire, and the
                    latter Warwickshire, each for upwards of thirty years), who bred in-and-in, Sir
                    Thomas from a bitch called <hi rend="italic">Lady,</hi> and her produce; and Mr
                    Corbet from a hound called <hi rend="italic">Trojan,</hi> and his produce, to
                    the great injury of their respective packs. We are aware it is asserted that a
                    pack of fox-hounds should have the appearance and character of being of one
                    family; but this expression is not to be taken in its literal construction. It
                    is in the conformity of their character and appearance that they should bear a
                    close resemblance to each other, and not in their close consanguinity. It is
                    true, the celebrated pack of Mr Warde, the present father of the field, and a
                    master of fox-hounds for the unparalleled period of fifty-seven years, which
                    sold for two thousand guineas, only contained, in 1825, three couples of hounds
                    not of his own blood, and those the produce of one stallion hound, Mr Assheton
                    Smith’s <hi rend="italic">Reubens.</hi> But we have no proof of Mr Warde’s
                    hounds being better for adhering so closely to his own sort; on the contrary, it
                    is the opinion, we believe, of the sporting world, reluctantly admitted, in
                    consideration of the well-merited celebrity of their owner, that, latterly, the
                    slackness of this renowned pack, unrivalled in fine form, •vas to be attributed
                    to that circumstance. On the other hand, the rare but valuable combination of
                    dash and nose, a match for the cold and ungenial Oxfordshire hills, for which
                    the Duke of Beaufort’s pack has been so long conspicuous, has been traced to his
                    Grace’s late huntsman, Philip Payne (said by Colonel Cook, in his <hi
                    rend="italic">Observations on Fox-Hunting,</hi> to be “the best judge of
                    breeding hounds in the kingdom”), going from home for his blood, and sending his
                    bitches to the celebrated stallion hounds of the best kennels within his reach.
                    This, however, it must be remembered, is not within the command of every man’s
                    purse, the expenses attending sending bitches to a distance, under any
                    circumstances, being heavy; as not only must they be placed under the care of a
                    trusty servant on their journey, but there are other occult expenses attending
                    them, which none but masters of hounds are aware of. It is, however, a notorious
                    fact, that the produce of some stallion hounds, if they have a fair chance by
                    the bitch, seldom fail in turning out well; and perhaps the most signal instance
                    of “like begetting like” in this species of animal, is that of Mr Osbaldeston’s
                    Furrier having been the sire of an entire pack in that gentleman’s kennel when
                    he hunted the Quorndon country in Leicestershire, which he would occasionally
                    take to the field, amounting to more than thirty-five couples, although, as may
                    be supposed, they were generally mingled with the rest of his kennel, which at
                    that period contained a hundred couples of hounds. These Furrier hounds gave
                    little trouble in the entering of them, and proved very true line-hunters, and
                    every thing that fox-hounds should be. The annals of fox-hunting likewise record
                    similar instances of the peculiar properties of stallion hounds transmitting
                    their virtues to many succeeding generations, especially in the instances of the
                    Pychley Abelard, the Beaufort, and the New Forest Justice, Mr Ward’s Senator, Mr
                    Meynell’s Gusman, Mr Musters’s Collier, Mr Corbet’s Trojan, Lord Yarborough’s
                    Ranter, with many others of more recent days, but too numerous to mention
                    here.</p>
                <p>The size, or, we should rather say, the height, of a foxhound, is a point upon
                    which there has been much difference of opinion. The long-established pack of
                    the late Mr Chute were at least three inches below the standard of his neighbour
                    Mr Villebois’s large pack; also as much below that of his Grace the Duke of
                    Cleveland, who had for many years also a large and a small pack; and at least
                    four inches lower than Mr Warde’s, in whose kennel were hounds full twenty-six
                    inches high. Various arguments are made use of by the advocates of large and
                    small hounds. Those of the former assert that they get better across a deep and
                    strongly fenced country than smaller ones; whilst the admirers of the latter
                    insist upon their being better climbers of hills, more active in cover, and
                    quicker out of it when their fox is gone; and are oftener found to be perfect in
                    form and shape. As to uniformity in size, how pleasing soever it may be to the
                    eye, it is by no means essential to the welldoing of hounds in the field, and
                    has been disregarded by some of our first sportsmen, the great Mr Meynell for
                    one, who never drafted a good hound for being over or under size; neither did Mr
                    Assheton Smith, when he succeeded to his, Mr Meynell’s, country. The great
                    object of both was to breed them with muscular power and bone, combined with as
                    much symmetry as could be obtained; and •to be equal in speed and good
                    qualities, rather than equal in height.</p>
                <p>We consider the proper standard of height in fox-hounds to be from twenty-one to
                    twenty-two inches for bitches, and from twenty-three to twenty-four for dog
                    hounds. The minimum and maximum size of the last fifty years would have been
                    found in the kennels of Mr Chute and Mr Warde; the Duke of Cleveland and Mr
                    Villebois coming next to Mr Warde in what may be called the maximum class. Mr
                    Chute’s motto over his kennel door was, “multum in parvo,” which was his great
                    aim; and although very full of power, and particularly neat in appearance, his
                    hounds did not'more than average twenty-one inches. On the other hand, many of
                    Mr Warde’s bitches, the most splendid animals of their kind and sex the world
                    has ever yet seen, were better than twenty-three, and some of his dog hounds
                    twenty-six inches high, which <pb break="no" facs="nls:193648221"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0711-8221-0702"/>was about the standard of the original Devonshire
                    staghounds. It may be said of hounds, however, as h as been said of horses, that
                    their height has little to do wi th their size, as far at least as their powers
                    of action are concerned; and doubtless in all animals that labour, a medium
                    height is the best.</p>
                <p>The amount of hounds bred annually will depend on the strength of the kennel, and
                    the number of days hunting in the week which the country they are intended for
                    requires. From sixty to eighty couples are about the complement for a
                    four-days-a-week country, which will require the breeding of a hundred couples
                    of puppies every year, allowing the usual diminution of the entry by
                    malconformation, under size, and that bane to the kennel, the distemper, which
                    often takes off a moiety of them. As the period of gestation in the female dog
                    is somewhat over two calendar months, the fox-hound bitch should, if she can be
                    spared, be put to dog in January, as then she will litter in the spring, when
                    the weather is comparatively mild (cold being destructive of young animals of
                    this sort), and the puppies will then come early into kennel, generally be of
                    good size, and powerful; and be entered without loss of time. The tips of their
                    sterns being pinched off, and their dew-claws cut, whelps should be taken to
                    their walks at about two months old; and if to one where there is plenty of milk
                    or whey, they will be the better for it. Whelps walked at butchers’ houses grow
                    to a great size, but they are apt to be heavy-shouldered and throaty, and
                    otherwise out of shape. If possible to avoid it, puppies should never be tied
                    up, as perpetually drawing at the collar-chain throws their elbows out, and
                    otherwise damages their legs, particularly by spreading their feet, and altering
                    the form of their ancles, although it is sometimes almost impossible to avoid
                    it, from their proneness to do mischief. If old bitches are bred from, they
                    should be put to young dogs, and of course <hi rend="italic">vice versa</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">;</hi> and a bitch should not be worked for at least the last
                    month of her time; and immediately on her whelps being taken from her, a dose of
                    physic should be given her.</p>
                <p>It is said that the dog in a state of nature is subject to few diseases, and for
                    these he finds his cure by an instinctive faculty; in a domesticated state,
                    however, he is subject to many, and some of an awful nature, which maybe classed
                    among the <hi rend="italic">opprobria medicoum,</hi> no certain remedy being
                    discovered for them. Amongst these is one called the distemper, not known by our
                    forefathers, but at present become a sort of periodical disorder in kennels, to
                    the destruction of thousands of young hounds annually. The first symptoms of
                    this disease are, generally, a dry husky cough; want of appetite, and consequent
                    loss of flesh; extreme dulness, and a running from the nose and eyes. As the
                    disease advances, it is attended with twitchings of the head, while the animal
                    becomes excessively weak in the loins and hinder extremities; is greatly
                    emaciated; runs at the eyes and nose, and smells very offensively. At length the
                    twitchings assume the appearance of convulsive fits, accompanied with giddiness,
                    which cause the dog to turn round; he has a constant inclination to dung, with
                    obstinate costiveness at one time, or incessant purging at another. Finally, the
                    stomach becomes extremely irritable; every thing swallowed is instantly thrown
                    up; and the dog generally dies in a spasmodic fit.</p>
                <p>For the cure of this disorder many remedies have been prescribed; but as none of
                    them can be relied upon as specific, we decline giving them,<note

                    the following observations of an intelligent and experienced huntsman in the
                    service of a noble duke, accompanied by a comment upon it by a noble lord, also
                    a practical sportsman, hunting his own fox-hounds.</p>
                <p>“As soon,” says the former, “as the young hounds come in from quarters, a sharp
                    look-out is kept for the distemper; and as soon as any of its symptoms appear, a
                    dose of cold-drawn castor oil is given, and the following morning a dose of
                    calomel and jalap. About seven grains of the former and twenty of the latter
                    made into a bolus, and put over their throats before they have tasted any thing,
                    and their heads coupled up above the level of their bodies for two hours, so as
                    to prevent them from vomiting up the medicine, which they are certain to do if
                    this is not carefully attended to. They are then to have their broth and their
                    meat. The oil and bolus to be repeated in a day or two as symptoms require; that
                    is to say, if the fever runs high, repeat the bolus, and, if only to keep the
                    bowels open, the oil in small quantities. Indeed the great thing is attending to
                    circumstances, and acting accordingly; as, for instance, nothing can be more
                    different than when flux attends the distemper, and when fits and obstinate
                    costiveness is the case. I believe, however, that at first a good scouring in
                    both cases is of service. In flux, of course, don’t repeat the calomel, but take
                    moderate means to stop it, as flux in a minor degree tends to keep off both
                    fever and fits. To allay the flux, arrow-root, or boiled milk and flour
                    porridge. There is no doubt that laudanum is the surest method to stop it, but
                    then it is sure to end with fits. Fits at the beginning are no bad sign, and at
                    the end nothing can be worse. I never either approved of bleeding or vomiting in
                    the distemper; the first weakening too much, the latter creating and adding to
                    the irritableness of their stomachs.”</p>
                <p>“With the foregoing plain, sensible, and simple treatment,” says the noble lord
                    in his comment on the foregoing observations, “my junior experience perfectly
                    agrees with the opinion of; but I revert to what he justly adds about ‘
                    circumstances,’ and differ with him about the bleeding, as I think a good
                    scouring out, and bleeding, before any thing symptomatic of the disease has
                    fairly begun, highly commendable. But, <hi rend="italic">vice versa,</hi> for
                    instance, if you bleed after the disease has fairly taken root, the lungs, nine
                    cases in ten, being affected, it is ten to one you kill the dog; but if done
                    early in the day, I cannot but think it is of much service, prevents fever, and
                    in many cases makes the disease less violent. I think perhaps the treatment of
                    whelps, after they come in from their healthy walks to the close confinement of
                    sometimes an ill-kept kennel, is the cause of the distemper taking more violent
                    hold of ,them than it otherwise would do; and amongst the hundred pretended
                    receipts of many huntsmen, the remark is a justly correct one, of what <hi
                    rend="italic">may</hi> cure one dog will kill another. But here and his ‘
                    circumstances’ put you right. What might be advisable would be this: As soon as
                    your puppies come in, look them attentively over; divide the well-walked whelps
                    from those that have been ill walked; bleed and scour well out the fat lot,
                    paying of course attention to their diet, cleanliness, and exercise; and cherish
                    the poor lot by the best food, giving them the castor oil without the calomel or
                    the lancet. But a lot of well-bred fox-hound whelps are not to be left to the
                    care of a whipper-in or a boiler, unless he is a perfectly sober, attentive,
                    experienced man; for in this disease in the animal, as in the human species, the
                    patient must be most attentively and closely watched.” <pb break="no"

                    Management.</hi></p>
                <p>The management of hounds in kennel has undergone great changes for the better
                    since Mr Beckford’s day; and, divesting the mind of the inferiority of horse
                    flesh over cow or bullock flesh, the food of hounds, both in its nature and the
                    cooking of it, is such as man might not only not reject, if necessity compelled
                    him to have recourse to it, but such as he would thrive and do well upon. It is
                    a common expression, that “any thing will do for dogs,” and experience informs
                    us they will exist upon very miserable fare; but hounds, <hi rend="italic">to be
                    in condition,</hi> must have every thing good of its kind, and also well cooked.
                    Were a master of hounds, or huntsman, of the present day, to follow Beckford’s
                    advice, of putting his hounds to a horse fresh killed, after a hard day, his
                    brother sportsmen would think him mad; nor is there scarcely any thing now used
                    in our first-rate kennels but the best oatmeal (Scotch or Irish is the best),
                    one year old, and well-boiled horse flesh, quite free from taint. The meal is
                    put into the copper when the water boils, and should be boiled up a second time,
                    and, in all, for at least two hours; for nothing is worse for the wind of hounds
                    than meal not thoroughly boiled. When taken out of the boiler, it forms a
                    substance resembling coarse rice pudding; and when the fresh flesh, which is
                    shredded, and the broth in which it is boiled, are added to it in the trough,
                    and very well mixed, it forms the best and highest food that can be given to
                    hounds. In some kennels, after the example of that famous huntsman the late
                    Thomas Oldacre, the meal and flesh are boiled up together, with the idea that
                    more of the virtue of the flesh is then imparted to the meal than when it is
                    merely mixed with the broth; but the practice is not general. But such is the
                    difference of constitution in hounds, and the aptitude of some, over others, to
                    gain flesh, or become foul, persons who are particular as to the condition of
                    their pack have troughs filled accordingly, that is, one with thinner food than
                    another, for hounds of the former description. No animal in the world is so soon
                    up and down in his condition as the dog; and, strange as it may appear, the
                    effect of two or three extra mouthfuls of thick meat will be visible on some
                    hounds on the second day after they have eaten them. Nevertheless, the dog being
                    strictly a carnivorous animal, cannot stand hard work without flesh, which he
                    should have a fair allowance of once a day, according as his constitution may
                    require it. Some masters of hounds, however (the justly celebrated Mr Ralph
                    Lambton one of them), do not feed with flesh on the day before hunting, giving
                    only meal and broth; and this on the supposition that the faculty of scent is
                    more delicately susceptible without it. Young hounds lately come from walks
                    should be fed twice in the day, as they do not always, at first, take to kennel
                    food.</p>
                <p>Colonel Cook is thus explicit and correct on the subject of feeding hounds, and
                    their condition, the result of many years experience, and great attention to the
                    kennel. ’ * It is quite certain,” says he, “a hound too high in condition cannot
                    run a burst, neither can a poor half-starved one kill an afternoon fox; a hound,
                    therefore, cannot be considered as fit to be brought out, if he is either too
                    high or too low. I like to see their ribs, but their loins should be well filled
                    up, and they should be hollow in their flanks: he that is full in the flanks is
                    sure to be fat in the inside, and consequently not fit for work. The feeding of
                    hounds, and the bringing them to cover, able to run a burst, or kill an
                    afternoon fox, is not altogether a thing so easy as some people imagine; in
                    fact, it requires nearly as much trouble to get a hound into condition as it
                    does a horse; and if the greatest attention is not paid to this particular, you
                    cannot expect to catch many foxes. It is the condition of a hound which gives
                    him the advantage over the animal he hunts. Nevertheless their constitutions
                    diffe as much as those of the human species; some requir∣ thick food, others
                    thin; the same quantity which may ♭ requisite for Ranter, if given to Rallywood,
                    would rende him unable to run a yard. Some time before huntin (say about three
                    weeks), they should have plenty of wall ing exercise, and salts given them once
                    a week. If hound is at any time very foul, the following receipt i very
                    efficacious :—Three grains of Aethiops mineral, fiv grains of calomel, made into
                    a ball: the hound must c course be carefully kept from cold water.”</p>
                <p>In the summer time, when hounds are out of work, the do not require flesh more
                    than twice a week, and succu lent vegetables in their food areat this time
                    useful. The are also physicked and bled at the close of one season, an&lt;
                    before the commencement of the next; and, if necessary dressed over with a
                    sulphureous mixture during the idl. months. But some owners of hounds, and
                    huntsmen object to dressing them, conceiving that it opens then pores too much,
                    and subjects them to rheumatic affee tions.</p>
                <p>One recent and great improvement in kennel disciplin¢ is, a small reservoir of
                    water within the walls, of sufficient depth to cleanse the legs of hounds, but
                    not to wel their bodies, which they are made to walk through immediately on
                    their coming home. Upon being turned inte their lodging room, they commence
                    licking themselves dry, which, as a dog’s tongue is proverbially called his
                    “doctor,” is most beneficial to their feet, by clearing them of sand or gravel,
                    as well as healing any trifling wounds which they may have received. In the Duke
                    of Cleveland’s kennel, this reservoir is filled with broth, which, in addition
                    to its healing properties, induces hounds to lick their feet still more than
                    water does. In flinty countries, the feet of hounds are very frequently wounded,
                    which is a great disadvantage to those a little inclined to do wrong, as they
                    are compelled to miss their turn, and so get above themselves. It also obliges a
                    gentleman to keep a larger number of hounds than this country would otherwise
                    require.</p>
                <p>Hounds are fed on the day before hunting about eleven o’clock <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">a. μ.,</hi> but some delicate feeders require to be let into
                    the troughs a second time. After hunting, they are fed as soon as they have
                    licked themselves dry, which, by the warmth that arises from their bodies when
                    shut up, is very soon effected; and in the summer time it is reckoned safer to
                    feed them in the evening, as they then rest quieter throughout the night, and
                    are less disposed to quarrel.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Colour of Hounds.</hi></p>
                <p>Independently of the justness and elegance of figure in animals, which adapt them
                    to the uses or ends of their creation, nature has been profuse in the adornment
                    of the surface of their bodies by various beautiful colours. But in proof that
                    the Creator never errs from his design in any of the qualities he has
                    communicated to his creatures, and that he adorns not merely for the sake of
                    ornament alone, these beauties conferred upon them are found greatly to
                    contribute to their well-being; for with them they have received the
                    consciousness of possessing, and a desire to preserve them. In fact, it is this
                    which attaches them so closely to their being, and renders them so attentive to
                    cleanse, ornament, and take care of themselves, as we every day see they do; and
                    to preserve, in all its lustre, the enamel which nature has given them. And we
                    may <hi rend="italic">go</hi> even one step farther than this. An. accurate
                    observer of animals will perceive, that they are not only conscious of their own
                    beauty, but are capable of beholding and admiring it in others. This is
                    undoubtedly the case with regard to both sexes of the same species: never are
                    they so atten <pb break="no" facs="nls:193648247" xml:id="kp-eb0711-8247-0704"
                    />tive to display the graces which nature has bestowed upon them, never are they
                    so ostentatious, as when they are together, which is evident from their gambols
                    and frolics; and, if we may judge of them from our own feelings, how greatly
                    must this disposition contribute to their mutual felicity.</p>
                <p>In no animal is variety of colours more conspicuous than in hounds, and it adds
                    greatly to their appearance when we see them in a body in the kennel, but still
                    more so in the field. The prevailing ones with the fox-hound are these: Tan (not
                    common); black (not common); black and white and tan (the most common); milk
                    white (not common); red (very rare); blue (the same). Next come the blended, or
                    mixed colours, known in the kennel as “pies.” There is the red pie; the blue
                    pie; the yellow pie; the grey pie; the lemon pie (very handsome); the hare pie;
                    and the badger pie, which last is very characteristic of the fox-hound. The
                    fox-hound is sometimes ticked, that is, his coat is dotted with small white
                    specks on a dark ground, but he is rarely what is called “mottled” (motley);
                    and, we believe, what is known by <hi rend="italic">“a</hi> blue mottled hound”
                    is not to be found among fox-hounds, being peculiar to harriers and beagles.
                    There was for many years a pack of “blue mottled” harriers kept near Croydon, in
                    Surrey.</p>
                <p>It is asserted that the original colour of the English fox-hound was fallow, or
                    pale yellow (Shakspeare speaks of a fallow <hi rend="italic">greyhound)</hi>;
                    and we are inclined to this opinion from its being spoken of in several old
                    works upon hunting, as the “best colour for hounds that hunt the hart or roe ;”
                    and there can be no doubt of our fox-hounds being originally descended from that
                    breed of dog, be it what it may. As we know that a recurrence to original colour
                    frequently takes place in animals and 15irds, after its disappearance throughout
                    several generations, this may probably account for the various pied hounds we
                    see in kennels, the produce of hounds of distinct colours, perhaps merely black
                    and white, and often of those nearly black. Moreover, at Ashdown Park, in
                    Berkshire, an old seat of the Craven family, there is a picture of a pack of
                    fox-hounds, above a hundred years old, in which every hound is either fallow
                    coloured or red.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">The Tongue, or Cry of Hounds.</hi></p>
                <p>During the early stages of mental progress, the ear is of more importance to man
                    than the eye. Indeed at all times sounds, by association, become the signs of
                    ideas; and the great variety in the voice of nature must have been designed to
                    meet the peculiar tastes and purposes of the countless multitudes that dwell on
                    the face of the earth. That the cry of hounds is a voluntary noise, proceeding
                    from a powerful organic impulse, is quite apparent, as is also the purpose for
                    which the impulse is given; namely, to announce their having discovered the
                    scent of an animal, either obnoxious to their notice, or desirable as food, and
                    by calling their straggling companions together, and uniting their forces, the
                    better to enable them to secure their prey. On the other hand, here is mercy
                    shown to the prey they are in pursuit of. The tongue of the hound gives notice
                    of his approach; and he does not pounce upon his victim as the silent greyhound
                    does, which Gratius, in his poem on coursing, alludes to in the following verse
                    :—</p>
                <p>“Sic canis illa suos taciturna supervenit hostes.”</p>
                <p>But the cry of hounds, melodious and heart-cheering as it even now is, has lost
                    much of its poetical interest, from the change man has made in the natural
                    organization of the animal from which it proceeds; and we shall never again hear
                    of a master of a pack, after the manner of Ad- ' dison’s knight, returning a
                    hound that had been given to him as an “excellent bass,” whereas the note he
                    wanted was a “counter-tenor.” The great Beckford, however, was something of the
                    worthy knight’s opinion; for he says, in his <hi rend="italic">Thoughts upon
                    Hunting,</hi><hi rend="italic">“</hi><hi rend="italic">If</hi> we attended more
                    to the variety of the notes frequently to be met with in the tongues of hounds,
                    it might greatly add to the harmony of the pack.” This is well in theory. The
                    natural organization of the dog is musical; he is, in fact, a victim to musical
                    sensibility; and we may reasonably suppose that the notes of his companions in
                    the chase may be as pleasing to himself as to his huntsman; but we more than
                    doubt whether a huntsman of this day would draft a highly-bred and beautiful
                    young bitch, as good too as she looks to be, merely because her light,
                    fox-hunting tongue might be somewhat drowned, and now and then lost, in the
                    general chorus of the pack. He would rather say, “<hi rend="italic">Let every
                    tongue be α fox,</hi><note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p><hi rend="italic">“</hi><hi rend="italic">Every</hi> tongue a fox,” is a
                    well-known sporting phrase.</p></note> and I’ll leave the rest to chance.” But,
                    on a good day for hearing it, what <hi rend="italic">natural</hi> sound is more
                    delightful and animating than that of hounds in full cry, in the deep recesses
                    of an echo-giving wood? Neither would those writers who have availed themselves
                    of the beauty and sublimity which allusions to sounds in nature stamp on their
                    various compositions, have at all descended from their eminence if they had,
                    like Shakspeare, delighted as much in bringing the soul in contact with such a
                    sound as this, as with the rolling of the thunder, or the howling of the
                    storm.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">The Age of Hounds.</hi></p>
                <p>The dog exhibits no exact criteria of age after the first two years, during which
                    time the whiteness and evenness of his teeth are a pretty certain test of his
                    not exceeding that period. An old hound, however, cannot be mistaken if only
                    looked in the face, where he shows old age nearly as distinctly as man. As to
                    the length of services of hounds, that depends upon circumstances. Few are found
                    in a kennel after their eighth year, and <hi rend="italic">very few</hi> after
                    their ninth; and not many hard-working hounds can “run up,” or keep pace with
                    the rest, after their fifth season at most. Hounds are in their prime in the
                    third and fourth years; and although there are a few instances, such as Sir
                    Richard Sulton’s Lucifer, the Beaufort Nector, and the Cheshire Villager, of
                    their hunting in their twelfth, eleventh, and tenth year, the average of their
                    work cannot, we fear, be placed beyond four seasons. Old hounds are useful in
                    the field, but when they cannot run up with the pack, they should be drafted.
                    The perfection of a pack consists in the great body of it being composed of
                    hounds <hi rend="italic">quite in their prime.</hi><hi rend="italic">Separation
                    of the Sexes.</hi></p>
                <p>The separation of the sexes in the kennel <hi rend="italic">and in the field</hi>
                    is one of the late innovations in the sporting world, and generally considered
                    as a good one. In the first place, it pleases the eye to see a pack of hounds
                    nearly all of a size, which cannot be the case when it is composed of dogs and
                    bitches mixed; and the character of the animal is likewise more uniformly
                    displayed when confined to one individual sex. Secondly, by the total separation
                    of dogs and bitches in the kennel and in the field, the former are less inclined
                    to quarrel, and the latter are more at their ease, than when subject to the
                    constant, and, at times, importunate solicitations, of the male sex. Of their
                    performances in the field, however, when taken into it separately, some
                    difference of opinion exists; and each <pb break="no" facs="nls:193648260"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0711-8260-0705"/>sex has its advocates. With a good fox before
                    them, and a warm scent, bitches are decidedly quicker, and more off hand in
                    their work, than dog hounds; but with a colder scent, or at fault, the general
                    opinion is, that they are not <hi rend="smallcaps">bo</hi> patient, and more
                    given to over-run it. That they are superior in “<hi rend="italic">dash”</hi>
                    which, Beckford says, is the distinctive characteristic of a fox-hound, we
                    bejieve is universally acknowledged; and a celebrated master of hounds,<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Sir Bellingham Graham, Bart,
                    of Norton Conyers, Yorkshire.</p></note> who hunted them himself several seasons
                    in Leicestershire, has been heard frequently to say, that if his kennel would
                    have afforded it, he would never have taken a dog hound into the field. That, in
                    the canine race, the female has more of elegance and symmetry of form,
                    consequently more of speed, than the male, is evident to a common observer; but
                    there is nothing to lead us to the conclusion, that, in the natural endowment of
                    the senses, any superiority exists. It is however remarkable, that the Latins,
                    when speaking of hunting, or “sporting dogs,” as we call them, generally use the
                    feminine gender, one instance of which is to be found in the second ode of the
                    fifth book of Horace <hi rend="italic">(multa</hi><hi rend="italic">cane),</hi>
                    which ode every sportsman ought to read, as it gives so pleasing a picture of a
                    country life.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Names.</hi></p>
                <p>The naming of hounds and horses has nearly exhausted human invention, as well as
                    classical research. Beckford furnishes a list of more than eight hundred names
                    for hounds, alphabetically arranged. But the naming of hounds is somewhat under
                    metrical control; for it is not only confined to words of two and three
                    syllables, but their quantity, or rather their time, must be consulted. For
                    example, a dactyl, as <hi rend="italic">Lucifer,</hi> answers well for the
                    latter; but who could holloa to <hi rend="italic">Aurora?</hi> a trochee, or an
                    iambus, is necessary for the former, the spondee dwelling too long on the tongue
                    to be applied smartly to a hound. But there ought to be a nomenclator, as of
                    old, at every kennel door; for it is but few persons unconnected with a pack
                    that can recollect their names until after a rather long acquaintance with them,
                    from the great similarity of form, character; as well as sometimes of colour,"
                    in old-established kennels. “How is it possible,” said a young master of
                    fox-hounds a few years ago, “that I should distinguish every hound in my kennel
                    by his name, when I find <hi rend="italic">three</hi> spots on one side of their
                    body, and <hi rend="italic">five</hi> perhaps on the other ?” There have been,
                    however, and still are, persons who can see a large kennel of hounds <hi
                    rend="italic">once</hi> drawn to their feeding troughs, and call them all by
                    their names afterwards, the result alone of a keen and practised eye.</p>
                <p>The price of hounds is strangely altered within the space of half a century, or
                    less; and on this subject we cannot do better than quote Colonel Cook. “Hounds,”
                    says he (p. 6), “have always been much undervalued; we sometimes hear of eight
                    hundred or even a thousand guineas as the price of a hunter, and the sum of
                    three or four hundred is often considered as a mere trifle; whereas a pack of
                    hounds, <hi rend="italic">on which every thing depends,</hi><hi rend="italic
                    smallcaps"> ∖nvls</hi> only considered worth a few hundreds. Yet Shakspeare
                    himself appears to have known the value of a hound; for in his “Induction” to
                    the <hi rend="italic">Taming of the Shrew,</hi> a nobleman returned from hunting
                    thus speaks of his hounds with delight to his huntsman:</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Nobleman.</hi> Huntsman, I charge thee, tender well my hounds;
                    Brach Merriman,—the poor cur is emboss’d, And couple Clowder with the
                    deep-raouth’d brach.</p>
                <p>Saw’st thou not, boy, how Silver made it good, At the hedge-corner, in the
                    coldest fault?</p>
                <p>I would not lose the dog for <hi rend="italic">twenty pound.</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Huntsman.</hi> Why, Belman is as good as he, my lord; He cried
                    upon it at the meerest loss, And twice to-day pick’d out the dullest scent;
                    Trust me, I take him for the better dog.</p>
                <p>“The sum of twenty pounds for a single hound in Shakspeare’s time,” continues the
                    colonel, “and that not the best in the pack either, was no inconsiderable price.
                    I am not alluding to <hi rend="superscript"> i</hi> a lot of curs ;’ but surely
                    a well-bred, established pack of fox-hounds, including brood bitches, and
                    puppies at walk, must be cheap at a thousand or twelve hundred pounds.”</p>
                <p>Now the value of anything is what it will fetch; and how far an established pack
                    of fox-hounds is cheap at a thousand or twelve hundred pounds, is a matter <hi
                    rend="italic">of</hi> consideration with reference to concomitant circumstances;
                    but that they will have cost the seller a great deal more, there can be no
                    doubt. We should put the average price at something less than either of the
                    above sums, although, within the last dozen years, several packs have been sold
                    for the former sum; and the justly renowned one of Mr Warde, the present Father
                    of the Field, fetched two thousand guineas; and the late Lord Middleton gave Mr
                    Osbaldeston the same sum for ten couples of hounds out of his kennel.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">The Harrier.</hi></p>
                <p>The modern harrier bears no greater resemblance to the one in use fifty years
                    back, than the hunter of the present day to that ridden by our grandfathers. In
                    fact, he is now nothing less than the fox-hound in miniature, which it is the
                    endeavour of all breeders to have him. Their qualities also are as opposite as
                    their form, the one delighting to dwell upon the scent, the other a little
                    inclined, perhaps, to the other extreme. But the taste of the day for all sports
                    of the field would not endure the tedious exactness of the old psalm-singing
                    harrier; and not only in point of diversion, but on the score of the <hi
                    rend="italic">pot,</hi> the balance is greatly in favour of the improved
                    variety. Before the old-fashioned harrier, the hare had time to play all sorts
                    of tricks, to double on her foil, and so stain the ground that she often escaped
                    by such means; whereas the modern hound, if the scent be tolerably good, forces
                    her from her foil to fly the country, and very often beyond her knowledge, when
                    a good straightforward run is the almost invariable result. The observation of
                    Mr Beckford holds good here. He could not, he said, imagine a hound too <hi
                    rend="italic">well</hi> bred to show sport, and kill his game; but he could
                    readily conceive the reverse, when the game ran stout and well.</p>
                <p>To Sir John Dashwood King, Bart, of West Wycombe Park, Bucks, is the credit due
                    for what may be termed the living model of the present improved harrier; and so
                    characteristically stamped are his sort of hound, now widely spread, that they
                    are recognised by a sportsman at the first glance. Their standard height did not
                    exceed eighteen inches, and therefore, in that respect, they were not an
                    overmatch for their game; but from the great equality of their size and speed,
                    combined with rare hunting qualities, they killed more hares, with good runs,
                    than any other pack in the kingdom, and for many, many years in succession
                    certainly “bore the bell.” Sir John kept them more than thirty years, at
                    Bourton-on-the-Hill, Gloucestershire, near the four-shire stone on the Oxford
                    and Worcester road, where his father kept them before him; hunting partly in the
                    vales of Warwickshire and Worcestershire, and partly over the Cotswold Hills,
                    which latter country is famous for the stoutness of its hares, frequently
                    standing an hour before this celebrated pack, after having been driven beyond<pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193648273" xml:id="kp-eb0711-8273-0706"/> their knowledge
                    by their <hi rend="italic">pressing</hi> method of hunting up to them, a method
                    quite unpractised by the old long-cared harrier. The parent stock of this pack
                    was a small fox-hound from the Duke of Grafton’s kennel, called Tyrant, whose
                    blood, form, and character, were strikingly apparent throughout; and so great
                    was its celebrity, that it fetched the highest price ever known to be given for
                    harriers, namely, seven hundred guineas, by Lord Soudes of Rockingham Castle,
                    Northamptonshire. Sir John, however, deserved success. He bred upwards of
                    seventy couples of hounds every year, and had an establishment of horses,
                    &amp;c. nearly equal to fox-hounds. The harehounds bred for many years by Mr
                    Yeatman of Stock House, Dorsetshire (who lately resigned the Blackmore vale
                    country, in which he hunted foxes), came next to Sir John’s in the true form and
                    character of the modern harrier.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">The Stag-Hound.</hi></p>
                <p>The English stag-hound is now known only by name, as there are none of the breed
                    kept for the purpose of hunting the wild stag; and such deer as are turned out
                    before his majesty’s, and the few other packs that follow this game, are hunted
                    by fox-hounds of the highest blood that can be procured. And the change is a
                    good one; for although the English stag-hound was a noble animal of his kind, he
                    was not sufficiently speedy, nor perfect in his work, to satisfy the present
                    taste, and he was likewise too much given to dwell on the scent in chase, as
                    well as of very delicate constitution in kennel. He is originally supposed to be
                    the produce of the old English blood-hound, by a cross of some kind of
                    greyhound, such as the Highland deer-greyhound, approximating his own form. At
                    all events, it is certain that the former, the blood-hound, was the dog first
                    made use of in hunting deer in England; and it is probable that, as the taste
                    for following hounds on horseback increased, a turn of speed was given to the
                    original breed by a cross with a speedier sort. We may add, the old paintings of
                    English stag-hunting favour this hypothesis.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">The Beagle.</hi></p>
                <p>This variety of the dog is now nearly extinct, and for the same cause as the
                    stag-hound. Time is at present considered as too precious to afford an hour at
                    least, and perhaps two, to the hunting down one hare, which is now accomplished
                    in a more off-hand manner, in twenty minutes. To an admirer of nature, however,
                    and of the endowments given to inferior animals, the busy, intelligent, and
                    highly-gifted beagle certainly affords a treat. His form, also, when not out at
                    his elbows, is handsome in the extreme, and his perseverance in chase is
                    exceeded by none. But he has one of the greatest faults that hounds can possess;
                    he is noisy, and dwells upon the scent, whilst his game is flying the country
                    before him. In fact, his only use or value now is (independently of being looked
                    at and admired, for he is a perfect animal of his kind), to accompany a brace of
                    greyhounds when a hare is wanted, and not ready at hand. There is, however, one
                    pack of beagles kept in Dorsetshire, known as the Mountain Harriers, whose
                    performances are much spoken of in the sporting world.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">The Greyhound.</hi></p>
                <p>The greyhound has now lost his place in the catalogue of the dogs used in chase,
                    neither can be classed as such, since man has deprived him of the necessary
                    faculty of smell; but he was held in such high estimation in the middle ages, as
                    to be considered as the peculiar companion of a gentleman. He never went abroad
                    without these dogs; the hawk which he bore upon his fist, and the greyhounds
                    which ran before him, were certain testimonies of his rank; and in the ancient
                    pipe rolls, payments appear to have been often made in these valuable animals.
                    But at no period of his existence was the greyhound the symmetrically elegant
                    animal we now see him, nor possessed of nearly so much speed; neither was the
                    diversion of the leash at any time carried on with so much spirit as within the
                    space of the last thirty years, in various parts of Great Britain. But the
                    necessity for, or rather the cause of, the change in the form of the greyhound,
                    may be traced to his being no longer, as formerly, made use of to course and
                    pull down deer, but chiefly to exhibit his speed at our different spirited
                    coursing meetings, for the various prizes contended for, as also in private
                    matches.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Courser s Manual or Stud Book,</hi> by Thomas Goodlake,
                    Esq. (1828), has the following interesting passages on the alteration effected
                    in this species of dog. “In the days of Elizabeth,” says the author, “the
                    greyhound seems to have been a fine and effective animal, but approaching more
                    to the bony, wire-haired make of the Highland greyhound represented in the
                    pictures of Edwin Landseer, and deficient in the symmetry and fine glossy coat
                    which mark a high-bred kennel of modern times. It is probable, that during the
                    early part of the seventeenth century, judicious crosses were made, partly from
                    the beautiful Italian greyhounds, which we often see in family pictures,
                    accompanying our fair ancestresses in their parks and plaisances, and partly
                    from the stouter breed of dogs represented in Flemish hunting-pieces; and that
                    even Persia and Arabia, whose greyhounds are not to be despised in point of form
                    and speed, contributed their quota of blood; as it is shown by the history of
                    Cromwell’s Coffin Nail, that the wealthier gentry of that period spared no
                    expense or pains in improving the more highly-prized breeds of sporting animals.
                    If we mistake not, some of the pictures of Charles the First contain portraits
                    of greyhounds approaching nearly in point of coat and shape to the present
                    breed.”</p>
                <p>Speaking of the late Lord Orford, who, with respect to modern coursing, laid the
                    foundation-stone of the celebrity to which it has arrived, and who, besides
                    being celebrated for his greyhounds, established the first coursing club that we
                    read of, at Swaffham in Norfolk, in the year 1776, the same writer says, “A few
                    anecdotes of this noble patron of coursing may not be uninteresting. He was
                    passionately fond of the sport; and as he was a man who never would do things by
                    halves, but was zealous beyond measure in succeeding in whatever he undertook,
                    he may be said to have made as much progress as possible in perfecting the breed
                    of the greyhound, and encouraging an emulative spirit in coursing amongst his
                    opulent neighbours, from the time he took it up till his death. Indeed, his
                    extensive property, and his influence as lord-lieutenant of Norfolk, gave him
                    the greatest means of accomplishing his favourite object. He could command such
                    an immensity of private quarters, or walks as they are generally called, for
                    greyhounds, that he bred largely, and few possessed the same advantages of
                    selection. He is recorded as. having at one time fifty brace of greyhounds; and
                    it was his fixed rule never to part with a single whelp till he had had a fair
                    trial of his speed; consequently he had chances beyond almost any other
                    individual, of having a collection of very superior dogs. Intent on obtaining as
                    much perfection in the breed as possible, he introduced every experimental
                    cross, from the English lurcher to the Italian greyhound. He it was that first
                    thought of the cross with the English bull-dog, in which he persevered in
                    opposition to every opinion, until, after breeding on for seven removes, he
                    found himself in possession of the best greyhounds at the time ever known; and
                    he considered that this cross produced the small ear, the rat-tail, the fine,

                    should possess, preferring death to relinquishing the chase.” There is something
                    curiously analogous in the sense conveyed by the concluding words of this
                    extract. His lordship fell dead from his horse immediately after witnessing the
                    triumph of his famous bitch Czarina, in a match at Swaffham, having been in vain
                    admonished on the impropriety of taking the field in his then indifferent state
                    of health; and his memory is introduced as a toast at most coursing meetings, as
                    father and patron of the sport.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">The Terrier.</hi></p>
                <p>The terrier is no longer the accompaniment to a pack of fox-hounds, and for the
                    best of all reasons,—foxes are not nearly so often digged for as formerly; and
                    his only use was, by his bay, to inform the diggers whereabouts the fox lay; and
                    we suppose he took his name from his being so eager to get under ground. There
                    is also a second reason why he is better left at home. He was seldom steady from
                    <hi rend="italic">icing, if</hi> he was from <hi rend="italic">foot,</hi> and
                    thus often the cause of riot. It was, however, a matter of astonishment to
                    behold those which were very highly bred, making their way, as they did, to the
                    end of the longest chases, over strong and wet countries, as well as through the
                    thickest covers, and so often making their appearance at the end of them. At all
                    events, if left behind, they were sure to find their way home in the course of
                    the night, whatever the distance might be. One peculiarity of form was essential
                    to their being sure of getting up to their fox, viz. not too full in the
                    shoulder; and those whose colour was pure white, and who were broken-haired,
                    were generally most esteemed by huntsmen. It was often their lot to lose their
                    life, by scratching up the earth behind them, and cutting off their means of
                    retreat; and they were now and then killed by a fox, the latter a rare
                    occurrence. They were commonly entered to a badger, whose bite is more dangerous
                    than that of a fox.</p>
