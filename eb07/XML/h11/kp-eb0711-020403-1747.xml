                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra

                <p><label type="entry">HECATAEUS</label>, an ancient historian of Miletus, in Asia
                    Minor. The exact period of his birth and death is unknown, but the active part
                    he took in the affairs of his country proves that he flourished about 500 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b. c.,</hi> at a time when the Ionians were attempting to throw
                    off’ the yoke of the Persians, who were then governed by Darius. He was the son
                    of Hegesandrus (Suid.), and descended of a noble family. Like Herodotus, whom he
                    preceded only by a few years, he visited many countries, and, making himself
                    acquainted with the peculiarities of their customs, and the history of different
                    nations, he wrote numerous works on these subjects. (Herodot· ii. 143.) We find
                    Hecataeus present at the deliberations of the Ionians, 501 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >b. c.,</hi> before they revolted against Darius, when he pointed out to his
                    countrymen the folly of their intended proceedings. War, however, was resolved
                    on at all hazards, and Hecataeus then recommended that they should devote their
                    attention to secure maritime supremacy. This advice was also neglected; and, 497
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">b c.,</hi> Aristagoras, who headed the war faction, was
                    obliged to fly, being a short time afterwards slain in Thrace (v. 36, 125).
                    Hecataeus was one of the earliest writers in prose, and is said by Porphyry to
                    have furnished materials for the history of Herodotus. His works were divided
                    into three classes; histories, genealogies, and geographical pieces. The
                    fragments, which are numerous, have been collected by Creuzer, <hi rend="italic"

                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Hecataeus,</hi> a native of Abdera, in Thrace, who was a
                    contemporary of Alexander the Great, and lived at the court of Ptolemy, son of
                    Lagus king of Egypt <hi rend="smallcaps">(b. c.</hi> 323- 283). He had there an
                    opportunity of becoming acquainted with the Jewish nation; for, after the battle
                    of Gaza, where Ptolemy defeated Demetrius Poliorcetes, the whole of Palestine
                    came into the possession of the king of Egypt; and a large body of Jews, charmed
                    by the humanity and moderation of Ptolemy, went along with him into Egypt, and,
                    amongst others, the high-priest Hezekiah. From him it would appear that
                    Hecataeus received such minute information respecting the customs and habits of
                    his countrymen, that he was induced to write a detailed history of the Jews.
                    Both Josephus (Ap. i. 22, ii. 4) and Eusebius have preserved passages which are
                    of great value, as confirming the accounts which we have elsewhere received of
                    that people. In this work he described the nature and position of the country of
                    Palestine, and gave an account of their fastnesses, Jerusalem, the temple, with
                    the remarkable customs of the people and priests. In later times it has become a
                    matter of dispute whether we ought to consider this work as the genuine
                    production of Hecataeus. Scaliger regarded it as spurious, following the opinion
                    of Herennius Philo, as quoted by Origen <hi rend="italic">{Contr. Cels.</hi>
                    lib. i∙); but we think that Sainte Croix <hi rend="italic">{Exam. Grit, des
                    Hist, d</hi> ’ <hi rend="italic">Alexandre,</hi> p. 558) has completely proved
                    that it is the work of the author whose name it bears. (See <hi rend="italic"
