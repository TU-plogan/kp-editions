                    significant corrections to the OCR text, predominantly in cases of confusing "c"
                    and "e." Isolates 90 entries that were mistakenly included at the end of prior
                    entries in v1 and v2. Normalizes ordinal numbers. Separates metadata in
                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra
                    space around the <gi>pb</gi> tag. Where a word is hyphenated at a <gi>pb</gi>,
                    the end fragment is now joined to the start fragment, making a machine-readable
                    word.</change>

                <p><label type="entry">HUTCHESON, <hi rend="smallcaps">Dr Francis</hi></label>, an
                    eminent philosopher, was the son of a dissenting minister in the north of
                    Ireland, and was born on the 8th of August 1694. He early discovered a superior
                    capacity; ∙and having gone through a school education, began his course of
                    philosophy at an academy, whence he removed to the university of Glasgow, where
                    he applied himself to the study of literature, in which his progress was
                    commensurate with his uncommon abilities.</p>
                <p>He then returned to Ireland, and having entered into the ministry, was just about
                    to be settled in a small congregation of dissenters in the north of Ireland,
                    when some gentlemen near Dublin, who knew his great abilities and virtues,
                    invited him to open a private academy in that city. He complied with this
                    invitation, and met with entire success. He had been established but a short
                    time in Dublin, when his singular merits and accomplishments made him generally
                    known; and his acquaintance was sought by men of all ranks who had any taste for
                    literature, or any respect for learned men. Lord Viscount Molesworth is said to
                    have taken great pleasure in his conversation, and to have assisted him with his
                    criticisms and observations upon his Inquiry into the Ideas of Beauty and
                    Virtue, before it was published. He received the same favour from Dr Synge,
                    bishop of Elphin, with whom he also lived in close friendship. The first edition
                    of this work appeared without the author’s name, but the merit of the
                    performance was such that he could not long remain concealed. So great was the
                    reputation of the work, and the ideas it had raised of the author, that Lord
                    Granville, who was then lord lieutenant of Ireland, sent his private secretary
                    to inquire at the bookseller’s for the author, and when he could not learn his
                    name, he left a letter to be conveyed to him; in consequence of which Hutcheson
                    soon became acquainted with his excellency, and was treated by him, all the time
                    he continued in the government, with distinguished marks of favour and
                    esteem.</p>
                <p>From this time his acquaintance began to be still more courted by men of
                    distinction, whether for station or for literature, in Ireland. Archbishop King,
                    the author of the well-known book <hi rend="italic">De Origine</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Mali,</hi> held him in high esteem; and the friendship of that
                    prelate was of great use to him in screening him from two different attempts
                    made to prosecute him for daring to take upon him the education of youth,
                    without having qualified himself by subscribing the ecclesiastical canons, and
                    obtaining a license from the bishops. He also enjoyed a large share in the
                    esteem of the primate Boulter, who through his influence made a donation to the
                    university of Glasgow, of a yearly fund for an exhibitioner, to be bred to any
                    of the learned professions. A few years afζgr the publication of his Inquiry
                    into the Ideas of Beauty and Virtue, his Treatise on the Passions was published.
                    Both these works have often been reprinted, and always admired for the sentiment
                    and language, even by those who have not assented to the philosophy they teach,
                    nor allowed it to have any foundation in nature. About this time he wrote some
                    philosophical papers accounting for laughter, in a way different from that
                    suggested by Hobbes, and more honourable to human nature; which papers were
                    published in the collection called <hi rend="italic">Letters of
                    Hibernicus.</hi></p>

                <p>After he had taught in a private academy at Dublin for seven or eight years with
                    great reputation and success, he was in the year 1729 called to Scotland to
                    become pro· fessor of ethical philosophy in the university of Glasgow. Several
                    young gentlemen came along with him from the academy, and his high reputation
                    drew many more thither both from England and Ireland. Here he spent the
                    remainder of his life, in a manner highly honourable to himself, and ornamental
                    to the university of which he was a member. His time was divided between his
                    studies and the duties of his office, except what he allotted to friendship and
                    society. A firm constitution, and a pretty uniform state of good health, except
                    some few slight attacks of the gout, seemed to promise a long life; yet he did
                    not survive the fifty-third year of his age. He was married, soon after his
                    settlement in Dublin, to Mrs Mary Wilson, a gentleman’s daughter in the county
                    of Longford, by whom he left one son, Francis Hutcheson, doctor of medicine, who
                    published, from the original manuscript of his father, A System of Moral
                    Philosophy, in three books, by Francis Hutcheson, LL. D. Glasgow, 1755, in two
                    volumes 4to. See the Dissertations prefixed to this Work by Mr Dugald Stewart
                    and Sir James Mackintosh.</p>
