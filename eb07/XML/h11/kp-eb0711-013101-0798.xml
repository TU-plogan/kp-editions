                <p><label type="entry">HANDEL, <hi rend="smallcaps">George Frederick</hi></label>,
                    the most illustrious of all musical composers, was born at Halle, in Upper
                    Saxony, on the 24th of February 1684. His father was an eminent physician of the
                    same place, and upwards of sixty years old when this son, the issue of a second
                    marriage, was born. From his very childhood Handel discovered a passion for
                    music which could not be subdued by the commands of his father, who intended him
                    for the profession of the law. Notwithstanding that he was forbidden to touch a
                    musical instrument, the boy found means to get a little clavichord conveyed
                    secretly into one of the attics of the house. To this room he constantly
                    repaired when the family had retired to rest, and, by his assiduous labours at
                    the midnight hour, made considerable progress in his favourite pursuit.</p>
                <p>It happened, when Handel was about seven years old, that his father had occasion
                    to pay a visit to a son by a former wife, who was then serving as attendant to
                    the Duke of Saxe-Weissenfells. Handel implored that he might be permitted to
                    accompany him; and, on being refused, he followed the carriage some way on the
                    road, till he overtook it. His father at first chid him for his disobedience;
                    but, yielding to his solicitations, at last took him into the carriage. During
                    his stay at the ducal residence, he continued to show the same irresistible
                    inclination for music. He could not be kept away from harpsichords, and he
                    contrived to gain admission into the organ gallery at church, and to play when
                    the service was over. Upon one of these occasions, the duke happening to leave
                    the chapel later than usual, was attracted by the uncommon style in which the
                    instrument was touched. Inquiring who played, he heard to his astonishment that
                    it was a boy of seven years of age. The duke immediately desired to see young
                    Handel, and was so much pleased with his precocious genius, that he prevailed
                    upon his father to allow him to follow the bent of his inclinations. He made the
                    boy a present, and told him that if he was attentive to his studies he should
                    not want encouragement.</p>
                <p>On his return to Halle, Handel was placed by his father under Zachau, organist of
                    the cathedral church of that city; a man of considerable abilities, and proud of
                    his pupil. By the time he was nine years old, our young musician was not only
                    able to supply his master’s place at the organ, but began to study composition.
                    At this early period of his life, he wrote a service, or <hi rend="italic"
                    >spiritual cantata, every</hi> week, for voices and instruments, and continued
                    this labour for three years successively. He also composed sonatas for the oboe,
                    which was his favourite instrument.</p>
                <p>Handel appears to have studied in his native city till he was about the age of
                    fourteen. He then, as Zachau himself acknowledged, far excelled his master; and
                    it was recommended to his father to send him to Berlin. Thither he accordingly
                    went in 1698. The opera at Berlin was then in a very flourishing state, under
                    the direction of Buononcini and Attilio. Handel distinguished himself in this
                    city as an astonishing musician for his years, and gave earnest of such great
                    talents, that the elector of Brandenburg offered to take him into his service,
                    and send him to Italy to complete his studies. But his father declining this
                    honour, from a spirit of independence, Handel returned to Halle. Not long after
                    this, his father died, and Handel not being able to go to Italy on account of
                    the expense, removed to Hamburg, in order, by his musical talents, to procure a
                    subsistence.</p>
                <p>Mattheson, an able musician and voluminous writer on the subject of music, who
                    resided at Hamburg, tells us that Handel arrived there in the summer of 1703.
                    “Here,” says Mattheson, “almost his first acquaintance was myself, as I met him
                    at the organ of St Mary Magdalen’s Church, July the 30th, whence I conducted him
                    to my father’s house, where he was treated with all possible kindness as well as
                    hospitality; and I afterwards not only attended him to organs, choirs, operas,
                    and concerts, but recommended him to several scholars. At first he only played a
                    <hi rend="italic">ripieno</hi> violin in the opera orchestra; and being
                    naturally inclined to indulge in a kind of dry humour, pretended unusual
                    ignorance, in a manner that made the most serious people laugh, though he
                    preserved his own gravity. But his superior abilities were soon discovered; for
                    the harpsichord player of the opera having been absent for a time, Handel was
                    persuaded to take his place, and on this occasion showed himself to be a great
                    master, to the astonishment of every one, except myself, who had frequent
                    opportunities of knowing his abilities on keyed instruments.”</p>
                <p>Mattheson and Handel became intimate acquaintances, and did not allow any
                    professional rivalship to interfere with their friendship, until the occurrence
                    of the following adventure. Mattheson had composed an opera called <hi
                    rend="italic">Cleopatra,</hi> which was performed in Hamburg, and in which he
                    acted the part of Antony himself, and Handel played the harpsichord. Mattheson
                    was accustomed, upon the death of Antony, which happened early in the piece, to
                    preside at the harpsichord, in the character of composer; but one evening Handel
                    refused to indulge his vanity by relinquishing this post to him. This occasioned
                    so violent a quarrel between them, that, on going out of the house, Mattheson
                    gave him a blow on the face; upon which both immediately drew their swords, and
                    a duel ensued in the market-place, before the opera-house. Luckily the sword of
                    Mattheson broke against a metal button on 'Handel’s coat, or, as some allege, a
                    score of music which he carried under it, which put an end to the fight.</p>
                <p>This rencontre happened upon the 5th of December, 1704; but, as a proof of a
                    speedy reconciliation, Mattheson mentions, that on the 30th of the same month,
                    he accompanied the young composer to the rehearsal of his first opera <hi
                    rend="subscript"> r</hi> of <hi rend="italic">Almira,</hi> at the theatre, and
                    performed the principal part in it; and that afterwards they became greater
                    friends than ever. Whilst he remained at Hamburg, Handel composed his opera of
                    <hi rend="italic">Nero,</hi><hi rend="italic">oder</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >die</hi><hi rend="italic">durch Blut und Mord erlangte liebe,</hi> which was
                    very successful. He also produced two operas entitled <hi rend="italic"
                    >Florinda,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Daĵne,</hi> and wrote innumerable songs,
                    cantatas, and pieces, for the harpsichord. His style, Mattheson allows, was
                    greatly improved by his constant attendance at the opera; and he was esteemed a
                    more powerful player on the organ than the famous Kuhnau of Leipsic, who was at
                    this time regarded as a prodigy.</p>
                <p>Handel having now acquired, by his operas at Hamburg, a sum sufficient to enable
                    him to visit Italy, he set out for that seat of the muses. He staid some time at
                    Florence, where he composed his opera of <hi rend="italic">Rodrigo.</hi> From
                    this city he went to Venice, where, in 1709, he produced his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Agrippina,</hi> which was received with acclamation, and ran for thirty nights.
                    Here he met with Domenico Scarletti, Gasparini, and Lotti. He next visited Rome,
                    where <pb break="no" facs="nls:193640811" xml:id="kp-eb0711-0811-0132"/>he had
                    an opportunity of hearing compositions and performers of the first class. At
                    Cardinal Ottoboni’s, by whom Handel was greatly caressed, he had frequently the
                    advantage of hearing the celebrated Corelli perform his own works. During his
                    stay at Rome, our young composer produced a serenata entitled <hi rend="italic"
                    >ll Triunfo del Tempo</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> after which he went to
                    Naples, where he set <hi rend="italic">Acis and Galatea</hi> in Italian.</p>
                <p>Handel returned to Germany about the beginning of the year 1710, and was made <hi
                    rend="italic">Maestro di</hi><hi rend="italic">Capella</hi> to the elector of
                    Hanover, afterwards George I. He does not appear, however, to have remained long
                    in the service of the elector, but bent his course to London, where a passion
                    for dramatic music had already manifested itself in several awkward attempts at
                    operas, and to which place he had received invitations from several of the
                    nobility he had seen in Italy and Hanover. His reception in England was
                    flattering to himself and honourable to the nation, at this time no less
                    successful in war than in the cultivation of the arts of peace. To the wit,
                    poetry, literature, and science, which marked this period of our history, Handel
                    added all the blandishments of a nervous and learned music, which he first
                    brought hither, planted, and lived to see grow to a very flourishing state. The
                    first opera he wrote in England was <hi rend="italic">Rinaldo,</hi> taken from
                    Tasso’s <hi rend="italic">Gierusalernme,</hi> which at once established his
                    reputation. He afterwards produced his <hi rend="italic">Pastor Fido,
                    Theseus,</hi> and, in 1715, <hi rend="italic">Amadis of Gaul.</hi> In all of
                    these, Nicoini and Valentini, the first Italian singers that appeared in
                    England, performed. When the peace of Utrecht was brought to a conclusion,
                    Handel was employed to compose the Hymn of Gratitude and Triumph on the
                    occasion. The grand <hi rend="italic">Te</hi><hi rend="italic">Deum</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">Jubilate</hi> he produced was composed with such force,
                    regularity, and instrumental effect, as to excite universal delight.</p>
                <p>On the arrival of George I. Handel was honoured with the most flattering marks of
                    royal favour from the king and queen, who added largely to the pensions
                    previously conferred on him by Queen Anne.</p>
                <p>We now come to the busiest and most glorious period of Handel’s life. His great
                    natural powers had been highly improved by cultivation; his genius for
                    composition was unbounded; he stood at the head of his profession. esteemed
                    alike by the sovereign, the nobility, and the public, of a great and powerful
                    nation, at a period of its greatest happiness and prosperity. Such were Handel’s
                    circumstances, when the Royal Academy, or an association for the establishment
                    of an Italian opera in England, was formed. Handel was appointed director and
                    composer, engaged singers, and, although he had to contend with several rivals,
                    at length, by the superior grandeur and invention of his operatic music,
                    distanced them all. About this period of his career Handel unfortunately became
                    involved in a quarrel with the vocalist Senesino, the particulars of which we
                    pass over. The result was to break up the academy; and it not only proved
                    injurious to the fortune of our composer, but was the cause of infinite trouble
                    and vexation to him during the rest of his life. From the institution of the
                    academy till its dissolution in 1729, Handel produced about thirty operas. The
                    greater part of these had immense success; yet such was the influence of
                    opposition and neglect, that none of his operas composed subsequently to 1740,
                    although actually his highest achievements in operatic composition, were
                    received with the admiration due to their merit.</p>
                <p>Following the narrative of Burney in his sketch of Handel’s life, we leave his
                    dramatic transactions, and come now to notice the sacred dramas or <hi
                    rend="italic">oratorios</hi> of this great musician. The oratorio of <hi
                    rend="italic">Esther</hi> was the first he composed; and in 1733 <hi
                    rend="italic">Deborah</hi> was given to the public. It was during these early
                    performances of oratorios that Handel first played his organ concertos, a
                    species of music wholly of his own invention, in which he usually introduced an
                    extempore fugue, a diapason-piece, or an adagio, displaying not only great
                    fertility and readiness of invention, but the most perfect accuracy and neatness
                    of execution. In 1735 he produced <hi rend="italic">Acis and Galatea,</hi> and
                    <hi rend="italic">Alexanders Feast;</hi> in 1738, <hi rend="italic">Israel in
                    Egypt;</hi> and in 1739, <hi rend="italic">L’Allegro ed</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >il</hi><hi rend="italic">Penseroso.</hi> In 1740 the oratorio of <hi
                    rend="italic">Saul</hi> was performed at the theatre in Lincoln-Inn Fields; and
                    from this period Handel almost entirely devoted his labours to the service of
                    the church. The profits arising from the performance of his oratorios were not
                    sufficient to indemnify his losses; and it remains a stigma upon the taste of
                    the nation, that the <hi rend="italic">Messiah</hi> at first proved neither
                    successful, nor remunerative to the composer. Chagrined with repeated
                    disappointments, Handel went to Ireland, in order, as Burney remarks, “to try
                    whether his oratorios would be out of the reach of prejudice and enmity in that
                    kingdom.” In allusion to this, Pope wrote his well-known lines, supposed to be
                    addressed by the poet personifying the Italian opera, to the goddess of
                    Dulness.</p>
                <p>Strong in new arms, 1o, giant Handel stands, Like bold Briareus, with his hundred
                    hands; To stir, to rouse, to shake the soul he comes, And Jove’s own thunders
                    follow Mars’ drums, Arrest him, empress, or you sleep no more :— She heard, and
                    drove· him to the Hibernian shore.</p>
                <p>After remaining about nine months in Ireland, where his exertions were
                    successful, Handel returned to London, and produced <hi rend="italic"
                    >Samson</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Messiah,</hi> which latter work was now
                    received with universal applause. This truly sublime oratorio was performed
                    annually at the laudable and benevolent instigation of the author, and under his
                    direction, for the benefit of the Foundling Hospital; and the produce of these
                    performances, from the year 1749 to the year 1777, amounted to nearly L.10,300.
                    Although the <hi rend="italic">Messiah</hi> was performed almost always to
                    crowded houses, the other oratorios were but thinly attended. This was owing no
                    less to the capriciousness of public taste than to the extraordinary hostility
                    of some of his powerful adversaries. The king, however, continued his steady
                    patron, and attended his oratorios when they were neglected by the rest <hi
                    rend="italic">of</hi> the court.</p>
                <p>Towards the close of his life Handel was afflicted with blindness, which,
                    however, did not affect his faculties, as he continued to play to the last with
                    his wonted vigour. “To sec him, however,” says Burney, “led to the organ after
                    this calamity, at upwards of seventy years of age, and then conducted towards
                    the audience to make his accustomed obeisance, was a sight so truly afflicting
                    and deplorable to persons of sensibility, as greatly diminished their pleasure
                    in hearing him perform.” It was remarked, that with many parts of his music he
                    was unusually agitated, particularly with that affecting air in <hi
                    rend="italic">Samson,</hi> “Total eclipse—no sun, no moon,” which so peculiarly
                    applied to his own situation. The last oratorio he attended
                    andsuperintendedwasupon the6thof April, and he expired on Friday the 13th, or
                    Good Friday 1759, the very day he had seriously wished that event should happen,
                    “in hopes,” as he said, “of meeting his good God, his sweet Lord and Saviour, on
                    the day of his resurrection,” meaning the Easter Sunday following.</p>
                <p>The musical powers of Handel can perhaps be best expressed by Arbuthnot’s reply
                    to Pope, who seriously asked his opinion of him as a composer. “Conceive,” said
                    he, “the highest you can of his abilities, and they are much beyond any thing
                    you can conceive.” He excelled in almost every style of composition. The church,
                    the theatre, and the chamber, were equally adorned by his talents. The best of
                    his Italian operas are superior in <pb break="no" facs="nls:193640824"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0711-0824-0133"/>variety and ingenuity to those of all preceding
                    and contemporary composers throughout Europe. In his full, masterly, and
                    admirable, organ fugues, upon remarkably natural and pleasing subjects, he has
                    surpassed the most renowned writers in this difficult and elaborate species of
                    composition; and every judicious and unprejudiced musician, when he hears or
                    peruses the noble, majestic, and sublime oratorios and anthems of Handel, must
                    allow, with readiness and rapture, that theyare unacquainted with any thing
                    equal to them among the works of the greatest masters that have existed since
                    the invention of counterpoint. (z. z.)</p>
