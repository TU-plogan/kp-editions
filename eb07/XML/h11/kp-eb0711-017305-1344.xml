                <p><label type="entry">HAWKING</label>, the exercise of taking wild-fowl by means of
                    hawks. The method of reclaiming, manning, and bringing up a hawk to this
                    exercise, is calle <hi rend="italic">à</hi><hi rend="italic">falconry.</hi></p>
                <p>There are only two countries in the world where we have any evidence that the
                    exercise of hawking was practised in ancient times. These are Thrace and
                    Britain. In the former it was pursued merely as the diversion of a particular
                    district, if we may believe Pliny, whose account is rendered obscure by the
                    indistinctness of his own ideas of the matter. The originaI Britons, with a
                    fondness for the exercise of hunting, had also a taste for that of hawking; and
                    every chief amongst them maintained a considerable number of birds for that
                    sport. To the Romans this diversion was scarcely known in the days of Vespasian,
                    yet it was introduced immediately afterwards. Most probably they adopted it from
                    the Britons; but we know certainly that they greatly improved it. In this state
                    it appears amongst the Roman Britons in the sixth century. Gildas, in a
                    remarkable passage in his first epistle, speaks of Maglocunus, on his
                    relinquishing the sphere of ambition, and taking refuge in a monastery; and
                    proverbially compares him to a dove, which hastens away at the noisy approach of
                    the dogs, and with various turns and windings takes her flight from the talons
                    of the hawk.</p>
                <p>In after times, hawking was the principal amusement of the English. A person of
                    rank scarcely stirred out without his hawk on his hand; and in old paintings
                    this is the criterion of nobility. Harold, afterwards king of England, when he
                    went on a most important embassy into Normandy, is painted embarking with a bird
                    on his hand, and a dog under his arm; and in an ancient picture of the nuptials
                    of Henry VI. a nobleman is represented in much the same manner. In those days,
                    “it was thought sufficient for noblemen to winde their horn, and to carry their
                    hawk fair, and leave study and learning to the children of mean people.” The
                    former were the accomplishments of the times. Spenser makes his gallant Sir
                    Tristram boast,</p>
                <p>Ne is there hawk which mantleth her on pearch, Whether high tow’ring, or
                    accoasting low, But I the measure of her flight doe search, And all her prey,
                    and all her diet know.</p>
                <p>In short, this diversion was, amongst the old English, the pride of the rich, and
                    the privilege of the poor. No rank of men seems to have been excluded from the
                    amusement. We learn from the book of St Alban’s, that every degree had its
                    peculiar hawk, from the emperor down to the holy-water clerk. Vast was the
                    expense which sometimes attended this sport. In the reign of James I. Sir Thomas
                    Monson is said to have given L. 1000 for a cast of hawks. We need not wonder
                    then at the rigour of the laws tending to preserve a pleasure which was carried
                    to such an extravagant pitch. In the 34th of Edward III. it was made felony to
                    steal a hawk; and to take its eggs, even in a person’s own ground, was
                    punishable with imprisonment for a year and a day, besides a fine at the king’s
                    pleasure. In Queen Elizabeth’s reign, the imprisonment was reduced to three
                    months, but the offender was to find security for his good behaviour for seven
                    years, or he in prison till he did so. Such then was the enviable state of the
                    times of old England. During the whole day the gentry were given to the fowls of
                    the air and the beasts of the field; in the evening, they celebrated their
                    exploits with the most abandoned and brutish sottishness; and the inferior ranks
                    of people, by the most unjust and arbitrary laws, were made liable to capital
                    punishments, to fines, and loss of liberty, for destroying the most destructive
                    of the feathered tribe. The love of game-laws runs in the blood of our
                    territorial aristocracy; it has descended to them from very ancient times, and
                    forms part of their inheritance.</p>
                <p>According to Olearius, the diversion of hawking is more followed by the Tartars
                    and Persians than ever it was in any part of Europe. “Il n’y avoit point de
                    hutte,” says he, “qui n’eust son aigle ou son faucon.”</p>
                <p>The falcons or hawks which were in use in these kingdoms are now found to breed
                    in Wales, and in Scotland and its isles. The peregrine falcon inhabits the rocks
                    of Caernarvonshire. The same species, with the gyrfalcon, <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193641357" xml:id="kp-eb0711-1357-0174"/>the gentil, and the goshawk,
                    are found in Scotland, and the lanner in Ireland. But we may here notice, that
                    the Norwegian breed were, in old times, in high esteem in England, and were
                    thought bribes worthy a king. Jeof-frey Fitzpierre gave two good Norway hawks to
                    King John, to obtain for his friend the liberty of exporting a hundredweight of
                    cheese; and Nicholas the Dane stipulated to give the king a hawk every time he
                    came into England, that he might have liberty to traffic throughout the king’s
                    dominions. Hawks were also made the tenures by which some of the nobility held
                    their estates from the crown. Thus Sir John Stanley had a grant of the Isle of
                    Man from Henry IV. to be held of the king, his heirs, and successors, by homage
                    and the service of two falcons, payable on the day of his or their coronation.
                    And Philip de Hastang held his manor of Combertoun, in Cambridgeshire, by the
                    service of keeping the king’s falcons.</p>
                <p>Hawking, though an exercise now much disused, does yet furnish a great variety of
                    significant terms, which still obtain in our language. Thus, the parts of a hawk
                    have their proper names. The legs, from the thigh to the foot, are called <hi
                    rend="italic">arms</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> the toes, the <hi rend="italic"

                <p>There are also proper terms for the several actions of the bird. When a hawk
                    flutters, as if striving to get away, either from the perch or hand, it is said

                <p>The reclaiming, manning, and bringing up a hawk to the sport, cannot easily be
                    brought under any precise set of rules. It consists in a number of little
                    practices and observances, calculated to familiarize the falconer to his bird,
                    and the latter to the falconer.</p>
                <p>When the hawk comes readily to the lure, a large pair of luring bells are to be
                    put on; and the more giddy-headed and apt to rake out the hawk is, the larger
                    must the bells be. Having done this, and the bird being sharp-set, ride out in a
                    fair morning, into some large field unencumbered with trees or wood, with the
                    hawk on your hand; then having loosened the hood, whistle softly, to provoke her
                    to fly; unhood, and let the bird fly with its head into the wind; for by that
                    means it will be the better able to get upon the wing, and will naturally climb
                    upwards, flying a circle. After the hawk has flown three or four turns, then
                    lure her with your voice, casting the lure about your head, having first tied a
                    pullet to it; and if your falcon come in and approach near you, cast out the
                    lure into the wind, and if she stoop to it, reward her.</p>
                <p>You will often find, that when she flies from the hand, she will take stand on
                    the ground. This is a fault which is very common with soar-falcons. To remedy
                    it, fright her up with your wand; and when you have forced her to take a turn or
                    two, take her down to the lure, and feed her. But if this does not succeed, then
                    you must have in readiness a duck sealed, so that she may see no way but
                    backwards, and that will make her mount the higher. Hold this duck in your hand,
                    by one of the wings, near the body; then lure with the voice to make the falcon
                    turn her head; and when she is at a reasonable pitch, cast your duck up just
                    under her; when, if she strike, stoop, or truss the duck, permit her to kill it,
                    and reward her by giving her a reasonable gorge. After you have practised this
                    two or three times, your hawk will leave the stand, and, delighted to be on the
                    wing, will be very obedient.</p>
                <p>It is not convenient, for the first or second time, to show your hawk a large
                    fowl; for it frequently happens that <pb break="no" facs="nls:193641370"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0711-1370-0175"/><hi rend="subscript"> l</hi> they escape from the
                    hawk, and the bird not recovering them, rakes after them. This gives the
                    falconer trouble, and frequently occasions the loss of the hawk. But if she
                    happens to pursue a fowl, and, being unable to recover it, gives it over, and
                    comes in again directly, then cast out a sealed duck; and if the bird stoop and
                    truss it across the wings, permit her to take her pleasure, rewarding her also
                    with the heart, brains, tongue, and liver. But if you have not a quick duck,
                    take her down with a dry lure, and let her plume a pullet and feed upon it. By
                    this means a hawk will learn to give over a fowl that rakes out, and on hearing
                    the falconer’s lure, will make back again, and know the better how to hold in
                    the head.</p>
                <p>Some hawks have a disdainful coyness, proceeding from their being high fed. Such
                    a hawk must not be rewarded though she should kill; but you may give her leave
                    to plume alittle, and then taking a sheep’s heart cold, or the leg of a pullet,
                    when the hawk is busy in pluming, let either of them be conveyed into the body
                    of the fowl, that it may savour of it; and when the hawk has eaten the heart,
                    brains, and tongue of the fowl, take out what is enclosed, call lier to your
                    hand, and feed her with it. Afterwards give her some of the feathers of the
                    fowl’s neck, to scour her, and make her cast.</p>
                <p>If your hawk be a stately high-flying one, it ought not to take more than one
                    flight in a morning; and if the bird be made for the river, let her not fly more
                    than twice. When she is at the highest, take her down with your lure; and when
                    she has plumed and broken the fowl a little, feed her, by which means you will
                    keep her a high-flyer, and fond of the lure.</p>
                <p>So much for the technicalities of hawking, which, from change of times and
                    manners, has now in a great measure fallen into disuse. The reader, however,
                    will find some admirable descriptions of this national sport in the novels of
                    Scott, who appears to have understood it thoroughly, and who, on this, as on
                    many other subjects, has brought the past, as it were, before us, rendering us
                    familiar with its habits, customs, and amusements, and deeply engaging our
                    sympathy in favour of the feelings, notions, and even prejudices, with which
                    these were associated.</p>
