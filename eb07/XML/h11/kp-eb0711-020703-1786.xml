                    (Theophilus), one of the most celebrated jurisconsults Germany has produced, was
                    born at Eisenberg, in the principality of Altenburg, on the 21 st of September
                    1681. His father, who was regent of the school of that place, and a man of
                    talents superior to his situation, made him early acquainted with the
                    masterpieces of antiquity, and thus inspired him with a decided taste for study.
                    Heineccius (or more properly <hi rend="italic">Heinecke)</hi> was still very
                    young when he had the misfortune to lose his father; but in his elder brother,
                    who was pastor at Goslar, he found a monitor and guide, who, by his care and
                    instructions, in some measure supplied the place of his deceased parent. From
                    Goslar he proceeded to Leipsic, where he attended the prelections of the
                    illustrious professor who then adorned the university of that place. In 1702 he
                    published there a thesis <hi rend="italic">De</hi><hi rend="italic">insignibus
                    sacerdotalibus Apostolorum</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> a subject which might
                    have afforded scope for a great display of erudition, but which, as treated by
                    Heineccius, did not indicate the real talent of the author. In this thesis he
                    attempted to combat some assertions of Baronius. Heineccius, the following year,
                    took his degree in arts, and then returned to his brother, who wished him to
                    enter the ecclesiastical profession. But having satisfied his brother as to the
                    reasons which induced him to decline taking orders, he soon afterwards
                    accompanied the latter to Halle, where he became tutor to the sons of Count
                    Golofkin. In 1708 he was admitted into the philosophical faculty of that city,
                    and there published an academical dissertation <hi rend="italic">De</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Genuina</hi><hi rend="italic">Christi Aera</hi><hi rend="italic">e
                    Nummis et Inscriptionibus illustrata,</hi> in 4to, republished in 1735, with
                    notes by Liebknecht. Two years afterwards he obtained a chair, which he filled
                    with ability, but without any material increase of reputation. All his studies,
                    however, he regarded as merely preparatory to that of jurisprudence; but it was
                    not until 1716, when he was admitted into the faculty of law, being then in the
                    thirty-sixth year of his age, that he disclosed his designs. His inaugural
                    thesis <hi rend="italic">De Origine et</hi><hi rend="italic">Indole</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Jurisdictionis Patrimonialis,</hi> which was considered as a
                    masterpiece, procured him the esteem of his judges; and his Abridgment of the
                    Antiquities of the Roman law confirmed the high idea which had been formed of
                    his merit, whilst it extended his reputation throughout all Germany. In 1721 he
                    was appointed to the chair of law, a situation which he filled with an ability
                    and success that reflected credit on the university; and new works, which
                    succeeded one another with inconceivable rapidity, added daily to his
                    reputation. But although he enjoyed the highest consideration, yet finding his
                    allowances insufficient to enable him to bring up his family, he was obliged, in
                    1724, to accept a chair which had been offered him, with suitable appointments,
                    in the university of Franeker. Three years afterwards, on the invitation of the
                    king of Prussia, he repaired to Francfort-on-the-Oder, whence this prince
                    obliged him, in 1733, to return to Halle. Everywhere his prelections were
                    attended by an extremely numerous concourse of pupils, attracted by the solid
                    instruction, the luminous method, and the clear and elegant die* tion, for which
                    this illustrious professor was distinguished. His life, barren of incidents, was
                    passed in the prosecution of useful labours; yet notwithstanding his continual
                    occupation, he discharged in an exemplary manner all the duties of society. But
                    sedentary habits and unremitting application at length ruined his health, and he
                    died generally regretted, on the 31st of August 1741, at the age of sixty. A
                    list of his numerous works will be found in the <hi rend="italic">Bibliothèque
                    Germanique,</hi> tom. ii. part 1st. The principal are, 1. Fundamenta styli

                    10. Elementa Juris Cambiales, Amsterdam, 1743, in 8vo. The works of Heineccius
                    were collected and published by Uhl, professor at Francfort-on-the-Oder, under
                    the title of <hi rend="italic">Opera ad</hi><hi rend="italic">Universam
                    Jurisprudentiam, Philosophiam, et Litteras humaniores pertinentia,</hi> Geneva,
                    1744-1748, in eight vols. 4to, reprinted in the same city, with additions, 1771,
                    in nine vols. 4to; and to these two editions a supplementary volume was at the
                    same time added. After the works of Cujas, this collection is perhaps the most
                    valuable and necessary to a student of jurisprudence. The commentary of
                    Heineccius on the Julian and Papian laws would alone suffice to place him in the
                    rank of the greatest jurisconsults; and if his authority has decreased somewhat
                    in Germany, which we believe to be the case, it is because his successors,
                    profiting by his researches, have been enabled to surpass him. We are also
                    indebted to Heineccius for editions of the <hi rend="italic">Jurisprudentia
                    Romana</hi><hi rend="italic">et</hi><hi rend="italic">Attica,</hi> Leyden, 1738,
                    in three vols. folio, with a learned preface prefixed to the first volume. <hi
