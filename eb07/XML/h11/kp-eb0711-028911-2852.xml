                    >Ecclesiastical History,</hi> a bible disposed in six columns, containing the
                    text, and different versions thereof, compiled and published by Origen, with a
                    view to secure the sacred text from future corruptions, and to correct those
                    which had been already introduced.</p>
                <p>Eusebius relates that Origen, after his return from Rome under Caracalla, applied
                    himself to learn Hebrew, and began to collect the several versions which had
                    been made of the Sacred Writings, and from these to compose his Tetrapla and
                    Hexapla; others, however, are of opinion that he did not begin till the time of
                    Alexander, after he had retired into Palestine, about the year 231.</p>
                <p>To understand what this Hexapla was, it must be observed that, besides the
                    translation of the Sacred Writings, called the Septuagint, made under Ptolemy
                    Philadelphus, about 280 years before Christ, the Scriptures were translated into
                    Greek by other interpreters. The first of these versions, or, reckoning the
                    Septuagint, the second, was that of Aquila, a proselyte Jew, the first edition
                    of which he published in the twelfth year of the emperor Hadrian, or about the
                    year of Christ 128; the third was that of Symmachus, published under Marcus
                    Aurelius, or, at least, under Septimius Severus, about the year 200; the fourth
                    was that of Thcodotion, prior to the version of Symma- <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193642865" xml:id="kp-eb0711-2865-0290"/>‘ chus, which appeared under
                    Commodus, or about the year 175. These Greek versions, says Dr Kennicot, were
                    made by the Jews from their corrupted copies of the Hebrew, and were designed to
                    stand in stead of that by the Seventy, against which they were prejudiced,
                    because it seemed to favour the Christians. The fifth was found at Jericho, in
                    the reign of Caracalla, about the year 217; the sixth was discovered at
                    Nicoolis, in the reign of Alexander Severus; and Origen himself recovered part
                    of a seventh, containing only the Psalms.</p>
                <p>Now Origen, who had held frequent disputations with the Jews, both in Egypt and
                    in Palestine, having observed that they always objected against those passages
                    of Scripture quoted against them, and appealed to the Hebrew text; in order the
                    better to vindicate those passages, and to confound the Jews by showing that the
                    Seventy had given the sense of the Hebrew, or rather to show by a number of
                    different versions what the real sense of the Hebrew was, he undertook to reduce
                    all these several versions into a body along with the Hebrew text, so that they
                    might easily be confronted, and thus afford a mutual illustration.</p>
                <p>He made the Hebrew text his standard; and allowing that corruptions might have
                    taken place, and that the old Hebrew copies might and did read differently, he
                    contented himself with marking such words or sentences as were not in the Hebrew
                    text, nor in the later Greek versions, and adding such words or sentences as
                    were omitted in the Seventy, prefixing an asterisk to the additions, and an
                    obelisk to the others.</p>
                <p>With this view he made choice of eight columns, in the first of which he gave the
                    Hebrew text in Hebrew characters; in the second the same text in Greek
                    characters; whilst the rest were filled with the severaí versions above
                    mentioned, all the columns answering verse for verse, and phrase for phrase; and
                    in the Psalms there was a ninth column for the seventh version.</p>
                <p>This work of Origen was called 'Eξαcraα, <hi rend="italic">Hexapla,</hi> or work
                    of six columns, as regarding only the first six Greek versions. But Epiphanius,
                    taking into account the two columns of the text, calls the work <hi
                    rend="italic">Octapla.</hi></p>
                <p>This celebrated work, which, Montfaucon imagines, consisted of fifty large
                    volumes, perished long ago, probably with the library at Caesarea, where it was
                    preserved in the year 653; though several of the ancient writers have preserved
                    fragments of it, particularly St Chrysostom on the Psalms, and Philoponus in his
                    Hexameron. Some modern writers have earnestly endeavoured to collect fragments
                    of the Hexapla, particularly Flaminius Nobilius, Drusius, and Montfaucon.</p>
