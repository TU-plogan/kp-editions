                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra

                <p><label type="entry">HERVEY, <hi rend="smallcaps">James</hi></label>, a divine of
                    the church of England in the eighteenth century, and a writer of great
                    popularity amongst a certain class of persons, was born at Harding-stone in the
                    year 1714. He was educated at the free grammar school of Northampton, where he
                    acquired a competent knowledge of the Greek and Latin languages; and in 1731 he
                    was sent to the university of Oxford. The first two or three years of his
                    residence at that seminary were spent, we are told, without serious application
                    to study, and therefore without making much improvement; but afterwards becoming
                    acquainted with those who zealously studied what they called primitive
                    Christianity, and who were afterwards termed <hi rend="italic">Methodists,</hi>
                    he became strongly attached both to piety and to learning. Independently of his
                    other studies, he learned anatomy from Dr Keil, and natural philosophy from Dr
                    Derham’s Physicoand Astro-theology; and by the perusal of Mr Spence’s essay on
                    Pope’s Odyssey, he improved his style. He attempted the Hebrew without a
                    teacher, but afterwards relinquished the study in despair; he resumed his
                    labours, however, and in time became a tolerable proficient in that language. In
                    the year 1740 he was appointed curate of Biddeford in Devonshire, where he had
                    only L.60 a year, including a stated collection made by his friends. Upon the
                    death of the rector he was dismissed by the new incumbent, contrary to the
                    earnest expostulation of the parishioners, who offered to maintain him
                    independently of the rector. In 1743 he became curate to his father, who held
                    the living of Weston Favell in Northamptonshire, and continued in that station
                    till 1750, when his health was rapidly declining. Having been induced to repair
                    to London for change of air, he continued about two years in the metropolis,
                    when he was recalled to Weston Favell to succeed his father. He obtained the
                    livings of Weston and Collingtree in the same neighbourhood, and in 1752 took
                    his degree of master of arts. He attended to the duties of both parishes
                    alternately with a curate, in the discharge of which he was fervent and
                    indefatigable. So great were his exertions, indeed, that he brought on a
                    decline, accompanied with incessant cough and acute pains, all which he
                    supported, not only with fortitude, but without a single expression of
                    peevishness, and died without a groan on the 25th of December 1758, at the age
                    of about forty-four. His piety was ardent and sincere, although in the
                    estimation of some judges he was rather enthusiastic. He was a man of
                    unblemished moral deportment; his temper was disinterested, and he was humble
                    without the affectation of humility. To society he was just and punctual, and
                    candid to people of every description. ∙ The L.700 which he received for his <hi
                    rend="italic">Meditations</hi> were applied to the relief of the indigent and
                    distressed. He was so rigid a Calvinist, that whenever he spoke of imputed
                    righteousness, he became almost an Antinomian. His erudition was respectable,
                    but not such as to place him amongst scholars of the first rank, although he
                    seems to have been well acquainted with the classics. Many persons have admired
                    the style of his writings; but competent judges must pronounce it as by far too
                    flowery and diffuse to be termed elegant, and regard it as equally destitute of
                    vigour and simplicity. The writings of Hervey are, 1. Meditations and
                    Contemplations, 1746, 8vo; 2. Contemplations on the Night and Starry <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193642813" xml:id="kp-eb0711-2813-0286"/> Heavens, 1747, in
                    8vo; 3. Remarks on Lord Bolingbroke*s Letters on the Study of History, so far as
                    they relate to the History of the Old Testament, 1753, in 8vo; 4. Theron and
                    Aspasio, or a series of Dialogues on the most important Subjects, 1755, in three
                    vols. 8vo; 5. Sermons, 1759; 6. An Edition of Jeuk’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Méditations;</hi> 7. A Preface to Burnham’s <hi rend="italic">Pious
                    Memorials,</hi> 1753, in 8vo; 8. Eleven Letters to Wesley; 9. Letters to Lady
                    Francis Shirley, 1782, in 8vo. All these are included in the edition of his
                    works in six vols. 8vo, published by the Rivingtons; but, in 1811, there
                    appeared, for the first time, what may be considered as a seventh volume,
                    consisting of Letters, illustrative of the author’s amiable character, and of
                    many circumstances in his early history.</p>
