                <p>The county returns two members to the House of Commons, the voters are about
                    3200, and the places for poling are Huntingdon and Stilton. The borough of
                    Huntingdon also returns two members.</p>
                <p>The appearance of the county is of three descriptions. In the south-east it is an
                    extensive plain of rich meadow land, the middle varying in its surface with
                    gentle undulations, and without many enclosures or many woods; the higher part
                    was anciently a forest, and still contains a great extent of woodland, the
                    foliage of which gives beauty to the scenery. On the north-eastern side a
                    portion of the county is fine land, comprising a part of what is commonly called
                    Bedford level, comprehending nearly one fifth of the whole county.</p>
                <p>The two most considerable rivers are the Ouse and the Nen. The Ouse enters from
                    Bedfordshire, and crossing the whole of the county, passes into Cambridgeshire
                    in its way to the German Ocean. It is navigable in its whole extent through
                    Huntingdonshire, and forms an important means of intercourse. The Nen enters
                    from Northamp <pb break="no" facs="nls:193648949?mode=fullsize"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0711-8949-0758"/> tonshire, and runs to the marshes; it is also
                    navigable along the greater part of its course. Besides these, the Cam passes
                    through a part of the county. There are three lakes, viz. Whittlesea-mere,
                    Ramsey-mere, and U gg-mere; the first of these is the largest, and covers an
                    area of several miles in extent. It affords excellent fishing, and pleasant
                    sailing, which induces many parties of pleasure to visit it in the summer
                    season. Projects for draining this lake have been formed, as the water is not
                    deep, and the soil excellent; but they have not yet een carried into
                    execution.</p>
                <p>The county of Huntingdon scarcely contains any manufactures, excepting some
                    spinning, performed by the females; but the improvements of machinery in other
                    districts have much diminished that mode of employment. The only trade is that
                    of corn, cattle, and the wool of the few flocks of sheep.</p>
                <p>Agriculture is the principal pursuit of the district. The marshes and meadows are
                    highly productive, and many oxen are fattened on them, without any other food
                    than their natural grass. Much of this land is under the plough, and produces
                    most abundant crops of oats and cole-seed; the mills for making the latter into
                    oil are numerous. The hay produced from these fens is very considerable, but on
                    the banks of the rivers they are subject to great floods, which sometimes
                    destroy the harvest of the year. Though these lands are very valuable, yet the
                    expense of draining them causes a great deduction from their value.</p>
                <p>The soils in the upland parts of the county are various, but consist principally
                    of a tenacious clayey loam, or of a deep gravelly loam with some clay. Much of
                    this is in open common fields, where each occupier is compelled to follow a
                    rotation like that of his neighbours. On the best of these lands the usual
                    course of cropping is a year’s fallow, then wheat or barley, next beans, and
                    then barley or wheat. On the land of a quality somewhat inferior, a three-course
                    rotation of fallow, wheat, and peas or beans, is pursued. In those fields which
                    are calculated for turnips, that root is succeeded by barley and wheat, or by
                    wheat and barley. The average produce of the lands is stated at five quarters of
                    barley, four of oats, and three and a half of wheat, to the acre. The excellent
                    practice of sowing clover between two corn crops is followed to a very small
                    extent. The farms are generally small; few rentals exceed L.200 per annum.</p>
                <p>The sheep of Huntingdonshire are a mixed race, composed of crosses of the
                    Lincolnshire and Leicestershire breeds with the native kinds. They are without
                    horns, and of very imperfect shape, but are found profitable from the quantity
                    of wool they produce, their fleeces usually weighing from seven to eight pounds
                    each. The sheep of the original race of the county are much inferior to those
                    produced by the crossing with the better kinds; many of these are still found in
                    the open commons, and their fleeces seldom exceed four pounds in weight. The
                    cows are bred with little attention, and are a compound of many races. Very
                    little butter or cheese is made, the principal object being the suckling of
                    calves to supply veal for the London markets. Many horses are bred in the lower
                    part of the county, but without much attention to their races. From this
                    practice of breeding, it has become very general to execute all the agricultural
                    work with mares.</p>
                <p>The remains of antiquity in this county are principally of Roman origin; amongst
                    them are the vestiges of the three roads which were constructed by that people
                    across the country. The remains of Ramsey Abbey and Castle, the seat of the
                    family from which Oliver Cromwell, a native of this county, sprung, are of
                    venerable date. The monks who formerly occupied it were highly celebrated for
                    their knowledge of the Hebrew language. The churches of Bluntishara, St Ives,
                    and St Neots, and the Castle of Kimbolton, exhibit marks of high antiquity.</p>
                <p>The most remarkable noblemen and gentlemen’s seats are, Kimbolton, Duke of
                    Manchester; Bucden Palace, Bishop of Lincoln; Connington Castle, J. Heathcote,
                    Esq.; Elton, Earl of Carysfort; Hinchinbroke, Earl of Sandwich; Overton
                    Longueville, *Earl of Aboyne; Gains Hall, Sir James Duberly; Paxton Place, P.
                    Stanley, Esq.; Ramsey, William Henry Fellowes, Esq.; Stirtloe, Launcelot Brown,
                    Esq.; Stoughton, Earl Ludlow; and Upwood, Sir Richard Bickerton. (See Brayley’s
