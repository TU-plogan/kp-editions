                <p><label type="entry">HONDURAS</label>, a settlement of Great Britain, in the
                    southern part of the North American continent, and province of Yucutan. It is
                    situated between the parallels of 17. and 19. north latitude, and 88. and 90.
                    west longitude, on a peninsula which forms the Bay otCampeachy on the west and
                    the Bay of Honduras on the east. Its name is derived from the Spanish term
                    Hondura, which signifies depth, and was originally given to the coast by its
                    discoverers, on account of the great depth of water along the shore. According
                    to the best geographical authorities, the line which embraces this settlement
                    commences at the mouth of the Rio Grande, or Hondo, whose course it at first
                    follows, and afterwards runs parallel with it for thirty miles. It then turns
                    south, and passes through the New River Lake, in a straight line, to the river
                    Balize, up which it ascends for a considerable distance, till again bending in a
                    southerly direction, it meets the head of the Libun, whose course it pursues to
                    the sea. The whole settlement embraces an area of 62,750 square miles.</p>
                <p>This coast was discovered by Columbus in the year 1502, but little that can be
                    relied upon is known of its early settlement. The abundance and fine quality of
                    the· wood, particularly mahogany and logwood, seem first to have drawn attention
                    to it; and at a pretty early period it was occasionally resorted to by
                    wood-cutters. But the· first permanent establishment of British wood-cutters was
                    made at Cape Cartoche, by some adventurers from Jamaica, whose numbers
                    increasing, they extended as far south as the river Balize, and as far west as
                    the neigh <pb break="no" facs="nls:193646245" xml:id="kp-eb0711-6245-0550"
                    />bourhood of Campeachy. The Spaniards, however, did not quietly submit to this
                    usurpation of their territorial dominion. Several expeditions were fitted out
                    against the settlers, but they were uniformly unsuccessful; and on two
                    occasions, in 1659 and 1678, so complete was their discomfiture, that the town
                    of Campeachy itself was taken b} the logwood-cutters, with only the assistance
                    of the seamen engaged in the trade. This last repulse occurred eight years after
                    a treaty had been concluded with Spain, by which the territorial right of
                    Britain to the occupancy of Honduras was generally, although not specifically,
                    embraced. The successes of the settlers aroused the jealousy of the Spaniards,
                    and led to a renewed discussion of their right to the territory which they
                    occupied. This would appear to have been again generally admitted; but the
                    Spaniards finally succeeded in driving the woodmen from the Campeachy shore, and
                    confining them to the limits which we have already defined. An attempt was again
                    made in 1718 to dispossess the British of the territory on the river Balize; but
                    the firmness of the woodcutters deterre.d the Castilians from effecting any
                    thing, except the erection of a fortification, which in a few years they
                    abandoned. In 1754 an expedition was undertaken to exterminate the colony; but
                    by a treaty of peace concluded in the year 1763, the Spaniards were compelled to
                    admit the right of occupancy to the British colonists, which, however, they
                    subsequently attempted to annul. In 1779 the Spaniards again attacked the
                    settlement, and after destroying property to a considerable amount, they took a
                    number of the colonists prisoners, and marched them off in irons to Merida,
                    whence they were shipped to the Havannah, and there confined till 1782. In 1784
                    Britain obtained from Spain a specific grant of “the lands allotted for the
                    cutting of logwood,” by which Honduras became as much a territorial occupancy of
                    the British crown, as Jamaica or any other of our colonial possessions. The last
                    attack on the settlement was made during the war in 1798, but the expedition,
                    which consisted of 3000 men, was gallantly repulsed; and since that period the
                    colony has remained undisturbed by foreign aggression.</p>
                <p>The coast of the Bay of Honduras is low, and the shore is studded with a number
                    of low islands or keys, which, however, are verdant. As we recede from the
                    coast, the land rises into a bold and lofty country, interspersed with rivers
                    and lagoons, and covered with gigantic forests. The inland frontier is formed by
                    an immense chain of mountains, which are also covered with impenetrable forests
                    and brushwood. Through this rocky barrier there is only one pass, namely, that
                    leading to Peten. It is merely a pathway, which might be defended by a few men.
                    The lagoons or sheets of water, and the falls and rapids of the rivers,
                    constitute sublime and beautiful features in the general aspect of the country.
                    The river and lagoon of Manatee, which is situated ten leagues south of Balize,
                    is considered as extremely grand. At about a mile from the mouth of the river is
                    the lagoon, a magnificent sheet of water, extending for several leagues in a
                    northerly direction. In many places immense mountains ascend from its margin,
                    overtopping large valleys and wood ranges of great extent, where the tiger,
                    antelope, armadillo, quash, opossum, racoon, and several species of deer,
                    abound. Amongst the feathered tribes there are numbers of quails, plovers,
                    pigeons, pheasants, and wild turkeys. The deficiency of streams amongst the
                    mountain ridges is supplied by the presence of large marshy spots or shallow
                    ponds, the banks of which are frequented by almost every species of water game.
                    Fish abound during a great part of the year in these ponds, but the latter dry
                    up in the season of drought, and then vast flocks of sea-fowl congregate around
                    them to prey upon the fish which have been left dry by the evaporation ι)f the
                    waters. The alligator is also a frequent visitor; and, to partake of this repast
                    thus yearly provided for him, he has been known to traverse trackless wilds, and
                    make long journeys into the interior. Eight or ten miles from the lakes the
                    rapids begin, and the high rocky banks of the river assume a romantic and
                    beautiful appearance. Further on there is a cataract of about a quarter of a
                    mile in length, and of considerable acclivity. A cluster of beautiful caves,
                    through which the river winds its way, and beneath which the traveller must
                    pass, is next reached. They have been described as equally singular and
                    grand:—“These magnificent natural excavations of the mountains are semicircular
                    at the entrance, and about five yards in diameter. Within the cave the arch
                    rises to the height of a hundred feet, and leads to another low arch, which,
                    being passed, a second cavern of large size opens, beyond which is a third with
                    a circular orifice, through which the river enters. During the floods the mouths
                    of the caverns are filled with water, which boils up with prodigious fury, and
                    thus detains travellers many days before they can pass through the caves or
                    tunnels. In the rainy season, as the water increases on the upper or inland
                    sides of the mountains, the river forces its passage through the interstices and
                    openings in its sides with tremendous noise, forming an indescribably grand
                    cascade of from forty to fifty feet high, issuing from an hundred
                    orifices.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>“There are
                    also magnificent caves in the river Libun∙ eight or ten days’ journey from
                    Balize; and some interesting caverns exist in the creeks or arms of the old
                    river.”</p></note></p>
                <p>The country is technically divided into the Pine and the Cahoun ridges. The soil
                    of the former has a substratum of loose reddish sand, and its indigenous
                    products consist of those varieties of vegetation the assimilative powers of
                    which are strong and perennial. Extensive prairies expand over this soil, and
                    the pine, from which it derives its name, is extremely abundant. The soil of the
                    Cahoun ridge consists of a deep loam, capable of growing every species of
                    European as well as of tropical aliment. Its fertility occasions the growth of
                    much brushwood, and it is covered with the wild cotton and other gigantic
                    trees.</p>
                <p>Fruits, spontaneously produced, are exceedingly abundant, and consist of oranges
                    of excellent quality, shaddocks, limes, mangoes, melons, pine-apples,
                    water-melons, avocato pears, cashew, cocoa-nuts, and many others. They are all
                    found in the neighbourhood of Balize, but are sometimes brought in large
                    quantities from more elevated plantations. The mahogany and logwood trees are at
                    present the staples of Honduras. The former is found best in elevated
                    situations; and growing generally solitary, it is discernible at a great
                    distance, from the yellow hue of its foliage. It is cut down at about twelve
                    feet from the ground, and when felled, the logs arc dragged to the banks of the
                    streams and floated down in rafts. It is said that the boughs and limbs afford
                    the finest wood, but the size is principally looked to in Britain. The logwood
                    is found in low swampy grounds, growing contiguous to fresh water creeks and
                    lakes, on the edges of which the roots, the most valuable part of the wood,
                    ramify. They are felled during the dry season, and carried off when the wet
                    season has laid the ground under water. There is another valuable tree called
                    the <hi rend="italic">pinus occidentalis,</hi> which grows to the height of
                    sixty feet, and covers many thousand acres of country. It contains an immense
                    quantity of tar and turpentine, and might be turned to good account were the
                    vexatious duties on colonial timber removed. The pine- <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193646258" xml:id="kp-eb0711-6258-0551"/>• wood is of course highly
                    inflammable, and in this respect it is very valuable to the poor, who make
                    torches of it. It likewise powerfully resists decay, and is in consequence much
                    used by builders. The cahoun, or cohoon tree as it is pronounced, is valuable on
                    account of an oil which it yields. This unctuous product, when unadulterated, is
                    almost colourless, destitute of any disagreeable taste, and when burned as a
                    lamp oil it emits a beautiful palish flame without smoke or smell. There are
                    various other kinds of wood of beautiful vein and close texture, such as
                    ironwood, clay-wood, rosewood, palmaletta, and the like. Amongst minerals, veins
                    of fine marble and mountains of alabaster are known to exist. Several valuable
                    specimens of crystals have been found, and gold has at various periods been
                    detected; but no pains were ever taken to ascertain whence it proceeded.
                    Labouring Creek, which lies on the Balize, about one hundred miles inland, is
                    remarkable for the petrifying properties possessed by its waters. They have also
                    a powerful cathartic effect on strangers, and when applied externally to an
                    ulcer, have a healing property.</p>
                <p>The country abounds with all kinds of animals fit for the food of man. Except in
                    very rough weather, the supply of salt-water fish of excellent quality is
                    abundant. The common green turtle, when in a healthy condition, is a staple
                    commodity in the market. It is often five feet long, and weighs from 200 to 250
                    lbs.</p>
                <p>Balize, the capital of the settlement, is divided into two parts by the river of
                    the same name. The part of the town which is situated upon the south or right
                    bank of the river, along the eastern edge of a point of land, is completely
                    insulated by a canal on its western side, which runs across from a small arm of
                    the sea, and bounds the town on its south side. The houses are about 500 in
                    number, and are in general well built, spacious, and even elegant. They are for
                    the most part constructed of wood, and raised ten feet from the ground. The two
                    parts of the town are connected by a bridge, which was built in 1818. It is
                    twenty feet in width, and its span is 220 feet. It is entirely constructed of
                    wood, and is well secured by balustrades on each side. The streets of Balize are
                    regular, running parallel north and south, and intersected by others. The main
                    one runs in a north-easterly direction to the bridge from the government-house,
                    which is situated on the south-east point or angle of the island on the right
                    bank of the river, and bounded on the south and east by the sea. Behind the
                    government-house is the church, on the east side of the main street. The whole
                    town is embowered in groves and avenues of the cocoa-nut and tamarind trees.
                    Fort George is situated about half a mile from the river, on a small low
                    islet.</p>
                <p>The climate in the neighbourhood of Balize is generally moist. July is the
                    hottest and dryest month of the year, and then the maximum heat is 83°, the
                    medium 82°, and the minimum 80° of Fahrenheit. The great heat, however, is
                    tempered by the sea breezes, which almost constantly prevail. During the wet
                    seasons the thermometer sinks to 60°, and the variation in the temperature is
                    sometimes very great. But the climate is by no means unhealthy; indeed it is
                    asserted in the Honduras Almanack that it is more favourable to European
                    constitutions than any other climate under the tropics. Where temperance and
                    regularity are observed, the average duration of human life will not be less in
                    Honduras than it is in this country.</p>
                <p>There are various classes of society in this settlement, including Europeans,
                    coloured people, Indians, and Mosquito men. The blacks of Honduras are distinct
                    from the aborigines of the country, being of African descent. In general they
                    are inclined to indulge those low propensities which are exhibited in a state of
                    barbarism. A few of them, either from national usage or other causes, show an
                    utter aversion to spirituous liquors, but by far the greater proportion are
                    guilty of the most beastly excesses in this respect. Having been derived from
                    various regions, they still retain all their national peculiarities; and, to
                    keep themselves distinct from every other tribe, each nation selects one
                    individual, on whom the rest of his people bestow the title of king, and who
                    exercises over them a certain degree of authority. The blacks, as a body, have
                    upon the whole little intelligence, and their dulness of comprehension is
                    remarkable. It is asserted, however, in the Honduras Almanack, the best
                    authority on this point, that some of the blacks exhibit an originality of
                    talent and a degree of mental activity little inferior to their European
                    brethren. They are much attached to their country, and with a native of his own
                    land a Honduras black will share his last plantain. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >coloured</hi> population has resulted from the intercourse of Europeans with
                    Africans or Indians. They of course, morally speaking, assume a medium status,
                    and partake more or less of the qualities of black and white, according to their
                    distance from either. The <hi rend="italic">Mosquito</hi> shore men abound in
                    the colony. They are remarkable for a fine muscular formation of body, but in
                    their countenances they exhibit an utter destitution of intelligence, and their
                    habits are most barbarous. They acknowledge the existence of a good and evil
                    spirit; and the little power of thought which they possess is displayed in their
                    conduct towards their deities. The good spirit is neglected, because, say they,
                    his goodness is so great that nothing is to be feared from his wrath, whilst, on
                    the other hand, the evil spirit is propitiated, in order to deprecate his
                    malevolence. The whole wealth of a Mosquito man consists in his canoe, paddle,
                    and harpoon. With these he satisfies the cravings of nature, and his grovelling
                    nature asks for no more. The <hi rend="italic">Indians,</hi> the real aborigines
                    of the place, are a timid, inoffensive race, apparently more under the influence
                    of instinct than of reason. They perform the most astonishing journeys through
                    woods as trackless as the sea, and impervious to all but themselves, with
                    infallible correctness of direction and amazing rapidity. Although free from
                    vindictive or malicious propensities, they are addicted to drunkenness to an
                    excessive degree.</p>
                <p>In religious matters Honduras forms part of the bishopric of Jamaica, and
                    facilities are afforded by the establishment for religious instruction. There is
                    a well-endowed school attached to it, conducted on the Madras system, and the
                    average daily attendance of children is above a hundred. There are likewise two
                    mission schools, and considerable benefit has already been reaped from these
                    institutions. Not one of the least is the change of sentiment which has taken
                    place with regard to marriage. Only a few years back this ceremony was little
                    regarded, and virtue and decency were absolutely despised. A better feeling,
                    however, is now beginning to prevail, of which the legislature has taken
                    advantage; and, for the encouragement of public morals, great facilities to the
                    marriages of the lower orders of blacks have been afforded by recent laws and
                    regulations. Petty larceny, and misdemeanours resulting from intemperance,
                    frequently occur; but atrocious crimes are happily seldom perpetrated. In the
                    mechanical arts the blacks display little or no ingenuity, but the coloured
                    people, approaching nearer to the European standard of mind, are considerably
                    above the negroes in this respect. In architectural designs, however, and other
                    arts by which domestic comforts are enhanced, the whites alone are to be
                    depended upon. Some years back the inhabitants of Honduras were content with
                    stoecadoed huts of the most primitive construction, but now there are many
                    large, commodious, and even elegant houses, particularly in Balize.</p>
                <p>The grand authority of the settlement is a mixed legislative<pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193646271" xml:id="kp-eb0711-6271-0552"/> and executive power,
                    designated the Magistrates of Honduras, by whom enactments are made; and these
                    become laws to be enforced by the executive part of the government, after they
                    have been sanctioned by the king’s representative. The magistrates are in number
                    seven, and annually elected by the inhabitants. In them the power is vested, and
                    they conduct the whole public business of the colony, without receiving any
                    remuneration for their services. The superintendent is of course a nominee of
                    the crown of Great Britain.</p>
                <p>The militia of Honduras, which is a thousand strong, consists of a brigade of
                    artillery and a regiment of the line; there is likewise a local maritime force,
                    the whole being under the command of the superintendent and his aides-de-camp
                    and staff. The following table exhibits the revenue and expenditure of Honduras
                    from 1807 till 1830.</p>

                <p>It will be perceived that the revenue of this colony has very materially
                    increased, and it would still increase were the interest of this settlement more
                    attended to at home. Its resources are very great, and were emigration properly
                    encouraged, it would soon become of vast importance both in a political and in a
                    commercial point of view, more especially as there are still uncultivated many
                    thousand square miles of the richest soil. Trade is yet in its infancy, but the
                    value of the imports in 1830 was L.234,379, and of the exports L.316,151,
                    employing a shipping inwards of 13,918 tons, and outwards of 16,351 tons,
                    independently of a large coasting trade, which is on the increase. The following
                    table exhibits the quantities of the principal articles exported from 1824 to
