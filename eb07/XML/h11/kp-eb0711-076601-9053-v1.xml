                <p><label type="entry">HUYSUM</label>, the name of several Dutch painters. The most
                    celebrated of these was John, whose subjects were flowers, fruit, and
                    landscapes. He was born at Amsterdam in 1682, and was a disciple of Justus van
                    Huysum, his father. He set out in his profession with a most commendable
                    principle, not so much to paint for the acquisition of money, as of fame; and
                    therefore he did not aim at expedition, but at delicacy, and strove, if
                    possible, to arrive at perfection in his art. Having studied the pictures of
                    Mignon, and all other artists of distinction who had painted in his own style,
                    he tried which manner would soonest lead him to imitate the beauties of each
                    flower, fruit, or plant, and then fixed upon a manner peculiar to himself, and
                    which seems almost inimitable. His pictures are finished with inconceivable
                    truth; for he painted every thing after nature, and was so singularly exact as
                    to watch even the hour of the day in which his model appeared in its greatest
                    perfection. By some persons he was thought to paint with greater freedom than
                    Mignon or Breughel; with more tenderness and nature than Mario da Fiori, Michel
                    Angelo di Campidoglio, or Segers; with more mellowness than De Heem; and with
                    greater force of colouring than Baptist. At length his reputation rose so high,
                    that he fixed immoderate prices on his works; so that none but princes, or those
                    possessed of princely fortunes, could pretend to become purchasers. The large
                    sums which Van Huysum received for his works caused him to redouble his
                    endeavours to excel; no person was admitted into his room whilst he was
                    painting, not even his.brothers; and his method of mixing the tints, and
                    preserving the lustre of his colours, he kept an mpenetrable secret. From the
                    same principle, he would never take any disciples, excepting one lady, named
                    Haverman; and he even grew envious of her merit. By several domestic disquiets
                    his temper became changed, and he grew morose, fretful, and apt to withdraw
                    himself from society. There were many who envied his fame, but he continued to
                    work, and his reputation never diminished. It is universally agreed that he
                    excelled all who painted fruit and flowers before him, by the superiority of his
                    touch, the delicacy of his pencil, and an amazing skill in finishing; nor does
                    it appear probable that any future artist will ever become his competitor.
                    Besides his merit as a painter of flowers, he also painted landscapes with great
                    applause. They are well composed; and althoug∏ he had never seen Rome, he
                    adorned his scenes with the noble remains of ancient magnificence preserved in
                    that city. His pictures in this style are well coloured, and every tree is
                    distinguished by a touch that is proper for the leafing. The grounds are well
                    broken, and disposed with taste and judgment; the figures are designed in the
                    manner of Lairesse, highly finished, and touched with a great deal of spirit;
                    and through the whole composition the scene represents Italy, in the trees, the
                    clouds, and the skies. He died in 1749, at the age of sixty-seven.</p>
