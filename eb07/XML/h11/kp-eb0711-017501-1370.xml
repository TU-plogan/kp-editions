                <p><label type="entry">HAWKINS, <hi rend="smallcaps">Sir John</hi></label>, an
                    industrious writer, was born at London in the year 1719, where his father was
                    employed as a builder and surveyor. He received an education for the same
                    profession, but afterwards became clerk to an attorney; and as his employment
                    consisted chiefly in copying, he improved his mind in knowledge by rising early,
                    and had made considerable advances by the time that his clerkship ended. He was
                    soon afterwards admitted as an attorney, and his taste for music procured him
                    admission into the Academy of Ancient Music. Having attained a degree of
                    celebrity by publishing the words of two sets of cantatas, the music of which
                    was furnished by Stanley, he was introduced to some acquaintances, who assisted
                    him in carrying forward his professional views. In 1749 he was introduced as a
                    member of a tavern club which had been instituted by Dr Johnson, and the
                    connection thus formed between that great man and him was only dissolved by
                    death. In 1753 he married a daughter of Mr Peter Storer, by whom he obtained a
                    handsome fortune; and this being augmented by the death of his brother, he laid
                    aside the profession of attorney, and lived as an independent gentleman. He
                    afterwards became a justice of the peace for the county of Middlesex, and was
                    both an active and an useful magistrate. Being extremely fond of angling, he
                    became the editor of Walton’s <hi rend="italic">Complete Angler,</hi> whichhe
                    enriched with notes of his own, and a life of the author, a work which has since
                    been frequently republished.</p>
                <p>His Observations on the Highways brought him a liberal share of public
                    approbation, and it has served as a model for all the acts which have since been
                    passed. In 1765 he was chosen chairman of the quarter sessions, and, in the year
                    1772, he obtained the honour of knighthood. Some of the notes to the edition of
                    Shakspeare by Johnson and Steevens were furnished by Sir John, who was for many
                    years engaged in writing the history of music, which he completed in 1776, in
                    five vols. 4to. It abounds with curious and original information, and may be
                    considered as a repository of many useful things not elsewhere to be met with.
                    His valuable library was destroyed by fire, which interrupted his literary
                    labours, but made no change in the tranquillity of his mind. In the year 1787
                    his Life and Works of Dr Samuel Johnson appeared in eleven vols. 8vo. This life
                    is a garrulous miscellany of anecdote, in which the author frequently wanders
                    from his subject; yet it contains many facts respecting that extraordinary man
                    which his admirers could wish had been concealed. After this he prepared for the
                    termination of his own life, which he perceived approaching; and he died in the
                    month of May 1789, being then about seventy years of age.</p>
