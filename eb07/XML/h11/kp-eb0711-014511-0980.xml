                <p><label type="entry">HARDOUIN, <hi rend="smallcaps">John</hi></label>, a Jesuit,
                    one of the most learned, and at the same time most singular men whose names are
                    to be found in the history of letters, was born at Quimper, in 1646. He was the
                    son of a bookseller; and this circumstance, in furnishing him with the means of
                    instruction, no doubt contributed to develope that desire for knowledge which at
                    first formed the principal trait of his <hi rend="superscript"> i</hi>
                    character. When his studies were terminated, he made application to the Jesuits,
                    into whose body he wished to be received; but he only obtained his admission
                    after two years of trial and examination; from which it may reasonably be
                    conjectured that, at the age of twenty, he gave no proofs of those brilliant
                    qualities for which he was afterwards distinguished. For some time he professed
                    rhetoric, and then proceeded to Paris in order to complete his course of
                    theology. He was associated with Father Garnier in classifying the books
                    belonging to the college of Louis the Great, and in 1683 he succeeded to the
                    office of librarian. The learned were then preparing editions of the classical
                    authors for the use of the Dauphin; but none of them had ventured to undertake
                    the <hi rend="italic">Natural History</hi> of Pliny, a work the text of which
                    has suffered more than that of almost any other ancient author, and which, to be
                    thoroughly understood and appreciated, requires extensive knowledge of various
                    kinds. Father Hardouin undertook<pb break="no" facs="nls:193640993"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0711-0993-0146"/> this task, to which he applied himself with
                    incredible zeal. In trying to determine the positions of the towns mentioned by
                    Pliny, he became sensible that a knowledge of medals would assist him in
                    clearing up different points of ancient geography; and with this view he
                    immediately applied to the study of numismatics, in which he soon rendered
                    himself profound. His edition of Pliny was completed in five years, and, when it
                    appeared, made the learned and indefatigable editor known to all Europe. This
                    work, which, according to Huet, would have occupied any five ordinary scholars
                    fifty years, met with so flattering a reception, that Father Hardouin could not
                    enjoy his success with moderation. The commendations which poured in upon him
                    from all quarters intoxicated him with pride; and he no longer spoke of other
                    antiquaries, except with the utmost contempt. The latter, again, set themselves
                    to humble him in his turn, by depreciating his merits, and exaggerating his
                    faults. Hardouin replied with bitterness, and in his reasonings displayed more
                    subtlety than good faith; for rather than confess his errors, he attempted to
                    palliate them by paradoxes, and, proceeding from one thing to another, he at
                    length came to advance some so utterly extravagant, that, if they have not
                    ruined his reputation, as some pretend, they have at least weakened the
                    impression which would otherwise have been produced by his really prodigious
                    knowledge. In one of his works, <hi rend="italic">La Chronologie
                    expliquée</hi><hi rend="italic">par</hi><hi rend="italic">les Médailles,</hi> he
                    ventured to maintain that ancient history had been entirely recomposed in the
                    thirteenth century, with the help of the works of Cicero and Pliny, the Georgies
                    of Virgil, and the satires and epistles of Horace, the only monuments which, in
                    his opinion, had any claim to antiquity. This strange assertion, which tended to
                    raise doubts as to the authenticity of the sacred Scriptures themselves, caused
                    his production to be suppressed, drew down upon him the censure of his
                    superiors, and obliged him, in 1708, to make a retractation, but without in any
                    degree changing his opinions, which he reproduced in several of his works.
                    Besides his office of librarian, Hardouin filled a chair of theology; and,
                    notwithstanding the continual distractions to which he was exposed, he passed
                    few years without publishing some new writing, as remarkable for erudition as
                    for novelty of the ideas. He rose, summer and winter, at four in the morning,
                    and continued his readings until night was well advanced. Endowed with an
                    astonishing memory, and a sagacity which made itself be remarked even in his
                    greatest aberrations, he would have more certainly obtained the glory he coveted
                    if be had pursued it less eagerly. He thought himself original when he was only
                    singular; and he frequently advanced vain subtleties or extravagant paradoxes,
                    that he might avoid repeating what others had said before him. He prepared
                    himself for death with Christian resignation, and terminated his long career,
                    which it would have been easy for him to render more honourable, as well as more
                    useful, in the house of his order at Paris, on the 3d of September 1729, in the
                    eighty-third year of his age. His epitaph, written by Jacob Vernet of Geneva,
                    gives a very just idea of the celebrated personage, and of the strange mixture
                    of pride and naivete, of scepticism and solid piety, which made up his
                    character.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Naked,
