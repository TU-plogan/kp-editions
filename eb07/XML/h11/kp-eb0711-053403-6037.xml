                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra
                    space around the <gi>pb</gi> tag. Where a word is hyphenated at a <gi>pb</gi>,

                <p><label type="entry">HOLT, <hi rend="smallcaps">Sir John</hi></label>, Lord
                    Chief-Justice of the Court of King’s Bench in the reign of King William, eldest
                    son of Sir Thomas Holt, serjeant-at-law, was born at Thame, Oxfordshire, in
                    1642. He entered himself at Gray’s Inn in 1658, and applied to the common law
                    with so much industry that he soon became an eminent barrister. In the reign of
                    James II. he was made recorder of London, an office which he discharged with
                    much approbation for about a year and a half; but he lost his place by refusing
                    to expound the law suitably to the king’s designs. On the arrival of the Prince
                    of Orange he was chosen a member of the Convention Parliament, which afforded an
                    opportunity of displaying his abilities; and as soon as the government was
                    settled, he was made Lord Chief Justice of the Court of King’s Bench and a privy
                    counsellor. In 1700, when Lord Somers resigned the great seal, King William
                    pressed Chief-Justice Holt to accept of it; but he replied that he never had in
                    his life but one chancery cause, which he lost, and that consequently he could
                    not think himself qualified for so great a trust. He continued as chief justice
                    for twenty-two years, during which time he obtained great reputation for
                    steadiness, integrity, and thorough knowledge in his profession. Upon great
                    occasions he asserted the law with intrepidity, though he thereby ventured to
                    incur by turns the indignation of both houses of parliament. Holt was a perfect
                    master of the common law, and as his judgment was sound, his capacity great, and
                    his understanding clear, so he possessed a firmness of mind, and a vigour of
                    resolution, which nothing could overcome when he found himself called upon to
                    assert the authority of the law, and to vindicate the purity of justice. Several
                    causes of the utmost importance, as affecting the lives, rights, liberties, and
                    property of the people, came in judgment before him, and his decisions were all
                    marked by the same high qualities. His definitions<pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193646050" xml:id="kp-eb0711-6050-0535"/> were remarkable for
                    clearness and perspicuity; his arguments displayed equal powers of analysis and
                    arrangement; and he possessed the invaluable faculty of rendering perceptible
                    and obvious the natural differences of things, at the same time that he
                    discriminated, with the nicest tact, between real and fanciful resemblances. His
                    great secret consisted in the rigid and scrupulous adjustment of his premises;
                    and hence he seldom erred in his conclusions. His arguments were instructive and
                    convincing, whilst his integrity shrunk from any accommodation of judicial
                    opinion to existing interests or prejudices. His decisions are, most of them,
                    faithfully and judiciously reported by Chief-Justice Raymond, himself an eminent
                    lawyer; and his integrity and uprightness as a judge are celebrated by the
                    author of the <hi rend="italic">Tatter</hi> (No. 14), under the character of
                    Verus the magistrate. The following reports were published by him, in 1708,
                    folio, with notes: “A Report of divers Cases in Pleas of the Crown, adjudged and
                    determined in the reign of King Charles II. with directions for justices of the
                    peace and others, collected by Sir John Keyling, knight, Lord Chief Justice of
                    the Court of King’s Bench, from the original manuscript under his hand; to which
                    is added, the Report of three modern cases, viz. Armstrong and Lisle, the King
                    and Plumer, the Queen and Mawgridge.” A pretended second edition appeared in
                    1739, but the title only was new.</p>

                    the parish of Bradford. The inhabitants amounted in 1811 to 1812, in 1821 to
