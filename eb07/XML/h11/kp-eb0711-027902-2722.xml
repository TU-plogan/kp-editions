                <p><label type="entry">HERODOTUS</label>, a celebrated historian, the son of Lyx-as
                    and Dryo, was a native of Halicarnassus, a city of Asia Minor. He was born 484
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">a. c.</hi> being descended of a family not less
                    distinguished for its love of literature than for its wealth and political
                    influence. His uncle Panyasis was highly esteemed as an epic poet, his writings
                    being regarded by his contemporaries as only second to those of Homer. We are
                    therefore justified in believing that the youthful mind of Herodotus was
                    cultivated with an assiduity which contributed in no small degree to the
                    eminence of his maturer years. (Suidas, ’ Hooδoros and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Hαvυaff∕ς,</hi> Schol. Aristoph. Nab. 331.) The period of history which he
                    selected had nothing of novelty to recommend it; many writers of great celebrity
                    had preceded him, but their high name and reputation, far from discouraging him,
                    served only to excite his emulation and to develope his talents. Xanthus of
                    Lydia, Hecataeus of Miletus, Pherecydes, Acesi-laus, Hellanicus of Lesbos,
                    Charon of Lampsacus, had each treated different parts of his subject with a
                    masterly hand, and it required no small confidence in his own powers to venture
                    on a period of history which had been so nearly exhausted. To enable him to do
                    justice to his subject, he determined to visit those countries the transactions
                    of which he was about to narrate. It is impossible to trace the exact route
                    which he pursued with any degree of precision, or to say with certainty whether
                    he visited Greece and the adjoining isles before he proceeded to the more remote
                    parts of the East. But be this as it may, Egypt was one of the first and most
                    constant objects of his attention and research. This country, which had long
                    been inaccessible to strangers, from the defensive policy of its sovereigns and
                    the inhospitable nature of its inhabitants, had been recently thrown open to the
                    Greeks. Thither Herodotus proceeded; and it is curious to remark, that though
                    many since that period have visited the country, and published the results of
                    their inquiries, no one has given a more exact description, either of the
                    physical appearance of Egypt, or of the manners of its inhabitants, than the
                    father of history. It was not merely to the geography of the country that he
                    directed his attention, but to its productions, its peculiar customs, its
                    strange superstitions, and the history of the princes who reigned immediately
                    before its conquest by the Persians. In his second book we have the fruits of
                    his voyage to Egypt; and it may be still referred to as the purest source for
                    acquiring a minute knowledge of its ancient history and institutions.
                    (Herodotus, ii.)</p>
                <p>From Egypt he must have passed into Libya, for we cannot believe that his
                    accurately detailed account of the whole coast, from the frontiers of Egypt to
                    the remote districts beyond Gibraltar, even as far as the promontory of Solocis,
                    could have been acquired otherwise than by personal examination. It is too
                    minute, and too conformable with what we know of these countries at the present
                    time, to have been collected from the hearsay statements of travellers. (ii.
                    181; iv. 168, 195, 196.)</p>
                <p>His visit to Tyre, the splendid city of the Phoenicians, is attested by himself
                    (ii. 44); and he must at the same time have examined the coasts of Palestine, as
                    he mentions having seen the pillar, and the disgraceful emblem engraved on it,
                    intended by Sesostris to commemorate his victory, about 1350 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">a. c.,</hi> over a weak and demoralized people, (ii. 106.)</p>
                <p>Some have ventured to deny that he ever journeyed so <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193642735" xml:id="kp-eb0711-2735-0280"/>far to the east as Babylon,
                    and the rich plains of Assyria: yet if he had not been on the spot, he could
                    scarcely have delineated with such minuteness the topography of that mighty
                    city. Besides, in recording the existence of the temple of Jupiter Belus, he
                    adds that he did not see the celebrated golden statue which had adorned its
                    shrine, because Xerxes had carried it elsewhere (i. 181). We may add, that his
                    frequent intercourse with the Chaldaeans, and the conversations he held with
                    them, could scarcely have taken place in any part of the world beyond the
                    confines of Assyria.</p>
                <p>Colchis, as the theatre of an adventure depicted in all the glowing colours with
                    which the creative genius of the poets could adorn it, was a natural object of
                    curiosity. He traversed its rugged coast; and finding himself in the vicinity of
                    the wandering Scythians, he penetrated into their wild and desolate solitude as
                    far as the commercial speculations of the Greeks had reached (iv. 81). The
                    country of the Getae, Thrace, Macedon, and Epirus, were each in their turn
                    examined; but Greece was the chief object of his labours; and though we are
                    unable to specify the time when he first visited it, he no doubt did so before
                    his work was begun.</p>
                <p>On his return to his native city, he found its government usurped by the tyrant
                    Lygdamis ∙. his uncle Panyasis was soon afterwards put to death: and he himself
                    becoming an object of suspicion, retired to the island of Samos. Here probably
                    he composed his history, in the soft Ionic dialect, preferring it to the harsher
                    sounds of his native Doric. Yet, amidst the pursuits of literature, he did not
                    forget the claims of the city which gave him birth. He organized a conspiracy by
                    which Lygdamis was expelled; but the tyranny of the aristocracy which succeeded
                    proved even more hateful to the citizens than that from which they had been
                    delivered. They probably ascribed to Herodotus the crimes of his associates,
                    which he had no power to avert; and, disgusted with the ingratitude of his
                    fellowcitizens, the historian left for ever the shores of Caria, and proceeded
                    to Greece. (Lucian <hi rend="italic">in Herod,</hi> iv. p. 116.)</p>
                <p>He arrived at the beginning of the eighty-first Olympiad (456 A.c.),and found a
                    vast concourse of people assembled to celebrate the games at Olympia. He was
                    unknown to all; but, ambitious of fame, he invited an audience to come and hear
                    him recite a portion of his history; and as he no doubt selected the parts most
                    likely to flatter the pride and to excite the enthusiasm of his compatriots, his
                    success was complete, the acclamations with which he was received were
                    overwhelming, and from that moment he was considered one of the first men of his
                    age. It is supposed that it was at this recitation that Thucydides, then in his
                    fifteenth year, shed tears of emulation when he saw the honours showered on the
                    head of the historian. Herodotus foretold to the father the future fame of his
                    son, and the sanction of posterity has verified the prediction. (Suid.;
                    Marcellii <hi rend="italic">Vit.</hi><hi rend="italic">Thucyd.</hi> p. 32.) Of
                    the next twelve years, we can only conjecture that he spent them in Greece, and
                    that he employed them in travelling leisurely over the country, examining with
                    attention the archives of different people, verifying on original monuments the
                    genealogies of the most illustrious families, and collecting the local
                    traditions of great events at their source. It is said he was in the habit of
                    reading to the different states the portions of history which more particularly
                    referred to them, and was thus able to correct any error into which he might
                    have fallen. At Athens, at the festival of Panathenaea, 446 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >a. c.,</hi> he again recited a portion of his history, and received from the
                    hands of that discerning people a donation of ten talents. (Eusb. <hi
                    rend="italic">Chron.</hi> p. 104.) In 444 <hi rend="smallcaps">a. c.</hi> Athens
                    was preparing to send a colony to Thurium, and Herodotus determined to accompany
                    it as a volunteer. Here he must have spent the remainder of his life in
                    dignified repose, employing his time in retouching his history, and rendering
                    the style still more harmonious. The period of his death is uncertain; but from
                    a fact which he records, and which we know to have happened 408 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">a. c.</hi> he must have been employed in his history till that
                    time. (Herodot. i. 130; iii. 15.)</p>
                <p>The work is contained in nine books, each dedicated to one of the muses; but
                    whether this was done by himself or by posterity we are unable to decide. To it
                    we are indebted for our knowledge of the origin and progress of the Persian
                    monarchy; of that of the Medes and Assyrians which preceded it; the origin of
                    the kingdom of Lydia, its destruction by Cyrus the elder, and the numerous
                    expeditions of that monarch; the conquest of Egypt by Cambyses, with a minute
                    description of that country; the various wars in which the successors of Cyrus
                    were engaged, and particularly the expedition of Darius against the Scythians,
                    where he takes an opportunity of introducing an account of that people in the
                    north of Europe and Asia. Then follows his narrative of the Persian expedition
                    against the Greeks, and their noble struggle against the overwhelming power of
                    that monarchy. This narrative breaks off at the siege of Sestos, 478 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">a.</hi> c.; and though he alludes to events that happened
                    seventy years later, he does not seem to have continued his history further.
                    (Diodor. xi. 37.) Some have ascribed to him a life of FIomer, which is generally
                    bound up with his work; but there are strong reasons for believing that it is
                    the composition of a later age. He seems also to allude to a work on Assyria <hi
                    rend="italic">(Assyriaca),</hi> i. 184; but as no notice is taken of it by
                    subsequent writers, it was probably never executed.</p>
