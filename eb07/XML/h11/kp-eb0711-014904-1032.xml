                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra

                <p><label type="entry">HARMONICA</label>. This word, when originally appropriated by
                    Dr Franklin to that peculiar form or mode of musical glasses which he himself,
                    after a number of happy experiments, had constituted, was written <hi
                    rend="italic">armonica.</hi> In this place, however, we have ventured to restore
                    it to its native plenitude of sound. It is derived from the Greek word <hi
                    rend="italic">α%μοv</hi><hi rend="italic">∣</hi><hi rend="italic">α.</hi> The
                    radical word is <hi rend="italic">aξpv, to suit</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Jit
                    one thing to another.</hi> By the word αgμowa the Greeks expressed <hi
                    rend="italic">aptitudes</hi> of various kinds; and from the use which they made
                    of that expression, we have reason to conclude that it was intended to import
                    the highest degree of refinement and delicacy in those relations which it was
                    meant to indicate. Relations or aptitudes of sound, in particular, were
                    understood by it; and in this view Dr Franklin could not have selected a name
                    more expressive of its nature and genius, for the instrument which we are now to
                    describe; as, perhaps, no musical tones can be finer, or susceptible of juster
                    concords, than those which it produces.</p>
                <p>The doctor, in his letter to Beccaria, has given a minute account of the
                    harmonica; nor does it appear that his successors have either sensibly improved,
                    or more accurately delineated, that instrument. The detail of his own
                    improvements, therefore, shall be given in his own words.</p>
                <p>“Perhaps,” says he, “it may be agreeable to you, as you live in a musical
                    country, to have an account of the new instrument lately added here to the great
                    number that charming science was possessed of before. As it is an instrument
                    that seems peculiarly adapted to Italian music, especially that of the soft and
                    plaintive kind, I will endeavour to give you such a description of it, and of
                    the manner of constructing it, that you or any of your friends may be enabled to
                    imitate it, if you incline so to do, without being at the expense and trouble of
                    the many experiments I have made in endeavouring to bring it to its present
                    perfection.</p>
                <p>“You have doubtless heard the sweet tone that is drawn from a drinking glass, by
                    pressing a wet finger round its brim. One Mr Puckeridge, a gentleman from
                    Ireland, was the first who thought of playing tunes formed of these tones. He
                    collected a number of glasses of different sizes; fixed them near each other on
                    a table; and tuned them, by putting into them water, more or less as each note
                    required. The tones were brought out by pressing his fingers round their brims.
                    He was unfortunately burnt here, with his instrument, in a fire which consumed
                    the house he lived in. Mr E. Delaval, a most ingenious member of our Royal
                    Society, made one in imitation of it, with a better choice and form of glasses,
                    which was the first I saw or heard. Being charmed with the sweetness of its
                    tones and the music he produced from it, I wished to see the glasses disposed in
                    a more convenient form, and brought together in a narrower compass, so as to
                    admit of a <hi rend="subscript"> l</hi> greater number of tones, and all within
                    reach of hand to a person sitting before the instrument; which I accomplished,
                    after various intermediate trials, and less commodious forms, both of glasses
                    and construction, in the following manner.</p>
                <p>“The glasses are blown as near as possible in the form of hemispheres, having
                    each an open neck or socket in the middle. The thickness of the glass near the
                    brim is about the tenth of an inch, or hardly quite so much, but thicker as it
                    comes nearer the neck, which in the largest glasses is about an inch deep, and
                    an inch and a half wide within; these dimensions lessening as the glasses
                    themselves diminish in size, except that the neck of the smallest ought not to
                    be shorter than half an inch. The largest glass is nine inches diameter, and the
                    smallest three inches. Between these there are twenty-three different sizes,
                    differing from each other a quarter of an inch in diameter. To make a single
                    instrument, there should be at least six glasses blown of each size; and out of
                    this number one may probably pick thirty-seven glasses (which are sufficient for
                    <pb break="no" facs="nls:193641045" xml:id="kp-eb0711-1045-0150"/>three octaves
                    with all the semitones), that will be each either the note one wants, or a
                    little sharper than that note, ’ and all fitting so well into each other, as to
                    taper pretty regularly from the largest to the smallest. It is true there are
                    not thirty-seven sizes; but it often happens that two of the same size differ a
                    note or half a note in tone, by reason of a difference in thickness; and these
                    may be placed one in the other, without sensibly hurting the regularity of the
                    taper form.</p>
                <p>“The glasses being chosen, and every one marked with a diamond the note you
                    intend it for, they arc to be tuned by diminishing the thickness of those that
                    are too sharp. This is done by grinding them round from the neck towards the
                    brim, the breadth of one or two inches, as may be required, often trying the
                    glass by a well-tuned harpsichord, comparing the note drawn from the glass by
                    your finger with the note you want, as sounded by that string of the
                    harpsichord. When you come near the matter, be careful to wipe the glass clean
                    and dry before each trial; because the tone is something flatter when the glass
                    is wet than it will be when dry; and grinding a very little between each trial,
                    you will thereby tune to great exactness. The more care is necessary in this,
                    because, if you go below your required tone, there is no sharpening it again,
                    but by grinding somewhat off the brim, which will afterwards require polishing,
                    and thus increase the trouble.</p>
                <p>“The glasses being thus tuned, you are to be provided with a case for them, and a
                    spindle on which they are to be fixed. My case is about three feet long, eleven
                    inches every way wide within at the biggest end, and five inches at the smallest
                    end; for it tapers all the way, to adapt it better to the conical figure of the
                    set of glasses. This case opens in the middle of its height, and the upper part
                    turns up by hinges fixed behind. The spindle is of hard iron, lies horizontally
                    from end to end of the box within, exactly in the middle, and is made to turn on
                    brass gudgeons at each end. It is round, an inch diameter at the thickest end,
                    and tapering to a quarter of an inch at the smallest. A square shank comes from
                    its upper end through the box, on which shank a wheel is fixed by a screw. This
                    wheel serves as a fly to make the motion equable, when the spindle, with the
                    glasses, is turned by the foot like a spinning-wheel. My wheel is of mahogany,
                    eighteen-inches diameter, and pretty thick, so as to conceal near its
                    circumference about twenty-five pounds of lead. An ivory pin is fixed in the
                    face of this wheel, about four inches from the axis. Over the neck of this pin
                    is put the loop of the string that comes up from the moveable step to give it
                    motion. The case stands on a neat frame with four legs.</p>
                <p>“To fix the glasses on the spindle, a cork is first to be fitted in each neck
                    pretty tight, and projecting a little without the neck, that the neck of one may
                    not touch the inside of another when put together, for that would make a
                    jarring. These corks are to be perforated with holes of different diameters, so
                    as to suit that part of the spindle on which they are to be fixed. When a glass
                    is put on, by holding it stiffly between both hands, while another turns the
                    spindle, it may be gradually brought to its place. But care must be taken that
                    the hole be not too small, lest, in forcing it up, the neck should split; nor
                    too large, lest the glass, not being firmly fixed, should turn or move on the
                    spindle, so as to touch or jar against its neighbouring glass. The glasses thus
                    are placed one in another; the largest on the biggest end of the spindle, which
                    is to the left hand. The neck of this glass is towards the wheel; and the next
                    goes into it in the same position, only about an inch of its brim appearing
                    beyond the brim of the first; thus proceeding, every glass when fixed shows
                    about an inch of its brim (or three quarters of an inch, or half an inch, as
                    they grow smaller) beyond the brim of the glass that contains it; and it is from
                    these exposed parts of each glass that the tone is drawn, by laying a finger on
                    one of them as the spindle and glasses turn round.</p>
                <p>“My largest glass is G, a little below the reach of a common voice, and my
                    highest G, including three complete octaves. To distinguish the glasses more
                    readily to the eye, I have painted the apparent parts of the glasses within
                    side, every semitone white, and the other notes of the octave with the seven
                    prismatic colours; viz. C red, D orange, E yellow, F green, G blue, A indigo, B
                    purple, and G red again; so that the glasses of the same colour (the white
                    excepted) are always octaves to each other.</p>
                <p>“This instrument is played upon by sitting before the middle of the set of
                    glasses, as before the keys of a harpsichord, turning them with the foot, and
                    wetting them now and then with a spunge and clean water. The fingers should be
                    first a little soaked in water, and quite free from all greasiness: a little
                    fine chalk upon them is sometimes useful, to make them catch the glass and bring
                    out the tone more readily. Both hands are used, by which means different parts
                    are played together. Observe, that the tones are best drawn out when the glasses
                    turn <hi rend="italic">from</hi> the ends of the fingers, not when they turn <hi
                    rend="italic">t'o</hi> them.</p>
                <p>“The advantages of this instrument are, that its tones are incomparably sweet
                    beyond those of any other; that they may be swelled and softened at pleasure by
                    stronger or weaker pressures of the finger, and continued to any length; and
                    that the instrument, being once well tuned, never again wants tuning.”</p>
