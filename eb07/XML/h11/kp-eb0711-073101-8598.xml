                <p><label type="entry">HUNGER</label>, an uneasy sensation occasioned by long
                    abstinence from food when the body is in a healthy state. The following useful
                    observations upon hunger or famine are extracted from a paper by Dr Percival in
                    the second volume of the <hi rend="italic">Manchester Transactions.</hi></p>
                <p>In a state of famine, life may be protracted, with less pain and misery, by means
                    of a moderate allowance of water. For the acrimony and putrefaction of the
                    humours are obviated by such dilution; the small vessels are kept permeable; and
                    the lungs are furnished with that moisture which is essential to the performance
                    of their functions. Fontanus, a writer of respectable authority in the
                    estimation of Morgagni, relates the history of a woman who obstinately refused
                    to take any sustenance, except twice, during the space of fifty days, at the end
                    of which period she died. But he adds, that she used water by way of drink,
                    though in small quantity. Redi, who made many experiments (cruel and
                    unjustifiable in our opinion) to ascertain the effects of fasting on fowls,
                    observed that none were able to support life beyond the ninth day to whom drink
                    was denied, whercas one indulged with water lived more than twenty days.</p>
                <p>Hippocrates has observed, that children are more affected by abstinence than
                    young persons, these more than the middle-aged, and the middle-aged more than
                    old men. The power to endure famine, however, must depend no less upon the state
                    of health and strength than upon the age of the sufferer. There are also
                    particular constitutions which do not suffer much pain from the calls of hunger.
                    Dr Percival was informed by a young physician from Geneva, that when he was a
                    student at Montpellier he fasted three nights and four days, with no other
                    refreshment than a pint of water daily. His hunger was keen, but never painful,
                    during the first and second days of his abstinence; and the two following days
                    he perceived only a faintness when he attempted either bodily or mental
                    exertion. A sense of coldness was diffused over his whole frame, but more
                    particularly affected the extremities. His mind was in a very unusual state of
                    pusillanimity; and he experienced a great tendency to tears whenever he
                    recollected the circumstance which had been the occasion of his fasting. During
                    the whole period, the alvine excretions were suppressed, but not those by the
                    kidneys; and at the close of it his skin became tinged with a shade of yellow.
                    The first food he took was veal broth, which had something of an intoxicating
                    effect, producing a glow of warmth, and raising his spirits, so as to render him
                    ashamed of his despondency. Perhaps, in the case of Sextius Baculus, as recorded
                    in the Commentaries of Caesar (lib. vi.), the extraordinary courage and prowess
                    which he suddenly exerted might be aided by the exhilarating effect of
                    sustenance, which, under such circumstances, it is probable he would no longer
                    decline. The fact, however, evinces that neither his sickness nor the sensations
                    of hunger had been so violent as much to impair his strength of body or vigour
                    of mind. Pomponius Atticus, the celebrated friend of Cicero, who put a voluntary
                    end to his life in the seventy-seventh year of his age by refusing all food,
                    appears to have experienced ease from his disorder, rather than any acute
                    sufferings, by famine. “Sic cum biduo cibo se abstinuisset, subito febris
                    decessit, leviorque morbus esse coepit; tamen propositum nihilo secius peregit.
                    Itaque die quinto, postquam id consilium inierat, decessit.”<note

                    circumstance, it has been conjectured that he did not wholly deny himself the
                    use of water, or of some other diluent. But though a few examples of this kind
                    may be produced, we have the evidence of numerous melancholy facts to show that
                    the pressure of want is agonizing to the human frame. “I have talked,” says an
                    ingenious writer,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Dr
                    Goldsmith’s <hi rend="italic">HUtory of the Earth,</hi> vok ii. p.
                    126.</p></note> “with a captain of a ship who was one of six that endured it in
                    its extremity, and who was the only person that had not lost his senses when
                    they received accidental relief. He assured me his pains at first were so great
                    as to be often tempted to eat a part of one of the men who died, and which the
                    rest of his crew actually for some time lived upon. He said that, during the
                    continuance of this paroxysm, he found his pains insupportable, and was desirous
                    at one time of anticipating that death which he thought inevitable. But his
                    pains, he said, gradually decreased after the sixth day (for they had water in
                    the ship, which kept them alive so long), and then he was in a state rather of
                    languor than desire; nor did he much wish for food, except when he saw others
                    eating; and that for a while revived his appetite, though with diminished
                    importunity. The latter part of the time, when his health was almost destroyed,
                    a thousand strange images rose upon his mind, and every one of his senses began
                    to bring him wrong information. The most fragrant perfumes appeared to him to
                    have a fetid smell; and every thing he looked at took a greenish hue, and
                    sometimes a yellow. When he was presented with food by the ship’s company that
                    took him and his men up, four of whom died shortly after, he could not help
                    looking upon it with loathing instead of desire; and it was not till after four
                    days that his stomach was brought to its natural tone, when the violence of his
                    appetite returned with a sort of canine eagerness.”</p>
                <p>To those who by their occupations are exposed to such dreadful calamities, it is
                    of serious importance to be instructed in the means of alleviating them. The
                    American Indians are said to use a composition of the juice of tobacco, and the
                    shells of snails, cockles, and oysters calcined, whenever they undertake a long
                    journey, and are likely to be destitute of provisions. It is probable the shells
                    are not burned into quicklime, but only so as to destroy their tenacity, and to
                    render them fit for lévigation. The mass is dried, and formed into pills of a
                    proper size to be held between the gum and lip, which, being gradually dissolved
                    and swallowed, deaden the sensations both of hunger and of thirst. Tobacco, by
                    its narcotic quality, seems well adapted to counteract the uneasy impressions
                    which the gastric juice makes on the nerves of the stomach when it is empty; and
                    the combination of testaceous powder with it may tend to correct the secretion
                    that is supposed to be the chief agent in digestion, and which, if not acid, is
                    always united with acidity. Certain at least it is, that their operation is both
                    grateful and salutary; for we find the luxurious inhabitants of the East Indies
                    mix them with the betel-nut, to the chewing of which they are universally and
                    immoderately addicted. Perhaps such absorbents may be usefully applied, both to
                    divide the doses and to moderate the virulence of the tobacco. For, in the
                    internal exhibition of this plant, much caution is required, as it produces
                    sickness, vertigo, cold clammy sweats, and a train of other formidable symptoms,
                    when taken in too large a quantity. During the time of war, the impressed
                    sailors frequently bring on these maladies that they may be admitted into the
                    hospitals, and released from servitude. It would be an easy and safe experiment
                    to ascertain the efficacy and to adjust the ingredients of the Indian
                    composition mentioned; and there is reason to believe that the trial would be in
                    some degree successful; for it is known that smoking tobacco gives relief to
                    those habitual pains of the stomach which appear to arise from the irritation of
                    <pb break="no" facs="nls:193648611" xml:id="kp-eb0711-8611-0732"/>the gastric
                    secretion. The like effect is sometimes produced by increasing the flow of
                    saliva, and swallowing what is thus discharged. And Dr Percival has related the
                    case of a gentleman who used to masticate, many hours daily, a piece of lead,
                    which being neither hard, friable, nor offensive to the palate, suited his
                    purpose, as he thought, better than any other substance. He continued the custom
                    for many years, deriving great ease from it, and suffering no sensible injury
                    from the poisonous quality of the metal. On mentioning this fact to a navy
                    surgeon, the doctor was told that the sailors, when in hot climates, are wont to
                    mitigate thirst by rolling a bullet in their mouths. A more innocent mean, the
                    doctor observes, might be devised; but the efficacy of this evinces, that the
                    salivary glands are for awhile capable of furnishing a substitute for drink.
                    When a scarcity of water occurs at sea, Dr Franklin has advised that the
                    mariners should bathe themselves in tubs of salt water. For, in pursuing the
                    amusement of swimming, he observed, that however thirsty he was before
                    immersion, he never continued so afterwards; and that, though he soaked himself
                    several hours in the day, and several days successively, in salt water, he
                    perceived not, in consequence of it, the least taste of saltness in his mouth.
                    He also further suggests, that the same good effect might perhaps be derived
                    from dipping the sailors’ apparel in the sea, and expresses a confidence that no
                    danger of catching cold would ensue.</p>
                <p>To prevent the calamity of famine at sea, it has been proposed by Dr Lind, that
                    the powder of salep should constitute part of the provisions of every ship’s
                    company. This powder and portable soup, dissolved in boiling water, form a rich
                    thick jelly; and an ounce of each of these articles furnishes one day’s
                    subsistence to a healthy full-grown man. Indeed, from Dr Percival’s experiments
                    it appears, that salep contains more nutritious matter, in proportion to its
                    bulk, than any other vegetable production now used as food. It has the property
                    also of concealing the nauseous taste of salt water; and consequently may be of
                    great advantage at sea, when the stock of fresh water is so far consumed that
                    the mariners are put upon short allowance. By the same mucilaginous quality, it
                    covers the offensiveness, and even in some measure corrects the acrimony, of
                    salted and putrescent meats. But, as a preservative against hunger, salep would
                    be most efficaciously combined with an equal weight of beef suet. By swallowing
                    little balls of this lubricating compound at proper intervals, the coats of the
                    stomach would be defended from irritation; and as oils and mucilages are highly
                    nutritive, of slow digestion, and indisposed to pass off by perspiration, they
                    arc peculiarly well adapted to support life in small quantities. This
                    composition is superior in simplicity, and perhaps equal in efficacy, to the
                    following one, so much extolled by Avicenna the celebrated Arabian physician, to
                    whom we are indebted for the introduction of rhubarb, cassia, tamarinds, and
                    senna, into the materia medica. “Take sweet almonds and beef suet, of each one
                    pound; of the oil of violets two ounces; and of the roots of marshmallows one
                    ounce; bray these ingredients together in a mortar, and form the mass into
                    boluses about the size of a common nut.” Animal fat is singularly powerful in
                    assuaging the most acute sensations of thirst, as appears from the narrative of
                    the sufferings experienced by those who w ere confined in the black hole at
                    Calcutta. A hundred and forty-six persons, exhausted by fatigue and military
                    duty, were there thrust together into a chamber of eighteen cubic feet, having
                    only two windows, strongly barred with iron, from which, in a close sultry
                    night, and in such a climate as that of Bengal, little or no circulation of
                    fresh air could be enjoyed. In a few minutes these unhappy wretches fell into
                    suctι a profuse perspiration, that an idea can hardly be formed of it; and this
                    again was succeeded by a raging thirst, which increased in proportion as the
                    body was drained of its moisture. Water, water, became the universal cry; and an
                    old soldier on the outside, through pity, furnished them with a few skinfuls of
                    it. But these scanty supplies, like sprinklings thrown on the fire, served only
                    to feed and increase the flame. From this experience of its effects, Mr Holwell,
                    their chief, determined to drink no more, and kept his mouth moist by sucking
                    the perspiration out of his shirt sleeves, and catching the drops as they fell
                    from his head and face. “You cannot imagine,” says he, “how unhappy I was if any
                    of them escaped me.” He came into the prison without his coat, the season being
                    too hot to bear it; and one of his miserable companions, observing the expedient
                    he had hit upon of allaying his thirst, robbed him from time to time of a
                    considerable part of his store. This plunderer, whom he found to be a young
                    gentleman in the service of the East India Company, afterwards acknowledged that
                    he owed his life to the many comfortable draughts which he derived from him.
                    Before Mr Holwell adopted this mode of relief, he had attempted, in an
                    ungovernable fit of thirst, to drink his own urine; but it was so intensely
                    bitter that a second taste could not be endured; whereas, he assures us, no
                    Bristol water could be more soft and pleasant than his perspiration. And this,
                    we may presume, consisted chiefly of animal fat, melted by excessive heat, and
                    exuding from the cellular membrane through the pores of the skin.</p>
                <p>Persons who have been accustomed to animal food are soon reduced when supplied
                    only with the farinacea. Several years ago, to determine the comparative
                    nutritive powers of different substances, an ingenious young physician, as Dr
                    Percival informs us, made a variety of experiments on himself, to which he
                    unfortunately fell a sacrifice. He lived a month upon bread and water; and under
                    this regimen of diet he every day diminished much in his weight.</p>
                <p>In attempts to recover those who have suffered under the calamities of famine,
                    great circumspection is required. Warmth, cordials, and food, are the means to
                    be employed; and it is evident that these may prove too powerful in their
                    operation, if not administered with caution and judgment. For the body, by long
                    fasting, is reduced to a state of more than infantile debility; the minuter
                    vessels of the brain, and of the other organs, collapse for want of fluids to
                    distend them; the stomach and intestines shrink in their capacity; and the heart
                    languidly vibrates, having scarcely sufficient energy to propel the scanty
                    current of blood. Under such circumstances, a proper application of heat seems
                    an essential measure, and may be effected by placing on each side a healthy man
                    in contact with the patient. Pediluvia or fomentations may also be used with
                    advantage. The temperature of these should be lower than that of the human body,
                    and gradually increased according to the effects of their stimulus. New milk,
                    weak broth, or water gruel, ought to be employed both for the one and the other;
                    as nutriment may be conveyed into the system this way, by passages probably the
                    most pervious in a state of fasting, if not too long protracted. “A lad at
                    Newmarket<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Watson’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Chemical Essays,</hi> vol. iii. p. 101.</p></note> having been
                    almost starved in order that he might be reduced to a proper weight for riding a
                    match, was weighed at nine o’clock in the morning, and again at ten; and he was
                    found to have gained near thirty ounces in weight in the course of an hour,
                    though he had only drank half a glass of wine in the interval. The wine probably
                    stimulated the action of the nervous system, and incited nature, exhausted by
                    abstinence, to open the absorbent <pb break="no" facs="nls:193648624"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0711-8624-0733"/>pores of the whole body, nι order to suck in some
                    nourishment from the air.” But no such absorption as this can be expected in a
                    state of extreme weakness and emaciation gradually induced, because the
                    lymphatics must partake of the general want of tone and energy. And
                    notwithstanding the salutary effects of wine in the case of the jockey, who, it
                    is likely, had been reduced by sweating as well as by abstinence, such a
                    stimulant might prove dangerous, and even fatal, in other cases. It appears
                    safer to advise the exhibition of cordials in very small doses, and at first
                    considerably diluted. Slender wine whey will perhaps best answer this purpose,
                    and afford, at the same time, an easy and pleasant nourishment. When the stomach
                    has been a little strengthened, an egg may be mixed with the whey, or
                    administered under some other agreeable form. The yolk of one was, to Cornaro,
                    sufficient for a meal; and the narrative of this noble Venetian, in whom a fever
                    was excited by the addition of only two ounces of food to his daily allowance,
                    shows that the return to a full diet should be conducted with great caution, and
                    by very slow gradations.</p>
