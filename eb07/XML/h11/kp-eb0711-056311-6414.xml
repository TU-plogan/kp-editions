                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra

                <p><label type="entry">HORNE, <hi rend="smallcaps">George</hi></label>, an English
                    prelate of considerable eminence, was born in the vicinity of Maidstone, in the
                    county of Kent, in the year 1730. His father was rector of Otham; and having for
                    some time acted in the capacity of tutor at Oxford, was well qualified to
                    superintend the education of his son. However, that the latter might not be
                    spoiled by too long a residence at home, he was, by the advice of a friend,
                    sent, at the age of thirteen, to Maidstone school, where he continued under an
                    eminent teacher for two years, and acquired some knowledge of oriental
                    literature, particularly the Hebrew. In his fifteenth year he went to Oxford,
                    where he laboured inde∙ fatigably to store his mind with almost every branch of
                    useful learning, and resolved to make polite literature subservient to the
                    knowledge and illustration of the Scrip <pb break="no" facs="nls:193646427"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0711-6427-0564"/>tures. He studied the Hebrew more attentively, and
                    was exhorted to abandon the method of Buxtorf, encumbered as it is with the
                    Masoretic punctuation. The rectitude of his conduct, and the vivacity of his
                    conversation, gained him the esteem of every person with whom he was acquainted.
                    īn the year 1749 he was made bachelor of arts, and next year was elected to a
                    fellowship in Magdalen College, without any solicitation upon his part.</p>
                <p>About this time he became a proselyte to the mysteries of Hutchinsonianism,
                    chiefly through the influence of Mr William Jones. At the age of nineteen, his
                    mind was completely fettered by these doctrines, believing that it was the
                    design of Sir Isaac Newton and Dr Clarke to subvert the theology of the
                    Scriptures, and introduce the stoical <hi rend="italic">anima</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">mundi</hi> instead of the God of the Universe. Under the influence
                    of such an infatuation, it is not astonishing that he should have endeavoured to
                    discredit the system of Newton. He obtained the degree of master of arts in the
                    year 1752, when he engaged in a controversy on the subject of the Cherubim. With
                    a view to recommend the writings of Hutchinson, he published, A fair, candid,
                    and impartial state of the case between Sir Isaac Newton and Mr Hutchinson, in
                    which is shown, how far a system of physics is capable of mathematical
                    demonstration; how far Sir Isaac’s, as such a system, has that demonstration;
                    and consequently, what regard Mr Hutchinson’s claim may deserve to have paid it.
                    In the year 1753 Mr Horne entered into holy orders, and acquired high reputation
                    as a public speaker, his compositions being excellent, and his elocution
                    graceful. Whilst preaching before the university, he introduced seme of his
                    peculiar notions, which again led him into controversy. A pamphlet made its
                    appearance, entitled A Word to the Hutchinsonians; or, remarks on three
                    extraordinary sermons lately preached before the university of Oxford, by Dr
                    Patten, Mr Wetherell, and Mr Horne. To this our author replied in an Apology for
                    certain gentlemen in the university of Oxford, aspersed in a late anonymous
                    pamphlet. The vindication of the hint to the Hutchinsonians was supposed to be
                    the production of Dr Kennicot, who afterwards became so famous for his labours
                    in collating Hebrew manuscripts, and his valuable edition of the Hebrew Bible.
                    Mr Horne was chosen proctor of the university in 1758; and, on the honourable
                    terminaticn of his authority, was created bachelor of divinity. When Mr,
                    afterwards Dr Kennicot, gave to the world proposals for collating the text of
                    the Hebrew Bible, for the purpose of correcting the original, and preparing for
                    a new translation, Mr Horne became very much alarmed. He apprehended that the
                    adoption of such a measure would overwhelm the sacred text with licentious
                    criticism; and on this ground he published, in 1760, A View of Mr Kennicot’s
                    method of correcting the Hebrew text, with three queries formed thereon, and
                    humbly submitted to the consideration of the learned and Christian world. But an
                    acquaintance which thus began in hostility was afterwards converted into genuine
                    friendship, which continued throughout the whole of life.</p>
                <p>In 1764, Mr Horne was created doctor in divinity, although not as yet advanced to
                    any conspicuous station. On the death of Dr Jenner, the president of Magdalen
                    College, in the beginning of 1768, Dr Horne was appointed to succeed him in a
                    post at once honourable and valuable; after which he exchanged a single for a
                    married life. Next year he published Considerations on the Life and Death of St
                    John the Baptist, being the substance of several sermons preached by. him before
                    the university. In 1771 he was chosen chaplain in ordinary to his majesty, which
                    he held for ten years. In 1772, when a number of clergymen had formed the
                    resolution of petitioning parliament for relief as to subscribing the liturgy
                    and thirty-nine articles, Dr Horne determined, if possible, to defeat their
                    object; and for this purpose he published Considerations on the projected
                    Reformation of the Church of England, in a letter to Lord North.</p>
                <p>He now set about finishing his greatest work, which had occupied his attention
                    for almost twenty years. This was his Commentary on the Book of Psalms, which
                    appeared in 1776, in two volumes quarto. It exhibits profound erudition and
                    fervent piety, and will be perused with pleasure and advantage by every judge of
                    merit. In the same year he was chosen vice-chancellor of the university, which
                    he held till the end of the year 1780. On the publication of Dr Adam Smith’s
                    letter, containing an account of the death of Mr David Hume, Dr Horne publicly
                    animadverted upon it, in A Letter to Adam Smith, LL.D, on the life, death, and
                    philosophy of his friend David Hume, Esq. by one of the people called
                    Christians. In 1779, Dr Horne published, in two volumes octavo, Discourses on
                    various subjects and occasions, which have procured the approbation of all
                    description of readers.</p>
                <p>As vice-chancellor of the university he became acquainted with Lord North, to
                    whose interest, joined with that of Lord Hawkesbury, he was in 1781 indebted for
                    the deanery of Canterbury. His time was now divided between that city and
                    Oxford; and the conscientious discharge of every part of his complex duty made
                    him universally beloved. In 1784 he published Letters on Infidelity, similar to
                    his reply to Dr Adam Smith. The books against which he levelled his ridicule
                    are, An Apology for the Life and Writings of David Hume, Esq.; Hume’s Dialogues
                    on Natural Religion; an Essay on Suicide by the same author, and a treatise
                    entitled Doubts of the Infidels. In the year 1790, when Dr Bagot was translated
                    to the see of St Asaph, Dr Horne was appointed to succeed him in the see of
                    Norwich. His last literary labours were, Observations on the case of the
                    Protestant Dissenters with reference to the Corporation and Test Acts, 1790; and
                    a Charge intended to have been delivered to the clergy of the diocese of
                    Norwich, at his first visitation, 1791. When he was raised to the episcopal
                    dignity, his health, always delicate, began rapidly to decline; but from the
                    waters of Bath he received great relief, and to this place he repaired a third
                    time in the harvest of 1791. On his way thither, however, he was seized with a
                    stroke of palsy, and after languishing for a few weeks, he died at Bath, on the
                    17th of January 1792, in the sixty-second year of his age.</p>
                <p>He was powerfully animated in his last moments by those hopes which spring from
                    the promises of the gospel, and the inexpressible satisfaction of a well-spent
                    life. ∏is erudition was extensive, his piety sincere, and his life
                    irreproachable. His charity, both of a public and private nature, was extensive;
                    and if not in debt at the end of the year, he felt perfectly satisfied. His
                    posthumous works are, Discourses on several Subjects and Occasions; a volume of
                    Sermons; and, Cautions to the Readers of Mr Law.</p>
