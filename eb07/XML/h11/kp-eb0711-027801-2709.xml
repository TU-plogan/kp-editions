                <p><label type="entry">HEROD</label>, surnamed the Great, was born about seventy-one
                    years before the commencement of the Christian era. When about twenty-five years
                    of age, his father Antipater made him governor of Galilee, where he
                    distinguished himself by suppressing a band of robbers, and executing their
                    ringleader. For this action, which was performed by his own authority, and
                    without trial of the criminals, he was ordered to appear before the Sanhedrim;
                    but, by the influence of his party, and the favour of the high priest, he
                    escaped judgment. During the civil war between the republican and Julian
                    parties, Herod joined Cassius, was made governor of Coelosyria, caused Malichus
                    to be assassinated for having poisoned his father, and ingratiated himself with
                    Marc Antony. After wandering for some time as an exile in Egypt, he found means
                    to arrive at Rome, where Antony received him with great kindness, and the senate
                    made choice of him for the crown of Judaea, about forty years before the birth
                    of Christ. It was at that time in the possession of Antigonus, and he had
                    consequently to fight his way to it. But he was finally victorious, Antigonus
                    was taken prisoner, and Herod succeeded to the regal dignity in the year
                    thirty-seven before Christ. In filling his empty coffers he was guilty of many
                    cruel extortions; yet it is but justice to add, that he performed many acts of
                    clemency. He sent for the aged high priest Hyrcan, who had been deposed, treated
                    him with the greatest kindness, and raised Aristobulus, the brother of his
                    beloved Mariamne, to the pontifical dignity. But soon afterwards, in a fit of
                    jealousy, he caused Aristobulus to be drowned in a bath. Being accused to Antony
                    by his mother-in-law, he appointed his uncle Joseph to govern in his absence,
                    charging him to put the queen to death if his trial should prove fatal to him,
                    as he could not support the idea of her falling into the possession of
                    another.</p>
                <p>Herod received a visit from Cleopatra, who is reported to have had amorous
                    inclinations towards him, which he prudently disappointed, from fear of the
                    vengeance of Antony; but he satisfied her avarice with the most ample donations.
                    When hostilities commenced between Antony and Octavius, he raised an army to
                    join the former; but had first to contend with Malchus, king of part of Arabia,
                    whom he defeated, and compelled to sue for peace. After the battle of Actium, he
                    resolved to make terms with the victor, and with this view he put the aged
                    Hyrcan to death, and embarked for Rhodes, where Augustus at that time was. He
                    appeared before the emperor in all the insignia of royalty except his diadem,
                    boldly relating all the services he had performed to his benefactor Antony, and
                    observed that he was willing to transfer the same gratitude to a new patron,
                    from whom he might hold his crown and kingdom.</p>
                <p>Augustus was struck with the magnanimity of this defence, and replaced the diadem
                    on his head. When Augustus passed through Syria in his way to Egypt, he was
                    magnificently entertained by Herod, to whom he restored the whole of his
                    dominions, which he even enlarged. Before his interview with Augustus, Herod had
                    given a second order respecting the murder of Mariamne; and becoming jealous of
                    Sohemus, her last guardian, he soon afterwards had her condemned and executed,
                    in spite of the most solemn protestations of innocence. But the remorse
                    occasioned by this barbarous murder was dreadful, and no scenes of riot or
                    debauchery could banish her from his mind. He would frequently call aloud upon
                    her name, and order his attendants to bring her into his presence, as if
                    unwilling to forget that she was no more. He built an amphitheatre at Jerusalem,
                    for the purpose of celebrating games in honour of Augustus; but this exasperated
                    the Jews to such a degree, that a conspiracy was formed against him, which
                    however was detected, and the principal contrivers punished with merciless
                    severity.</p>
                <p>He built several strong fortresses in different parts of Judaea for his own
                    security, one of which, in honour of the emperor, was denominated Caesarea. To
                    supply in some measure the loss of Mariamne, he married another lady of the same
                    name, tlie daughter of a priest, whom he raised to the supreme pontificate. He
                    was in such favour with Augustus, that he was appointed imperial procurator of
                    Syria, and obtained a tetrarchate for his brother. To conciliate the favour of
                    the Jews, he undertook the vast work of rebuilding the temple of Jerusalem; and,
                    by constantly employing a whole army of workmen for a year and a half, this
                    magnificent edifice was completed. In the course of another visit to the
                    emperor, Herod obtained new favours, particularly a grant of half the produce of
                    the mines of Cyprus, and the inspectorship of the rest. After this he dedicated
                    his new city of Caesarea, when he exhibited so much profuse magnificence, that
                    Augustus declared his soul was too large for his kingdom. He procured the
                    condemnation and death of his two sons by the first Mariamne, for which he has
                    been bitterly accused; but when we recollect that he took the greatest care of
                    the two sons whom each left behind him, we must conclude that there may have
                    been more reason for their punishment than some are willing to allow. The charge
                    brought against them was an unnatural conspiracy against his life and crown, and
                    it seems to have been fairly substantiated. His brother Pheroras, and his
                    favoured son Antipater, conspired against him; but soon after the discovery of
                    the plot the former died, and the latter went to Rome.</p>
                <p>The birth of Christ happened in the thirty-third year of his reign, and is said
                    to have been soon followed by that act of barbarous cruelty <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 7</hi>, the massacre of the children of Bethlehem,
                    instigated by jealousy of this king of the Jews in a spiritual sense, of whose
                    birth he had obtained information from the magi. It is to be observed that the
                    account of this deed is to be met with nowhere but in St Matthew’s gospel; for
                    whilst Josephus seems to dwell with studied minuteness on the cruelties of
                    Herod, he drops not a single hint respecting this massacre. As Antipater was
                    returning from Rome, he was arrested by his father’s orders, tried and condemned
                    for treasonable practices. These calamities, joined to a shattered constitution,
                    threw Herod into a loathsome distemper, accompanied with remarkable symptoms,
                    which has sometimes been considered as a judgment from heaven. He ordered the
                    sentence against Antipater to be put in execution, and appointed his son
                    Archelaus to succeed him on the throne. According to Josephus, he collected
                    together at Jericho the chief persons amongst the Jews, whom he ordered to be
                    shut up in the circus, giving strict orders to his sister Salome to have them
                    all massacred as soon as he had breathed his last. This order was never
                    executed, and we very much doubt whether it was ever given..</p>
                <p>His remains were interred with great pomp and magnificence; and although his
                    memory has been consigned to detestation and abhorrence, his great talents and
                    the glories <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> of his reign conspire to secure him a
                    distinguished place in the list of able but unscrupulous sovereigns.</p>
