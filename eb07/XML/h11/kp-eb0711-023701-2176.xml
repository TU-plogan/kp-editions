                <p><label type="entry">HENRYSON, <hi rend="smallcaps">Robert</hi></label>, one of
                    the most celebrated of the early Scotish poets, is described as chief
                    schoolmaster of Dunfermline, and this is almost the only particular of his life
                    that is sufficiently ascertained. According to one writer, he was a notary
                    public, as well as a schoolmaster; and another is inclined to identify him with
                    Henryson of Fordell, the father of James Henryson, who was king’s advocate and
                    justice clerk, and who perished in the fatal battle of Floddon. This very
                    dubious account seems to have originated with Sir Robert Douglas; who avers that
                    Robert Henryson appears to have been a person of distinction in the reign of
                    James the Third, and that he was the father of the king’s advocate. Douglas
                    refers to a certain charter, granted by the abbot of Dunfermline in 1478, where
                    Robert Henryson subscribes as a witness;<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Douglas’s Baronage of Scotland, p. 518.</p></note> but in
                    this charter he certainly appears without any particular distinction, as he
                    merely attests it in the character of a notary public. A later writer is still
                    more inaccurate when he pretends that the same witness is described as Robert
                    Henryson of Fordell:<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>Sibbald’s Chronicle of Scottish Poetry, vol. i. p. 88.</p></note> in this
                    and other two charters which occur in the chartulary of Dunfermline, he is
                    described as a notary public, without any other addition.<note anchored="true"

                    rend="italic">Magister,</hi> while the names of several other witnesses appear
                    without this title. He had perhaps taken the degree of master of
                    arts.</p></note> That the notary public, the schoolmaster of Dunfermline, and
                    the proprietor of Fordell, were one and the same individual, is by no means to
                    be admitted upon such slender and defective evidence. Henryson, or, according to
                    its more modern and less correct form, Henderson, was not at that period an
                    uncommon surname. It is not however improbable that the schoolmaster may have
                    exercised the profession of a notary. While the canon law prevailed in Scotland,
                    this profession was generally exercised by ecclesiastics, and some vestiges of
                    the ancient practice are still to be traced: every notary designates himself a
                    <hi rend="italic">clerk</hi> of a particular diocese; and by the act of 1584,
                    which under the penalty of deprivation prohibited the clergy from following the
                    profession of the law, they still retained the power of making testaments; so
                    that we continue to admit the rule of the canon law, which sustains a will
                    attested by the parish priest and two or three witnesses.<note anchored="true"

                    that he was also an ecclesiastic, and if he was an ecclesiastic, he could not
                    well leave any legitimate offspring. The poet, in one of his works, describes
                    himself as “ane man of age ;” and from Sir Francis Kinaston we learn that “being
                    very old he dyed of a diarrhea or fluxe.” With respect to the period of his
                    decease, it is at least certain that he died before Dunbar, <pb break="no"

                <p>The compositions of Henryson evince a poetical fancy, and, for the period when he
                    lived, an elegant simplicity of taste. He has carefully avoided that cumbrous
                    and vitiated diction which had begun to prevail among the Scotish as well as the
                    English poets. With his power of poetical conception he unites no inconsiderable
                    skill in versification: his lines, if divested of their uncouth orthography,
                    might often be mistaken for those of a much more modern poet. His principal work
                    is the collection of Fables, thirteen in number, which have been printed in
                    various forms. They are written in a pleasing manner, and are frequently
                    distinguished by their arch simplicity; but in compositions of this nature,
                    brevity is a quality which may be considered as almost indispensable, nor can it
                    be denied that those of Henryson sometimes extend to too great a length. The
                    collection is introduced by a prologue, and another is prefixed to the fable of
                    the lion and the mouse. The latter prologue exhibits a curious specimen of the
                    literature of that age. In a delightful morning of June, the poet wanders into a
                    wood, and reclines himself, in the midst of flowers, under the shade of a
                    hawthorn; where, having made the sign of the cross, he falls asleep, and fancies
                    himself to be accosted by a person of a goodly appearance. This venerable
                    stranger proves to be Aesop; who is here represented as a Roman and a poet, and
                    in whom it is not easy to recognise the reputed author of the fables written in
                    Greek prose. Mr Tyrwhitt, who was equally familiar with classical and with
                    Gothic literature, has remarked that in many passages quoted from Aesop by
                    writers of the middle ages, it is difficult to ascertain what author they
                    mean.</p>
                <p>Henryson’s Tale of the vponlands Mouse and the bur-gesse Mouse may be regarded as
                    one of his happiest efforts in this department. The same tale, which is borrowed
                    from Aesop, has been told tíy many other poets, ancient as well as modern.
                    Babrius has dispatched the story of the two mice in a few verses,<note

                    this fable of the Scotish poet, it does not, in the opinion of Dr Nott, seem
                    improbable that Sir Thomas Wyatt might have been indebted, if not for the idea
                    of his first satire, at least for the manner of telling the story.<note

                    Foxe is evidently borrowed from Chaucer’s Nonnes Preestes Tale. From these
                    apologues some curious fragments of information may be gleaned. That of the
                    Sheepe and the Dog contains all the particulars of an action before the
                    consistory court, and probably as complete an exposure of such transactions as
                    the author could prudently hazard. The proceedings of the ecclesiastical courts
                    seem about this period to have been felt as a common grievance; and they are
                    still more decidedly reprehended in the Satyre of Sir David Lindsay, whose works
                    furnish many valuable contributions to the history of manners and customs.</p>
                <p>Another conspicuous production of Henryson is the Testament of Cresseid,<note

                    says Sir Francis Kinaston, “called the Testament of Crescid, which may passe for

                    nation, that it was made and written by one Mr. Robert Henderson, sometime
                    cheife schoole-master in Dumfermling, much about the time that Chaucer was first
                    printed and dedicated to King Henry the 8th by Mr. Thinne, which was neere the
                    end of his raigne. This Mr. Henderson wittily observing that Chaucer in his 5th
                    booke had related the death of Troilus, but made no mention what became of
                    Crescid, he learnedly takes upon him, in a fine poeticall way, to exprès the
                    punishment and end due to a false unconstant whore, which commonly terminates in
                    extreme misery.” See the Loves of Troilus and Crescid, written by Chaucer; with
                    a Commentary by Sir Francis Kinastou, p. xxix. Lond. 179θ, 8vo. Kinaston had
                    translated into Latin rhyme two books of Chaucer’s poem, and had published them

                    his version of the poem, together with a commentary; and his manuscript at
                    length came into the possession of Mr Waldron, who announced his intention of
                    committing it to the press, but did not find encouragement to proceed beyond a
                    short specimen.</p></note> which is a sequel to Chaucer’s Troy-lus and Creseyde,

                    history, had been invested with all the characteristics of modern romance; nor
                    could the Scotish poet be expected to deviate from the models which delighted
                    his contemporaries. Sir Troilus is commended for his knightly piety; a temple is

                    The personages are ancient, but the institutions and manners are all modern.</p>
                <p>Henryson’s tale of Orpheus is not free from similar incongruities, and possesses
                    fewer attractions; it is indeed somewhat languid and feeble, and may have been a

                    Thrace, and is first dispatched to heaven in search of the lost Eurydice.</p>

                    His subsequent adventures are circumstantially, but not very poetically
                    detailed. In enumerating the various characters whom he finds in the domains of
                    Pluto, the poet is guilty of a glaring anachronism: here Orpheus finds Julius
                    Caesar, Nero, and even popes and cardinals; and it is likewise to be remarked
                    that the heathen and the Christian notions of hell are blended together. But
                    such anachronisms are very frequently to be found in the writers of the middle
                    ages. Mr Warton remarks that Chaucer has been guilty of a very diverting, and
                    what may be termed a double anachronism, by representing Creseyde and two of her
                    female companions as reading the Thebaid of Statius. Like the fables of
                    Henryson, his tale of Orpheus is followed by a long moral; and here he professes
                    to have derived his materials from Boethius and one of his commentators.</p>
                <p>The Bludy Serk is an allegorical poem of considerable ingenuity. The poet
                    represents the fair daughter of an ancient and worthy king as having been
                    carried away by a hideous giant, and cast into a dungeon, where she was doomed
                    to linger until some valiant knight should achieve her deliverance. A worthy
                    prince at length appeared as her champion, vanquished the giant, and thrust him
                    into his own loathsome dungeon. Having restored the damsel to her father, he
                    felt that he had received a mortal wound. He requested her to retain his bloody
                    shirt, and to contemplate it whenever a new lover should present himself. It is
                    unnecessary to add that the interpretation of this allegory involves the high
                    mysteries of the Christian faith. The poem bears an obvious resemblance to two
                    distinct tales which occur in the <hi rend="italic">Gesta Romanorum.</hi> In the
                    first of these, a noble lady having been cruelly oppressed by a tyrant, is
                    relieved by a valiant pilgrim, who falls in the moment of victory. According to
                    his injunctions, she places his staff and scrip in her chamber; but on being
                    addressed by three kings, in whom we are instructed to recognize the devil, the
                    world, and the flesh, she afterwards removes these memorials, and forgets her
                    obligations. The other tale represents the daughter of a king as having suffered
                    dishonour from a tyrannical duke. When reduced to poverty and wretchedness, she
                    is accosted at the wayside by a certain valiant knight, who, on condition of
                    obtaining her hand, undertakes to fight the oppressor, and to recover her
                    inheritance. A fierce combat ensues. Before he slays his antagonist, he receives
                    a mortal wound, which, after an interval of three days, terminates his life. She
                    hangs up his bloody armour in a chamber, and on being addressed by any new
                    suitor, she surveys this memorial of her deliverer, and declares her resolution
                    to form no new attachment.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                <p>The Abbay Walk is of a solemn character, and is not altogether incapable of
                    impressing the imagination. Its object is to inculcate submission to the various
                    dispensations of Providence, and this theme is managed with some degree of
                    skill. Of his poem entitled the Garment of Gude Ladyis, Lord Hailes has remarked
                    that “the comparison between female ornaments and female virtues, is extended
                    throughout so many lines, and with so much of a tire-woman’s detail, that it
                    becomes somewhat ridiculous.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    Makyne, the earliest specimen of pastoral poetry in the Scotish language. We
                    consider it as superior in many respects to the similar attempts of Spenser and
                    Browne: it is free from the glaring improprieties which sometimes appear in the
                    pastorals of those more recent writers, and it exhibits many genuine strokes of
                    poetical delineation. The shepherd’s indifference is indeed too suddenly
                    converted into love; but this is almost the only instance in which the
                    operations of nature are not faithfully represented. The story is skilfully
                    conducted, the sentiments and manners are truly pastoral, and the diction
                    possesses wonderful terseness and suavity.</p>
                <p>The Fables of Henryson have lately been reprinted<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Edinb. 1832, 4to. This edition was printed
                    for the Maitland Club.</p></note> from the edition of Andrew Hart; of which the
                    only copy known to exist was lately added to that great repository of Scotish
                    literature, the Advocates Library. It is a small octavo volume, which, although
                    in a very frail condition, cost no small price. This edition, printed in 1621,
                    is not however the first; and indeed the title-page indicates the work to be
                    “newlie reuised and corrected.” In the library of Sir Andrew Balfour, which was
                    sold by auction in 1695, there appears to have been a copy of an edition printed
                    at Edinburgh in 1570. And after a short interval the work was exhibited in an
                    English dress: “The fabulous Tales of Esope and Phrygian, compiled moste
                    eloquently in Scottishe metre, by Mr. Robert Henrison, and now lately
                    Englished.” London, printed by Richard Smith, 1577, 8vo. Of this edition there
                    is a copy in the library of Sion College. Among the Harleian manuscripts in the
                    British Museum are preserved “The morall Fai-billis of Esope, compylit be
                    Maister Robert Henrisoun, Scolmaister of Dunfermling, 1571.” This is apparently
                    the date of the transcript, which is conjectured to have been taken from tiie
                    edition of the preceding year. The manuscript, as Mr Pinkerton has stated, “is
                    well writen and preserved, and has some curious illuminations, tho poorly
                    done.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Pinkerton’s List
                    of the Scotish Poets, p. c.</p></note> Ten of the fables, together with several
                    other poems of the same author, are to be found in Bannatyne’s manuscript. The
                    various works of Henryson afford so excellent a specimen of the Scotish language
                    and versification, that a complete collection, printed with due accuracy and
                    accompanied with proper illustrations, could not fail to be highly acceptable to
                    the lovers of our early literature. (x.)</p>
