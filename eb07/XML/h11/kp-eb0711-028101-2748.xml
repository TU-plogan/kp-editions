                    significant corrections to the OCR text, predominantly in cases of confusing "c"
                    and "e." Isolates 90 entries that were mistakenly included at the end of prior
                    entries in v1 and v2. Normalizes ordinal numbers. Separates metadata in
                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra
                    space around the <gi>pb</gi> tag. Where a word is hyphenated at a <gi>pb</gi>,
                    the end fragment is now joined to the start fragment, making a machine-readable
                    word.</change>

                    rend="italic">Thomas,</hi> archbishop of Canterbury, memorable for his
                    attachment to civil and religious liberty, was the son of a clergyman, and born
                    in the year 1693. He received his grammar-school education at Wisbech, in the
                    isle of Ely; and at the age of seventeen was sent to Jesus College, Cambridge,
                    at which place he was made bachelor of arts in 1714, and had the degree of
                    master of arts conferred upon him about three years afterwards. In the year
                    1722, he was appointed chaplain to Dr Fleetwood, bishop of Ely, who gave him two
                    rectories; and in 1726 he was nominated preacher to the honourable society of
                    Lincoln’s Inn. He was chosen chaplain in ordinary to his . majesty about the
                    same period, and obtained from Cambridge the degree of doctor of divinity in the
                    year 1728. Bishop Fleetwood, his patron, declared to his friends that he never
                    heard a sermon from Dr Herring which he would not have been proud to be the
                    author of himself. In 1731, he was chosen rector of Blechingley in Surrey; the
                    same year he was appointed dean of Rochester; and in the year 1737 the king
                    promoted him to the see of Bangor. In 1743 he was elevated to the archiepiscopal
                    see of York; and it was peculiarly fortunate for the country at such a critical
                    juncture, that a man of his principles and public spirit was raised to so
                    exalted a rank. The rebellion in Scotland had been so artfully concealed by its
                    friends in England, that it was scarcely believed the Highlanders were in arms
                    until the royalists were defeated at the battle of Gladsmuir. Amidst the
                    universal consternation which this event occasioned, Archbishop Herring roused
                    the people to a sense of their danger, contributed to assuage the panic, and
                    encouraged them to unite with firmness and vigour in the defence of their
                    country.</p>
                <p>A meeting of the nobility, gentry, and clergy, was held at York, where the
                    archbishop addressed them in a very able and animated speech, requesting them to
                    unite as one man in averting the present danger, to preserve their happy
                    constitution, and to contribute by a subscription to raise troops for the
                    defence of the country. The whole assembly entered warmly into his views, and
                    immediately subscribed about L.40,000 for the important purpose recommended by
                    his grace. On the death of Archbishop Potter, which happened in 1747, Dr Herring
                    was translated to the see of Canterbury. In 1753 he was seized with a violent
                    fever, which brought him to the verge of the grave; and although he so far
                    recovered that he languished a few years, yet his strength and spirits were much
                    exhausted, and he expired in 1756, in the sixty-third year of his age. He was
                    buried, according to his own desire, without any pomp or parade, and no monument
                    was erected to his memory.</p>
