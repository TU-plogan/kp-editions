                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra

                    practical physician of great celebrity, was born in London in the year 1710. He
                    was sent at a very early age, near the end of 1724, to St John’s College,
                    Cambridge. He took his first degree in 1728, and obtained a fellowship about
                    1730; he became master of arts in 1732, and took his degree in physic in 1739.
                    He remained at Cambridge about ten years longer as a practitioner of physic, and
                    gave an annual course of lectures on the Materia Medica. In 1746 he became a
                    fellow of the Royal College of Physicians in London, and two years afterwards he
                    left Cambridge, having presented to St John’s College the specimens which had
                    been subservient to his lectures. He also added to this donation, a few years
                    afterwards, a collection of astronomical instruments of some value. Having
                    determined to establish himself in London, he was elected a fellow of the Royal
                    Society in 1769; and he was employed in a very extensive medical practice for
                    more than thirty years. When he became sensible that his age required some
                    indulgence, he resolved to pass his summers at a house which he had taken at
                    Windsor; but he continued his practice in the winter for some years longer. In
                    January 1760 he married Mary, daughter of W. Wollaston, Esq. by whom he had five
                    sons and three daughters; but he survived them all, except Dr W. Heberden, and
                    Mary, married to the Rev. G. Jenyns. In 1778 he was made an honorary member of
                    the Royal Society of Medicine at Paris.</p>
                <p>Dr Heberden’s first publication seems to have been a short essay on the
                    incongruous composition of the mithridate and theriac, entitled Antitheriaca,
                    8vo, 1745. 2. He sent to the Royal Society an Account of a very large Human
                    Calculus, weighing more than 2į pounds avoirdupois <hi rend="italic">(Phil.
                    Trans,</hi> xlvi. 1750, p. 596; <hi rend="italic">Abr.</hi> xi. p. 1005). 3.

                    >(Phil. Trans,</hi> liv. 1764, p. 198). Both these essays are erroneously
                    attributed, in Dr Maty’s index, to his brother, Dr Thomas Heberden of Madeira,
                    who sent several other papers to the society. Dr Heberden was one of the
                    principal contributors to the first three volumes of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Medical Transactions,</hi> published in a great measure at his suggestion, by
                    the College of Physicians, in which we find about sixteen of his original
                    communications. 4. Remarks on the Pump Water of London, 1768. 5. Observations on
                    Ascarides. 6. On Night Blindness, or Nyctalopia. 7. On the Chicken-Pox. 8. On
                    the Epidemical Cold of 1767. 9. Queries, relating to bark, camphor, cold, the
                    gout, and apoplexy. 10. On Hectic Fever. 11. On the Pulse. 12. On a Disorder of
                    the Breast, the <hi rend="italic">angina pectoris.</hi> 13. On Diseases of the
                    Liver. 14. On the Nettle Rash. 15. On Noxious Fungi. 16. Queries; on sizy blood,
                    on hernia, on damp clothes, on venesection in hemorrhages. 17. On an Angina

                    1778, p. 86.) 21. Commentarii de Morborum Historia et Curatione, London, 1802,
                    in 8vo; also in English. He had long been in the habit of making notes in a
                    pocket-book, at the bed-sides of his patients; and every month he used to select
                    and copy out, under the proper titles of the diseases, whatever he thought
                    particularly worthy to be recorded. In the year 1782 he employed himself in
                    digesting this register into the form of a volume of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Commentaries</hi> on the history and cure of diseases, religiously observing
                    never to depend on his memory for any material circumstance that he did not find
                    expressly written down in his notes. These commentaries were intrusted to the
                    care of his son, Dr W. Heberden, to be published after his death. We find in
                    them a greater mass of valuable matter, accurately observed and candidly
                    related, than in almost any other volume which has ever appeared upon a medical
                    subject; yet they are but too likely to chill the ingenuous ardour of many a
                    youthful mind, and even to lead to a total apathy with respect to the diligent
                    study of a profession in which so respectable a veteran was so often disposed to
                    exclaim, that “all is vanity.” There are indeed many instances in which he does
                    not seem to have been perfectly master of all the instruments of his art: thus,
                    he appears to have been but partially acquainted with the virtues and various
                    uses of antimony and ipecacuan, and to have reasoned very inaccurately on the
                    operation for a strangulated hernia. But it has been remarked, that the more
                    experience a physician acquires in his profession, the more he is in general
                    inclined to approach the opinions of Dr Heberden, and to esteem his
                    writings.</p>
                <p>Notwithstanding that he has been accused of having occasionally been liable to
                    personal and professional prejudices, it may safely be asserted, that he
                    possessed a singular combination of modesty and dignity of character. He was not
                    only a well-informed and accomplished scholar, but a man of the purest integrity
                    of conduct, of mild and courteous manners, distinguished by genuine piety, and
                    by unaffected benevolence of heart. It is related by one of his biographers,
                    that he bought a sceptical work, left in manuscript by Dr Conyers Middleton, of
                    his widow, for L.50, in order to burn it. He was at the expense of publishing
                    another work of the same author, on the servile condition of physicians amongst
                    the ancients, as well as an edition of some of the plays of Euripides, by
                    Markland. He had an opportunity of rendering an essential service to Dr
                    Letherland, a man of the deepest and most extensive learning and science that
                    adorned the last century, but of retired habits, and very little known even in
                    his own profession, though he contributed by his literary information to the
                    popularity of more than one of his colleagues. Dr Heberden’s extensive practice
                    made it inconvenient for him to accept the appointment of physician to the
                    queen; and the king, who had always shown him the greatest esteem and regard,
                    readily adopted his disinterested recommendation of Dr LetherIand as his
                    substitute in the situation. He died on the 17th of May 1801, at the age of
                    above ninety years, having exhibited at the close of his life the same serenity
                    of mind which· he had enjoyed throughout its course. <hi rend="italic"
