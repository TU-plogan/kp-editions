                <p><label type="entry">HADDINGTON</label>, a royal burgh of Scotland, and capital of
                    the county of the same name. It is situated on the left bank of the river Tyne,
                    on the great road between Edinburgh and London, about sixteen and a hall miles
                    from the former capital. Haddington is a place of considerable antiquity, but
                    the exact date of its origin is unknown. In records which belong to the twelfth
                    century, it comes into notice as a demesne of David I., who occupied it as his
                    burgh, with a church, a mill, and other apurtenants of a manor. Ada, the wife of
                    Henry, son and hen <pb break="no" facs="nls:193640421"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0711-0421-0102"/>of this monarch, came into possession of the town,
                    and was very attentive to its interests, founding here in 1178 a convent of
                    Cistertian nuns, which she endowed with the lands of Clerkington. Other lands,
                    and several churches, likewise belonged to the nuns of this place; but these
                    were of course confiscated at the reformation. There was also a monastery of
                    Franciscan or Grey Friars at Haddington. The choir of the church, which is now
                    in ruins, was anciently called the Lamp of Lothian <hi rend="italic"
                    >(^Lucerna</hi><hi rend="italic">LaudonicT)</hi><hi rend="italic subscript">
                    i</hi> because of its beautiful structure, and from its being kept constantly
                    lighted, and thus rendered visible by night at a considerable distance. Oh the
                    east of what is called the Nungate are the ruins of a chapel dedicated to St
                    Martin. After the death of Ada above mentioned, the town became the property of
                    her son William the Lion, whose son Alexander II. was born here. For some time
                    Haddington seems to have been exempt from the miseries of war; but in 1216 it
                    was burned by king John of England. In 1244, and again about two hundred years
                    ago, it suffered a similar fate; but these were accidental occurrences. By the
                    overflowings of the Tyne, it has likewise been repeatedly inundated. So late as
                    1775, the suburb of the Nungate was overwhelmed, and the whole town was
                    submerged beneath the waters of the river, which had risen to seventeen feet
                    above their ordinary level. Haddington was formerly surrounded by strong walls,
                    which were provided with gates and ports, and also fortified. It was taken
                    possession of by the English after the battle of Pinkie, arid in the year
                    following endured a siege by the Scotch, which makes some figure in history.
                    Little, however, now remains of the ancient defences of this place; and
                    although, as we have said, it was a royal residence, the only relics which
                    tradition points to as those of a palace or castle, are found at a short
                    distance from the western port of Haddington, within the walls, on the site of
                    which the county buildings or court-house was recently erected. The town at
                    present consists of a main or High Street, which stretches in a direction from
                    cast to west, and forms a portion of the road from London to Edinburgh. It is a
                    spacious and handsome street, and possesses some elegant buildings. Parallel to
                    it, on the north, runs the Back Street, having two cross streets at their
                    eastern extremity. The town-house is a respectable fabric, provided with a
                    handsome spire 150 feet in height. Connected with this edifice are the
                    departments used as a jail for the town and county. The town is connected with
                    the ancient suburb of Nungate, by a bridge of four arches thrown over the Tyne.
                    The old Franciscan church is a fine Gothic building, although partly
                    dilapidated. It is 210 feet in length, and is surmounted by a square tower
                    ninety feet in height, and of handsome architecture. Some years ago the chancel,
                    or west end of the cross, was repaired, and now forms a handsome parish church.
                    Haddington, being situated in the midst of a rich and populous agricultural
                    district, serves as the depot of inland trade, and by this means its prosperity
                    has been greatly advanced. The market, which is held on Friday, is a favourite
                    place of resort for the sale and purchase of grain by the East Lothian farmers,
                    and corn-dealers from different quarters. The town possesses no manufactories of
                    any importance, if we except a few tan-works; and there are two distilleries and
                    two breweries; but a number of extensive trades are also carried on. For
                    facilitating business, branches of two banking establishments are here settled.
                    As a royal burgh, the civic government of Haddington is vested in a provost, two
                    merchant-bailies, a trades-bailie, a dean of guild, a treasurer, and twelve
                    councillors. Since the passing of the burgh reform act, the deacons no longer
                    sit as councillors, the distinction between merchant and trades-councillors
                    having ceased to exist. The county courts of the sheriff are held here every
                    Thursday during session time, and a sheriff small debt court every alternate
                    Thursday. There is also a justice of peace court held at various times during
                    the year. Haddington is the seat of a presbytery; and, besides the parish
                    church, there are several chapels and meeting-houses, where dissenting bodies
                    assemble. There is here an excellent academy, under the patronage of the
                    magistrates, a parochial school, and several private educational establishments.
                    There is also a school of arts institution, connected with which is a library,
                    and a collection of philosophical apparatus. Besides a number of benefit and
                    friendly societies, there have been recently established in Haddington The
                    United Agricultural Society of East Lothian, and the East Lothian Horticultural
                    Society. The population of the burgh and parish of Haddington amounted in 1821
                    to 5255, and in 1831 to 5883.</p>
