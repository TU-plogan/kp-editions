                <p><label type="entry">HOUSE</label>, a habitation, or place built with conveniences
                    for dwelling in. See <hi rend="smallcaps">Architecture</hi> and <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Building.</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">Houses,</hi> amongst the
                    Jews, Greeks, and Romans, were flat-roofed, and had usually stairs on the
                    outside, by which they might ascend and descend without coming into the house.
                    Each house, in fact, was so laid out that it enclosed a quadrangular area or
                    court. This court was exposed to the weather, and being open to the sky, gave
                    light to the house. This was the place where company was received, and for that
                    purpose it was strewed with mats or carpets for their better accommodation. It
                    was paved with marble or other materials, according to the owner’s ability, and
                    provided with an umbrella of vellum to shelter them from the heat and inclemency
                    of the weather. This part of their houses, called by the Romans <hi
                    rend="italic">impluvium,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">cava tedium,</hi> was
                    provided with channels to carry off the water into the common sewers. The top of
                    the house was level, and covered with a strong plaster by way of terrace.
                    Hither, especially amongst the Jews, it was customary to retire for meditation,
                    private conversation, devotion, or the enjoyment of the evening breezes.</p>
                <p>The Grecian houses were usually divided into two parts, in which the men and
                    women had distinct mansions assigned. The part assigned to the men was towards
                    the gate, and called αy¾ωwr∕f; the apartment of the women was the farthest part
                    of the house, and called yu<hi rend="italic">m</hi>/xawr/¢. Jews, Greeks, and
                    Romans supposed their houses to be polluted by dead bodies, and to stand in need
                    of purification.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">House,</hi> in <hi rend="italic">Astrology,</hi> denotes the
                    twelfth part of the heavens. The division of the heavens into houses is founded
                    upon the pretended influence of the stars, when meeting in them, upon all
                    sublunary bodies. These influences are supposed to be good or bad; and to each
                    of these houses particular virtues are assigned, on which astrologers prepare
                    and form a judgment of their horoscopes. The horizon and meridian are two
                    circles of the celestial houses, which divide the heavens into four equal parts,
                    each containing three houses, six of which are above the horizon, and six below
                    it; of these, six are called <hi rend="italic">eastern</hi> and six <hi
                    rend="italic">western houses.</hi></p>
                <p>A scheme or figure of the heavens is composed of twelve triangles, all called <hi
                    rend="italic">houses,</hi> in which are marked the stars, signs, and planets, so
                    included in each of these circles. Every planet has likewise two particular
                    houses, in which it is pretended that they exert their influence in the
                    strongest manner; but the sun and moon have only one, the house of the former
                    being Leo, and that of the latter Cancer.</p>
                <p>The houses in astrology have also names given them according to their qualities.
                    The first is the house of life, which is the ascendant, extending five degrees
                    above the horizon, and the rest below it. The second is the house of riches; the
                    third, the house of brothers; the fourth, in the lowest part of the heavens, is
                    the house of relations, and the angle of the earth; the fifth, the house of
                    children; the sixth, the house of health; the seventh, the house of marriage,
                    and the angle of the west; the eighth, the house of death; the ninth, the house
                    of piety; the tenth, the house of offices; the eleventh, the house of friends;
                    and the twelfth, the house of enemies.</p>
