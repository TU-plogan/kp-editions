                    significant corrections to the OCR text, predominantly in cases of confusing "c"

                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra
                    space around the <gi>pb</gi> tag. Where a word is hyphenated at a <gi>pb</gi>,

                <p><label type="entry">HELIASTAE</label>, in <hi rend="italic">Antiquity,</hi> the
                    judges of the court of <hi rend="italic">Helioea.</hi> They were so called,
                    according to some authors, from a Greek word which signifies <hi rend="italic"
                    >to assemble in a great number</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> but, according to
                    others, from another word which signifies <hi rend="italic">the sun,</hi>
                    because they held their assemblies <hi rend="italic">sub dio.</hi> They composed
                    not only the most numerous, but likewise the most important of the Athenian
                    tribunals; for their province was either to explain obscure laws, or to give new
                    vigour and authority to those which had been violated. The Thesmothetae convoked
                    the assembly of the Heliastae, which sometimes amounted to a thousand, sometimes
                    to fifteen hundred, judges. Mr Blanchard is of opinion, that, to make up this
                    number, the Thesmothetae sometimes summoned those of each tribe who had last
                    quitted the public offices they had exercised in another court. But, however
                    this may be, it appears that the assemblies of the Heliastae were not frequent,
                    as they would have interrupted the jurisdiction of the stated tribunals and the
                    common course of affairs.</p>
                <p>The Thesmothetae paid to each member of this assembly, for his attendance, three
                    oboli, which are equal to two Roman sesterces, or to half a drachma. Hence
                    Aristophanes terms them “the brothers of the triobolus.” They were likewise
                    condemned to pay a fine if they came too late; and if they did not present
                    themselves till after the orators had begun to speak, they were not admitted.
                    Their attendance was requited out of the public treasury, and their pay was
                    called <hi rend="italic">misthos heliastico.</hi></p>
                <p>The assembly met, at first, according to Aristophanes, at the rising of the sun.
                    If the judges were obliged to meet under cover on account of frost and snow,
                    they had <pb break="no" facs="nls:193641851" xml:id="kp-eb0711-1851-0212"/>a
                    fire; but there is not a passage in any ancient author which informs us of the
                    place where these assemblies were held either in the rigorous or in the mild
                    season. We only learn that there was a double enclosure around the assembly,
                    that it might not be disturbed. The first was a kind of arbour-work, from space
                    to space, separated by doors, over which were painted in red the ten or twelve
                    first letters of the,Greek alphabet, which directed the entrance of the officers
                    who composed the tribunal, each of them entering under the letter which
                    distinguished his tribe. The beadles of the court, to whom they showed the wand
                    which had been sent them by the Thesmothetae as a summons to meet, examined its
                    mark to see if it was authentic, and then introduced them. The second enclosure,
                    which was at the distance of twenty feet from the former, was a rope or cord,
                    that the people who stood round the first enclosure, and were desirous to see
                    what passed within the second, might not be prevented from gratifying their
                    curiosity at a proper distance. Thus the attention of the judges was not
                    interrupted by the concourse of the multitude, many of whom were heated by views
                    of interest or of party.</p>
                <p>To each of the members of the assembly were distributed two pieces of copper; one
                    of which was perforated, not certainly that it might be distinguished from the
                    other by feeling, for these assemblies met at the rising and were dissolved at
                    the setting of the sun. Those pieces of copper had been substituted for little
                    sea-shells, which were at first in use. The Thesmothetae read the names of those
                    who were to compose the assembly, and each man took his place as he was called.
                    The Thesmothetae were then sent for, whose function it was to observe prodigies
                    and to superintend the sacrifices; and if they gave their sanction, the
                    deliberations were begun. It is well known that the officers called <hi
                    rend="italic">Exegetoe</hi> were often corrupted by those who were interested in
                    the debates of the assembly, and that they excited tumults such as were raised
                    by the Roman tribunes in the popular assemblies convoked by the consuls.</p>
                <p>Of all the monuments which remain relating to the Heliastae, the most curious is
                    the oath which those judges took before the Thesmothetae. Demosthenes has
                    preserved it in his oration against Timocrates, who having been bribed by those
                    who had been intrusted with the effects taken on board a vessel of Naucratis,
                    and refused to give an account of them, got a law passed, by which an
                    enlargement was granted to prisoners for public debts on giving bail.
                    Demosthenes, on making his oration against that law, ordered the oath of the
                    Heliastae to be read aloud, as a perpetual auxiliary to his arguments, and
                    happily calculated to interest the multitude and inflame their passions. This
                    oath was in these terms: “I will judge according to the laws an*d decrees of the
                    people of Athens, and of the senate of five hundred. I will never give my vote
                    for the establishment of a tyrant, or of an oligarchy; nor will I ever give my
                    approbation to an opinion prejudicial to the liberty or to the union of the
                    people of Athens. I will not second those persons who may propose a reduction of
                    private debts, or a distribution of the lands or houses of the Athenians. I will
                    not recall exiles, or endeavour to procure a pardon for those who shall be
                    condemned to die. Nor will 1 force those to retire whom the laws and the
                    suffrages of the people shall permit to remain in their country. I will not give
                    my vote to any candidate for a public function, who gives not an account of his
                    conduct in the office which he has previously filled; nor will I presume to
                    solicit any trust from the commonwealth without subjecting myself to this
                    condition, which 1 mean as obligatory to the nine archons, to the chief of
                    religious matters, to those who are balloted on the same day with the nine
                    archons, to the herald, the ambassador, and the other officers of their court. I
                    will not suffer the same man to hold the same office twice, or to hold two
                    offices in the same year. I will not accept any present, either myself or by
                    another, either directly or indirectly, as a member of the Heliastic assembly. I
                    solemnly declare that I am thirty years old. I will be equally attentive and
                    impartial to the accuser and the accused; I will give my sentence rigorously,
                    according to evidence. Thus I swear, by Jupiter, by Neptune, and by Ceres, to
                    act. And if I violate any of my engagements, I imprecate from these deities ruin
                    on myself and my family; and I request them to grant me every kind of prosperity
                    if I am faithful to my oath.”</p>
                <p>Here we have one of the motives of the meeting of this assembly stated. Aristotle
                    informs us of another, which was by the public authority deputed to them,
                    namely, to elect a magistrate in the room of one deceased. It is surprising that
                    Pausanias, who enters so often into details, gives us no particular account of
                    this assembly. All that he says of it is, that the most numerous of the Athenian
                    assemblies was called <hi rend="italic">Helice.</hi></p>
                <p>We are informed by Diogenes Laertius, in his life of Solon, that it was before
                    one of these Heliastic assemblies that Pisistratus presented himself, covered
                    with wounds and contusions self-inflicted, to excite the indignation of the
                    people against his pretended enemies, who, jealous, as he alleged, of the
                    popularity he had acquired by asserting the rights of his poorer
                    fellow-citizens, in opposition to the men in power, had attacked him whilst he
                    was hunting, and had wounded him in that barbarous manner. His design succeeded,
                    and a guard was appointed him, by the assistance of which he acquired the
                    sovereignty or tyranny of Athens, and kept it during thirty-three years. The
                    power of the assembly appeared remarkably on that occasion; for Solon, who was
                    present, opposed it with all his efforts, but did not succeed.</p>
                <p>As to the manner in which the judges gave their suffrages, there was a sort of
                    vessel covered with an osier mat, in which there were placed two urns, the one
                    of copper, the other of wood. In the lid of these urns there was an oblong hole,
                    which was large at the top, and became narrower downwards, as we see in some old
                    boxes of our churches. The suffrages which condemned the accused person were
                    thrown into the wooden urn, which was termed <hi rend="italic">hyrios,</hi>
                    whilst that of copper, named <hi rend="italic">ahyros,</hi> received those which
                    absolved him.</p>
                <p>Aristotle observes, that Solon, whose aim was to make his people happy, and who
                    found an aristocracy established by the election of the nine archons, annual
                    officers, whose power was almost absolute, tempered their sovereignty, by
                    instituting the privilege of appealing from <hi rend="italic">them</hi> to the
                    people, who were to be assembled by lot to give their suffrage, after having
                    taken the oath of the Heliastae, in a place near the Panathenaeum, where Hissus
                    had in former days calmed a sedition of the people, and bound them to unanimity
                    by an oath. It has likewise been remarked, that Apollo was not invoked in the
                    oath of the Heliastae, as in the oaths of the other judges. We have observed,
                    that he who took the oath of the Heliastae engaged that he would not be
                    corrupted by solicitation or money. Those who violated this part of their oath
                    were condemned to pay a severe fine. The decemvirs at Rome made such corruption
                    a capital crime. But Asconius remarks, that the punishment denounced against
                    them was mitigated in later times; and that they were expelled the senate, or
                    banished for a certain time, according to the degree of their guilt.</p>
