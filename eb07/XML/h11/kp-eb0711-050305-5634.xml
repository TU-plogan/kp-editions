                <p><label type="entry">HOGARTH, <hi rend="smallcaps">William</hi></label>, an
                    artist, a truly great and original genius, was born in 1697 or 1698, in the
                    parish of St Martin, Ludgate. The outset of his life, however, was unpromising.
                    “He was bound,” says Lord Orford, “to a mean engraver of arms on plate.” Hogarth
                    probably chose this occupation as it required some skill in drawing, to which
                    his genius was particularly turned, and which he contrived assiduously to
                    cultivate. His master was Mr Ellis Gamble, a silversmith of eminence, who
                    resided in Cranburn Street, Leicester Fields. In this profession it is not
                    unusual to bind apprentices to the single branch of engraving arms and ciphers
                    on every species of metal; and in that particular department of the business
                    young Hogarth was placed; but, before his time had expired, he felt the impulse
                    of genius, and it directed him to painting. During his apprenticeship, he set
                    out one Sunday, with two or three companions, on an excursion to Highgate. The
                    weather being hot, they went into a public house, where they had not been long
                    before a quarrel arose between some persons in the same room, and one of the
                    disputants having struck the other on the head with a quart pot, cut him very
                    much. The blood running down the man’s face, together with the agony of the
                    wound, which distorted his features into a most hideous grin, presented Hogarth,
                    who showed himself thus early sensible of the course which Nature had intended
                    he should pursue, with too laughable a subject to be overlooked. He drew out his
                    pencil, and produced on the spot one of the most ludicrous figures that ever was
                    seen. What rendered this piece the more valuable was, that it exhibited an exact
                    likeness of the man, with the portrait of his antagonist, and the figures in
                    caricature of the principal persons collected around him.</p>
                <p>How long he continued in obscurity has not been ascertained; but the first piece
                    in which he distinguished himself as a painter is supposed to have been a
                    representation of Wanstead Assembly. The figures contained in it were, it seems,
                    drawn from the life, and without any circumstances of burlesque. The faces were
                    said to be extremely like, and the colouring rather better than in some of his
                    later and more highly finished performances. From the date of the earliest plate
                    that can be ascertained as his work, it may be presumed that he began business
                    on his own account at least as early as 1720.</p>
                <p>His first employment seems to have been the engraving of arms and shop-bills; his
                    next, to design and furnish plates for booksellers. Mr Bowles, at the Black
                    Horse in Cornhill, was one of his earliest patrons, but the prices paid by that
                    person were very low. His next friend in this line was Mr Philip Overton, who
                    paid him somewhat better for his labour and ingenuity.</p>
                <p>There are still existing many family pictures by Hogarth, in the style of serious
                    conversation-pieces. What the prices of his portraits were, Mr Nichols tried in
                    vain to discover; but he suspects that they were originally very low, as the
                    people who are best acquainted with them choose to be silent on that
                    subject.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:193645647" xml:id="kp-eb0711-5647-0504"/>
                <p>Lord Orford has remarked, that if óur artist indulged his spirit of ridicule in
                    personalities, it seldom proceeded beyond sketches and drawings; and wonders
                    that he never, without intention, delivered the very features of any identical
                    person. But Mr Nichols assures us, from unquestionable authority, that almost
                    all the personages who attended the levee of the Rake were undoubted portraits;
                    and that in Southwark Fair, and the Modern Midnight Conversation, as many more
                    were discoverable. Whilst Hogarth was painting the Rake’s Progress, he had a
                    summer residence at Isleworth; and he never failed to question the company who
                    came to see these pictures, if they knew for whom one or another figure was
                    designed. When they guessed wrong, he set them right.</p>
                <p>The Duke of Leeds possessed an original scene in the Beggar’s Opera, painted by
                    Hogarth. It is that in which Lucy and Polly are on their knees before their
                    respective fathers, to intercede for the life of the hero of the piece. All the
                    figures are either known or supposed to be portraits. Lord Orford had a picture
                    of a scene in the same piece, where Macheath is going to execution. In this also
                    the likenesses of Walker, and Miss Fenton, afterwards Duchess of Bolton, the
                    first and original Macheath and Polly, were preserved.</p>
                <p>In 1730 Mr Hogarth married the only daughter of Sir James Thornhill, by whom,
                    however, he had no children. This union, indeed, was a stolen one, and
                    consequently without the approbation of Sir James, who, considering the youth of
                    his daughter, then scarcely eighteen, and the slender finances of her husband,
                    as yet an obscure artist, was not easily reconciled to the match. Soon after
                    this period, however, he began his Harlot’s Progress; and was advised by Lady
                    Thornhill to have some of the scenes of it placed in the way of his
                    father-in-law. Accordingly, one morning early, Mrs Hogarth undertook to convey
                    several of them into her father’s dining-room. When he arose, he inquired whence
                    they had come; and being told by whom they were introduced, he cried out, “Very
                    well; the man who can furnish representations like these can also maintain a
                    wife without a portion.” He designed this remark as an excuse for keeping his
                    purse-strings close; but soon afterwards he became both reconciled and generous
                    to the young people.</p>
                <p>In 1732 Hogarth ventured to attack Mr Pope, in a plate called the Man of Taste,
                    containing a view of the Gate of Burlington House, with Pope whitewashing it,
                    and bespattering the Duke of Chandos’s coach. This plate was intended as a
                    satire on the translator of Homer, Mr Kent the architect, and the Earl of
                    Burlington. It was fortunate for Hogarth that he escaped the sting of the “wasp
                    of Twickenham.” Either Hogarth’s obscurity at that time was his protection, or
                    the poet was too prudent to exasperate a painter who had already given such
                    proof of his abilities for satire.</p>
                <p>In 1733 his genius became conspicuously known. The third scene of his Harlot’s
                    Progress introduced him to the notice of the great. At a meeting of the treasury
                    board, which was held a day or two after the appearance of that print, a copy of
                    it was shown by one of the lords, as containing, amongst other excellencies, a
                    striking likeness of Sir John Gonson. It gave universal satisfaction, brom the
                    treasury each lord repaired to the print-shop for a copy of it, and Hogarth
                    immediately rose into fame.</p>
                <p>The Abbé Dubos has complained that no historical painter of his time went through
                    a series of actions, and thus, like an historian, painted the successive
                    fortunes of a hero from the cradle to the grave. What Dubos wished to see done,
                    Hogarth performed. He launched out his young adventurer a simple girl upon the
                    town, and conducted her through all the vicissitudes of wretchedness to a
                    premature death. This was painting to the understanding and to the heart; none
                    had ever before made the pencil subservient to the purposes of morality and
                    instruction. A book like this is fitted to every soil and to every observer; he
                    that runs may read it. Nor was the success of Hogarth confined to his persons.
                    One of his excellencies consisted in what may be termed the furniture of his
                    pieces. As, in sublime and historical representations, the fewer trivial
                    circumstances are permitted to divide the spectator’s attention from the
                    principal figures, the greater is their force, so, in scenes copied from
                    familiar life, a proper variety of little domestic images contributes to throw
                    an air of verisimilitude over the whole. “The Rake’s levee-room,” says Lord
                    Orford, “the nobleman’s dining-room, the apartments of the husband and wife in
                    Marriage-à-la-Mode, the aiderman’s parlour, the bedchamber, and many others, are
                    the history of the manners of the age.”</p>
                <p>In 1745 Hogarth sold about twenty of his capital pictures by auction; and in the
                    same year he acquired additional reputation by the six prints of
                    Marriage-à-la-Mode, which may be regarded as the groundwork of a novel called
                    the Marriage Act, by Dr Shebbeare, and also of the Clandestine Marriage. The
                    prints, however, possess far more of the true spirit of comedy than either the
                    novel or the play; they are amongst the most masterly productions of this great
                    dramatic painter of life and manners.</p>
                <p>Soon after the peace of Aix-la-Chapelle he went over to France, and was taken
                    into custody at Calais whilst he was drawing the gate of that town; a
                    circumstance which he has recorded in his picture entitled 0 the Roast Beef of
                    Old England, published in 1749.</p>
                <p>In 1753 he appeared to the world in the character of an author, and published a
                    quarto volume, entitled Analysis of Beauty, written with a view of fixing the
                    fluctuating ideas of taste. In this performance he shows, by a variety of
                    examples, that a curve is the line of beauty, and that round swelling figures
                    are most pleasing to the eye; and the truth of his opinion has been countenanced
                    by subsequent writers on the subject. In this work he acknowledges himself
                    indebted for assistance to his friends, particularly to one gentleman for his
                    corrections and amendments of at least a third part of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >wording.</hi> This friend was Dr Benjamin Hoadly, the physician, who carried on
                    the work to about the third part, and then, through indisnosition, declined with
                    regret the friendly office. The kind office of finishing the work, and
                    superintending the publication, was assumed by Dr Morell, who superintended the
                    remainder of the book. The preface was in like manner corrected by the Reverend
                    Mr Townley. The family of Hogarth rejoiced when the last sheet of the Analysis
                    was printed off, as the frequent disputes he had with his coadjutors, in the
                    progress of the work, did not much harmonize his disposition. This work was
                    translated into German by Mr Mylius, under the author’s inspection; and the
                    translation was printed in London. A new and correct edition was in 1754
                    proposed for publication at Berlin by Vok, with an explanation of Mr Hogarth’s
                    satirical prints, translated from the French; and an Italian translation was
                    published at Leghorn in the year 1761.</p>
                <p>This work may be considered as in many respects remarkable, emanating as it did
                    from one who was totally illiterate, and who, in all probability, had never
                    before attempted to throw together his ideas upon any subject of importance. But
                    although his general principle is right, considered merely as expressing a <hi
                    rend="italic">fact,</hi> and al though the feeling or sentiment which we call
                    beauty is generally excited in the mind by objects bounded by curve lines, yet
                    neither Hogarth himself, nor any of those persons who assisted him in the
                    composition of his work, ever perceived that external objects are beautiful or
                    the reverse, <pb break="no" facs="nls:193645660" xml:id="kp-eb0711-5660-0505"
                    />not because they possess this or that form, but in proportion as they are
                    associated with, or regarded as the natural signs and emblems of, ideas or
                    emotions which we denominate beautiful or otherwise; that the curve, considered
                    <hi rend="italic">per set</hi> is not more beautiful than the angular line;
                    that, in applying this epithet to the former, we do so, not because it is a
                    curve, but because it suggests to the percipient mind the idea of easy, gentle,
                    flowing motion, or some other that is calculated to excite in it the feeling
                    which we denominate beauty; that the sentiment of beauty is a reflected image of
                    some pleasing emotion, softened and subdued by the awakened reminiscence; that
                    the whole, therefore, resolves into the great law of association, by means of
                    which one thing becomes the occasion of resuscitating another in the mind; and
                    that external objects or external forms are not of themselves beautiful or
                    deformed, but are so called only in proportion as they are the natural signs of,
                    and serve to recall, emotions of a pleasing character, or the contrary. But this
                    was a discovery reserved for other and more philosophical inquirers.</p>
                <p>Hogarth affected to despise every kind of knowledge which he did not possess.
                    Having established his fame with little or no obligation to literature, he
                    either conceived it to be useless, or decried it because it lay altogether out
                    of his reach. Till he commenced author, and was obliged to employ the friends
                    already mentioned to correct his Analysis of Beauty, he did not seem to have
                    discovered that even spelling was a necessary qualification in a writer.
                    Previously to the time of which we are now speaking, one of his common topics of
                    declamation was the uselessness of books to a man of his profession. In Beer
                    Street, amongst other volumes consigned by him to the pastry-cook, we find
                    Turnbull on Ancient Painting; a treatise which Hogarth should have been able to
                    understand before he ventured to condemn it.</p>
                <p>About 1757, his brother-in-law, Mr Thornhill, resigned the place of king’s ser;
                    cant-pain ter in his favour.</p>
                <p>The last remarkable circumstance of his life was his contest with Churchill. It
                    is said that both met at Westminster Hall; Hogarth to take by his eye a
                    ridiculous likeness of the poet, and Churchill to furnish a description of the
                    painter. But Hogarth’s print of the poet was not much esteemed, and the poet’s
                    letter to him was but little admired. When genius is forced to minister to the
                    gratification of the baser passions, its efforts are seldom successful.</p>
                <p>It may be truly observed of Hogarth, that all his powers of delighting were
                    limited to his pencil. Having rarely been admitted into polite circles, none of
                    his sharp corners had been rubbed off, and he continued to the last a rough,
                    uncultivated man. The slightest contradiction transported him into rage. To some
                    confidence in himself he was certainly entitled, for, as a comic painter, he
                    could have claimed no honour that would not most readily have been allowed him;
                    but he was at once unprincipled and variable in his political conduct and
                    private attachments. He is also said to have beheld the rising eminence and
                    popularity of Sir Joshua Reynolds with envy, and he frequently spoke with
                    asperity both of the painter and his performances. Justice, however, obliges us
                    to add, that he was liberal and hospitable; and that, in spite of the emoluments
                    which his works had procured to him, he left but an inconsiderable fortune.</p>
                <p>Of Hogarth’s lesser plates many were destroyed. When he wanted, on a sudden, a
                    piece of copper, he would take any from which he had already worked off such a
                    number of impressions as he supposed he would sell. He then sent it to be
                    effaced, beaten out, or otherwise altered to his present purpose. The plates
                    which remained in his possession were secured to his widow by <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 7</hi> his will, dated the 12th of August 1764, chargeable
                    with an annuity of eighty pounds to his sister. He died in the month of October
                    of that year.</p>
                <p>The character of Hogarth as an artist is delineated by Mr Gilpin in his <hi
                    rend="italic">Essay on Prints.</hi> “The works of this master,” says Mr Gilpin,
                    “abound in true humour, and satire which is generally well directed; they are
                    admirable moral lessons, and a fund of entertainment suited to every taste; a
                    circumstance which shows them to be just copies of nature. We may consider them
                    too as valuable repositories of the manners, customs, and dresses of his
                    age.</p>
                <p>“In design Hogarth was seldom at a loss. His invention was fertile, and his
                    judgment accurate. An improper accident is rarely introduced, a proper one
                    rarely omitted. No one could tell a story better, or make it, in all its
                    circumstances, more intelligible. His genius, however, it must be owned, was
                    suited only to low or familiar subjects; it never soared above common life; to
                    subjects naturally sublime, or which from antiquity or other accidents borrowed
                    dignity, he could not rise. In composition we see little in him to admire. In
                    many of his prints the deficiency is so great as plainly to imply a want of all
                    principle, which makes us ready to believe, that when we do meet with a
                    beautiful group, it is the effect of chance. In one of his minor works, the Idle
                    Prentice, we seldom see a crowd more beautifully managed than in the last print.
                    If the sheriff-officers had not been placed in a line, and had been brought a
                    little lower in the picture, so as to have formed a pyramid with the cart, the
                    composition had been unexceptionable; and yet the first print of this work is
                    such a striking instance of disagreeable composition, that it is amazing how an
                    artist who had any idea of beautiful forms could suffer so unmasterly a
                    performance to leave his hands. Of the distribution of light Hogarth had as
                    little knowledge as of composition. In some of his pieces we see a good effect,
                    as in the Execution just mentioned; in which, if the figures at the right and
                    left corners had been kept down a little, the light would have been beautifully
                    distributed on the fore-ground, and a fine secondary light spread over part of
                    the crowd. But at the same time there is so obvious a deficiency in point of
                    effect in most of his prints, that it is very evident he had no principles.
                    Neither was Hogarth a master in drawing. Of the muscles and anatomy of the head
                    and hands he had perfect knowledge, but his trunks are often badly moulded, and
                    his limbs ill set on; yet his figures, upon the whole, are inspired with so much
                    life and meaning, that the eye is kept in good humour in spite of its
                    inclination to find fault. The author of the Analysis of Beauty, it might be
                    supposed, would have given us more instances of grace than we find in the works
                    of Hogarth; which shows strongly that theory and practice are not always united.
                    Many opportunities his subjects naturally afford of introducing graceful
                    attitudes, and yet we have very few examples of them. With instances of
                    picturesque grace his works abound. Of this expression, in which the force of
                    his genius lay, we cannot speak in terms too high. In every mode of it he was
                    truly excellent. The passions he thoroughly understood, and all the effects
                    which they produce in every part of the human frame. He had the happy art also
                    of conveying his ideas with the same precision with which he conceived them. He
                    was excellent too in expressing any humorous oddity which we often see stamped
                    upon the human face. All his heads are cast in the very mould of nature. Hence
                    that endless variety which is displayed throughout his works; and hence it is
                    that the difference arises between <hi rend="italic">his</hi> heads and the
                    affected caricatures of those masters who have sometimes amused themselves with
                    patching together an assemblage of features from their own ideas. Such are
                    Spaniolet’s, which, though admirably executed, appear plainly to have <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193645673" xml:id="kp-eb0711-5673-0506"/> no archetypes in
                    nature. Hogarth’s, on the other hand, are collections of natural curiosities.
                    The Oxford Heads, the Physicians’ Arms, and some of his other pieces, are
                    expressly of this humorous kind. They are truly comic, though ill-natured
                    effusions of mirth; more entertaining than Spaniolet’s, as they are pure nature,
                    but less innocent, as they contain ill-directed ridicule. But the species of
                    expression in which this master perhaps most excels, is that happy art of
                    catching those peculiarities of art and gesture which the ridiculous part of
                    every profession contract, and which for that reason become characteristic of
                    the whole. His counsellors, his undertakers, his lawyers, his usurers, are all
                    conspicuous at sight. In a word, almost every profession may see in his works
                    that particular species of affectation which they should most endeavour to
                    avoid. The execution of this master is well suited to his subjects and manner of
                    treating them. He etches with great spirit, and never gives one unnecessary
                    stroke.”</p>
