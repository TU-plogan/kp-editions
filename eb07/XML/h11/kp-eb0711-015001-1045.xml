                <p><label type="entry">HARMONY</label>, according to the modern definition of the
                    word, is a succession of chords, written according to the laws of fundamental
                    progression and modulation. Harmony is a generic term when it signifies the
                    doctrine of chords; but we also make use of the expression to indicate the
                    effect of a combination of sounds on the ear.</p>
                <p>The history of harmony forms an interesting branch of musical knowledge. In
                    tracing its progress, we observe an almost uninterrupted succession of
                    discoveries in the aggregate properties of sounds. These discoveries are
                    referrible to the early felt and increasing desire to create novelty of effect;
                    to the boldness of human skill and invention, to the improvement of instrumental
                    music, and, without doubt, also to the results of chance. The history of the
                    theory is necessarily dependent upon that of the practice of harmony; for, in
                    proportion as composers have attempted new combinations, it becomes more
                    difficult to trace their origin and reduce them to a general system. The
                    innumerable modifications which chords undergo so essentially change their
                    primitive forms, that we can scarcely wonder at the multiplicity of errors which
                    have been committed in endeavouring to classify them.</p>
                <p>We could almost persuade ourselves that harmony, from its being so natural to
                    man, must have been universally understood in all ages. We learn, however, that
                    the ancients had scarcely any idea of it; and even now the oriental nations are
                    ignorant of harmonic relations, and our music affects them with disagreeable
                    sensations. The knowledge which the Greeks and Romans had of harmony has been
                    the subject of much controversy, but to little purpose. Some treatises on music,
                    written since the time of Alexander the Great, and towards the decline of the
                    Grecian empire, have come down to us; but in none of them do we find the word
                    <hi rend="italic">harmony</hi> employed in the sense in which we now understand
                    it. The chant or song of an ode by Pindar, a hymn to Nemesis, and a few other
                    fragments, without chords of any kind, are all that have been preserved as
                    specimens of ancient Greek music. Moreover, the form of ancient instruments, and
                    the small number of their strings, all tend to render probable the opinion of
                    those who doubt the employment of harmony in the music of the ancients. Their
                    opponents contend that harmony exists <pb break="no" facs="nls:193641058"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0711-1058-0151"/>as an elementary part of our nature, and must have
                    been comprehended in the most primitive times; but this opinion we are strongly
                    induced to disregard, from the fact, that to this day the Turks, Arabians, and
                    Chinese are unacquainted with the simplest union of harmonies.</p>
                <p>The first indications of an approach to harmony appeared among the writers of the
                    middle ages, towards the ninth century; but it remained in a state of barbarism
                    till about the middle of the fourteenth century, when some Italian musicians
                    began to mould it into a somewhat agreeable form. Amongst those who
                    distinguished themselves at this remote epoch were, Francesco Cieco, so called
                    from his blindness, and Francesco degli Organi, so designated from his skill in
                    organ-playing, and Jacomo da Bologna. Harmony was still further elucidated by
                    two French musicians, Guillaume Dufay and Giles Binchois, and by John Dunstable,
                    an Englishman, who lived about the early part of the fifteenth century. The
                    advancement of this science must, however, for a long period have been of small
                    extent, and still less interest; for, up to the close of the sixteenth century,
                    we find that consonant chords, and certain discordant prolongations, or
                    suspensions as they are now called, were all that were known and used in music.
                    Composed of such elements, harmony was too limited in its operation to become
                    the groundwork of any intelligible science. It appears indeed probable, that at
                    this dark period of musical history, no systematic connection was even supposed
                    to exist between the chords, or the tones of which they consisted. The intervals
                    were considered only in a double relation; and the art of writing them,
                    according to certain conditions, comprehended the whole doctrine of the
                    schools.</p>
                <p>Towards the year 1590, a Venetian called Monteverde introduced the fundamental
                    discord, and immediately a new impulse was given to the art, which attracted the
                    attention of musicians. About fifteen years after this period, Monteverde’s
                    invention was disputed by Viadana and some Germans, who represented harmony by
                    figures, and considered the nature of musical sounds separately. It was then
                    that the term <hi rend="italic">chord</hi> was introduced into the vocabulary of
                    music; and harmony, or the <hi rend="italic">basso</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >continuo</hi> as it was styled, became a branch of scientific study. For nearly
                    a century, no further advances were made, although a number of elementary works
                    had been published during that interval, to explain the intricacies of the new
                    science.</p>
                <p>In 1699, Sauveur, a French geometrician, entertained such a passion for music,
                    that it became the object of all his pursuits. The doctrine of sounds appeared
                    to him worthy of mathematical analysis, and his researches were so successful,
                    that he founded the science called Acoustics. Availing himself of the labours of
                    Father Mersenne, Sauveur also found that every sound, however simple, was always
                    accompanied with other sounds less sensible. With this experiment Rameau set
                    out, and upon it formed the basis of his harmonic system, which he demonstrated
                    in a series of works published in the early part of the last century. Tartini,
                    although following a different mode of investigation, arrived at conclusions
                    similar to those of Rameau. The latter supposes the treble to be generated by
                    the bass; the former makes the bass result from the treble. Rameau deduces
                    harmony from melody; Tartini, on the contrary, derives melody from harmony. To
                    determine from which of the two schools the best performances are likely to
                    proceed, no more is necessary than to investigate the end of the composer, and
                    discover whether the air is made for the accompaniment, or the accompaniment for
                    the air. Rousseau, in his <hi rend="italic">Musical Dictionary,</hi> gives a
                    decided preference to the system of Tartini; but this celebrated author was not
                    very profoundly versed in these matters. D’Alembert gave a familiar explanation
                    of the doctrines of Rameau, and in 1752 published his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Elements</hi><hi rend="italic">of the Theory and Practice of Music,</hi> in
                    which an apparent order and clearness is imparted to a system essentially
                    defective. Marpurg attempted to introduce these doctrines into Germany without
                    success. It is almost unnecessary to add, that they are now universally rejected
                    by all modern theorists.</p>
                <p>It was reserved for Kirnberger, a learned musician, to discover the theory of
                    suspensions, and explain, in his <hi rend="italic">Wahren Grundsatze</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">sum</hi><hi rend="italic">gebrauch der Harmonie,</hi> published in
                    1773, the laws of harmony, in a manner at once natural and satisfactory. Catel
                    has reproduced this system in a clear and simple form, in his treatise on
                    harmony, written for the conservatory of music in France. Albretz-berger,
                    Reicha, and several other eminent theorists, have propagated and elucidated the
                    doctrines of Kirnberger with ingenuity and ability, and by their elaborate works
                    have largely promoted the practical uses of harmony. In England the science has
                    been as yet very imperfectly explained. One of the best works we have met with
                    in our language is by Kollmann, whose <hi rend="italic">Treatise on Harmony</hi>
                    displays admirable systematic arrangement, although his ex« positions are rather
                    dry and verbose. See Music, (z. z.)</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic smallcaps"> Harmony</hi><hi rend="italic">of the Spheres,</hi>
                    or <hi rend="italic">Celestial Harmony,</hi> a sort of music much talked of by
                    many of the ancient philosophers and fathers, and supposed to have been produced
                    by the sweetly-tuned motions of the stars and planets. This harmony they
                    attributed to the various proportionate impressions of the heavenly globes upon
                    one another, acting at proper intervals. It is impossible, according to them,
                    that such prodigiously large bodies, moving with so much rapidity, should be
                    silent. On the contrary, the atmosphere, continually impelled by them, must
                    yield a set of sounds proportionate to the impression it receives; and as they
                    do not all run the same circuit, nor revolve with the same velocity, the
                    different tones arising from the diversity of motions, directed by the hand of
                    the Almighty, must form an admirable symphony or concert. They therefore
                    supposed that the moon, as being the lowest of the planets, corresponded to <hi
                    rend="italic">mi,</hi> Mercury to <hi rend="italic">fa,</hi> Venus to <hi
                    rend="italic">sol,</hi> the Sun to <hi rend="italic">la,</hi> Mars to <hi
                    rend="italic">si,</hi> Jupiter to <hi rend="italic">ut,</hi> Saturn to <hi
                    rend="italic">re,</hi> and the orb of the fixed stars, as being the highest of
                    all, to <hi rend="italic">mi,</hi> or the octave.</p>
