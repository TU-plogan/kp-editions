                    this article was formerly bestowed on a much larger group of animated beings
                    than that to which we here restrict it. The Linnaean group of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Vermes</hi> contained, in fact, the whole of the intestinal and other worms,
                    the molluscous and testaceous tribes, the Zoophytes and Infusoria,—which now
                    form the natural materials of many classes. We here apply it exclusively to the
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">Annelides,</hi> or red-blooded vermes, of which the
                    medicinal leech and earth-worm afford familiar examples. Bruguieres and others
                    have no doubt conjoined them, in comparatively recent times, with the intestinal
                    tribes; and it was at one time our intention (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Animal
                    Kingdom,</hi> vol. iii. p. 180 of this work) to have adopted that arrangement.
                    But we now conceive it to be more advisable to follow the example of Cuvier,
                    and, referring the latter to the radiated or zoophytical division, to include in
                    the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Helminthology</hi> the Annelides alone. In
                    truth, the intestinal tribes exhibit no organs of respiration, either tracheal
                    or branchial,—no traces of a true circulation,—and their nervous system is
                    extremely obscure. It will therefore become apparent, from the following
                    definition, how greatly the Annelides differ from the creatures just named.</p>
                <p>The Annelides or red-blooded worms form the first class of the articulated
                    division of the animal kingdom.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>For a description of these primary divisions of the animal
                    kingdom, see vol. iii. p. 179 of this work.</p></note> Their blood, of a red
                    colour, resembling that of the vertebrated animals, circulates in a double
                    system of closed vessels, that is, in arteries and veins. This system, though
                    destitute of a heart properly so called, is sometimes provided with one or more
                    distinct fleshy ventricles. Respiration is carried on through the medium of
                    organs, which are sometimes external, occasionally developed beneath the surface
                    of the skin, or sunk more deeply into the interior. They may all be presumed to
                    breathe by means of branchiae, although the respiratory system, of the so-called
                    Abranchial Order, is still unknown. The branchiae or respiratory organs of the
                    greater number are external, and vary considerably in their size, form, number,
                    and position. Their body, of a softish texture, is more or less elongated, and
                    always divided into numerous rings or segments, of which the anterior, known
                    under the name of head, scarcely differs from the others, except by the
                    possession of a mouth, and of the principal organs of the senses. None of the
                    Annelides possess articulated members properly so called, but in room of these
                    many are furnished with setiferous mammillae, or fleshy projections, bearing
                    bundles of hairs or bristles, and forming what may be called <hi rend="italic"
                    >pedes</hi><hi rend="italic">spurii,</hi> of which the number is extremely
                    various. These peculiar organs are sometimes composed of two parts, the one
                    superior and dorsal, the other inferior and ventral. The muscular power resides
                    in the interior, and is capable of producing only an undulatory or creeping
                    movement,—the locomotive parts being incompetent to sustain the body. The organs
                    of the mouth consist sometimes of parts resembling jaws, more or less
                    developed,—sometimes of a simple tube. The organs of the external senses are
                    composed of fleshy tentacula, sometimes articulated,—and of certain blackish
                    points, not existing in all the species, regarded as eyes. The nervous system
                    consists of a double ganglionic cord, analogous to that of insects, as already
                    described in our article <hi rend="smallcaps">Entomology.</hi> In regard to
                    their natural habits, most of these creatures are aquatic (the Lumbrici or
                    earthworms excepted). Some dwell in holes beneath the waters, other form tubes
                    or tunnels of mud or other matters, or even transude from their own bodies a
                    calcareous secretion, which forms around them a protecting covering.<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>“As to the external tube
                    which the Chetopoda (by which term Μ. de Blainville denominates the setigerous
                    genera of the class Annelides) often inhabit, although it is frequently
                    sufficiently regular and solid, it cannot however in any manner be compared to
                    the shell of the Mollusea, not even where there is the greatest approximation,
                    as in <hi rend="italic">Dentalium</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Siliquaria.</hi>
                    These tubes of the Chetopoda are always simple excretions from their body, which
                    are by no means attached to it, and from which the animal may issue forth
                    without dying immediately. We begin to observe something of this kind in the
                    mucosity with which certain species line the hole hollowed in the mud or sand
                    which they inhabit, as in the Arenicoae, and some Lumbrici. This is analogous to
                    the mucous pellicle of the tube of the Amphitritae and the Sabellae; but in the
                    latter, surrounding this mucosity, is attached externally a stratum, more or
                    less thick, composed merely of mud or very fine grains of sand, or, in fine, of
                    debris, more or less thick, of shells and larger grains of sand. These tubes are
                    constantly open at both extremities; there are also some of them more regular,
                    which are completely calcareous. The double opening is a character whereby they
                    are distinguished from tubular shells, the summit of which, on the contrary, is
                    constantly imperforate. These tribes, however, appear constantly to grow, after
                    the manner of tubular shells, by laminae or strata extremely thin, placed inside
                    of and out-edging one another. From this result striae marking the growth, more
                    or less apparent outside·; but we never remark longitudinal striae on their
                    surface, nor anything indicating the delicate working of the edges of a mouth,
                    as in the Mollusea. This character alone might suffice to distinguish them from
                    the true tubular <hi rend="italic">shells</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> but to
                    this we may add, that the constant perforation of the summit of the tube of the
                    Chetopoda never allows the animal, in growing and advancing in its tube, to form
                    partitions there, whereas in the tubular shells the reverse is invariably the
                    case. A final character which distinguishes the tubes of the Chetopoda is, that
                    they are adherent, and fixed flatly, through a greater portion of their extent,
                    on foreign bodies, which never takes place with the tubular shells.” (Griffith’s
                    edition of Cuvier’s <hi rend="italic">Animal Kingdom,</hi> vol. xiii. p. 58.) We
                    may add, that the young of the shell-bearing Mollusea are always born with
                    shells, because that part forms, in fact, a portion of their <hi rend="italic"
                    >skin;</hi> but there is no doubt that the young Annelides are produced in an
                    exposed condition, and afterwards proceed, by a voluntary effort, to form their
                    protecting habitations. '</p></note> Considered sexually, they are for the most
                    part hermaphrodite, and some require reciprocal communication.</p>
                <p>It will be perceived, even from the preceding brief exposition, that the
                    Annelides are animals of a very peculiar nature. Although their nervous system
                    coincides with that of the other articulated classes, and although their bodies
                    are likewise divided by transverse sections, yet their locomotive organs are
                    entirely dissimilar to those of the Crustacea, Arachnides, and Insects. Their
                    setiferous mam-millae are merely retractile sheaths, and the hairs or bristles
                    which they enclose are in no way comparable to the feet of the last-named
                    classes, but are organs of a very different nature.</p>
                <p>The Annelides are few in number compared with insects and other articulated
                    classes, and the greater proportion are marine. Their possession of red blood is
                    a singular character in animals so low in the scale, and one not possessed by
                    the molluscous tribes, which are yet regarded as their superiors in other points
                    of organisation. In regard to their external parts, we shall here indicate a few
                    of the most important,—premising that the characters mentioned are not universal
                    to the class, but rather <pb break="no" facs="nls:193641916"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0711-1916-0217"/>confined to certain races. The head, in such as
                    possess one, is a small anterior swelling, which bears the antennae commonly so
                    called, and the eyes, and is distinct from the first segment of the body. The
                    Nereids of Linnaeus are regarded by Latreille as the only Annelides of which the
                    anterior segment merits the name of head, or possesses organs fit to be compared
                    to eyes, more especially to those of the larvae of insects. These eyes are
                    simple, extremely small, and appear like blackish points,—their number from two
                    to four. Savigny indeed attributes eight to the leech tribe, but Latreille
                    suspects that their structure is different from that of the Nereids. The
                    organisation of the mouth varies greatly in the different orders. The parts
                    called maxillae by Savigny are hard circumscribed parts, of a corneous or
                    calcareous nature, to which Latreille does not accord the name of jaws. The
                    latter author indeed seems to regard the Annelides as a suctorial rather than a
                    masticating class. Most of them are of carnivorous habits, and live on the blood
                    of other creatures. The trunk or sucker is a contractile fleshy portion,
                    constituting the mouth, and containing the so-called jaws. The latter portions,
                    however, being adherent to the inner coats of the sucker, and the latter being
                    nothing more than a prolongation of the oesophagus, can scarcely be regarded as
                    genuine jaws.</p>
                <p>Several tribes have their branchiae uniformly spread over the extent of the body,
                    or over its central portion, while others (and these usually dwell in tubes)
                    bear those organs at their anterior extremity. In the erratic species, or such
                    as are naked, and without fixed dwellings, they are usually disposed
                    longitudinally along the sides of the body, there being one for each foot.
                    Blood-vessels sometimes appear to spread into the setiform processes, and to
                    convert them into respiratory organs.</p>
                <p>We have already stated that Linnaeus placed the Annelides in his almost unlimited
                    class of Vermes,—a vast and by no means well-combined group, which the later
                    labours of Otho Frederick Muller, Pallas, and other naturalists, failed to cast
                    into a more natural mould. The great Swedish naturalist separated the true
                    Annelides from each other, placing one portion of the group in the order
                    Intestina, and the other in that of Mollusea. In Cuvier’s earliest work <hi
                    rend="italic">(Tableau</hi><hi rend="italic">Elémentaire,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >8cc.</hi> 1789), he restricted the class of worms to the Annelides and
                    intestinal species, a mode of grouping previously practised by Bruguieres in the
                    <hi rend="italic">Encyclopédie Méthodique.</hi> Subsequent investigations
                    induced the French anatomist to raise the former to the rank of a separate
                    class, which he named <hi rend="italic">Vers a sans rouge,</hi> in a memoir read
                    to the French Institute in 1802. On this same group Lamarck <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Extrait</hi><hi rend="italic">du Cours,</hi> &amp;c. 1812) bestowed the name
                    of <hi rend="smallcaps">Annelides,</hi> which has since been very generally
                    adopted. A slight disparity, however, still exists in the constitution of the
                    Annelides, in the works of Cuvier and Lamarck, the former including in the class
                    so named the genus Gordius, which the latter associates with the other
                    Vermes.</p>
                <p>But notwithstanding the valuable labours of these and other writers, the external
                    structure of the Annelides cannot be said to have been at all rigorously
                    determined, or viewed in relation to that of conterminous groups, till we
                    received the fruits of Savigny’s laborious and most delicate observations,
                    originally presented to the Academy of Sciences.<note anchored="true"

                    others, have likewise contributed to our knowledge of this curious and important
                    class, in publications, to the majority of which we shall more particularly
                    allude in the course of the present treatise.</p>
                <p>In regard to the geographical distribution of the Annelides, our data are not yet
                    sufficiently precise and numerous to admit of any satisfactory generalization.
                    We have already said, that with the exception of the earthworms (and even these
                    require a moist abode), all the <hi rend="italic">known</hi> species are
                    aquatic. We may add, that the great majority inhabit the saline waters of the
                    ocean. Most of the Naids, however, occur in fresh water, and some true Nereids
                    are found in the lakes of North America. Annelides of some kind or other are met
                    with in all quarters of the globe, and the species of many genera are very
                    widely distributed; but others, such as the <hi rend="italic">Amphi-nomoe,</hi>
                    for example, are characteristic of, if not peculiar to, the warmer seas.
                    Undoubtedly the most magnificent are native to the Indian shores. “It is in
                    general on the coasts of the sea, in the midst of Thalassiophytes, in the
                    anfractuosities of Madrepores, in the sand, and particularly in mud, that the
                    Chetopoda are to be found; and if some species are more commonly to be met with
                    in the open sea, as, for instance, the Amphinomae, named by Μ. Savigny <hi
                    rend="italic">Pleione vagans,</hi> it appears that they may have been drawn
                    along with marine plants by the currents, as is the case with many other

                    compared to those of slugs, although their appendages for locomotion are much
                    more numerous. The Nereids, however, not only creep in a kind of serpentine
                    manner over the surface of solid bodies at the water’s edge, but frequently swim
                    very respectably, either by successive undulations of the body, after the manner
                    of eels and serpents, or by agitating their appendages, and thus making these
                    organs serve as oars.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                <p>The utility, in an economical point of view, of the Annelides in general to the
                    human race, is by no means great. According to Pallas, the inhabitants of some
                    parts of Belgium eat those portions of <hi rend="italic">Aphrodita</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">aculeata</hi> which compose the mouth; the Nereids and Arenicoae,
                    as well as the earth-worms, are extensively employed as baits for fish, and the
                    medicinal uses of the leech are notorious; but, with these, and, it may be, a
                    few other exceptions, little can be said regarding the direct benefits derivable
                    from this peculiar class. Its subjects, howèver, are by no means on that account
                    the less important in the eyes of the philosophical naturalist.</p>
                <p>Several of the Annelides possess a phosphoric property, from which Linnaeus named

                <p>The presence or absence of the organs of motion, and the position of the
                    branchiae, furnish natural characters of easy application, which modern
                    zoologists have employed to signalize the primary groups. Lamarck divides the
                    Annelides into three orders, <hi rend="italic">les Apodes, les Antennes,</hi>
                    and <hi rend="italic">les Sédentaires,—</hi> and in the system of Cuvier they
                    likewise form an equal number of orders, <hi rend="italic">les Tubicoes, les

                    the Serpulae occupy the highest position in the scale. Savigny’s arrangement of
                    these animals consists of five orders, of which the author has as yet treated
                    only of four, viz. <hi rend="italic">les Nereidees, les Serpulees, les

                    >rudinées.</hi> He places the Aphrodites and Nereids at the head of the class.
                    Latreille is also of opinion that these Annelides, especially the Nereids, so
                    far as regards their external organisation, are entitled to precedence, and make
                    the nearest approach to the articulated animals provided with feet, such as
                    Insects and Crustacea.</p>
                <p>We shall here, in as far as general arrangement is concerned, follow the system
                    of Cuvier.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Order</hi> I.—TUBICOLAE, Cuv.</p>
                <p>Some form a calcareous homogeneous tube, supposed to result from transudation,
                    like the covering of testaceous Mollusea, but which does not adhere by any
                    muscular attachment; others construct a covering by agglutinating grains of
                    sand, broken shells, and other debris, by means of a membrane, likewise the
                    result of transudation; while a third group are surrounded by a tube of an
                    entirely membranous or corneous nature.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Genus Serpula,</hi> Linn. The body is composed of numerous
                    segments; its anterior portion is enlarged in the form of a disk, armed on
                    either side by several bundles of stiff bristles; and on each side of the mouth
                    is a fanshaped plume of branchiae, usually adorned by lively colours. At the
                    base of each plume is a fleshy filament, one or other of which is always
                    prolonged and dilated at the extremity into a disk of various form, which serves
                    as an operculum, and closes the overture of the tube whenever the contained
                    creature chooses to retire. (Plate CCLXXV. fig. 3.) Of this genus the calcareous
                    tubes cover, by their tortuous windings, the surface of stones, shells, and
                    other submarine bodies. The species are widely distributed throughout the seas
                    of Europe, India, and America. The largest are indigenous to the warmer climates
                    of the globe. Little is known of their instinctive habits or natural economy.
                    They arc said to feed on aquatic animalcules, which they seize by means of their
                    branchial tentacula.</p>
                <p>Linnaeus, and most of the naturalists of his time, placed the Serpulae among the
                    testaceous Mollusea. They now constitute a numerous genus, of which several
                    species occur in the European seas. They are very contractile, and are supposed
                    to feed on animalcules. A well-known species, <hi rend="italic">8.
                    contortuplicata</hi> (Plate CCLXXV. fig. 1), has rounded tortuous tubes, of
                    about three lines in diameter. Its operculum is tunnel-shaped, and its branchiae
                    are often of a beautiful red, or varied with yellow and violet. Any object
                    thrown into the sea is apt to be speedily covered by this species.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Genus Spirorbis,</hi> Lam. Branchiae much less numerous than
                    in the preceding genus (from three to four on each side), placed anteriorly in a

                    between the branchiae. Tube testaceous, and rolled after the manner of a <hi

                <p>This genus is composed of very small species, which are found attached to fuci,
                    shells, and other marine bodies. They frequently occur in great numbers, though
                    always separate from each other. The animals are of a blood-red colour. We have
                    figured the <hi rend="italic">Sp. nautildides</hi> of Lam. synonymous with the
                    <hi rend="italic">8erpula spirorbis</hi> of Linn. See Plate CCLXXV. figs. 2 and

                    Lamarck. Body and fan-shaped branchiae resembling those of the preceding genus,
                    but both the fleshy filaments adhering to the branchiae terminate in a point,
                    and do not form an operculum; they are sometimes even wanting. Their tube is
                    rarely calcareous, and seems often formed of grains of very fine clay or mud.
                    Most of the ascertained species are of considerable size, and are remarkable for
                    the extreme delicacy and lustre of their plumy branchiae.</p>

                    the rocks. It is extremely wary, and when approached instantly recedes within
                    its tube, which on a further alarm also retires into the rock, so that specimens
                    can be obtained only by breaking off portions of the mass. These, when put into
                    tubs of sea water, may be preserved for months, and the habits of the animals
                    attentively studied. The species in question is characterized by a simple
                    undulated tube of a whitish hue, the tentacula being varied by beautiful
                    alternate bands of red and white. <hi rend="italic">Amph. vesiculosa</hi> is a
                    British species described by Montagu.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    The internal texture of its tube is coriaceous, but the outer coat is invariably
                    covered by coarse sand, intermixed with fragments of shells. (See Plate CCLXXV.
                    fig. 5.) Considerable variety exists in the form and aspect of the genus
                    Sabella.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Genus Terebella, Cuv.</hi> These, like the preceding,
                    inhabit a tube of their own formation, but composed of coarser materials than
                    that of the generality of Sabellae. Their body presents much fewer segments, and
                    the head is otherwise adorned. Numerous filiform tentacula, capable of great
                    extension, surround the mouth; and on the neck are placed the branchiae, which
                    are not fan-shaped, but in the form of little branches.</p>
                <p>The animals of this genus, according to Montagu, either prepare a sheath from the
                    tenacious secretion of their own bodies, mixed with adventitious matters, or
                    reside in prepared perforations at the bottom of the sea. Their tubes are in
                    general so extremely fragile as to be easily destroyed, and the animals are then
                    found lurking beneath stones, or forming a new dwelling. Some fabricate their
                    tube in old shells or stones, to which they adhere by their entire length, while
                    others fix a tube perpendicularly in the sand. These tubes are indeed frequently
                    observed to obtrude several inches above the surface of the soil, and when the
                    waters flow, the gills and other appendages are stretched forth, and seem
                    agitated to and fro. The gills or branchial appendages are extremely sensible,
                    of a fine blood colour, and when touched they contract so suddenly as to expel
                    the fluid which they contain, and then they lose their sanguine hue. Many are
                    gregarious, and so numerous, that the sea-shore is sometimes seen covered by
                    their fragments after a storm. When their tubes are entire, but a small portion
                    of’ the body is protruded, with the exception of the filiform tentacula, which
                    they thrust about in all directions as if in search of food. The branchial
                    appendages, just mentioned as so finely coloured during life, lose their
                    brightness from day to day as the animals become sickly in confinement.</p>

                    and their golden setae form upon the head several concentric crowns, from which
                    an operculum is produced, which closes the tube when the animal is in a state of

                    no cirrhi to any part of the body.</p>
                <p>This genus was established by Lamarck, at the expense of the old genus <hi

                <p>This genus contains a monstrous worm, <hi rend="italic">Eun. gigantea,</hi> Cuv.
                    the largest of all known Annelides. It measures from four to six feet in length,
                    and its body consists of 448 segments. Its colour is ashy grey, with an
                    opalescent reflection. It inhabits the Indian seas. Montagu (in <hi

                    species, under the title of <hi rend="italic">Nereis sanguinea,</hi> but which,
                    from the author’s description of the jaws, is no doubt referrible to the present
                    genus, or rather to that subdivision of it called <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Marphysa</hi> by Savigny, and distinguished by the absence of nuchal tentacula.
                    The body is long, slightly depressed beneath, and its segments exceed 270, about
                    forty of which, at the posterior extremity, were of a much paler colour than the
                    others, and appeared to Montagu as if they had been lately reproduced. The rest
                    of the body was of a fine bronze colour, resplendent with changeable prismatic
                    tints. It is a large species, measuring fourteen or fifteen inches in length.
                    <hi rend="italic">Eun. tubicoa</hi> inhabits the North Sea, and is remarkable
                    for dwelling constantly in a solid corneous transparent tube. See Plate CCLXXV.

                <p>Some exhibit an alliance to the genus Eunice, in the strength of their jaws, and
                    the unequal number of their antennae. Such are the genera <hi rend="smallcaps"

                    small plates, in which a net-work of sanguineous vessels is disposed. Each foot
                    is moreover provided with two tubercles, two bundles of setae, and an upper and
                    under cirrhus.</p>
                <p>“The Nereides,” it is observed in Mr Griffith’s Supplement, “most usually live in
                    the excavations of littoral rocks, in the hollows of sponges, in certain
                    alcyones, in univalve or bivalve shells, in Madrepores, in the interstices of
                    the radicles of Thalassiophytes, under stones, and in general in all bodies
                    which present fissures more or less profound. There are some which bury
                    themselves in mud or sand, where they excavate a lodge proportional to the
                    dimensions of their body, and sometimes they line this dwelling with a mucous
                    matter issuing from their body, in sufficient abundance to construct a tube or
                    sheath. From this they put forth a greater or less portion of their body, but
                    rarely the posterior extremity, so that they may be able to reenter on the
                    slightest indication of danger. They all appear to feed upon animal substances,
                    whether in the living state, or in a state of putrefaction more or less
                    advanced. Μ. Bose, who has observed the manners of some species on the coasts of
                    the United States, tells us positively that these animals feed upon polypi and
                    small worms, on which they throw themselves, by darting the anterior part of
                    their body, which they have first contracted. Otho Fabricius tells us of some
                    species of Spio, or Nereides with tubes, that they seize the planariae on which
                    they feed, by means of their long tentacula.”</p>
                <p>The species of this genus have a linear shaped body, more or less convex above,
                    and composed of numerous segments. The term <hi rend="italic">Sea
                    scolopendree,</hi> sometimes applied to them, expresses not inaptly their usual
                    form. (See Plate CCLXXV. fig. 15.) <hi rend="italic">N. margaritacea</hi> of
                    Leach is distinguished by its pearly body, terminated by two long setae. Its
                    head is tri-lobate, with eight tentacula. This species is common near the Bell
                    Rock, and is subject to great variation of colour.</p>
                <p>Near the preceding Nereids may be classed several genera of the same slender
                    form, and with branchiae reduced to simple plates, or even to threads or

                <p>The body of this marine Vermis is long and slender, and composed of more than 200
                    annulations, each of which is furnished with two fasciculi of very minute
                    bristles. There are no eyes, and the branchiae are obscure. From the sides of
                    the segments issue very long, red, capillary appendages, most numerous near the
                    anterior end, the extreme point of which, however, is destitute of them, and
                    becomes acuminated. The mouth is placed on the inferior face. The posterior end
                    is likewise obtusely pointed. The length of this animal is eight or nine inches.
                    The colour of the upper portion is olive green, of the under dull orange. While
                    in a state of nature, the filiform appendages of the sides are in continual
                    motion, appearing like slender red worms, twisting themselves around the body in
                    all directions. This curious species was taken from a piece of timber that had
                    been perforated by <hi rend="italic">Pholades,</hi> and was destitute of any

                <p>The form of these Annelides is usually flatfish, and is shorter and broader than
                    in most of the genera. The in-, terior contains a very thick and muscular
                    oesophagus, susceptible of being in part protruded outwards, like a trunk or
                    sucker; there is likewise an unequal intestine, furnished on each side with a
                    great number of branched caeca, of which the extremities are attached between
                    the bases of the tufts of setae, which serve as locomotive organs. It is alleged
                    that the sexes are separate in the Aphroditae, and that the females are
                    oviparous. At certain periods the female is certainly found filled with egg-like
                    substances, which swim in a circumambient liquid, and the male is said to abound
                    with milt.</p>
                <p>Savigny has raised this genus to the rank of a family, containing three genera,
                    viz. <hi rend="italic">Palmyra,</hi> already noticed, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Hali-thea,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Polynoe.</hi></p>
                <p>To the genus <hi rend="italic">Halithea</hi> belongs a well-known British
                    species, <hi rend="italic">Aph.</hi><hi rend="italic">aculeata,</hi> Linn. It is
                    of an oval form, six or seven inches in length, and nearly two inches broad. The
                    scales of the back are covered, and in part concealed, by a substance resembling
                    tow, which takes its growth from the sides. From these sides also spring groups
                    of strong spines, which partially pierce through the tow-like substance, and
                    bundles of softer and more flexuous bristles, which shine with the brilliancy of
                    gold, or exhibit the various tints of the rainbow, scarcely yielding in beauty,
                    as Cuvier has observed, either to the lustrous plumage of the humming-bird, or
                    the sparkling of precious gems. Lower down is a tubercle, from which spines
                    issue in three groups, and of three different sizes, and lastly, a fleshy cone.
                    There are forty of these tubercles on each side; and between the first two there
                    are a pair of small fleshy tentacula. There are fifteen pair of broad scales,
                    sometimes pursed, upon the back, and fifteen small branchial crests on each
                    side. This curious creature is known along our native shores by the name of <hi

                <p>Another subdivision of the Linnaean. Aphroditae has none of the flax-like
                    substance on the back—the tentacula are five in number—and the trunk encloses
                    strong corneous mandibles. (Plate CCLXXVI. fig. 5.) It is named <hi
                    rend="italic">Polynoe</hi> by Savigny, and contains most of the old species
                    described by Linnaeus, Pallas, Muller, and Otho Fabricius. The <hi rend="italic"

                <p>FAMILY I—ABPvANCHIA SETIGERA.</p>
                <p>These are furnished with setae, and correspond to the two genera <hi
                    rend="italic">Lumbricus</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Nais</hi> of Linn.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Genus</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">Lumbricus,</hi><hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Cuv.</hi> Body long, contractile, cylindrical, divided by
                    wrinkles into a great number of apparent rings. Mouth without teeth,
                    subterminal, bilabiate, the upper lip larger than the other, advanced. No
                    eyes.</p>
                <p>This genus corresponds to <hi rend="italic">Enterion</hi> of Savigny, and
                    contains the earth-worm and other species. The setae are rough and short, as if
                    unguiculated. Each segment is provided with eight of these setae, that is, four
                    on each side, united in pairs, and forming, by their distribution on the body,
                    eight longitudinal rows, of which four are lateral and four inferior. From six
                    to nine of the segments, comprised between the 26th and the 37th, are swollen,
                    and form towards the anterior and superior portion of the body a kind of
                    cincture, especially perceptible during the breeding season. In the interior of
                    these creatures we perceive a straight wrinkled intestine, unprovided with a
                    caecum, but receiving in its course several muscular fibres (proper to the rings
                    of the body), which form an equal amount of small diaphragms. Some internal
                    whitish glands towards the anterior of the body are regarded as connected with
                    the generative system. The nervous cord consists of a series or infinity of very
                    small ganglia, closely set together. The circulation of the blood among the
                    Lumbrici is by no means difficult to detect. We may perceive arising from the
                    intestinal canal, and from the inner surface of the outer envelope, an infinite
                    number of small veinous vessels, which interlace with a great assemblage of
                    arterial ones. These veins unite in one common trunk, placed longitudinally
                    beneath the belly, and from that trunk proceed five small canals, which ūnite in
                    a single dorsal vessel, which may be regarded as the heart. From the
                    last-mentioned organ small arteries take their origin, and proceed to form a
                    net-work with the veins of the superficies of the body,— thus completing the
                    circulation. Respiration appears to be carried on at the surface of the skin,
                    most likely by means of extremely small internal branchiae.</p>
                <p>The appearance of the common earth-worm <hi rend="italic">{Lumbricus
                    terrestris)</hi> is too familiar to need description in this place. We shall
                    merely mention, that beneath the sixteenth segment there are two pores, the uses
                    of which are still unknown. The mode of production is likewise still disputed.

                    eggs descend between the intestine and the outer envelope, around the rectum,
                    where they hatch, and are speedily protruded in the living state. Μ. Dufour, on

                    state, sometimes still surrounded by an envelope or egg-like
                    covering.</p></note> See Plate CCLXXVI. figs. 7, 8, 9, 10. The ordinary habits
                    of the earth-worm are well known. 'They inhabit moist earth, which they pierce
                    in all directions, and a quantity of which they swallow. They also, however,
                    feed on animal and vegetable remains, and always prefer soil imbued with those
                    substances. They seek each other’s society chiefly during the night, and in the
                    month of June. Under the specific name of <hi rend="italic">terrestris,</hi>
                    naturalists have no doubt confounded many different kinds. Savigny, to whom we
                    owe so much in relation to the Annelides in general, has, since the publication
                    of his great work on that class, devoted his attention more particularly to the
                    genus Lumbricus, and has ascertained the existence of about twenty-two species
                    in the environs of Paris alone.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                <p>In the genus <hi rend="italic">Eypogocon</hi> of Savigny, each segment is
                    furnished with an additional seta on its dorsal surface, and the setae are long,
                    spiny, and sharp-pointed. The body in form and colour greatly resembles that of
                    thecommon earthworm, but the segments are less numerous, not exceeding 106,
                    whereas those of the latter amount to 120 and upwards. The only species with
                    which we are acquainted is <hi rend="italic">Hyp-</hi><hi rend="italic"

                    elongated, linear, flattened, transparent or semi-transparent, and in general
                    provided with lateral ciliae, simple or in tufts. Segments less distinctly
                    marked than in the earth-worm.</p>
                <p>The synonymy of this genus is very confused, its nature and attributes obscure,
                    and its position in the system consequently various, according to the views of
                    different observers. The name, borrowed from the heathen mythology, was first
                    applied by Muller, and was generally adopted by contemporaneous, as it has been
                    by succeeding, naturalists. It was written <hi rend="italic">Naias</hi> by
                    Bruguieres∙(in <hi rend="italic">Encye. Method.'),</hi> an erroneous alteration,
                    in so far as the latter term had been previously consecrated by Linnaeus to a
                    genus in botany. Lamouroux increased the confusion by bestowing the name of <hi
                    rend="italic">Naisa</hi> on a polypus genus of the family of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Tubularia,</hi> already known by the title of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Plumas-tella</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and the resemblance of the two names
                    has induced some compilers to refer to them as synonymous, although they in fact
                    signify objects belonging to separate classes of -the animal kingdom.</p>
                <p>Lamarck and Cuvier, in preserving the name of <hi rend="italic">Nais</hi> to the
                    subjects of our present notice, do not agree regarding their relations to other
                    groups. The former author places them in the third or concluding order of his
                    class Vermes <hi rend="italic">( Vers hispides),</hi> thus disposing them
                    between the genus <hi rend="italic">Gordius</hi> and the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Epizoariae.</hi> His reason for so doing is, that the structure of the Naides
                    is by no means sufficiently composite to entitle them to a place among the true
                    Annelides; and the fact of their being capable of multiplication by incision,
                    shows that their nature is somewhat anomalous in relation to the last-named
                    class. We may bear in mind, however, that notwithstanding the observations of
                    Trembley and Roesel, their <hi rend="italic">tomiparous</hi> generation is
                    doubted by Bose; and, all things considered, we regard them as more nearly

                    >Lumbricus</hi> than to any other. We therefore follow Cuvier in placing them
                    among the Annelides.</p>
                <p>The Naides in general are small vermiform creatures, of a few lines in length, of
                    a reddish colour, though diaphanous, extremely active in their movements, and of
                    a voracious disposition. They abound in fresh waters, where some dwell upon
                    aquatic plants,—others beneath stones, or in ’perforations in the mud. They prey
                    on minute Crustacea, such as the genus <hi rend="italic">Daphnia,</hi> and on
                    the still minuter animalcular tribes, and are themselves greedily devoured <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193641994" xml:id="kp-eb0711-1994-0223"/>by the fresh-water
                    polypi, which swallow them up, notwithstanding the pointed ciliae with which
                    their sides are armed. These ciliae, however, and other apparently indigestible
                    portions, are afterwards disgorged by the polyp;, in the same manner as owls and
                    other birds of prey reject from their stomachs little rounded pellets of hair
                    and feathers.</p>
                <p>The productive powers of the Naides, by whatever process accomplished, are truly
                    astonishing. They appear in countless thousands in the waters of marshes after
                    the lapse of a few hours, prior to which only some solitary individuals were
                    perceptible. The mouth in these animals is sometimes a simple cleft, sometimes
                    an opening, accompanied by two lips. The <hi rend="italic">N. proboscidia</hi>
                    of Gmelin, being provided with a trunk, forms the genus <hi rend="italic"
                    >Stylaria</hi> of Lamarck; while certain anomalous species; such as <hi
                    rend="italic">Lumbricus</hi><hi rend="italic">tubi~</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >fex</hi> and <hi rend="italic">marinus</hi> of Muller, constitute the
                    conterminous genus <hi rend="italic">Tubifex</hi> of the former author. They
                    dwell in perforations in the mud of streams and marshes, and in the sand of the
                    sea-shore. We may conclude by observing, that the nervous system of the Naides
                    is unknown, and that the ocular points on the heads of certain species, though
                    vaguely named eyes, cannot with any certainty be regarded as organs of
                    vision.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Genus Climena,</hi> Lam. Head without tentacula or other

                    and radiated.</p>
                <p>These creatures inhabit fixed tubes of a cylindrical form and membranous texture,

                    interstices of rocks, or to Madrepores and other productions of the sea.</p>

                    Raffles in one of his letters descriptive of an excursion from Bencoolen. “I
                    must not omit to tell you, that in passing through the forest, we were, much to
                    our inconvenience, greatly annoyed by <hi rend="italic">leeches</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">;</hi> they got into our boots and shoes, which became filled with
                    blood. At night, too, they fell off the leaves that sheltered us from the
                    weather, and on awaking in the morning we found ourselves bleeding profusely.
                    These were a species of intruders we were not prepared for.” Another species of
                    land leech is said to inhabit Madagascar, where it occurs on plants.· It seizes
                    greedily on the legs of the passers by, and sucks their blood.</p></note></p>
                <p>The leeches in general <hi rend="smallcaps">(Hirudines)</hi> are characterized by
                    an oblong body, sometimes depressed, transversely wrinkled, and furnished with a
                    dilatable cavity at either extremity—that is, the mouth is surrounded by a lip,
                    and the posterior end is provided with a flattened disk. These latter parts are
                    useful as organs of prehension and locomotion, and also act as suckers. The
                    mouth, placed in the anterior cavity, is furnished with three jaws.</p>
                <p>These useful vermes were probably known in very ancient times. The <hi
                    rend="italic">Halucah</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Gnaluha</hi> of the Hebrews
                    appears to have been one of this tribe, at least the term has been so translated
                    in our versions of the Proverbs, ch. XXX. V. 15. “The horse-leech hath two
                    daughters, crying, Give, give.” The Greek writers make mention of them under the
                    name of <hi rend="italic">Bdella,</hi> and the Latin authors under those of <hi
                    rend="italic">lnrudo</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Sanguisuga</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >;</hi> but the ascertainment of the precise species indicated is by no means
                    easy. After the revival of learning we have various general no tices of their
                    history and habits, although it was so late as the time of Linnaeus before we
                    attained to any knowledge of their specific distinctions. The Swedish naturalist
                    (in his <hi rend="italic">Fauna Suecica)</hi> described eight species, and
                    numerous additions have been made in more recent times. For a long period the
                    genus <hi rend="italic">Hirudo,</hi> as founded by Ray and adopted by Linnaeus,
                    experienced no subdivision; but the labours of Leach, Oken, Savigny, Lamarck,
                    and others, have shown the propriety of re-arranging a group, consisting no
                    doubt of natural constituent parts, but composed of beings exhibiting a varied
                    range of structure, and too much extended for the formation of a genus, properly
                    so called.</p>
                <p>The structure of these creatures is soft and contractile, composed of a great
                    number of articulations, and generally invested by an abundant supply of mucous
                    moisture. The anterior cavity, which contains themouth, is named <hi
                    rend="italic">capula</hi> by Savigny, while the posterior disk bears the name of
                    <hi rend="italic">cotyla</hi> in the nomenclature of that author. On the
                    anterior segments certain small black points are observable, which some
                    designate as eyes, but which have scarcely been proved to fulfil the functions
                    of those organs. They vary in number in the different genera, from two to ten.
                    Various experiments have been made with a view to the ascertainment of this
                    sense. If we place leeches in a vessel surrounded by black paper, and permit the
                    light to enter only by means of a single small orifice, they are by no means
                    slow in directing themselves to that point ;—but this observation we deem to be
                    in no way conclusive, in as far as light produces an efficient action and a
                    directing influence, not only upon many of the lowest tribes, which we know to
                    be destitute of eyes, but even upon the subjects of the vegetable kingdom. Μ.
                    Moquin-Tandon however asserts, that having placed a small piece of red-coloured
                    wood in front of <hi rend="italic">Nephelis vulgaris,</hi> it evidently turned
                    round on purpose to avoid it.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">Monographie de la famille</hi><hi

                    perception of the sense of touch is delicate, although they possess no special
                    or circumscribed organs for its reception. The sense of taste is obvious,—that
                    of hearing and of smell imperceptible. No odour affects them,—no sound seems to
                    produce any influence; nor can we detect any organs which may reasonably be
                    deemed the seat of these last-named functions.</p>
                <p>The tegumentary system of leeches has been examined in detail in very few
                    species. In the medicinal leech three parts are, however, distinguishable—the
                    epidermis, an intermediate layer which is the seat of colour,—and the dermis.
                    The epidermis is extremely fine and delicate, perfectly colourless, and
                    remarkably deciduous, that is to say, it is frequently renewed, even as often as
                    once in every four or five days in warm weather. It adheres intimately to the
                    lower layer, but not by its entire extent—being frequently free between the
                    rings of which the body of the creature is composed. When detached we perceive
                    that it is perfectly transparent at the points which adhered to the coloured
                    layer, and slightly opake, or even of a whitish colour, where it became
                    unattached in passing from one segment to another. Under the microscope it is
                    seen to be pierced by an infinity of small holes, through which a mucous liquid
                    flows, which lubricates the surface. The coloured layer, or <hi rend="italic"
                    >pigmentum,</hi> adheres strongly to the dermis on which it lies. The hues which
                    it exhibits are very different according to the species,—sometimes they are <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193642007" xml:id="kp-eb0711-2007-0224"/> dark and uniform,
                    but usually lighter on the under than the upper surface; sometimes the ground
                    colour is varied by spots or streaks of different intensities, while the
                    pigment, if we may so express it, is occasionally almost colourless, and we may
                    then perceive distinctly through the skin all the interior organs of the body.
                    The dermis, or deepest layer, exhibits a curious organisation; it consists of a
                    thickish tunic, presenting an appearance of distinct circular articulations,
                    which produce the ringed or wrinkled aspect of the external surface. The spaces
                    which exist between these rings are covered by the epidermis, and seem intended
                    to facilitate the varied movements of the animal.</p>
                <p>Beneath the skin, of course, are placed the muscles. We find first a layer of
                    transverse fibres, which adheres intimately to the dermis. This layer covers
                    other muscles, of which the direction is longitudinal; and beneath these we find
                    some more, of which the direction is again transversal.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">capula</hi> or oral sucker is formed by two extensile lips;
                    the one superior, usually large, sometimes almost lanceolate—the other inferior,
                    and less advanced. Within it are placed the jaws, rarely wanting, and usually
                    three in number, disposed triangularly, and fixed upon a corresponding number of
                    little tubercles. Their consistence is slightly cartilaginous, their form almost
                    lenticular, and their margin, free and cutting, is sometimes smooth, sometimes
                    furnished with a double row of dentations, more or less numerous according to
                    the different kinds. A sort of cartilaginous ring, which frequently surrounds
                    the base of the tubercles, indicates the opening of the intestinal canal, which
                    commences by a species of oesophagus more or less narrow, presenting
                    occasionally some longitudinal folds, but never any lateral pouch-like
                    swellings. The ensuing portion or stomach, on the contrary, usually exhibits
                    throughout its entire extent expansions more or less perceptible, according to
                    the state of repletion. In certain species (such as <hi rend="italic"
                    >Clepsina</hi><hi rend="italic">complanata)</hi> these lateral appendages are
                    never effaced, but constitute permanent caeca. The rectum is generally separated
                    from the stomach by a valvular contraction. The anal opening is on the back, at
                    the origin of the posterior sucker, called <hi rend="italic">cotyla</hi> by
                    Savigny. The digestive canal is throughout composed of two pellucid tunics, and
                    towards its extremity some muscular fibres are perceptible. Although the
                    existence of a liver in the leech tribe is not so ascertained as to be at all
                    generally admitted (indeed it is denied by some, and doubted by many), yet Μ.
                    Blainville describes an apparatus for the secretion of bile, consisting of a
                    cellulo-membranous tissue, surrounding a portion of the stomach and
                    intestine.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi

                <p>All leeches are blood-thirsty and voracious, and support themselves by sucking
                    the life-blood of other animals. Their powers of digestion and assimilation are,
                    however, extremely slow. After the lapse of days, weeks, and even months,
                    portions of the liquid or solid matters which they may have Swallowed are found
                    to remain in the intestinal canal. The kinds used in medicine, moreover, offer
                    this peculiarity, that the blood which they have sucked does not seem to
                    experience any sensible alteration in their stomach, but maintains its natural
                    colour and fluidity. If, however, the leech dies, or the blood is exposed to the
                    air, it speedily coagulates, and becomes of a blackish brown.</p>
                <p>The nervous system of the leech tribe has been described in some detail by
                    several authors, especially that of <hi rend="italic">Sanguisuga</hi><hi

                    It is composed of a series of ganglions, extending from the mouth to the
                    extremity of the body, and placed, as among the other articulated classes,
                    beneath the alimentary canal. From each ganglion proceed nervous threads, which
                    ramify <hi rend="italic">ad infinitum</hi> to the other parts.</p>
                <p>The circulating system of leeches has been the subject of still more numerous

                    signalised themselves in that laborious field. All the species hitherto examined
                    have presented four longitudinal vascular trunks,—one dorsal, another ventral
                    (these two being separated by the alimentary canaD, and two lateral. These
                    principal organs communicate with each other, not only by the capillary vessels
                    which meet and intermingle in the different parts to which they are distributed,
                    but also by special branches of considerable diameter, which proceed directly
                    from one vascular trunk to another. The ventral vessel furnishes large branches,
                    which, mounting vertically on either side, embrace the intestinal canal, and
                    open on the dorsal vessel. Dugés names these the <hi rend="italic"
                    >abdomino-dorsal</hi><hi rend="italic">branches.</hi> The lateral branches
                    communicate with each other by means of transverse branches, which pass beneath
                    the medullary cord. These branches have been lately figured and described by
                    Jean Muller (in <hi rend="italic">Archiv,</hi><hi rend="italic">fur

                    Lastly, these lateral trunks also send large branches to the dorsal vessel,
                    which bear the designation of <hi rend="italic">latero-dorsal branches.</hi> In
                    addition to these canals, which thus establish a direct connection between the
                    principal trιmks, each of the latter gives rise to an infinite number of small
                    vessels, which carry the blood to the various parts, and especially to the skin,
                    which may be regarded as the principal, though not the sole, organ of
                    respiration. That other organ, to which we now allude, consists of certain
                    pouches, amply provided with blood-vessels, which form a net-work on their
                    coats, and proceed from the subdivision of a vessel furnished by the
                    latero-abdominal branches, as well as of a large vascular pouch or bag called
                    pulmonary by Dugés, and which is derived from the lateral trunk. In a species of
                    <hi rend="italic">Albione</hi> dissected by Μ. Audouin, the lateral vessels were
                    perceived to be in direct communication with the respiratory pouches, by means
                    of two branches, one of which is anterior, the other posterior. He also observed
                    that numerous branches sprang from the anterior portion of the dorsal vessel,
                    and proceeded partly to the pouches, and partly to the lateral trunks. Thus the
                    pouches communicate at the same time, both with the dorsal and lateral vessels.
                    In accordance with these views, the process of circulation is supposed to be as
                    follows. The lateral trunks are regarded as great veins, which receive the blood
                    from all parts of the body, and transmit it to the respiratory pouches, in which
                    it becomes re-oxygenated; a small portion then flows back to the lateral
                    vessels, while the greater portion enters the dorsal vessel, and then the
                    ventral one, both of which assist in propelling it to all the other parts of the
                    body, from whence it returns to the lateral branches, and thence flows to the
                    respiratory pouches as aforesaid. We must add, however, that Μ. de Blain ville
                    and others deny that the pouches or vesicular sacks just mentioned are of a
                    pulmonary nature.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Cuvier

                    respiration is carried on in great part through the medium of the skin. Various
                    kinds of leeches may be often seen fixed by their posterior sucker, and swinging
                    themselves to and fro for hours and even days together, their bodies being at
                    that time more than usually flattened, in order to render the motion more
                    effective. They are then respiring after the manner of the Naids, by bringing
                    their cutaneous system into constant contact with a fresh supply of water.
                    During this singular process the pulmonary pouches are almost quite inert, and
                    their sanguineous vessels scarcely perceptible, while the <hi rend="italic"
                    >cutaneous</hi> net-work, on the contrary, is in full and remarkable
                    activity.</p>
                <p>Leeches are hermaphrodites, like others of their class; but sexual union of
                    separate individuals is indispensable to the process of fecundation. Although in
                    many of their more obvious characters they so nearly resemble the Planariae„they
                    stand too high in the scale to be capable of reproduction by excision, or the
                    cutting of parts. A variety of opinion exists among naturalists regarding the
                    mode of production, whether by eggs or living young. It is probable that such as
                    do not appear to lay eggs are merely ovoviviparous, and bring forth their young
                    alive, after they have been hatched in the body of the parent. The majority of
                    species in truth lay <hi rend="italic">oviferous capsules,</hi> each containing
                    several germs. Certain kinds of <hi rend="italic">Clepsina</hi> are
                    distinguished by this peculiarity; a small pouch exists in the abdomen, in which
                    the young seek protection during infancy. They attain to full size rather
                    slowly, and the duration of life is considerable, though not distinctly known.
                    Medicinal leeches have been kept in life for a period of eight years; and it has
                    been inferred, that if, with the disadvantages of confinement, and irregular
                    supplies of food, they survive so long, their natural term of life must be much
                    greater. This, however, we regard as an inconclusive, if not erroneous mode of
                    reasoning; for we know that among insects and other classes of the more lowly
                    organized departments of animal life, abstinence, and the non-fulfilment of
                    their natural instincts, are uniformly found to prolong their period of
                    existence.</p>
                <p>The leech tribe in general is widely distributed over the earth’s surface,
                    although, as usual, each species has its own range of localities.<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>We observe it stated in
                    several continental works of authority, that leeches are unknown in, or at least
                    not indigenous to, the western world. We were inclined <hi rend="italic">α
                    priori</hi> to doubt the accuracy of this statement, ami lately instituted some
                    inquiries on the subject, in which we were aided by an excellent physiological
                    naturalist of this city, Dr Alien Thomson. We find that in the Dispensatory of
                    the United States, by Drs Wood and Bache (published at Philadelphia in 1833),
                    there is a description of a true American medicinal leech. These authors state,
                    that at New York, Boston, and elsewhere, European leeches, that is, the gray and
                    green varieties of the <hi rend="italic">Hirudo medicinalis</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">of</hi> Linnaeus, are chiefly employed, and are imported in great
                    quantities; but that in Philadelphia and the neighbourhood the indigenous <hi
                    rend="italic">Hirudo</hi><hi rend="italic">decora</hi> is used. It is this
                    species which is described in Major Long’s Second Expedition (vol. ii. p. 268).
                    The back is of a deep pistachio-green colour, with three longitudinal rows of
                    square spots, twenty-two in number, and placed on every fifth ring. The abdomen
                    is spotted with black. This kind usually measures two or three inches in length,
                    occasionally attaining to the extent of four or five inches. It is carried to
                    Philadelphia by the country people from Bucks and Berks county. It is said to
                    draw less blood than the European leech, and does not cut so deeply. About three
                    American do not more than correspond to a single European leech in their
                    suctorial powers.</p></note> Our medicinal kinds seem proper to Europe, although
                    they extend from Russia to the southern point of Spain. All the species are
                    extremely sensible of atmospheric changes. They seem agitated during high winds,
                    and often bury themselves in the mud during cloudy weather. Some fanciful
                    observers have even kept them in confinement, that they might serve to indicate
                    the weather; but we incline to think that it is fully as useful, and not more
                    troublesome, to look out of a window than into a phial. On the approach of cold
                    weather they sink into the mud, and pass the winter in a state of lethargy.</p>
                <p>We shall now proceed to a brief consideration of the principal genera into which
                    the tribe has been partitioned by modern naturalists.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Genus</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">Sanguisuga,</hi> Sav. Oral
                    sucker consisting of several segments; upper lip almost lanceolate; aperture

                    edges with two ranges of fine teeth. Ten black points (which some regard as
                    eyes) disposed in a curved line; the posterior four more isolate. Anal sucker
                    obliquely terminal.</p>
                <p>This genus contains the leeches properly so called, that is, the medicinal kinds;
                    and, according to Savigny, consists of three species. Some recent additions,
                    however, have been made to these by MM. Moquin-Tandon and Carena.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">H.</hi><hi rend="italic">medicinalis</hi> of naturalists (Plate
                    CCLXXVI.fig. 14) is the most common kind, and that most frequently used for
                    blood-letting purposes. It occurs throughout the freshwater marshes of Europe,
                    and measures from four to five inches in what may be called its medium state,
                    although capable of both contraction and extension within and beyond those
                    limits. Its body, including the anterior sucker, is composed of ninety-eight
                    rings, and is of a deep-green colour on the back, with six reddish bands, three
                    on each side. The two inner bands are almost spotless; the two central ones are
                    marked by a chain of small spots and points of velvet-black; the exterior bands
                    are marginal, and each subdivided by a black fillet. The abdomen is of an olive
                    colour, broadly bordered and spotted with black. Savigny distinguishes, under
                    the name of *9. <hi rend="italic">officinalis</hi> (it is the <hi rend="italic"
                    >H.</hi><hi rend="italic">provincialis</hi> of Carena), another species,
                    likewise used in medicine (see Plate CCLXXVI. figs. 11 and 12), and frequently
                    confounded with the preceding. It is vulgarly known as the <hi rend="italic"
                    >green leech,</hi> and resembles the common kind in size, and the number of its
                    segments; but the colour of the back is not so sombre, and the abdomen is of a
                    more yellow green, and, though bordered with black, is without spots. The six
                    anterior eyes are very projecting, and have more truly the appearance of organs
                    or vision. The third species mentioned by Savigny is the &gt;9. <hi
                    rend="italic">granulosa.</hi> It was brought by Μ. Leschenhault from
                    Pondicherry, where it is used in blood-letting after the manner of our European
                    kinds. &lt;9. <hi rend="italic">obscura</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >interrupta</hi> are both described by Μ. Moquin-Tandon as indigenous to the
                    vicinity of Montpellier; and <hi rend="italic">S. verbena</hi> of Carena occurs
                    in the Lago Maggiore.</p>
                <p>With the exception of the last-named species, and that from Pondicherry, Μ.
                    Blainville refers all the others to the <hi rend="italic">H.</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">medicinalis</hi> of Linn., of which, according to his peculiar
                    views, he establishes five varieties; the grey, the green, the spotted, the
                    black, and the flesh-coloured. With that love of change for which too many
                    modern naturalists are remarkable, he names the genus <hi rend="italic"
                    >Jatrobdella.</hi></p>
                <p>We have already mentioned that leeches are abundant in all the countries of
                    Europe. France furnishes an immense supply, and their collection in some of her
                    provinces affords the materials of an important branch of commerce. Some curious
                    details on the subject were read several years ago to the agricultural society
                    of the department of Seine-et-Oise. Towards the month of April or May, according
                    to the nature of the season, the country people collect the cocoons or capsules
                    formerly mentioned as containing the eggs. These they find in abundance in the
                    mud of shallow marshes, and convey them <pb break="no" facs="nls:193642033"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0711-2033-0226"/>to various reservoirs in other quarters, so as to
                    spread and propagate the breed. They do not use them commercially till they are
                    about eighteen months old. Leeches are very numerous in the lakes and marshes in
                    the neighbourhood of Nantes; and their collection is carried on throughout the
                    whole year, but chiefly during summer. They are transported to Paris in linen
                    bags, each containing about 500, placed in panniers, and surrounded by wet moss.
                    During a favourable season the dealers of Nantes will sometimes receive at the
                    rate of fifty thousand every day; and a Parisian druggist informed Μ. Audouin,
                    that in the summer of 1820 he received from Moulins 130,000 for his own
                    share.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic"
                    >Diet. Class. d’Hist. Nat.</hi> t. xv. p. 108.</p></note> Many leeches refuse to
                    bite. This generally arises either from their appetite for food having been
                    recently satisfied, or from their being about to change their skins. It is
                    believed, however, that capricious individuals sometimes occur, which will not
                    suck at all; and of this it is impossible to ascertain the cause. Inflammation
                    occasionally follows the infliction of the bite, and in this case a vulgar
                    prejudice exists that a horseleech has been applied. This is in every way an
                    error, for the horse-leech refuses to fasten upon the human body. The means used
                    for the preservation of leeches in confinement are various. The most common mode
                    consists in placing them in a bottle of water frequently renewed. Some
                    apothecaries find advantage from placing moss or aquatic plants at the bottom of
                    the vessel, which aid in freeing them from slime. The chief dispenser of the
                    marine hospital of Rochefort keeps his leeches simply in moistened clay, in
                    which the creatures form holes and galleries, where they live happily for
                    years.</p>

                    allege that it causes wounds extremely dangerous both to man and beast. Linnaeus
                    asserts that nine will kill a horse. MM. Huzard and Pelletier, on the other
                    hand, maintain that the horseleech, improperly so called, never attacks any
                    vertebrated animal whatever;<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    that these writers have mistaken their subject of observation, and have
                    described the black leech (his <hi rend="italic">Pseudobdeila nigra),</hi> which
                    is truly characterized by the jaws being nothing more than folds of toothless
                    skin, and may therefore be inferred to confine its attacks to the lower orders
                    of creation. We agree with Cuvier in thinking that the subject deserves a fresh
                    examination. In addition to the common species, Savigny describes three other

                    as a genus in Botany. (See <hi rend="italic">Mím. du Museum,</hi> t. x. p.
                    106.)</p></note> does not seem to differ from the preceding, except by an
                    enlargement near the position of the generative system. One species (<hi
                    rend="italic">Geob-della trochetii</hi> of Blainville) comes on shore in pursuit
                    of earth-worms. Another minor genus has been established by Μ. Moquin-Tandon,
                    under the name of <hi rend="smallcaps">Aulastoma.</hi> The jaws are represented
                    by numerous projecting folds. The eyes are ten in number. We may here also
                    mention Μ. Odier’s genus <hi rend="smallcaps">Branchiobdella,</hi> of which the
                    jaws are two in number, and the eyes wanting.<note anchored="true"

                <p>In all the preceding groups or genera of leeches, the anterior sucker is but
                    slightly distinguishable from the adjoining portion of the body; but in the two
                    following genera it is rendered more perceptible by a restriction, and is
                    composed of only a single segment. In the genus <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Haemocharis</hi> of Savigny, the eyes are eight in number, the body slender,
                    and indistinctly ringed. The species do not swim, but march after the manner of
                    the <hi rend="italic">surveyors</hi> or geometric caterpillars. They attach
                    themselves particularly to fishes. The genus <hi rend="smallcaps">Albione</hi>
                    of the same author differs from the preceding in its body being beset by
                    tubercles, and in possessing only six eyes. The species inhabit the sea. We may
                    mention as an example the <hi rend="italic">Hirudo muricata</hi> of Linn.</p>
                <p>The genus <hi rend="smallcaps">Branchellion</hi> of Sav. is distinguished by what
                    some regard as projecting branchiae. The epidermis is loose and ample, and seems
                    to enclose the animal as in a sack. The species are parasitical, and attach
                    themselves chiefly to fish of the torpedo kind. With the leeches, Cuvier also
                    places the genus <hi rend="smallcaps">Clepsīna,</hi> Sav., which is
                    characterized by a broadened body, possessing only a posterior sucker. The
                    anterior portion is a simple orifice, without any appearance of the usual disk.
                    (See Plate CCLXXVI. figs. 13 and 13 <hi rend="superscript"> α</hi>.) The species
                    make a near approach to the <hi rend="italic">Planar-ice,</hi> and the one
                    represented by the figure just referred, to was described and figured by Mr
                    Kirby, under the name of <hi rend="italic">Hirudo</hi><hi rend="italic"

                    allied to the preceding in their enlarged form and absence of the oral disk,
                    have been established by Oken and Blainville. Of these, however, we cannot give
                    account within our prescribed limits, and we shall therefore conclude the
                    present treatise by a short notice of the more distantly related.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Genus Gordius,</hi> Linn. Body filiform, smooth, or with
                    very slight transverse markings. Neither branchiae nor tentacula of any
                    kind.</p>
                <p>A well-known species of this genus (<hi rend="italic">G.</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >aquaticus,</hi> Linn.) is distinguished in this country by the name of the <hi

                    dwells in mud, which it perforates in all directions. The position of the genus
                    is variously regarded by different naturalists, and the extreme tenuity of form
                    in these creatures has probably opposed obstacles in the way of a precise
                    knowledge of their structure. The nervous system being composed of a ganglionic
                    cord, seems, however, a strong reason for placing them among the Annelides. We
                    follow the Baron Cuvier in so doing, although we are aware that Rudolphi and
                    Blainville combine them with the genus <hi rend="italic">Filaria,</hi> which
                    contains the noted Guinea worm <hi rend="italic">(F. Medinensis),</hi> and is
                    usually regarded as belonging to the intestinal class.<note anchored="true"

                    among the young and ignorant, that Gordii or hair-eels derive their origin from

                    probably a mare) is placed in water, it will ere long assume the form and fulfil
                    the functions of a Gordius,—in other words, will become animated. We once heard
                    this subject very gravely discussed in a company of poets and philosophers. The
                    writer of the preceding sketch maintained, perhaps more seriously than so absurd
