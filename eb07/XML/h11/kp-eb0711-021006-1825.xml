                <p><label type="entry">HELENA, <hi rend="smallcaps">St</hi></label>, an island in
                    the Atlantic Ocean, off the coast of Southern Africa. It belongs to no group of
                    islands, but stands entirely alone in the ocean, about twelve hundred miles from
                    larid. To the sea it presents, throughout its whole circumference, which is
                    twenty-eight miles, only an immense wall of perpendicular rock, from 600 to 1200
                    feet in height. Its general aspect is bleak and dreary, but on passing through
                    the wall of rock by one of the few openings which nature has left, the scene is
                    agreeably changed. Verdant and even beautiful patches of ground are interspersed
                    amongst the rocks; and on the summit is a fertile plain, consisting of about
                    1500 acres, covered with grass, and capable of every species of cultivation. The
                    loftiest eminence is called Diana’s Peak. It is situated nearly in the centre of
                    the island, and rises to the height of 2700 feet above the level of the sea. In
                    this, as in most of the African islands, the rocks consist chiefly of basalt.
                    Limestone of the best quality is also abundant, and various kinds of volcanic
                    rocks are scattered about the island in considerable quantities. There are only
                    four small openings in the rock, which, like a natural bulwark, surrounds St
                    Helena; and on the largest of these, where alone a little beach appears, James
                    Town has been built. It is entered by an arched gateway, within which is a
                    handsome parade, about one hundred feet square. Here are the governmenthouse and
                    the main guard-room. Within the former is the residence of the governor and the
                    public officers. The principal street in James Town contains about thirty
                    houses, most of which are neat and well built. The number of English families
                    upon the island amounts to between two and three hundred. St Helena is chiefly
                    of importance as a place of refreshment for vessels returning from the East
                    Indies. There is abundance of excellent water, and fresh provisions can be
                    obtained here, though they are neither so plentiful nor so cheap as those of the
                    Cape of Good Hope.</p>
                <p>St Helena was first discovered by the Portuguese in 1502, on St Helena’s day;
                    whence its name. They stocked it with different kinds of useful animals; but
                    whether they ever settled a colony on it or not is uncertain. The Portuguese
                    having either abandoned or never taken possession of it, the Dutch became its
                    masters, and kept possession of it till the year 1600, when they were driven out
                    by the English. In 1673 the Dutch retook it by surprise; but a short time
                    afterwards it was recovered by the brave Captain Munden, who also took three
                    Dutch East Indiamen then lying in the harbour. On this occasion the Hollanders
                    had fortified the landing place, of which there is only one on the island, and
                    erected batteries of great guns to prevent a descent; but the English having
                    knowledge of a small creek, where only two men abreast could creep up, climbed
                    to the top of the rock in the night, and appearing the next morning behind the
                    batteries, the Dutch were so terrified that they threw down their arms, and
                    surrendered at discretion. This creek has since been fortified, and a battery of
                    large cannon placed at the entrance; so that now the island is rendered
                    perfectly secure against all regular approaches or sudden attacks.</p>
                <p>St Helena has acquired no small celebrity as the place of confinement of Napoleon
                    Bonaparte, ex-emperor of France. The illustrious exile arrived there on the 17th
                    of October 1815, and remained in the island till his death, on the 5th of May
                    1821. He was buried in a retired spot not far from Longwood, the place of his
                    residence. Long. 5. 43. W. Lat. 15. 55. S.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Helena,</hi> the daughter of Leda (wife of Tyndareus, <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193641838" xml:id="kp-eb0711-1838-0211"/> king of Sparta),
                    and of Jupiter, who, being changed into a swan, had obtained the favours of the
                    queen. In consequence of this amour she produced two eggs, from one of which
                    sprang Castor and Clytemnestra (both mortal, as being children of Tyndareus),
                    and from the other Pollux and Helena, who were considered immortal, as the
                    offspring of Jupiter. (Clement. Alex. <hi rend="italic">Cohort,</hi> p. 26;
                    Pind. <hi rend="italic">Nem.</hi> X. 150.)</p>
                <p>From her infancy she possessed that dazzling beauty which became in the course of
                    time so fatal to her admirers. About the age of ten she was carried off by
                    Theseus, who concealed her at Aphidnae, in Attica, under the protection of his
                    mother Aethra. (Plut. <hi rend="italic">Thes.</hi> 31; Hygin. 79.) She was
                    rescued by her brothers, Castor and Pollux, who discovered her place of
                    concealment by means of Academus. They carried off at the same time Aethra, who
                    henceforth remained the captive slave of Helen. (Paus. X. 25.) This adventure
                    did not prevent her from being sought in marriage by all the young princes of
                    Greece. The most celebrated of her suitors were Menelaus, Diomede, Philoctetes,
                    Idomeneus, Merione, Amphilochus, Patroclus, the two Ajaxes, Teucer, Antilochus,
                    Ulysses, with others to the number of thirty. Her father, Tyndareus, was alarmed
                    at the number of her suitors, believing that the preference he showed to one
                    would bring on him the displeasure of all the rest. He was relieved from this
                    dilemma by Ulysses, on condition he should receive the hand of his niece
                    Penelope in marriage. His advice was to bind all the princes by an oath that
                    they would yield implicitly to the will of the princess, and that they would
                    unite to defend her if any attempt should be made to carry her off from the arms
                    of her husband. The rivals consented, and Helen decided in favour of Menelaus,
                    who thus became the heir apparent, and soon afterwards possessor, of the throne
                    of Sparta. By her he had a daughter Hermione, and two sons, Morrhaphius and
                    Diethus. (óc/zoZ. <hi rend="italic">II.</hi> Γ. 175; <hi rend="italic">Od.</hi>
                    Δ. 12; Apollodor. iii. 10, 7.)</p>
                <p>Venus had promised to Paris the possession of the most beautiful of women. At her
                    instigation, he proceeded to Sparta during the absence of Menelaus, and
                    succeeded in gaining the affections of Helen, and in inducing her to quit her
                    husband and her country. It was in vain that Menelaus sent to Troy to demand
                    back his wife, in vain that the sons of Atreus threatened that all Greece would
                    march against Troy. During the celebrated Trojan war she remained faithful to
                    Paris, and had by him Bunichus, Agane, Idaeus, and Corythus. On the death of
                    Paris she married Deiphobus, the bravest of the sons of Priam after Hector; and
                    on the taking of Troy, she is said to have betrayed him in order that she might
                    ingratiate herself with Menelaus. It appears that Menelaus forgave her, and that
                    they proceeded on their way to Sparta, where, according to some, they did not
                    arrive till the space of eight years had elapsed. Here they received the visit
                    of Telemachus, who had been sent by his mother in search of his father Ulysses.
                    And here the legend of Homer ends. According to Euripides, she was killed by
                    Orestes, her son-in-law, or she was banished by her step-sons, Megapenthes and
                    Ni-costratus, when she retired to the island of Rhodes, where she was suffocated
                    in a bath. <hi rend="italic">{Paus.</hi> iii. 19.)</p>
                <p>According to one tradition, Helen never visited Troy, but was detained in Egypt
                    by King Proteus during the whole period of the siege. Here Menelaus being driven
                    on shore by a storm, found her. (Herodot. ii. 112, <hi rend="italic">et</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">seqq.}</hi> She had a temple at Therapne (vi. 61).</p>
