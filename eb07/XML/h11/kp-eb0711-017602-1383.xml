                <p><label type="entry">HAYDN, <hi rend="smallcaps">Francis Joseph</hi></label>, a
                    celebrated musical composer, was born.at Rohrau, a small town fifteen leagues
                    distant from Vienna, in the year 1732. His father was a cartwright, and his
                    mother, before her marriage, had been cook in the family of Count Harrach, the
                    lord of the village. Haydn’s father had a fine tenor voice, and played a little
                    on the harp. On holidays, after church, he used to accompany his wife whilst she
                    sung; and, when only five years old, Haydn was wont to stand by his parents, and
                    join the concert in his own way, with two pieces of wood, one of which served
                    for a violin, and the other for a bow. When loaded with years and honours, the
                    great symphonist would often recall the music of this domestic performance; so
                    deep an impression had its simple strains made on his soul. A cousin of the
                    cart-wright, whose name was Frank, a schoolmaster at Haimburg, came to Rohran
                    one Sunday, and assisted at the <hi rend="italic">trio.</hi> He remarked that
                    the child, then scarcely six years old, beat the time with astonishing exactness
                    and precision. This Frank was well acquainted with music, and proposed to his
                    relations to take little Joseph to his house, and teach him. They accepted the
                    offer with joy, hoping to succeed more easily in getting Joseph into holy
                    orders, if he should understand music. Chance brought to Frank’s house Reuter,
                    <hi rend="italic">maestro di capella of</hi> St Stephen’s, the cathedral church
                    of Vienna. He was in quest of children to recruit his choir. The schoolmaster
                    soon proposed his little relation to him; and when he came Reuter gave him a <hi
                    rend="italic">canon</hi> to sing at sight. The precision, purity of time, and
                    spirit with which the child executed it, surprised him; but he was more
                    especially charmed with his voice, which was naturally sonorous and delicate. He
                    only remarked that he did not shake, and asked him the reason with a smile. The
                    boy smartly replied, “How should you expect me to shake, when my cousin does not
                    know how to do it himself ?” “Come here,” said Reuter, “and I will teach you.”
                    He then took him between his knees, showed him how he should rapidly bring
                    together two notes, hold his breath, and agitate the palate. The child
                    immediately made a good shake. Reuter, enchanted with the success of his
                    scholar, took a plate of fine cherries, which Frank had ordered for his
                    illustrious brother professor, and emptied them all into the child’s pocket. The
                    delight of the young musician may be readily conceived. Haydn often mentioned
                    this anecdote, adding with a smile, that he fancied he had these beautiful
                    cherries in his mouth whenever he happened to shake.</p>
                <p>Young Haydn was now placed in the hands of Reuter, and accompanied him to Vienna.
                    Haydn, in afterwards speaking of his studies under this master, said he did not
                    remember to have passed a single day without practising sixteen or eighteen
                    hours daily, and this he did of his own accord, for the. children of the choir
                    were not compelled to practise more than two hours. It was by this unwearied
                    assiduity, aided by the inspirations of his genius, that Haydn, almost in the
                    dawn of life, laid the foundation of his future eminence.</p>
                <p>Mozart at twelve years of age composed a successful opera; but, less fortunate,
                    Haydn, at thirteen, produced a mass, which his worthy master ridiculed.
                    Convinced, after comparing his work with the compositions of others, that Reuter
                    was right, and that nature without art was like an eagle unfledged, Haydn
                    resolved to apply himself to the study of counterpoint. But Reuter did not teach
                    composition; and none of the masters in Vienna were so generous as to instruct
                    an unknown and unpatronised boy. But to this misfortune Haydn perhaps is
                    indebted for his originality. Under a master he might have avoided some of the
                    errors he has fallen into when he subsequently wrote for the church and for the
                    theatre; but, upon the whole, he would certainly have been less original. He
                    purchased the theoretical works of Mattheson, Fux, Emanuel Bach, and Kirberg,
                    which he studied most assiduously, labouring alone, and exercising every
                    scientific intricacy; and so great was the pleasure he experienced in his
                    pursuits, that, poor as he was, shivering with cold, and oppressed with sleep,
                    seated by the side of an old worn out harpsichord, he declared himself never to
                    have been happier at any period of his life.</p>
                <p>At eighteen Haydn’s voice broke, and he left the class of <hi rend="italic"
                    >soprani</hi> at St Stephen’s. Obliged to seek for a lodging, chance threw him
                    in the way of a poor peruke-maker named Keller, who received him as a son.
                    Haydn, in the quiet obscurity of his new dwelling, was enabled to pursue his
                    studies without interruption. His residence here had, however, a fatal influence
                    on his future fortune. Keller had two daughters, and his wife and he arranged
                    that one of them should marry Haydn, who, absorbed in his studies and thinking
                    little about love, made no objection to the proposal. He adhered to his
                    engagement honourably in after life, but the union was an unhappy one.</p>
                <p>Haydn now began to compose short sonatas for the piano-forte, which he sold at
                    low prices to his few female pupils. He also wrote <hi rend="italic"
                    >minuets,</hi><hi rend="italic">allemands,</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >waltzes</hi> foi the <hi rend="italic">Ridotto.</hi> By performing in concert
                    with two of his friends a sererada in the streets, he attracted the attention of
                    Curtz, the director of the theatre of Carinthia, who employed him to, write
                    music, which was performed with the happiest success. But Haydn’s talent was not
                    for the stage, and he chose his own proper ground when in his twentieth year,
                    and produced six trios, which, from theiι striking originality, at once brought
                    him into notice. Shortly after this he published his first quartett, which ever)
                    musical amateur soon had by heart. Leaving the house of Keller, Haydn went to
                    lodge with Martinez, and became acquainted with Metastasio the poet, who taught
                    him Italian, and instructed him in the fine arts.</p>
                <p>Haydn struggled long against want, but at last his genius brought him into
                    notice, and he received employmenl from Prince Antony Esterhazy, and bris
                    successor Nicholas, for whom Haydn composed a number of pieces for the baryton,
                    an instrument now scarcely ever used. Haydn did not forget his promise to his
                    benefactor Keller; and being now in better circumstances, he married hisdaughter
                    Ann, from whom he afterwards separated, on account of her bad temper and
                    conduct.</p>
                <p>Placed now at the head of a full and excellent orchestra, and attached to the
                    service of a rich patron, Haydn found himself in that happy union of
                    circumstances which gives opportunity to genius to display all its powers. From
                    this moment his life was uniform and fully employed. He rose early in the
                    morning, dressed himself very neatly, and placed himself at a small table by the
                    side of his pianoforte, where the hour of dinner usually found him still seated.
                    In the evening he went to rehearsals, or to the open which was performed in the
                    prince’s palace four times every week. Sometimes, but not often, he devoted <hi
                    rend="italic">s</hi> morning to hunting. The little time he had to spare on
                    common days was divided between his friends and Mademoiselle Boselli, a singer
                    of eminence. Such was the course of his life, for more than thirty years; and
                    this car alone account for the prodigious number of his productions in
                    instrumental music, church music, and operas. In fift; <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193641396" xml:id="kp-eb0711-1396-0177"/>years he produced no less
                    than five hundred and twenty- ʹ seven instrumental compositions, and in the
                    whole of these pieces he has never copied or imitated himself, but when it was
                    his intention to do so.</p>
                <p>Haydn wrote his best music with some labour, not from any want of ideas, but from
                    the extreme delicacy of his taste, which he could with difficulty satisfy. A
                    symphony would sometimes cost him a month,anda mass perhaps two. His manuscripts
                    of one piece sometimes contain passages enough for three or four pieces. But
                    although it seemed labour, it was not so; for he was wont to say that he never
                    felt so happy as when at work. Nothing troubled him till the death of his patron
                    Prince Nicholas, in the year 1789, and the subsequent demise of his favourite
                    Boselli; circumstances which induced him to come to England, upon the
                    solicitations of Salomon. This musician was about to give concerts in London,
                    and offered Haydn fifty pounds for each performance, which terms he accepted.
                    Haydn was then fifty-nine years old, and he resided in England upwards of a
                    year, and brought out there some of his finest instrumental pieces.</p>
                <p>From England Haydn went to Germany, but he returned for a short time in 1794. He
                    was honoured with the diploma of doctor of music by Oxford. He afterwards went
                    to Austria, and did not return again to England. He was in his sixtieth year
                    when he commenced his <hi rend="italic">Creation,</hi> to which he devoted two
                    years. When urged to hasten its completion, he calmly said, he had been a long
                    time about it, because he intended it to last <hi rend="italic">a</hi> long
                    time. It was finished in 1798, and performed in Vienna with enthusiastic
                    approbation. All Germany rang with its praises; in a few weeks it was printed,
                    and spread over Europe with a rapidity before unheard of. Two years after, he
                    composed his oratorio of the <hi rend="italic">Four Seasons,</hi> of which Haydn
                    used to say, “It is not another <hi rend="italic">Creation,</hi> and the reason
                    is this: in that oratorio the actors are angels, in the <hi rend="italic">Four
                    Seasons</hi> they are peasants.” This work terminated his musical career; the
                    labour of it exhausted him, and he complained that he was forced to seek ideas
                    which used to come to him formerly unsought. He wrote, however, subsequently a
                    few quartetts, and arranged nearly three hundred Scotch songs, which produced
                    him about six hundred guineas. At last he grew so weak, that a vertigo seized
                    him the moment he sat down to the piano. He now seldom quitted his house and
                    garden at Grumpendorff, and he became feeble in mind and body. On the morning of
                    the 31st of May 1809 he died, aged seventy-eight years and two months. He was
                    privately interred at Grumpendorff; for Vienna was at that time in the
                    occupation of the French. Haydn’s heir was a blacksmith, to whom he left the
                    bulk of his fortune. His manuscripts were purchased by Prince Esterhazy. He left
                    no posterity. Cherubini, Pleyel, New-komm, and Weigh, may be considered as his
                    disciples.</p>
                <p>Haydn, in his symphonies, stands first in the list of the greatest instrumental
                    authors. In sacred music he opened a new path, by which he placed himself on a
                    level with the most celebrated composers for the church. In theatrical music he
                    was least successful. In that department he was only an imitator. His
                    instrumental music consists of chamber symphonies for a greater or less number
                    of instruments, and of symphonies for a full orchestra. The first of these
                    divisions comprehends duets, trios, quartetts, sestetts, octetts, and
                    divertimentos; sonatas, the <hi rend="italic">fantasie,</hi> variations, and <hi
                    rend="italic">capricci.</hi> In the second are contained the symphonies for the
                    grand orchestra, concertos for different instruments, serenades, and
                    marches.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">allegros</hi> of his symphonies are in general full of life
                    and spirit. They generally begin with a short, easy, and intelligible theme.
                    Gradually, and by a procedure full of genius, this theme, repeated by the
                    different instruments, acquires a character of mingled heroism and gaiety. There
                    is more variety in the slow movements; in these the lofty style is majestically
                    displayed. The phrases or musical ideas in his <hi rend="italic">andantes</hi>
                    and <hi rend="italic">adagios</hi> are finely and nobly developed. Sometimes the
                    composer is carried away by his copiousness and power; but this excess of vigour
                    does not exclude passion and sentiment. His <hi rend="italic">minuets are</hi>
                    admirable, being rich in harmony and accumulated beauties. The general character
                    of Haydn’s instrumental music is that of romantic imagination. “Haydn,” says
                    Carpani, “è l’Ariosto della musica. Passeggia il suo genio per tutte le regioni
                    dell’ arte. La sua immaginazione âpre i tesori d’ogni bellezza, e ne dispone a
                    sua voglia.” As a composer of symphonies and quartetts, he may be considered as
                    the first who moulded them into that form which Mozart, Beethoven, and others,
                    have adopted. The famous seven instrumental pieces, called <hi rend="italic">Die
                    Sieben</hi><hi rend="italic">Worte</hi><hi rend="italic">des Heylandes
                    am</hi><hi rend="italic">Kreuze,</hi> were esteemed by the composer as his best
                    works.</p>
                <p>The oratorio of the <hi rend="italic">Creation</hi> is replete with grandeur,
                    sublimity, and beauty. The <hi rend="italic">Seasons,</hi> with less sentiment
                    and learning than the <hi rend="italic">Creation,</hi> is equally admirable as
                    an expressive and delightful composition. The ideal part of Haydn’s masses is
                    brilliant and dignified: the style is noble and full of fire. His <hi
                    rend="italic">Agnus Dei</hi> is full of tenderness; the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Amens</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Hallelujahs</hi> breathe all the reality of
                    joy; the fugues display all the exultation of an enraptured mind. <hi
                    rend="italic">(Le</hi><hi rend="italic">Haydine</hi> de Carpani.) (z. z.)</p>
