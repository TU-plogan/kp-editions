                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">The</hi> term <hi rend="smallcaps">Heat,</hi> in common
                    language, is applied both , to the sensation excited in us by the approximation
                    of a warm body, and to the cause of that sensation. To obviate this ambiguity,
                    chemists and other cultivators of physical science have employed the word <hi
                    rend="italic">caloric</hi> to designate the cause of heat; but as there are few
                    disquisitions in which this distinction is material to perspicuity, in this
                    article we shall use either term to signify the cause of the sensation.</p>
                <p>SECT. ï. NATURE OF HEAT.</p>
                <p>One of the first inquiries that suggests itself is, what is <hi rend="italic"
                    >caloric</hi><hi rend="italic">?</hi> Two opinions on this subject have divided
                    philosophers. The most generally received opinion is, that heat, or caloric, is
                    a material agent of a peculiar nature, highly attenuated, and, from its affinity
                    or attraction for all other matter, universally distributed amongst the
                    particles of bodies, in quantities proportional to their mutual attractions, or,
                    as it has been termed, the <hi rend="italic">capacities</hi> of different
                    substances for heat; whilst its tendency to diffuse itself amongst contiguous
                    bodies has been explained on the supposition of its own particles being
                    repellent of each other. The other opinion, which has been maintained by Bacon,
                    Boyle, and several other philosophers, considers heat as a mere quality of
                    matter, and ascribes it to a vibratory movement among the intimate particles of
                    bodies; an idea which was adopted by Rumford, to explain his curious experiments
                    on the excitation and communication of heat by friction. This opinion, however,
                    seems vague and unsatisfactory. If we say that heat is motion amongst the
                    particles of matter, still we have no explanation of the manner in which this
                    motion is produced; for we cannot conceive any movement without an impulse, nor
                    an impulse without a material agent. Heat pervades all sorts of matter: it
                    remains in some circumstances dormant, or, as it is termed, <hi rend="italic"
                    >latent,</hi> and may be again elicited from bodies by various means. Did it
                    consist in vibrations or motions of the particles of other matter, it should
                    pervade elastic bodies with the greatest celerity; which we know not to be the
                    fact. It will, for instance, pervade a rod of lead, or of the softest copper,
                    far more readily than an equal length of glass or of marble. If we mingle
                    together equal quantities of water at different temperatures, the resulting
                    temperature will be an exact mean between the extremes. But if heat consisted in
                    such vibrations, there ought to have been a loss of heat, as in all other
                    communicated motions. If we mix together equal quantities of different
                    substances at different temperatures, the resultant temperature is not a mean:
                    one body has lost more heat than the other has appeared to gain, or a part of
                    the heat of the one has become latent in the other, and that in a constant ratio
                    to the power of each substance of absorbing heat, as tried by comparing each
                    with a third body in the same manner. It is very difficult to conceive this
                    species of interchange, if heat merely consisted in vibrations amongst the
                    particles of matter. Still more difficult is it to conceive how a permanent
                    temperature could subsist among a great system of bodies, as the planets, if
                    heat were nothing more than a vibration of the particles of bodies; for the
                    original impulse ought to diminish with each communication.</p>
                <p>It is possible, however, to modify this theory, by supposing that heat is
                    produced not merely by the motions of the particles of the heated substance, but
                    by the vibrations or undulations of a very subtile matter existing in all
                    bodies. This will approximate the vibratory theory to that which has been
                    generally considered as its antagonist, will accord 1 well with some recently
                    discovered facts, and will assimilate the vibratory hypothesis of heat to the
                    undulations ' now so generally received as explanatory of the phenomena of
                    light, to which heat has so intimate a relation.</p>
                <p>Caloric, like light, has been proved to be capable of radiation, of reflection,
                    and refraction, whilst recent investigations have distinctly proved that
                    refracted heat is susceptible of polarisation. But it is transmitted, reflected,
                    refracted, and polarised by different substances in a different manner and
                    degree from light; and hence some have inferred that light and heat are not the
                    same agent, but are produced by different kinds of matter. Other philosophers
                    have regarded them as modifications of the same matter, depending on the greater
                    celerity or velocity of the undulations that produce them. Such speculations,
                    however, are not yet susceptible of any direct proof; and, in the present state
                    of our knowledge, it is safer to consider light and heat as produced by
                    different but intimately connected agents.</p>
                <p>These views lead us to the conclusion that the phenomena of caloric are owing to
                    the movements of a subtile matter, universally diffused throughout other bodies,
                    the particles of which are strongly repellent of each other, and have an
                    affinity for those of all other bodies, differing in force according to each
                    kind of matter. We may further conceive, that heat or caloric is the cause why
                    the particles of the most solid bodies are not in absolute contact. If we
                    diminish the temperature of a bar of iron, for instance, it shrinks in all its
                    dimensions, z. e. its particles approximate; and the more we reduce the
                    temperature, the nearer they approach. Each particle of matter would seem to be
                    surrounded with an atmosphere of heat, which remains <hi rend="italic"
                    >latent</hi> or quiescent, until disturbed by the approach of bodies of a
                    different temperature, when the vibrations or undulations of the subtile matter
                    of heat are induced, by the tendency of this matter to produce an equilibrium of
                    temperature; and then we become sensible of the existence of heat.</p>
                <p>The subtilty of the matter of heat is such, that we cannot ascertain its
                    accumulation in any body by the nicest balance; its fluidity may be considered
                    as proved by the ease with which it insinuates itself amongst the particles of
                    matter; its affinity for other matter is shown by its being universally
                    contained in all bodies, in proportions differing in each kind of substance; its
                    repulsion amongst its own particles is proved by its tendency to exist in a
                    state of equilibrium in contiguous bodies.</p>
                <p>Our knowledge of the laws which regulate the distribution of caloric was very
                    imperfect when we possessed no other measure of heat than our sensations. The
                    susceptibility of the sense of touch varies in different individuals, and in the
                    same individual at different times. We can even make the same object feel warm
                    and cold to the same person, by previously cooling one hand, whilst the other is
                    immersed in a warm fluid. Hence sensation could never afford any tolerable
                    measure of varying degrees of heat; and we are indebted for more accurate
                    notions on the subject to the invention of <hi rend="italic">thermometers.</hi>
                    The principle of these instruments depends on the expansion of solids, fluids,
                    or gaseous bodies by heat, and their subsequent contraction on cooling. The
                    construction of these useful instruments will be described under the article <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Thermometer.</hi> It will be here sufficient to state, that
                    though the thermometer affords us indications of the changes in the sensible
                    heat of bodies, it does not give us any information respecting their latent
                    caloric, nor the absolute quantity of heat <pb break="no" facs="nls:193641448"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0711-1448-0181"/>they may contain. This mustbe sought for by other
                    modes, which we shall shortly explain, after we have considered the modes in
                    which caloric is diffused amongst bodies, and its general effects on different
                    kinds of matter.</p>
                <p>SECT. II. DIFFUSION OF HEAT.</p>
                <p>The tendency of heat to diffuse itself equally amongst bodies is so great, that
                    we are unable permanently to accumulate it in any substance. All that can be
                    effected in this way by the most skilful contrivances, is to produce some
                    retardation of this dissipation. The mode in which it is diffused through
                    solids, liquids, and gases, is different, and demands a separate
                    consideration.</p>
                <p>I. <hi rend="italic">Diffusion of Heat by Communication.</hi></p>
                <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Diffusion in Solids.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> When we
                    place a heated solid in contact with a colder body, the superabundant caloric of
                    the first immediately begins to flow into the latter. The nearest particles are
                    first heated, and they communicate a portion of their caloric to the second
                    series, and these last to a third, until both bodies acquire a common
                    temperature; and this equilibrium will be established amongst all contiguous
                    bodies. If a bar of iron twenty inches long be heated at one end, it will
                    require four minutes for the smallest sensible increase of temperature to be
                    perceived at the other. Biot has endeavoured to ascertain the rate of this
                    transmission. He employed a bar of iron several feet in length, and bent into a
                    right angle, at one end of which a steady heat of 216° Fahrenheit was applied.
                    Thermometers were placed in holes drilled for the purpose, at intervals of four
                    inches along the top of the bar. In four hours all the thermometers became
                    stationary, the difference between the first and second = 21° ∙50; between the
                    second and third, = 11° ∙25; between the third and fourth, = 7° ∙25; between the
                    fourth and fifth, = 5°; between the fifth and sixth, = 4°; between the sixth and
                    seventh (beyond which no sensible effect was perceptible), = 1° ∙75; which,
                    allowing for the unavoidable errors in such investigations, would show, that,
                    taking the distances in arithmetical progression, the decrease of temperature
                    follows a geometrical ratio in penetrating solids. In such cases, the heat seems
                    to be communicated from particle to particle, and is said to be <hi
                    rend="italic">conducted</hi> through the body.</p>
                <p>All bodies do not <hi rend="italic">conduct</hi> heat with equal celerity. If we
                    place equal thermometers on equal cubes of metal, ivory, marble, and glass,
                    heated by the same source, we shall find that the thermometer placed on the
                    metal will rise soonest; next, that placed on the marble, then those on the
                    ivory and the glass. The most dense bodies conduct heat, in general, more
                    readily than rarer bodies; but experiment shows that their conducting power is
                    not always in the ratio of their density, but probably depends also on their
                    affinity for caloric. Spongy and light bodies are found to be extremely bad
                    conductors of caloric. Silk, cotton, and wool, are especially so; and hence
                    their utility in preserving our animal heat in cold climates. Count Rumford made
                    a series of experiments on the conducting power of different substances of this
                    nature, and found that raw silk, fur, and eider-down, were remarkably bad
                    conductors of heat. They give to us the sensation of warmth, not by
                    communicating heat to our surface, but because their bad conducting power
                    prevents the waste of our animal heat by the ambient air. Their stopping the
                    transmission of heat seems partly to depend on the air they entangle; for, by
                    twisting them, <hi rend="italic">i. e.</hi> by expelling a portion of the air
                    contained in such bodies, their conducting power is increased,</p>
                <p>The facility with which bodies conduct heat is not exactly in proportion to any
                    of their sensible qualities, but is more nearly in the direct ratio of their
                    density than any other quality. This may be ascribed to the greater intensity of
                    the repulsive energy of the atmospheres of caloric surrounding each particle of
                    dense bodies (by reason of their greater proximity) conveying each fresh
                    addition of temperature with greater celerity through such substances. But if we
                    conceive “heat to be a material agent,” this quickness of conducting power may
                    also be modified by the different degrees of affinity between caloric and each
                    kind of matter. However this may be, scarcely any two substances conduct heat
                    with equal facility. Solids conduct much more readily than liquids. Of the
                    former, the best conductors are the metals; and amongst these, the very best are
                    gold, silver, platinum, and copper, whilst iron and lead are among the worst.
                    The rapidity with which silver conducts away heat is well illustrated by
                    wrapping a piece of muslin smoothly round a spoon of that metal, when the muslin
                    may be held in the flame of a candle or a lamp, so as to boil water in the
                    spoon, without burning the muslin.</p>

                <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Diffusion in Liquids.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> The
                    extreme slowness with which liquids conduct heat is shown by a beautiful
                    experiment of Count Rumford. Freeze a little water in the bottom of a tube, and
                    then pour water over the ice: by inclining the tube, the flame of a lamp may be
                    applied to the surface of the liquid, so as to cause it to boil; and by slowly
                    moving the flame towards the ice, we may raise the water to ebullition in
                    successive portions; yet this ebullition will almost reach the ice before it
                    shows any signs of melting. The same fact is exhibited by fixing an air
                    thermometer in a vessel filled with water to one or two tenths of an inch above
                    the ball of the thermometer, and pouring a little aether on the surface of the
                    water. On kindling the aether, it will burn with a copious flame, without
                    affecting in the slightest degree the submersed thermometer. This extreme
                    slowness of liquids in conducting heat induced Count Rumford to suppose that
                    they were absolute nonconductors of caloric; but this inference is not warranted
                    by his own experiments, and was fully refuted by the investigations of Hope,
                    Murray, and Traill, which proved, that though liquids conduct heat slowly <hi
                    rend="italic">downwards,</hi> they are not absolute <hi rend="italic"
                    >non-conductors</hi> of caloric.</p>
                <p>If, however, we apply heat to the lower part of a vessel containing any liquid,
                    it rapidly acquires a higher temperature. This, however, is in a different
                    manner from <hi rend="italic">conduction.</hi> The liquid is heated by the <hi
                    rend="italic">transportation</hi> of its particles in quick succession. In this
                    case the particles nearest the heating cause become specifically lighter by
                    receiving heat; they therefore ascend through the fluid, to which they impart
                    part of their caloric, while their place is supplied by another series of
                    particles, which become heated, and ascend in their turn; and this succession
                    continues until, by these rapid changes, the whole body of the fluid attains its
                    boiling point, if the heat be sufficient for that purpose. These motions may be
                    rendered visible by throwing into the vessel a few particles of matter a little
                    heavier than water, such as powdered amber.</p>
                <p>It is by this transportation of their particles that liquids are principally
                    heated; and the rapidity with which a piece of ice melts when it floats in ajar
                    containing hot water, compared<pb break="no" facs="nls:193641461"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0711-1461-0182"/> to the extreme slowness of the melting of a
                    similar mass of ice fixed in the bottom of a jar, and defended from the
                    immediate contact of the hot water by a thin film of ice-cold water, exhibits,
                    in a striking manner, the difference between the heating of fluids by <hi
                    rend="italic">transportation</hi> and by <hi rend="italic">conduction.</hi></p>
                <p>3. <hi rend="italic">Diffusion in Gases</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> The
                    conducting power of gases is not so easily ascertained, because it is difficult
                    to separate their conducting power from the effect of radiation of heat through
                    them. The experiments of Professor Sir John Leslie and of Dr Dalton, however,
                    decidedly show a difference in the conducting power of gases, which is also more
                    nearly in the direct ratio of their specific gravity than of their other
                    properties; hydrogen having the lowest conducting power, atmospheric air one
                    considerably higher, and carbonic acid the greatest of all the gases subjected
                    to this examination.</p>
                <p>The difference of bodies in conducting heat is a most important subject, as on it
                    depends not only many of our contrivances to concentrate artificial heat, and
                    apply it to numerous purposes in the useful arts, as the obtaining of metals
                    from their ores; but on it also depend the methods of defending our bodies
                    against external cold. The living system has within itself the power of
                    supporting a nearly equable temperature, notwithstanding the perpetual tendency
                    of contiguous bodies to a common temperature; but if the naked surface be
                    exposed to the elements in our climate, the heat of the body would soon be
                    reduced below what is consistent with health or comfort. To preserve the animal
                    heat, we surround our bodies with bad conductors of caloric, such as woollen,
                    silk, or cotton; and the more imperfectly these defences conduct heat, the less
                    will our temperature be reduced. Hence the worst conducting substances are the
                    most suitable garments for a cold climate; and, in hot latitudes, the comfort of
                    man requires that the coverings of his body should be of the kind that would
                    most rapidly abstract his redundant animal heat.</p>
                <p>Nature has beautifully adapted the covering of the lower animals to the climates
                    they inhabit. The thick fur of the Greenland bear, the musk ox, and the arctic
                    hare, adapts them to the rigours of their native climate; whilst the short and
                    sleek hair of the antelope, the giraffe, the leopard, and the lion, proclaims
                    them denizens of the warmer regions of the earth. Even in the same species
                    inhabiting a changeable climate, nature adapts their covering to the season. The
                    glossy sleekness of the horse, and of our domestic cattle, diminishes toward the
                    close of autumn. The bear, the fox, and the weasels of northern regions, assume
                    a longer and more shaggy coat on the approach of winter; and the sheep, which in
                    Europe is covered with a thick fine wool, an extremely bad conductor of heat, in
                    the burning plains of Africa is clothed only by a short and coarse hair, that
                    presents comparatively a “mall obstacle to the evolution of animal heat.</p>
                <p>In the vegetable kingdom a similar care is bestowed to defend plants from
                    excessive cold. Plants of cold climates, which are perennial, are protected by a
                    considerable thickness of bark; a substance which experiment proves to be a bad
                    conductor of heat. In high latitudes they are further defended against the
                    excessive cold of the climate by a spongy covering of snow, which, until it
                    begin to melt, is found to be a very bad conductor of heat; and therefore tends
                    to preserve the juices of plants from being frozen. Thus trees are more seldom
                    killed by the freezing of their sap, when a fall of snow has preceded an intense
                    frost; an accident not uncommon, even in the temperate climates of the earth, in
                    a long continuance of what is termed a <hi rend="italic">black frost.</hi>
                    Recent voyages of discovery have also shown that the Esquimaux find the
                    excessive rigour of their inhospitable climate very endurable in houses built
                    of'frozen snow.</p>
                <p>II. <hi rend="italic">Diffusion of Heat by Radiation.</hi></p>
                <p>The diffusion of heat by the means already noticed is a <hi rend="superscript">
                    v</hi> comparatively slow process, and is limited to bodies in contact with each
                    other. But heat is capable of being diffused among bodies not in contact. A
                    heated body suspended <hi rend="italic">in vacuo</hi> emits its excess of heat
                    in all directions; and in air, though much of its caloric apparently passes off
                    with the ascending currents which it produces in the ambient air, the emanations
                    of heat also pass off in directions contrary to these aerial currents. Thus a
                    person standing before a fire perceives its warmth, though a light body like a
                    feather will show that there is a current of air perpetually flowing toward the
                    fire. This emission of heat is termed <hi rend="italic">radiation,</hi> and is
                    analogous to the emanations of light from a luminous object; each point of the
                    heated surface emitting divergent rays, which are subject to the same
                    modifications as those of light, by reflection from polished surfaces, and by
                    refraction through transparent media.</p>
                <p>When the rays of heat fall on a bright metallic surface, they are* <hi
                    rend="italic">reflected.</hi> As early as 1682, Mariotte showed that “the heat
                    of a fire is reflected from a burning mirror, so as to be sensible in its focus;
                    but that it is intercepted by a plate of glass interposed between the mirror and
                    the fire.” The next important step was made by Lambert, who discovered that the
                    heat might be so increased, by employing two concave mirrors, and a charcoal
                    fire placed in the focus of the one, that a combustible might be kindled in the
                    focus of the other. But the most successful cultivator of this branch of science
                    during the last century was Scheele of Sweden, who proved that metallic surfaces
                    are the most powerful reflectors of radiant caloric; that glass is far inferior
                    in this respect; that if we cover the surface of the metallic mirror with a film
                    of lamp-black, it does not reflect heat, but actually absorbs it; that radiant
                    heat is separated from light by interposing screens of glass; and that it passes
                    through air, without suffering any obstruction from the direction of the aerial
                    currents through which it radiates.</p>
                <p>Saussure and Pictet repeated the experiments of Lambert. They showed the
                    instantaneous transmission of heat by radiation; that it was in such experiments
                    material to place the heated body and the thermometer in the focus of each
                    mirror; and that, a very little beyond the focus, the effect was trifling,
                    although the thermometer was nearer the heated body. When the heated body was a
                    red-hot cannon bullet, combustibles were speedily kindled in the focus of the
                    other mirror at the distance of several feet. These researches were greatly
                    extended by Pictet, who showed that a flask of hot water radiated heat which
                    could be concentrated in the focus of a metallic mirror, and thus rendered
                    sensible by a thermometer, showing that the invisible rays of heat might be
                    reflected, as well as those emanated from a hot luminous body.</p>
                <p>The experiments on radiant heat may be exhibited by means of a pair of concave
                    mirrors of well-polished tinned iron, hammered into segments of spheres of about
                    one foot in diameter; but still better with mirrors of thick brass plate,
                    hammered, on Sir John Leslie’s plan, into a parabolic form. The writer of this
                    possesses a pair twenty-two inches in diameter, hammered into a parabolic curve
                    with surprising accuracy, by Mr Alexander Kilpatrick of Edinburgh, with which he
                    has repeatedly melted lead by collecting the sun’s rays in one of them. This
                    form of mirror is the best; because the rays which fall on the mirror parallel
                    to its axis are reflected, not divergingly, but so as to meet in the focus of
                    the parabola.</p>
                <p>Pictet found the sensibility of the thermometer much increased by painting its
                    ball black; and he showed that glass screens intercepted the rays of caloric
                    from burning bodies or a heated bullet; but it was found that the ra<pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193641474" xml:id="kp-eb0711-1474-0183"/>diant heat in the
                    sun’s rays was not intercepted by a plate of glass, or even by a sheet of tin,
                    which completely intercepts heat derived from other luminous bodies.</p>
                <p>Such was the state of our knowledge of radiant heat, when our veteran astronomer,
                    Sir William Herschel, discovered, toward the close of the last century, that
                    rays of heat exist, independently of those of light, in the solar spectrum. When
                    he received the solar rays through a prism of flint-glass, he found that a row
                    of delicate thermometers placed in the coloured spectrum were differently
                    affected at its two extremities. In the violet ray it only rose 2°, in the red
                    ray it rose 7°; but his most interesting discovery was, that half an inch beyond
                    the red ray it was still hotter. These very important results were fully
                    confirmed by Sir Henry Englefield. In one of Englefield’s experiments, the
                    following results were obtained :—In the blue rays, in 3' the thermometer rose
                    2°; in the green, in 3' it = 4°; in the yellow, in S' it = 6°; in the middle of
                    the red, in 2'∙5 it = 16°; in the outer edge of the red, in 2'∙5 it = 17° ∙5;
                    and beyond the spectrum, in 2'∙5 it = 18°. When the bulbs of the thermometers
                    were previously blacked, the full red ray raised the thermometer in three
                    minutes 22°; and jnst beyond the spectrum it rose 33°. Even half an inch beyond
                    the spectrum altogether, the rise was 6° more than in the red ray.</p>
                <p>These experiments show that the refrangibility of the rays of heat and light are
                    different, and that the former are less refrangible than the latter.</p>
                <p>The experiments of Berard and of Leslie confirmed the fact, that the point of
                    greatest heat in the solar spectrum is in the red rays; and Leslie states the
                    result of his experiments to have made the difference between the violet and red
                    as one to sixteen; but neither of these philosophers detected any heat
                    altogether beyond the spectrum. The conclusions of Herschel have, however, been
                    confirmed by more recent investigations; and Śeebeck has shown that prisms of
                    different substances produce a different refraction of the rays of heat. With a
                    hollow prism filled with water, the greatest heat is in the full yellow light;
                    with sulphuric acid it is in the orange; with crown glass it is in the dark
                    limit of the red.</p>
                <p>We may here state, that not long after Herschel’s discovery, Ritter, Wollaston,
                    and Beckmann, simultaneously discovered the existence of other invisible rays in
                    the solar spectrum, which are only known by their chemical effects in
                    decomposing some metallic saline compounds, aš the nitrate of silver. These <hi
                    rend="italic">chemical rays</hi> are the most refrangible of all, and exist in
                    greatest abundance toward the violet end of the spectrum, and even entirely
                    beyond it. Thus the solar spectrum would seem to consist of three species of
                    rays, the luminous, the calorific, and the chemical; all differing in their
                    refrangibility, and in their apparent effects: and if we consider white light as
                    composed of red, yellow, and blue rays, we have five kinds of rays in the solar
                    beam, three of which are visible, and two invisible. In the solar beams these
                    are intimately blended, but may be in some degree separated by refraction
                    through diaphanous prisms. The separation of the luminous and calorific rays may
                    be made by black opake bodies, through which the sun’s heat will penetrate
                    without admitting a single ray of light. The sun’s rays, however, pass through
                    all transparent media, without a separation of light and heat. Glass and ice
                    intercept the rays of terrestrial heat, the first partially, the latter wholly;
                    yet the sun’s rays passing through and collected in the focus of a lens of
                    glass, produce the most intense heat; and Scoresby and others have shown, that a
                    lens of <hi rend="italic">ice</hi> will concentrate the sun’s rays, so as to
                    ignite inflammable substances.</p>
                <p>The publication of Sir John Leslie’s <hi rend="italic">Inquiry into the Nature of
                    Heat,</hi> in 1804, forms an important era in the history of the radiation of
                    caloric. This very original and able philosopher, by the simplicity and delicacy
                    of his apparatus, and the ingenuity of ĥis well-devised experiments, did more
                    than has been accomplished by any other individual to develop the laws which
                    regulate the transmission and reception of this mysterious agent; and his work
                    will remain a land-mark in the history of this branch of physical science. In
                    his experiments, a single mirror only was employed; and the source of heat
                    generally used was a cube or square canister of tinned iron placed before the
                    mirror, at the distance of three or four feet, whilst the ball of an air
                    thermometer was placed in the focus of the mirror. The air thermometer employed
                    by him was his own modification of that figured by Sturmius. <hi rend="italic"

                <p>Leslie’s principal object was the relation of different surfaces in emitting and
                    receiving calorific rays. Of his cubical canister, one side was polished, or, as
                    it is termed by workmen, <hi rend="italic">planished</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >;</hi> the second was covered by a plate of glass; a third with white paper
                    smoothly pasted on; the fourth was painted with lamp-black mixed with <hi
                    rend="italic">size.</hi> The cubes he used were from four to ten inches, and
                    were filled with boiling water. When the polished side was turned toward the
                    thermometer, placed at four feet from the mirror, the increase of temperature
                    was no more than 12°; when the glass side was presented, the differential
                    thermometer under the same circumstances rose to 90°; when the papered side was
                    the radiating surface, the temperature was 98°, and the painted side indicated
                    100°; when the polish of the planished side was destroyed, by ploughing it in
                    one direction with a finetoothed plane, its propelling or radiating power rose
                    to 19°; and when scratched in one direction with a fine file, its effect was as
                    much as 26°. On covering one of the surfaces smoothly with gold and silver leaf,
                    the effect was about equal to the surface of polished tin; a plate of polished
                    iron gave 15°; a surface of fresh lead 19°; but when the same became tarnished,
                    its effect was equal to 45°; and painting it with red oxide of lead raised it to
                    80° w An amalgam of mercury and tin, when fresh, gave no more than 20°.</p>
                <p>Leslie then investigated the relative <hi rend="italic">receiving power</hi> of
                    different surfaces, by coating the <hi rend="italic">sentient ball</hi> of the
                    differential thermometer with different substances. When that ball was smoothly
                    coated with tinfoil, the effect of the blackened side of the canister was only
                    2°∙5, or about one fifth of what it produced on the naked ball; and he found,
                    that of either side of the canister the effect was now just one fifth of that
                    observed with the naked ball. On the other hand, when the ball was covered with
                    a coat of china ink, or formed of a black enamel, the effect of either side of
                    the canister was greatly increased.</p>
                <p>The power of surfaces in reflecting heat was also investigated. In fact, it was
                    shown by the last series of experiments with the coated ball; but he proved it
                    also by varying the reflecting surface. When a glass concave mirror, two feet in
                    diameter, was substituted for the metal reflector, the effect of the blackened
                    side of the canister on the naked ball was but just perceptible; and if a film
                    of china ink be spread over the surface of the mirror, even this slight effect
                    totally disappears. If, however, the concave surface of the glass mirror be
                    smoothly coated with tinfoil, the effect of the black side of the canister <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193641487" xml:id="kp-eb0711-1487-0184"/> will be ten times
                    more than with the naked glass surface. Removing the silvering from the back of
                    the mirror produced no effect on its reflecting the calorific rays, neither was
                    this affected by roughening the back of the mirror. Hence Leslie infers, that
                    reflection of heat takes place at the surface of the glass mirror, or
                    principally so.</p>
                <p>A polished tin reflector had its power diminished one third by being coated as
                    smoothly as possible with tinfoil, evidently by the imperfection of the
                    smoothness of its surface. Scratching its surface with sand-paper diminishes its
                    effect one tenth; and he found that the mirror seemed to have its reflecting
                    power more impaired when the scratches were all in one direction, than when they
                    crossed. A film of tallow on the surface of the mirror reduced the effect of the
                    blackened side from 100° to 8°; but if held before the fire until all that could
                    be thus removed had run off, the effect of that side rose to 37°. When the
                    surface of the mirror was covered with a very thin iridescent film of isinglass,
                    the blackened surface gave an effect of 80°; but when that film was only <hi
                    rend="subscript"> ru</hi> ⅛ <hi rend="subscript"> σ</hi> th of an inch, the
                    effect was reduced to 15°.</p>
                <p>The results of his experiments with other reflecting surfaces gave the following
                    proportions :—A reflector of polished brass = 100°, of the same coated with
                    tinfoil = 85°, of steel = 70°, of fresh lead = 60°, of glass = 10° ∕</p>
                <p>The inference from these investigations is, that the reflecting power of various
                    surfaces bears some inverse proportion to their propelling and absorbing powers.
                    The numerical results of Leslie’s experiments would give the ratio between
                    metallic surfaces and glass, in reflecting power as ten to one; in propelling
                    power as one to eight; in absorbing power as one to five. It was, however,
                    supposed that some minute circumstances, of which it is difficult to estimate
                    the effect, interfered in the two last processes, and that the propelling and
                    absorbing powers are equal in all bodies: we shall find this to be
                    incorrect.</p>
                <p>One of the most interesting parts of Leslie’s investigations was the effect of
                    screens of different kinds, interposed between the sources of heat and the
                    thermometer. When he interposed a screen of tinfoil, the effect of the blackened
                    side of the canister was 0°; a thin sheet of crown-glass was = 20°; a sheet of
                    common writing paper, placed about two inches from the cube, was = 23°. If the
                    screen of any material was placed one foot from the cube, the effect was only
                    one thirtieth of what it was at the distance of two inches. From this he
                    inferred, that the screen prevents all transmission of radiant heat until it
                    becomes itself heated; and then it radiates from its other surface toward the
                    thermometer. This was confirmed by substituting a plate of ice (a substance the
                    temperature of which cannot rise above 32° F.) for the screen, when the effect
                    was 0°. This view he considered as confirmed by his beautiful contrivance of the
                    <hi rend="italic">double</hi> or compound screen. He coated one side of two
                    plates of glass with tinfoil; when the coated sides were outermost, the
                    thermometer did not rise; when the glass surfaces were outwards, the thermometer
                    rose to 18°. He blackened one surface of two plates of tinned iron; when the
                    blackened surfaces were outwards, the effect was 23°; but if the plates were
                    separated from each other, the thermometer fell back to its former station. When
                    the tinned surfaces were outermost, the thermometer was not at all affected.</p>
                <p>Leslie included his whole apparatus in a trough of water, in such a way as to be
                    able to fill the canister with hot water after the whole was adjusted; but there
                    was no radiation of caloric.</p>
                <p>The inference which this philosopher drew from his investigations is, that heat
                    is an elastic substance, extremely fluid and active; and he advanced strong
                    arguments against the theory which ascribes all the phenomena of heat to
                    vibrations in the particles of matter. (<hi rend="italic">Vide Inquiry,</hi> p.
                    139 to 150.) Yet he is disposed to consider the phenomena of radiation as
                    depending on certain undulations, produced by radiating surfaces in the ambient
                    air. This view has been ably combated by the late Dr Murray, with the sagacity
                    which distinguished that philosopher. But the limits of the present article will
                    not allow us to enter into this part of the subject, for which we must refer the
                    reader to Leslie’s <hi rend="italic">Inquiry,</hi> and Murray’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Chemistry.</hi></p>
                <p>The more usually-received theory of radiation is, that from heated bodies emanate
                    rays of caloric in all directions, which proceed through gaseous bodies with
                    little or no sensible interruption, and with amazing velocity; that these rays
                    are absorbed by dark and rough surfaces, and are reflected by polished bright
                    surfaces.</p>
                <p>There is, however, one curious experiment, which is rather difficult of
                    explanation, namely, the seeming <hi rend="italic">radiation of cold.</hi> The
                    Florentine philosophers of the <hi rend="italic">Academia del Cimento</hi>
                    found, that when a mass of snow was placed in the focus of one mirror, the
                    thermometer placed in the focus of the other sunk, or indicated cold. This
                    subject has been investigated by Pictet and by Leslie. The latter observed that
                    his canister, filled with snow, produced the greatest effect when its blackened
                    side was towards the thermometer and the mirror, and the least when its polished
                    side was in that direction. The effect of screens, in retarding the influence of
                    the cold body, he found analogous to their effect on the radiation from the hot
                    water.</p>
                <p>These facts were considered by Leslie as proving the existence of what he
                    denominated cold pulses from the snow towards the mirror, “on the wings of the
                    ambient air;” but the explanation of Pictet appears to account for it well,
                    without the necessity of inferring the existence of frigorifie particles, which
                    is a highly improbable supposition. On this view, radiation is considered as
                    only taking place amongst bodies unequally heated. He conceived that bodies at
                    the same temperature do not radiate heat to each other, because in this state
                    caloric exists in them all in an equality of tension; but when a cool body is
                    introduced, all radiate heat towards it, and consequently their temperature
                    falls. Hence radiation is nothing more than the tendency of caloric to establish
                    an equilibrium of temperature. The rays of heat enter into the snow from the
                    surrounding matter, and, amongst others, from the thermometer, which is now a
                    radiating body; and these collected in the mirror pass in right lines to the
                    snow, with a celerity in proportion to their absorption by the cold body. Hence
                    the caloric of the thermometer will more rapidly leave it when the blackened
                    side of the cold canister, that is, its most absorbent side, is turned to the
                    thermometer.</p>
                <p>Leslie explains this phenomenon by his theory of aerial pulsations. He considers
                    the cold surface as abstracting part of the caloric of the contiguous stratum of
                    air, which induces a momentary contraction of'that portion; and this contraction
                    produces pulsations, accompanied by a discharge of heat, in a continued chain
                    from the thermometer and the mirror to the snow.</p>
                <p>The effect of surface on the refrigeration of bodies, an important part of the
                    consequences of radiation, has been ably examined both by Sir John Leslie and
                    Count Rumford. The experiments of both show, that to preserve the heat of any
                    liquid, a bright metallic vessel is the best; and Rumford has pointed out many
                    important economical purposes to which these principles may be applied. Thus,
                    where it is of consequence to preserve the heat of liquids, of steam, or of hot
                    air, they should be conveyed in vessels and tubes of polished metal. On the
                    other hand, if we wish to have the greatest radiant heat from a stove or grate,
                    its surface next the room should be dark and rough, as these are the most
                    favourable for radiating heat into the apartment. The same principles show why a
                    silver <pb break="no" facs="nls:193641500" xml:id="kp-eb0711-1500-0185"/>I
                    tea-pot makes better tea, and keeps it longer warm, than a china one.</p>
                <p>' One of the most beautiful applications of the principle of the radiation of
                    heat, is Dr Wells’ explanation of the phenomena of dew and hoar-frost. Dr Wilson
                    of Glasgow had observed, that bodies upon which dew and hoarfrost formed, were
                    always <hi rend="italic">colder</hi> than the surrounding air. This cold he
                    ascribed to these depositions; but an attentive examination of facts led Dr
                    Wells to draw an opposite conclusion, and to infer that the coldness of the
                    bodies was the <hi rend="italic">cause</hi> of the deposition of dew and
                    hoar-frost. This he successfully established, by proving that, before any dew
                    formed, the surface on which it condensed was uniformly cooler than the ambient
                    air. And it was reserved for this accomplished man to offer a theory of those
                    meteors, complete in almost all its parts, and perfectly satisfactory. He
                    ascribed it to the radiation of heat, without any return from the air to the
                    surface of the earth. He observed, that it was chiefly in serene, clear nights,
                    that dew was formed; that exposure to the open clear sky favoured the formation
                    of dew; and that cloudy skies were unfavourable to its formation. These
                    phenomena he beautifully. explained on the theory of radiation. The upper
                    regions of the atmosphere are well known to be the abodes of perpetual
                    congelation, as is seen whenever mountains reach a certain altitude, differing,
                    it is true, in different climates, but yet invariable over the earth. When we
                    have a clear atmosphere at night, the surface of the earth rapidly parts with
                    the heat it had acquired during the day, by radiation to the superior regions,
                    whence it can receive no heat in return. In this case, the empyrean regions act
                    the part of the snow in the Florentine experiment; and the earth’s surface may
                    represent the thermometer. But if fleecy clouds intervene, they act the part of
                    screens, intercepting the passage of radiant caloric from the earth, and
                    consequently retarding the nocturnal cooling of its surface. Air at an increased
                    temperature contains more water than cool air, and on the reduction of its
                    temperature deposits its surplus water. Now, as the radiation from the earth’s
                    surface cools it more rapidly than the air during serene nights, its temperature
                    rapidly falls, as the thermometer shows; and the consequence is the cooling of
                    the stratum of air in immediate contact with the ground, and the deposition of
                    its superabundant moisture, in the form of dew or hoarfrost, according to the
                    celerity and intensity of the refrigeration.</p>
                <p>This theory is experimentally proved by placing substances absorbent of moisture,
                    along with thermometers, below and above screens, and then noting the
                    temperature and the increase of weight. If, for instance, a light table, about
                    three feet high, be placed in a garden on a clear night, and a few grains of
                    wool, previously weighed, be laid under the table, and as much on its upper
                    surface, with a thermometer by each parcel of wool, it will be found that the
                    upper thermometer will indicate the greatest degree of cold, and the wool on the
                    table will have imbibed much more moisture than that below. The table, in such
                    experiments, acts the part of clouds in intercepting the discharge of radiant
                    heat, and preventing the cooling of the earth’s surface. The theory agrees with
                    the fact, that dew is heaviest in our climate in serene nights, after a hot day;
                    and that the dews of hot climates are far heavier than with us, so as, in clear
                    weather, in the south of Europe, to drench the clothes of persons exposed to the
                    air about sunset. The slight anomalies which sometimes occur in such experiments
                    are easily explicable by the different <hi rend="italic">conducting power</hi>
                    of substances in regard to heat, by which the influence of radiation may be in
                    some degree modified; but undoubtedly the principal effect is due to <hi
                    rend="italic">radiation.</hi></p>
                <p>The influence of a clear sky in reducing the temperature of the earth’s surface,
                    and the effect of clouds in preventing this change, are beautifully illustrated
                    by Leslie’s elegant invention, the <hi rend="italic">Aethrioscope.</hi> (See,
                    for the description of the aethrioscope, the article <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Climate.)</hi> This instrument is so delicate, that it instantly indicates cold
                    on presenting its uncovered ball to the clear sky; but if a passing cloud cross
                    the zenith, even momentarily, the movement of the fluid in its stem immediately
                    shows an increase of temperature. If one walk in a clear night, with this
                    instrument in one hand and a parasol in the other, it may be kept in a perpetual
                    state of fluctuation, by alternately projecting it beyond and drawing it under
                    the parasol.</p>
                <p>The radiant heat afforded by the sun’s rays is the most important phenomenon of
                    this class. Light and heat are in these rays so united, that experiment would
                    seem to prove the one to be always in proportion to the other. This is by no
                    means the case with the light and heat of common combustibles, or what we may
                    term <hi rend="italic">terrestrial,</hi> in contradistinction to <hi
                    rend="italic">solar</hi> emanations of light. Phosphorus gives an intense light
                    during combustion, but a feeble heat; whilst hydrogen, which has a very feeble
                    light, excites a high temperature by its combustion. Solar light and heat, on
                    the other hand, are uniformly proportional. There are more marked differences
                    between solar and terrestrial radiant heat. Screens of glass greatly interrupt
                    the passage of the latter, but do not sensibly intercept that of the sun. A
                    plate of the most diaphanous ice totally intercepts terrestrial radiant caloric,
                    but does not impede the sun’s heating rays. This has, with considerable reason,
                    been supposed to depend on the different velocities of the two species of
                    calorific emanations. Sir John Leslie considered “that the phenomena of solar
                    radiation proved <hi rend="italic">heat to be only light in a state of
                    combination.</hi><hi rend="italic">”</hi><hi rend="italic">(Essay,</hi>

                <p>For thirty years after the publication of Leslie’s <hi rend="italic">Experimental
                    Inquiry,</hi> little appears to have been attempted on this subject, until
                    within a recent period, when the experimental researches of Melloni and of
                    Nobili, particularly of the former, opened a beautiful field of investigation,
                    which has already been cultivated with success by Professor James Forbes of
                    Edinburgh. Melloni has, by means of a thermo-magnetic combination, invented a
                    very delicate test of minute degrees of heat, wholly inappreciable by any
                    thermometer, and has successfully applied it to investigate the laws of radiant
                    heat. By uniting fifty small bars of antimony and bismuth into one bundle, about
                    three fourths of an inch square, and about 1∙17 inch in length, and connecting
                    this with a galvanometer, he obtained an apparatus so sensible to heat, that the
                    warmth radiating from the human hand, at the distance of several inches from
                    the. end of the bars, is indicated by the deviation of the needle of the
                    galvanometer.</p>
                <p>Melloni’s instrument is represented in the adjoining figure, where a firm sole of
                    wood is seen, provided with a groove m which the different parts of the
                    apparatus slide to adjust <pb break="no" facs="nls:193641513"

                    metallic bars, enclosed in a square case of brass; B is the source of the heat;
                    C, D are the wires proceeding from the bars, to convey their thermo-magnetism to
                    the nearly neutralized needle or galvanometer, which is not here represented; G
                    is the stage for occasionally supporting various substances, the effect of which
                    on the calorific rays it is intended to ascertain; FF are screens of brass,
                    moveable on joints, for cutting off at pleasure the radiant heat, or for
                    obviating the influence of extraneous sources of heat. In F is a hole through
                    which the heat radiates to A when the screen is removed.</p>
                <p>This apparatus has been employed by Melloni to investigate the laws of radiant
                    heat; and he has not only confirmed the general results of Leslie, but extended
                    greatly our knowledge of this mysterious agent.</p>
                <p>Melloni found, that the radiant and absorbent power of surfaces were not always
                    proportional, as the following tables show.</p>

                <p>This experiment proves,</p>
                <p>1. That bodies do not always agree in their emitting and absorbent powers, though
                    generally nearly so.</p>
                <p>2. That their absorbent power varies very remarkably with the origin and
                    intensity of the calorific rays.</p>
                <p>3. That they approach each other more and more in their power of emitting and
                    absorbing rays of heat, when the temperature approaches that of boiling water;
                    and that, when exactly at that temperature, the emitting and absorbing powers
                    coincide.</p>
                <p>With respect to the <hi rend="italic">reflection</hi> of radiant heat, he has
                    shown, that it is equally reflected by metallic surfaces, from whatever source
                    it emanates.</p>
                <p>But Melloni’s most original experiments are those on the transmission of radiant
                    heat through various transparent media.</p>
                <p>1. He showed that radiant heat is intercepted in a greater or less degree by all
                    diaphanous bodies, in proportion to the <hi rend="italic">lowness</hi> of the
                    temperature of the radiating body.</p>
                <p>2. That of two bodies unequally diaphanous, it may happen that the thickest and
                    least diaphanous may transmit most radiant heat. Thus he showed that a thin
                    plate of very transparent alum, placed on the stage G, transmitted four times
                    less heat than a plate of almost opake quartz, about 100 tiŋaes as thick; but he
                    found that in the <hi rend="italic">same</hi> substance the transmission of
                    radiant heat is diminished by ' the thickness of the plate interposed, and this
                    diminution is proportional to· the lowness of the temperature of the radiant
                    body.</p>
                <p>3. That there are combinations of two media, which allow a notable quantity of
                    light to pass, but totally intercept radiant heat; whilst others transmit heat,
                    but wholly intercept light.</p>
                <p>4. That in traversing a transparent plate, radiant heat undergoes certain
                    modifications, variable with the nature of the plate; a change which renders it
                    more or less susceptible ultimately of being transmitted through other
                    diaphanous substances. Melloni instances this last property <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >mi</hi> glass, in crystallized citric acid, and in alum.</p>
                <p>Delaroche had inferred, from his experiments, that it was a general law of
                    radiant heat, that the permeability of plates to this agent depended upon the
                    intensity of the source of the caloric; and in this way he explained the instant
                    permeability of glass and ice to the calorific rays of the sun, whilst they
                    retarded those from terrestrial sources of heat; butMelloni has discovered one
                    substance which he found to be equally pervious to heat, from whatever
                    terrestrial source, whether proceeding from the brightest flame, or from water
                    far below the boiling point.</p>
                <p>The power of penetrating glass and other media increasing in proportion as the
                    radiating heat approaches the state of light, had been used by Delaroche as au
                    argument for their identity; but the anomaly of rock-salt destroys the
                    universality of the supposed law on which the argument is founded. Yet Mrs
                    Somerville has ingeniously employed the unlooked-for analogy between light and
                    heat, in the equal transmission of the latter, however eliminated, through
                    rock-salt, as an argument for their being modifications of the same principle.
                    The condition of visibility or invisibility, she contends, may depend on the
                    construction of our eyes, not on the nature of the agent producing the
                    sensations of vision and of heat.</p>
                <p>“The sense of seeing, like that of hearing, may be confined within certain

                    rapid, or not sufficiently excursive in their vibrations to be visible to the
                    human eye; and the calorific rays beyond the other end of the spectrum may not
                    be sufficiently rapid, or too extensive, in their undulations, to affect our
                    optic nerves, though both may be visible to certain animals or insects.”</p>
                <p>She has traced the analogies between light and heat in their reflection by
                    polished surfaces, their refraction through transparent media, with their
                    concentration by concave and dispersion by convex mirrors; and since the
                    publication of her beautiful essay on the connection of the physical sciences,
                    Professor Forbes has drawn the analogy closer, as we shall presently see.</p>
                <p>But to return to Melloni. This able philosopher has shown that radiant caloric is
                    susceptible of refraction; and when it arrives at the second surface of the
                    refracting angle, with a certain obliquity, it is, like light, reflected toward
                    the interior of the prism, and issues at the opposite face.</p>

                    transmission on the absolute power of different radiating surfaces thus:</p>

                <p>Melloni, however, failed to detect the polarisation of radiant heat: indeed, he
                    states that the direction in <pb break="no" facs="nls:193641526"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0711-1526-0187"/>which we slice crystallized bodies does not exert
                    any influence upon the quantity of radiant heat immediately transmitted by them;
                    and adds, that radiant heat is <hi rend="italic">not polarised</hi> by
                    transmission through tourmaline. In this, however, Melloni was deceived; and it
                    was reserved for our countryman Professor Forbes of Edinburgh to complete the
                    analogy between light and heat, by demonstrating the polarisation of the
                    latter.</p>
                <p>Since the characteristic phenomenon which marks the polarisation of light is its
                    variable susceptibility as to reflection or transmission, under circumstances in
                    which common light would be reflected or transmitted, it will appear that the
                    correlative fact in the case of heat would be indicated by a diminished effect
                    on the thermometer, where the intensity of light, under similar circumstances,
                    would be a <hi rend="italic">minimum,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">vice
                    versa.</hi> The importance of establishing this effect with regard to heat is
                    far greater than the mere addition of such facts to our knowledge; for, as the
                    corresponding facts in the instance of light have been completely brought into
                    the domain of <hi rend="italic">analysis</hi> by Fresnel, the polarisation of
                    heat must be considered as almost decisive of its nature.</p>
                <p>Mr Forbes employed Melloni’s apparatus; and by interposing two plates of
                    tourmaline, cut parallel to the axis of the crystal, and mounted on two slips of
                    thin glass, he made a series of successive observations under the two conditions
                    of the axes parallel and perpendicular to each other. Two measures of intensity
                    in the position in which least light is transmitted were noted, and in the
                    following table this position is indicated by <hi rend="italic">dark</hi><hi

                <p>The most convenient way of polarising heat is by transmitting it through a bundle
                    of extremely thin laminae of mica, inclined to the incident ray at the
                    polarising angle; mica having the property of transmitting heat very readily.
                    The amount of polarisation is indicated by the relative quantities of heat
                    reaching the pile, or thermo-magnetic combination of the instrument, through a
                    second bundle of thin plates of mica, placed alternately in a parallel or
                    perpendicular position to the first. With such an apparatus Mr Forbes
                    demonstrated, in the most decisive manner, the polarisation of heat; and
                    obtained this effect, even with water below 200° F. as the source of heat. The
                    quantity polarised, however, always bears a proportion to the temperature of the
                    source of the radiant heat, as is seen by the following tabular results.</p>

                    more delicate problem of the <hi rend="italic">depolarisation</hi> of heat by
                    plates of mica. By interposing a film of mica between the two bundles of mica
                    plates already mentioned, having their planes of incidence at right angles to
                    each other, and marking the difference of the heat transmitted to the

                    plane of primitive polarisation, or inclined to it at an angle of 45°, he
                    succeeded in demonstrating the polarisation of the rays of heat, even when heat
                    without light was employed. In these experiments, when the principal section
                    coincided with the plane of polarisation, the depolarising effect was <hi

                    obtained the following proportions in one series of experiments.</p>
                <p>100: 118:: — 100: 120 — 100: 120 — 100:113 —</p>
                <p>The depolarisation is still more marked with incandescent platinum; as the
                    results were</p>
                <p>100: 126 — 100: 138 — 100: 138.</p>
                <p>One of the most striking proofs of the depolarising power of mica is obtained,
                    when the two bundles of mica plates are crossed, so as to intercept most heat,
                    and we interpose a very thin plate or film of mica as above mentioned; then the
                    galvanometer moves towards zero, or the thin plate evidently stops more heat
                    than it depolarises; but if we substitute a much thicker plate of mica for the
                    film, the instrument will indicate a higher temperature than when no mica at all
                    is interposed, or the thick plate depolarises more heat than it intercepts.</p>
                <p>These experiments were varied in a great variety of ways, so as to establish the
                    fact of the depolarisation of heat; and if we admit that it depends on a similar
                    cause to the analogous phenomena of light, it follows that the rays of caloric
                    are susceptible also of <hi rend="italic">double refraction;</hi> that the two
                    pencils are polarised in opposite planes, and that they become capable of <hi
                    rend="italic">interference</hi> by the action of the analysing plate.</p>
                <p>These curious facts would indicate at least a great similarity between light and
                    heat; and the concluding observations of Professor. Forbes’s paper <hi

                <p>SECT. III.—GENERAL EFFECTS OF CALORIC.</p>
                <p>The general effects of heat applied to other matter are, expansion, fluidity,
                    vaporization, and incandescence. The <hi rend="italic">most</hi> general effect
                    of heat, however, is,</p>
                <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Expansion.</hi></p>
                <p>When a body is heated, it expands in all its dimensions; but when the heat is
                    withdrawn, the body returns to its original size. This is well shown by having a
                    turned rod of metal, loosely fitted to a gage, to ascertain its length, and
                    provided with a hole which first allows it, when cold, to pass through. This
                    expansion is small in solids, but has been most accurately measured by
                    philosophers, for <pb break="no" facs="nls:193641539"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0711-1539-0188"/>the important purposes of ascertaining with
                    precision the true length of the pendulum vibrating seconds in any latitude, and
                    for obtaining a perfect standard of length. This difficult subject engaged the
                    attention of Ellicot, Smeaton, Roy, Troughton, Lavoisier, and Laplace. The
                    latest experiments were made by the two last-mentioned philosophers, and were
                    first published by Biot in the following table, which shows the expansion which
                    different solids sustain, in passing from the freezing to the boiling point of
                    water, in fractions of their own lengths.</p>

                <p>A very elaborate and interesting set of experiments on the expansion of building

                    in a pyrometer of his own invention, to a heat of 212°. The increments in length
                    were accurately determined by a microscope-micrometer, attached to the

                <p>The inequality of the expansion of fluids by heat has long been known to form an
                    obstacle to the accuracy of thermometers. Deluc found, that of all fluids
                    mercury was the most equable in its expansions, which is probably owing to the
                    great distance between its freezing and boiling points; for it is found that
                    those liquids which have a low boiling point are the most irregular in their
                    expansion at ordinary temperatures; and hence alcohol is not a suitable fluid
                    for thermometers.</p>
                <p>The expansibility of liquids is not in proportion to their density; but it is
                    more nearly in the inverse ratio of their density than of any other known
                    property.</p>
                <p>The expansion of gases by heat is much more considerable than that of the other
                    two forms of matter.</p>
                <p>The higher increasing ratio in the expansibility of liquids with their augmenting
                    temperature, than in solids, led philosophers at first to infer, that the
                    inequalities of the gaseous bodies, in this respect, would be still more
                    considerable; but the elaborate researches of General Roy have disproved this
                    idea; and some experiments of the late Dr Murray of Edinburgh, and of Dr Dalton,
                    would rather indicate a <hi rend="italic">decrease</hi> in the ratio with the
                    increased temperature. This, however, may probably be owing to the imperfection
                    of our best thermometers, and to the difficulty of estimating the expansions of
                    the glass containing the air examined.</p>
                <p>Dr Dalton has ascertained that all gases expand equally by equal increments of
                    heat; a conclusion which has been confirmed by Gay-Lussac. They have shown that,
                    between the freezing and boiling point of water, 100 cubic inches of atmospheric
                    air expand to 137∙50, that with hydrogen the result was 137∙52, with oxygen gas
                    137∙48, and with nitrogen 137∙49; differences so slight as to be within the
                    probable limits of experimental error.</p>
                <p>The force opposed to expansion would appear to be cohesion. Expansion is least in
                    solids where the cohesion is strongest; it is more considerable in liquids where
                    the cohesion is greatly weakened; and it is greatest in gases, in which cohesion
                    is wholly overcome.</p>
                <p>The expansion of bodies by heat, and their contraction on the reduction of the
                    temperature, would show that the atoms of bodies are not in absolute contact. In
                    fact, we may suppose them surrounded by <hi rend="italic">atmospheres of
                    heat,</hi> which prevent, by the repulsive energy of caloric, their absolute
                    contact; whilst the force of cohesion limits the diffusive influence of the
                    contained caloric. In some, the superior force of cohesion gives rise to
                    solidity. When more heat is introduced, the cohesion is weakened, and the body
                    becomes a liquid; and a further addition of caloric destroys cohesion
                    altogether, separates the atoms, and the body becomes a gas.</p>
                <p>The expansion of bodies by heat proves the mutual repulsion of their particles;
                    but this limits the repulsive energy of heat to insensible distances. In 1824,
                    Libri endeavoured to prove, from the movements of globules of water along fine
                    wires, that the repulsive power of heat was exerted also at sensible distances.
                    But his experiments are not conclusive; for the motions may have arisen from the
                    formation of vapour at one end of the globule. Fresnel attempted to prove this
                    point by bringing discs of foil or of mica, on the end of a delicately suspended
                    magnet, into contact with fixed discs <hi rend="italic">in vacuo,</hi> and
                    marking the effect of heat collected from the sun’s rays. The moveable discs
                    sensibly receded; but this may have arisen from some change produced by the heat
                    in the form of the discs. Professor Forbes has happily applied<pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193641552" xml:id="kp-eb0711-1552-0189"/> the repulsive energy of heat
                    acting at <hi rend="italic">sensible distances,</hi> to explain the curious
                    vibrations of the metal bars in Trevelyan’s experiments. Still more lately
                    Professor Powell of Cambridge has demonstrated the repulsion of heat at sensible
                    distances <hi rend="italic">(Phil. Trans,</hi> for 1834), by the changes
                    produced, on the approximation of a heated body, in the Newtonian coloured rings
                    of plates of glass which are pressed together. When, for instance, a flat plate
                    is laid on a slightly convex surface of glass, the rings appear. On bringing a
                    heated body near the upper surface of the plates, the rings instantly contract,
                    and again enlarge on withdrawing the heated body. On repeating the experiment
                    with the colours formed under the base of a prism placed on a lens of small
                    convexity, he found the repulsion of heat acting at distances, which Sir J.
                    Herschel has calculated at τ⅛θth of an inch.</p>
                <p>Expansion is so general an effect of heat, that there are only two known
                    exceptions, viz. in clay, and in water -at a certain limited range of
                    temperature. It is well known that porcelain clay contracts in baking, and ever
                    afterwards retains its contracted dimensions. It was this quality which induced
                    Wedgwood to employ its contractions as a pyrometer. (See <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Thermometer</hi> and <hi rend="smallcaps">Pyrometer.)</hi>-This property,
                    however, seemingly depends on heat producing in the heterogeneous substance
                    clay, a more intimate union of its parts, or a partial conversion of this
                    mechanical mixture into a chemical compound.</p>
                <p>The exception of water between 42° and 32° Fahrenheit, is, however, real. When
                    water is cooled down from the ordinary temperature, say 60°, it regularly
                    contracts by the cooling, until it has attained 42°; but whilst passing from
                    that point down to its freezing point, it continues to expand gradually^ until
                    converted into ice.</p>
                <p>The important purposes which this constitution of water serves in the economy of
                    nature, the immense quantity of heat which is by this contrivance saved to our
                    lakes and other collections of water, are strikingly pointed out by Count
                    Rumford in his Essays; and this peculiarity in water has been confirmed by the
                    well-devised experiments of Professor Hope and Dr Murray.</p>
                <p>Many liquids at the moment of congelation <hi rend="italic">expand,</hi> from the
                    crystalline arrangement of their parts. This is familiarly known in the floating
                    of ice in water, in the bursting of water pipes by frost, and in the splitting
                    of masses of rock by the congelation of the water which has insinuated itself
                    into their fissures. This force is well known to be enormous, as was shown by
                    the experiments of the Florentine academicians, of Huygens, and of Major
                    Williams at Quebec (see <hi rend="italic">Edin. Phil.</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Trans.).</hi> The same cause produces the expansion of cast iron at the moment
                    of becoming solid; and it is to this property that we are indebted for the
                    sharpness of the casts obtained from this metal. In these instances we do not
                    find an exception to the law of contraction by diminished heat. It is wholly
                    owing to a crystalline arrangement of the particles, by which interstices are
                    left between them, and consequently the solid occupies more space than if
                    solidification took place without crystallization. Hence lead expands not in
                    cooling, though cast iron does.</p>
                <p>Many operations in the arts depend on the contraction of metals as they cool. It
                    is in this way that the tyers of coach wheels are fitted tightly to the fellies.
                    The expansion of metals by heat seemed at one time to form an insurmountable bar
                    to the perfection of the going of a pendulum clock; but the ingenuity of an
                    English artist showed how, by a combination of bars of metals of unequal
                    expansibility, this property might be applied to keep the pendulum, at all
                    temperatures, of precisely the same length. This first produced the gridiron
                    pendulum; and more lately the compensation pendulum, with a mercurial cistern at
                    the end of a metallic rod. Similar principles have been successfully applied to
                    the balance-wheels of pocket chronometers.</p>
                <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Liquefaction, or Fluidity.</hi></p>
                <p>When solids are heated, they first expand, and then melt. This is a very general
                    effect of caloric, the exceptions to which are disappearing, as we discover new
                    sources of intense temperature. The oxyhydrogen blowpipe has fused almost all
                    the most refractory substances; and the sun’s rays collected by immense lenses,
                    or metallic mirrors, have melted, or even dissipated in vapour, many bodies,
                    which were long regarded as incapable of fusion. We are therefore entitled to
                    regard solidity as the natural state of all matter, and its two other
                    modifications as resulting from its union with caloric.</p>
                <p>Those bodies always fused at the ordinary temperatures are no exception to this
                    law, since, by artificial cold, we have reduced most of them to a solid state.
                    Thus mercury, at about — 40° of Fahrenheit, becomes a solid metal with the
                    lustre of silver; and alcohol, which has not yet been frozen, may be considered
                    as having its melting point lower than any yet discovered artificial cold. The
                    point at which bodies become fluid differs widely in different substances, but
                    remains uniformly the same in the same fluid under similar circumstances. Thus
                    ice always melts at 32°.</p>
                <p>It was long believed, that when solids began to melt, they were converted into
                    liquids by a small increase of heat; and that they might again return to the
                    solid state by a small diminution of their temperature. An attentive
                    consideration of the process of liquefaction convinced the celebrated Dr Joseph
                    Black of the insufficiency of the commonly-received opinion; and he promulgated
                    in 1757 more philosophic views of this subject, which he illustrated by a
                    beautifully simple experiment.</p>
                <p>He introduced equal quantities of water into two thin glass flasks of the same
                    form and weight. One of them he froze, by placing it in a freezing mixture; the
                    other he reduced by similar means to the temperature of 32°, or its freezing
                    point, but without allowing it to become solid. When removed from the freezing
                    mixture, the flask of ice soon acquired the same temperature as the ice-cold
                    water, and both were suspended in a room at 47°. In half an hour the thermometer
                    in the ice-cold water had risen to 40°, but it required twenty-one half-hours to
                    raise the temperature of the flask which had been frozen to the same point. As
                    both were exposed to the same medium, equal quantities of heat must have been
                    imparted to each in equal times; but it required twenty-one times as long to
                    raise the frozen flask 8°, as sufficed to impart 8° to the ice-cold water. Dr
                    Black inquired what had become of this quantity of caloric, which was not
                    indicated by any rise in the thermometer? He inferred that it had entered into
                    the ice during its liquefaction; and as the quantity so absorbed was not
                    indicated by the thermometer, he denominated it <hi rend="italic">Latent
                    Heat.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> In repeating the experiment with much care,
                    he found that a pound of ice required twenty times as long to rise through 7°,
                    as did as much ice-cold water; and therefore inferred, that during the
                    conversion of that ice into water, as much heat disappears, or is absorbed, as
                    would have elevated a pound of ice-cold water 140°. This absorption of heat
                    during liquefaction is easily shown. If we add a pound of boiling water to a
                    pound of ice, the temperature of the mixture will still remain at 32°; but if to
                    a pound of water at 32°, we add a pound of boiling water at 212°, the
                    temperature of the mixture will be found about J 22°, or a mean between the
                    extremes of temperature.</p>
                <p>Similar absorptions of heat take place during the melt» ing of tallow, bees-wax,
                    and of the metals.</p>

                <p>It is possible, by nice management, to cool down water considerably below its
                    freezing point. The principal circumstance necessary for this experiment is to
                    leave it at perfect rest, in an atmosphere from 10° to 15° below 32° (Dalton
                    succeeded in this way in cooling water as low as 5° without freezing); but on
                    slightly agitating it, the water suddenly freezes; and if a thermometer has been
                    suspended in it, the instrument suddenly rises to 32°, owing to the conversion
                    of latent into sensible heat.</p>
                <p>Another experiment shows this fact in a striking point of view. Into a glass
                    flask introduce a mixture of sulphate of soda and water, in such proportions
                    that it will form a saturated solution about the point of ebullition. When this
                    is heated to that point, pour a little oil on its surface, introduce a
                    thermometer, and remove it from the fire. When quite cold, drop into it a small
                    crystal of sulphate of soda, and the solution will speedily crystallize into a
                    solid mass, during the formation of which the thermometer will be seen to rise,
                    indicating the evolution of sensible heat, during the conversion of the liquid
                    into a solid.</p>
                <p>The absorption of sensible caloric on the liquefaction of bodies forms the basis
                    of most of the processes by which we obtain artificial cold. When to some salts,
                    such as sulphate of soda, we add nitrous acid diluted with an equal part of
                    water, the salt rapidly melts, and the temperature is reduced to the beginning
                    of Fahrenheit’s scale. Diluted acid added to snow rapidly melts it, and the
                    temperature is greatly reduced. A mixture of common salt and snow, which is the
                    mixture generally employed to procure ice-cream, will sink the temperature to
                    the beginning of Fahrenheit’s scale. Dry muriate of lime added to dry snow will
                    reduce the temperature, during their liquefaction, so low as to freeze mercury.
                    In all these instances it is the absorption of heat caused by the liquefaction,
                    or the conversion of sensible into latent caloric, that produces the cold.</p>
                <p>Dr Black applied his theory of latent heat to explain many phenomena. The
                    ductility of a body appears to be owing to the presence of latent caloric; for
                    if we hammer a piece of iron smartly, it becomes intensely hot, by parting with
                    its latent caloric, and at the same time has its ductility greatly impaired.
                    This ductility is only restored by again heating the metal in the fire, by which
                    it re-acquires latent heat, that may again be forced out by a repetition of the
                    hammering.</p>
                <p>The absorption of heat by bodies whilst melting is an important law in the
                    economy of nature. Had it merely been necessary, for the immediate conversion of
                    ice or snow into water, to raise the atmospheric temperature a few degrees, the
                    sudden formation of water would have deluged the earth on every occurrence of a
                    thaw. On the other hand, had the slightest lowering of the temperature of the
                    air below 32° been all that was requisite to convert water into ice, the sudden
                    expansion of the congealing juices of vegetables must have burst their
                    sap-vessels, and rent asunder the strongest ornaments of the forest. But the law
                    of the gradual absorption and emanation of caloric during these transitions from
                    the solid to the liquid, and from the liquid to the solid state, produces those
                    changes tranquilly and beneficially. The melting snow gradually augments the
                    sources which fertilize the valleys; whilst the soil, loosened by the expansion
                    produced by the previous frost, when softened by the succeeding thaw, is fitted
                    for the reception of the roots of plants.</p>
                <p>The influence of these processes on climate is not inconsiderable. The absorption
                    of heat during the liquefaction of ice on tropical mountains, sends down into
                    the heated valleys copious sources of cool water, which by its immediate
                    contact, and still more by its evaporation, assuages the fervour of a broiling
                    climate; and in high la- ' titudes the caloric, eliminated on the freezing of
                    water,, tends to mitigate the rigours of an arctic winter.</p>
                <p>3. <hi rend="italic">Vaporization.</hi></p>
                <p>When liquids are heated, the first effect is expansion; but if the application of
                    heat be continued, they assume the aeriform state, or pass into <hi
                    rend="italic">vapour</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and when the caloric iŝ
                    abstracted, they again assume the liquid form. When water is heated to 212°
                    Fahrenheit, it boils, and is converted into an invisible aeriform fluid, which
                    remains perfectly transparent and colourless as longas its temperature is not
                    below 212°; but what in common language is called steam, is this elastic fluid
                    partially recondensed into water, by the loss of a portion of its heat. The
                    invisible elastic vapour is capable of occupying space and expelling atmospheric
                    air, as is shown by corking a flask when boiling, and opening it underwater;
                    when the flask will be suddenly entirely filled with the water, which condenses
                    the steam.</p>
                <p>Liquids, however, pass also into vapour by a more gradual process. If exposed to
                    the air, water, for instance, gradually disappears; and if the process be
                    carried on under a glass vessel, the included air becomes charged with moisture,
                    which may be again abstracted from it by dry quicklime, or other substance
                    having a strong affinity for water. The process by which liquids are thus
                    converted into vapour is termed <hi rend="italic">Spontaneous
                    Evaporation</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> an important operation in nature, as on
                    it depends the charging of the atmosphere with water, for the formation of
                    clouds, mist, rain, and dew; all elastic fluids, however, are not capable of
                    being condensed into liquids by any decrease of temperature we can command.
                    Thus, no artificial cold has hitherto been discovered capable of converting
                    atmospheric air into a liquid.</p>
                <p>The common property of all aeriform fluids is <hi rend="italic">elasticity,</hi>
                    or^the tendency, when forcibly compressed, to resume their former bulk. Thus, if
                    we throw air, by means of a forcing pump, into an air-tight cistern, provided
                    with a small orifice commanded by a stop-cock; on opening the latter, the air
                    will issue out with great force, until the air has regained its former
                    volume.</p>
                <p>But vapours, or those aeriform bodies which are not permanently elastic, may, by
                    strong pressure, even whilst their temperature is above their vaporific point,
                    be condensed into liquids.</p>
                <p>The elasticity of all aeriform bodies is increased by augmentation of
                    temperature. In atmospheric air this increase has been found equal to ψ⅛θth of
                    its volume for every 1° Fahrenheit; and the elasticity of steam, or the vapour
                    of water, is nearly doubled by 30° of increased temperature above 212.</p>
                <p>We are indebted to the celebrated Dr Dalton for accurate ideas as to the
                    elasticity of aeriform bodies at different temperatures. He showed that the
                    vapour of water, under a barometrical pressure of thirty inches at the boiling
                    point, is just equal to the elasticity of atmospheric air under the same
                    pressure; that the ratio of increase is rather less than a geometrical series,
                    when the temperature is taken in an arithmetical progression; and, what was less
                    obvious; that the elasticity of all vapours is precisely the same with the
                    elasticity of the vapour of water, at the same number of degrees above the
                    boiling point of each liquid. Thus water, under a mean barometrical pressure,
                    boils at 212°; and the elasticity of its steam at 220°, or 8° above its boiling
                    point, was found by Dalton to be = 34∙99 inches: alcohol boils at 175°, and the
                    elasticity of its vapour at 183°, or 8° above its boiling point, is just =
                    34&gt;∙99.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:193641578" xml:id="kp-eb0711-1578-0191"/>
                <p>The bulk of a body is very much increased by its conversion into vapour. Dr Black
                    and Mr Watt made experiments to ascertain this increase. They boiled water in a
                    flask, and, as the last drop was converted into steam, accurately closed the
                    flask, which was then carefully weighed; on opening the flask below the surface
                    of water, the quantity of water which rushed in was easily ascertained by a
                    second weighing of the flask. The mean of several experiments showed that water,
                    in the state of vapour, occupied 1800 times the space it filled as water. When
                    heat is applied to solids, its first effect is expansion, next liquefaction,
                    and, lastly, conversion into vapour. A few solids pass at once into the state of
                    vapour, as carbonate of ammonia.</p>
                <p>Different liquids acquire different degrees of heat for their vaporization. Thus
                    aether becomes vapour at 104°, alcohol at 175°, water at 212°, and mercury
                    requires a temperature about 692°. The vaporific point, however, remains
                    constantly the same, in the same liquid, under the same barometric pressure. If,
                    however, we diminish the pressure, the liquid will boil at a lower temperature.
                    This is easily shown by the air-pump, in the exhausted receiver of which aether
                    will boil at a temperature considerably below the freezing point of water. It is
                    also strikingly exhibited by the following experiment: If a portion of water,
                    say two.ounces, be boiled in a flask capable of holding eight or ten, and if it
                    be corked whilst briskly boiling, a vacuum will be formed on its surface, by the
                    condensation of its vapour, on removing it from the lamp. As the steam
                    condenses, the liquid in the flask will begin to boil more briskly as the flask
                    cools; and if ŵe pour <hi rend="italic">cold</hi> water on this flask, the more
                    will the pressure of the vapour in the flask be removed', and the more violently
                    will the contained water boil. If now we pour <hi rend="italic">boiling</hi>
                    water on the flask, more steam will be formed, and the boiling will cease, but
                    will be again renewed on a second application of the <hi rend="italic">cold</hi>
                    water. This may be alternated for several times if the flask be well corked.</p>
                <p>As the boiling point of liquids varies exactly in the ratio of the barometrical
                    pressure, it is obvious that the height of mountains may be ascertained by
                    noting the thermometrical degree at which liquids boil on them. A portable
                    instrument, constructed for this purpose, was devised by the Reverend F.
                    Wollaston.</p>
                <p>We cannot heat any liquid beyond its boiling point in an open vessel. Water
                    placed on the fire soon rises to 212°, but a thermometer plunged in it remains
                    at this point, however long it boils; but if the vessel be provided with a
                    steam-tight cover, the temperature of the liquid may be much increased,
                    according to the strength of the vessel. The elasticity of the steam in such
                    cases is enormous; and experiments with steam under high pressure are hazardous,
                    unless the vessel be of great thickness. The Marquis of Worcester seems to have
                    burst a cannon by this means; and the frequent explosions of steam-engine
                    boilers is a familiar instance of the same. Dr Black and Mr Watt heated water in
                    a strong copper vessel to 400°; and in some of Perkins’ experiments lead was
                    melted, it is said, in water subjected to strong pressure; yet in an open vessel
                    we cannot heat water to more than 212°.</p>
                <p>Dr Black sagaciously and happily applied his doctrine of <hi rend="italic">latent
                    heat</hi> to explain the conversion of liquids into vapour. He remarked, that
                    when a kettle was placed on the fire it soon rose to 212°; but though the same
                    heat continued to be applied, it rose no higher. In one of his beautifully
                    simple and conclusive experiments, a vessel containing some water, at
                    temperature 50°, was placed on a red-hot iron plate; in four minutes it began to
                    boil, but it required twenty minutes to convert the whole into vapour. In the
                    first four minutes it had acquired an increase of 162° of tem perature; and as
                    the heat was uniform during the whole time of the experiment, it must have
                    received an equal quantity of heat during the whole interval; or, during the
                    other sixteen minutes, 810° must have flowed into it, yet during the whole time
                    a thermometer in it rose no higher than 212°. Black naturally inferred that this
                    large quan tity of heat, which disappeared, had entered into the vapour in a <hi
                    rend="italic">latent form.</hi></p>
                <p>A series of experiments were undertaken by him, and by his friend Mr Watt, from
                    which they inferred, that when water is converted into steam, it unites with
                    940° of heat, which the thermometer does not indicate; or, in Black’s
                    phraseology, that quantity becomes <hi rend="italic">latent</hi> in the steam.
                    This determination nearly coincides with the experiments of Lavoisier, who
                    estimated the quantity which thus disappears at 1000° Fahr.</p>
                <p>The absorption of heat during the formation of vapour is easily demonstrated. A
                    piece of muslin moistened with any liquid, laid on the bulb of a thermometer,
                    sinks the temperature; and if that liquid be very evaporable, the temperature
                    thus produced will be low in proportion. The evaporation of aether will freeze
                    water under the receiver of the air-pump; and the evaporation of the fluid
                    called sulphuret of carbon is so rapid, that, in a well-exhausted receiver, it
                    will freeze the mercury in the bulb of the thermometer.</p>
                <p>A liquid may even, by particular management, be frozen by its own evaporation.
                    This is the principle of Wollaston’s philosophic toy, called the <hi
                    rend="italic">cryophorus</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and it was ingeniously
                    applied to an important practical purpose by the late Sir John Leslie, viz. the
                    production of ice at a cheap rate in all climates. The apparatus employed by
                    this philosopher is a powerful air-pump, which can at once exhaust from three to
                    six flat receivers about twelve inches in diameter. These are fitted to
                    different plates, each connected with the pump, and each provided with its own
                    stop-cock. A shallow glass dish, nearly the width of the receiver, intended to
                    hold a thin stratum of sulphuric acid, is introduced under each receiver, and a
                    cup of porous earthenware, supported on a glass tripod about an inch above the
                    surface of the acid, is under each receiver. Water is to be poured into this
                    cup, which is to be placed on its tripod, and the whole covered by the receiver.
                    By working the air-pump, each receiver may be exhausted in succession. The
                    withdrawing of the atmospheric pressure causes the rapid evaporation of the
                    water, the vapour of which is immediately absorbed by the sulphuric acid; and
                    thus the vacuum is sustained. The latent heat necessary for the conversion of
                    the water into steam or vapour is derived from the water itself; its temperature
                    therefore falls; and the absorption of the vapour by the acid, as quickly as it
                    is formed, keeps up the vacuum, and speedily reduces the whole water to the
                    freezing point, when it soon forms a cake of ice. By a full-sized machine of
                    this kind, about a quarter of an hour’s labour will set the process in full
                    operation; and within the period of an hour afterwards six pounds of solid ice
                    may be obtained. During this process, the water loses only about one fiftieth of
                    its bulk; and the acid will be sufficiently strong for repeated operations of
                    the same kind.</p>
                <p>Leslie showed, that any substance which is powerfully absorbent of watery vapour,
                    may be substituted for the acid; and he found that highly toasted <hi
                    rend="italic">oat meal,</hi> or well-dried powder of <hi rend="italic"
                    >greenstone,</hi> had very considerable power to produce ice, when employed
                    instead of sulphuric acid. He even showed, that by enclosing a globule of
                    mercury in a small pyriform mass of ice, suspended over the acid in a good
                    vacuum, the mercury might easily be frozen.</p>
                <p>The latent heat of steam may be shown by the large quantity of water which may be
                    rapidly heated by a small <pb break="no" facs="nls:193641591"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0711-1591-0192"/>quantity of steam. The elegant distillatory
                    apparatus figured (No. 46) in Henry’s Chemistry readily proves this. In an
                    experiment with a similar apparatus, the condensation ol one ounce of steam
                    heated eight ounces of water from 60° to 180°; that is, the whole water gained
                    120° of temperature; consequently that ounce of steam had lost as much caloric
                    as would have elevated an ounce of any fluid, capable of being so heated, to
                    960°.</p>
                <p>The same phenomena attend the condensation of all other vapours; and we are to
                    regard the discovery of Black, <hi rend="italic">that during the conversion of
                    solids into liquids, or of liquids into vapours, heat is absorbed, which is
                    again given out on their</hi><hi rend="italic">recondensation,</hi> as a general
                    law, and one of the highest importance, both in its practical application, and
                    in explaining the phenomena of nature.</p>
                <p>With regard to those aeriform bodies which we cannot condense, or, as they are
                    called in chemical language, permanently elastic fluids or <hi rend="italic"
                    >gases,</hi> we have every reason to consider them but as vapours, of which the
                    po⅛t of generation is so low, that we have not yet found any means of exhibiting
                    them in their unelastic state. This view is supported by analogy, and by recent
                    discoveries. Some of the gases which a few years ago were reckoned permanently
                    elastic, have been, by a great pressure, reduced to the state of liquids. This
                    has been shown in the case of chlorine, muriatic acid, ammonia, and carbonic
                    acid. It can also be shown that gases contain latent caloric. Thus, if we
                    suddenly compress atmospheric air in a small tube fitted with a piston, so much
                    heat is given out as to ignite touchwood. The sudden expansion of air, too, is
                    always attended with the absorption of heat. Thus, on discharging an air-gun,
                    the sudden expansion of the air produces a sensible degree of coolness in the
                    condenser.</p>
                <p>The same facts are shown when chemical action of the gases with each other
                    produces condensation, or when they are evolved from their combinations.</p>
                <p>The qualities of vapour are applied to many important purposes in the useful
                    arts; and, on account of its economical fitness, the vapour of water, or <hi
                    rend="italic">steam,</hi> is that almost always employed.</p>
                <p>The application of steam to domestic purposes is familiar to all; and it is
                    frequently employed to communicate an equable heat, when a temperature above
                    212° would be injurious or dangerous. Thus steam, confined in metallic tubes, is
                    used to dry some delicate articles of manufacture; and in some instances, where
                    there is risk of explosion from even a moderate increase of temperature, the
                    same contrivance is adopted. Steam has also been employed to warm apartments. It
                    is employed to heat the dye-vats in calico-printing, and other species of
                    dyeing, and has likewise been used for h¢nting warm baths. For these last
                    purposes, the steam is usually allowed to escape into the fluid to be heated by
                    numerous small apertures in pipes coiled in the bottom of the vessel; which may
                    thus be made of less costly materials than if it were necessary to subject it to
                    the fire.</p>
                <p>The most important application of steam, however, is as a moving power in the
                    most stupendous of human inventions the <hi rend="italic">steam-engine,</hi> the
                    perfecting of which has conferred an enviable immortality on the name of <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Watt.</hi> The application of this noble discovery to the
                    moving of machinery of every sort, from the ponderous hammers of the <hi

                    >tambouring frame,</hi> to the drawing out and twisting the gossamer filaments
                    of the cotton factory, to the weaving of cloth with a celerity that gives the
                    process the air of enchantment, the winged velocity of the locomotive engine on
                    the railway, and the stately mechanism which renders navigation independent of
                    the winds, belongs to different branches of practical mechanics.</p>
                <p>The conversion of liquids into vapour is the foundation of the important arts of
                    <hi rend="italic">evaporation</hi> and <hi rend="italic">distillation.</hi> By
                    the first we obtain salts from their solutions; by the latter, the spirituous or

                <p>4. <hi rend="italic">Incandescence.</hi></p>
                <p>When the temperature of a body is raised to a certain pitch, it begins to emit
                    light as well as heat; and this is termed <hi rend="italic">incandescence,</hi>
                    or glowing heat; a designation preferable to <hi rend="italic">ignition,</hi>
                    which may be confounded with <hi rend="italic">combustion</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >;</hi> a process totally different from that treated of in this section,
                    inasmuch as it is accompanied by important chemical changes in the body acted
                    on; whereas incandescence may be repeated innumerable times with the same body,
                    merely by raising its temperature. The point at which this takes place would
                    seem to be the same in all bodies, and has been approximated by Newton; but as
                    the determination depends on the acuteness of the eye, and the degree of
                    obscurity in the apartment where the experiment is made, it is not easily fixed.
                    According to his calculations, a good eye can perceive a body faintly luminous
                    about 635° Fahrenheit; it shines with a full red in the dark about 752°, it is
                    luminous in twilight at 884°, and glows in broad day-light when its temperature
                    has reached 1000°. The experiments of Irvine, who found that mercury, which
                    boils at 660°, is not in the slightest degree luminous at that point, prove that
                    Newton fixed the point of incandescence too low. On the other hand, the
                    determination of Wedgwood appears too high. In general the point of
                    incandescence may be stated at about 800° Fahr. Its lowest pitch is at first a
                    dull red, which becomes a full red with an increased temperature, or the least
                    refrangible rays first meet the eye; if the heat be increased, these rays become
                    mingled with the yellow; and, when the temperature is raised to the utmost, all
                    the other rays of the spectrum are evolved in the proportions which constitute
                    <hi rend="italic">white light.</hi></p>
                <p>All solids which are not volatilized by heat may be rendered incandescent; and
                    all liquids may be heated to redness, provided we can repress their volatility.
                    But it has been doubted whether gases be capable of incandescence. Dr Fordyce
                    had remarked that the extremity of the flame of a blowpipe, which was itself
                    invisible, heated a thin rod of glass to a white heat; and some experiments of
                    Mr T. Wedgwood prove that air, heated in a bent tube passing through a crucible
                    filled with red-hot sand, was not luminous, although a gold wire suspended in
                    the heated air became red. The speculations of Sir Humphry Davy on flame show
                    that his opinion inclined to consider flame as luminous gases; but in all such
                    cases there is reason to consider the light as derived from the combustible.
                    Incandescence can be excited by the mere percussion of hard bodies against each
                    other. Thus, two pieces of quartz struck together will produce light; the same
                    will take place with two fragments of porcelain; and the light produced by the
                    collision of flint and steel is partly incandescence, partly a species of
                    combustion of the steel.</p>
                <p>It has been supposed that incandescence affords a probable evidence of the
                    identity or convertibility of heat into light. But this is not a legitimate
                    deduction; for we may conceive that light and heat, though two distinct fluids,
                    may have an intimate affinity for each other, or a tendency to unite, that both
                    may exist united in all matter, that heat is most easily separated by percussion
                    and friction, but that, when the percussion is violent, both are given out.</p>
                <p>SECT. IV— <hi rend="smallcaps">quantity of heat in bodies.</hi></p>
                <p>Equal weights of the same body, at the same temperature, contain equal quantities
                    of heat; and when their tern·</p>

                <p>peratures are unequal, their heat is in proportion to their temperature. But it
                    is very different with dissimilar bodies, which can be shown to contain unequal
                    quantities of heat at the same temperature. The following is the method of
                    proving these positions. If we mix a pound of water at 40° with a pound of water
                    at 112°, the resultant is 76°, the mean between the extremes of temperature.</p>
                <p>But if we mingle a pound of water at temperature 112° with a pound of mercury at
                    40°, the resultant temperature will not be 76°, the mean, but 109°. Here the
                    temperature of the water has only been diminished 3°, yet that of the mercury
                    has risen 69°. If we reverse the experiment, and take water at 40° and mercury
                    at 112°, the product will be 43°; the mercury losing 69°, whilst the water only
                    acquires 3°; or the same quantity of heat which can elevate the temperature of
                    mercury 23° will only augment that of water l <hi rend="superscript"> o</hi>. If
                    a similar experiment be made with spermaceti oil, Dr Thomson has shown <hi
                    rend="italic">{System of Chemistry)</hi> that the quantity of caloric which will
                    elevate the temperature of the oil 2° can only raise that of water 1°.</p>
                <p>Dr Black was undoubtedly the first who promulgated the idea of the absorption of
                    heat during liquefaction and the formation of vapour; and this doctrine was
                    publicly taught in his lectures in Glasgow university from 1757 to 1764. His
                    pupil, Dr Irvine, continued these experiments at his suggestion, and ascribed
                    the absorption to a change in the <hi rend="italic">capacity for heat.</hi>
                    These experiments were made between 1765 and 1770; and in 1779 Dr Adair Crawford
                    published his treatise on <hi rend="italic">Animal Heat,</hi> in which the
                    capacities of numerous substances are given, which were corrected in his edition
                    of 1788, from the results of most elaborate experiments. Professor Wilcke of
                    Stockholm published some valuable experiments on the same subject, in the
                    Stockholm Transactions for 1781. This philosopher introduced the term <hi
                    rend="italic">specific heat</hi> for what Irvine named <hi rend="italic"
                    >capacity for heat.</hi> Various experiments on the same subject were made by
                    Lavoisier and Laplace, with the instrument called a <hi rend="italic"
                    >calorimeter,</hi> in which the specific caloric was estimated by the quantity
                    of snow melted by different substances heated to the same pitch. The subject of
                    experiment in their investigations was introduced into a wire cage suspended
                    within a vessel of tinned iron. This vessel was filled with snow or ice; and to
                    secure that snow from being melted by the external air, the vessel containing it
                    was placed within another exterior case, and the space between them also filled
                    with snow; and the whole covered by a lid, likewise covered with snow. Thus, if
                    water in passing from 2l2° to 32° melted one pound of ice, and the same weight
                    of oil melted a half pound; if the specific caloric of water be termed 1∙0, that
                    of oil will be 0∙5.</p>
                <p>A considerable series of experiments on this· curious subject were made by Dr
                    Dalton <hi rend="italic">{New System of Chemical Philosophy).</hi> In these
                    investigations Dalton pursued a method, also employed by Leslie, namely, to
                    observe the comparative rates of cooling, as was proposed by Meyer. This would
                    be preferable to the other modes of ascertaining the specific caloric, were we
                    sure that the cooling of bodies is not influenced by other circumstances than
                    their capacity; but in this method it is difficult to obviate the effects of
                    radiation and conducting power on refrigeration. In all these determinations
                    there are to be foynd discrepancies inseparable from the difficulties attending
                    such delicate investigations; but they have sufficient accordance when we
                    attempt to estimate the capacities of solids and of liquids. It is a far more
                    difficult and delicate problem to determine the specific caloric of gaseous
                    bodies, from the minute quantities of matter to be operated on in such
                    experiments, and the difficulty of obviating the chance of accidental error
                    where the changes of temperature are necessarily very minute. Crawford found the
                    difference in the specific heat of the gases rarely to exceed <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 1</hi><hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> θth of a degree of
                    Fahrenheit. He employed two equal hollow spheres of brass, united by a bar of
                    the same metal, and furnished with stop-cocks, and an adapting piece, to be
                    screwed to an air-pump. One of these was filled with the gas to be tried, and
                    the other was exhausted of air. Each ball had cemented into it a very delicate
                    thermometer; both were heated to the same pitch by exposure to the same source
                    of heat, conveyed by cylinders surrounded with warm water. They were then
                    simultaneously plunged into separate vessels containing each equal quantities of
                    cold water, and the elevation of temperature of the water in both vessels
                    ascertained by delicate thermometers, indicating as small a change as Ath of a
                    degree of Fahrenheit. The temperature communicated by the vacuum being
                    subtracted from that given out by the other ball, the difference exhibited the
                    heat communicated by the included air alone; and the accuracy of the method was
                    afterwards tested by again comparing them when the exhausted vessel was filled
                    with atmospheric air.</p>
                <p>The specific caloric of gases has been again investigated by Berard and Delaroche
                    in 1813. They passed a current of each gas, at a given temperature, through a
                    spiral tube, fixed in a cylinder of thin copper filled with water and then
                    closed. The temperature communicated, by the passage of the gases from a
                    gasometer through the spiral, to the surrounding medium in a given time, being
                    proportional to the excess of temperature each gas acquires from the source of
                    heat above that of the medium in the cylinder, the comparative specific heat of
                    each gas may be ascertained.</p>
                <p>For the success of such experiments the current of gas must be uniform, and the
                    temperature of the gas, when entering and escaping from the cylinder, must be
                    accurately ascertained, as well as that of the water in the copper vessel.</p>
                <p>The conclusions of these philosophers are directly at variance with those of
                    Crawford, and, indeed, would tend to overturn some of the most important points
                    of the philosophy of heat now generally received. But these experiments, though
                    highly ingenious, are not more satisfactory than those of Crawford. The only
                    objection to his conclusions is derived from the smallness of the quantities
                    operated upon in his experiments; but the simplicity of his apparatus, the
                    delicacy of his instruments, and the apparent care of his manipulations, more
                    than fully counterbalance that objection; whilst the complexity of the apparatus
                    of Berard and Delaroche, the acknowledged difficulty of keeping up an equable
                    current through the spiral tube, the impossibility of obviating in such
                    investigations the influence of changes in the medium during the experiments,
                    and the nicety requisite to ascertain the temperature of the entering and
                    escaping currents, present sources of error of which it is almost impossible to
                    estimate the amount. On these grounds we may consider the conclusions of
                    Crawford as not yet overturned.</p>
                <p>The deductions of these gentlemen would lead to the conclusion that all the
                    gases, with the exception of hydrogen, have an inferior specific gravity to
                    water; and they even make steam <hi rend="italic">inferior</hi> in capacity to
                    water in the ratio of 847 to 1000. If this last were true, instead of an
                    absorption of heat when steam is generated, we should have an extrication of
                    caloric from it; and water in the <hi rend="italic">worm-tub</hi> of a still, or
                    in the <hi rend="italic">condensing-bach</hi> of a steam-engine, ought not to
                    increase in temperature. It may be added, that more recently the conclusions of
                    Berard and Delaroche have been controverted by Delarive; and his experiments, as
                    well as those of Clement, support the opinions of Crawford.</p>
                <p>Mr Haycraft (in a naper in <hi rend="italic">Trans. Royal Soc. Edin.</hi> x.) <pb

                    to show that all gases at the same temperature, when perfectly freed from
                    moisture, have the same specific heat; and that when they are saturated with
                    water, their specific caloric is a certain ascending arithmetical ratio, in
                    proportion to the quantity of moisture they contain. These views are rendered
                    not improbable by the well-ascertained fact, that the elasticities of all the
                    gases are the same at the same temperature.</p>
                <p>The capacities of bodies are more nearly in the inverse ratio of their density,
                    than of any other sensible property. Thus solids in general have less capacity
                    for caloric than liquids, and liquids less than vapours or gaseous bodies. In
                    the same body a change of capacity accompanies a change of volume. Thus gases
                    compressed have their capacity diminished, and heat is extricated; and when they
                    expand, their capacity is increased, which is the cause of the coldness felt on
                    a sudden expansion of the air. Crawford endeavoured to show that this was also
                    the case with liquids; but his experiments are scarcely to be relied on as
                    establishing that point. The contraction of Wedgwood’s pyrometrical pieces would
                    seem to diminish sensibly their capacity for heat. The capacity of bodies is
                    not, however, exactly in the inverse ratio of their density, which probably
                    arises from the effect of density on capacity for heat being modified by a
                    difference in the force of affinity between caloric and various substances.
                    There seems also to be some relation between capacity and power for conducting
                    heat, as the former is nearly in the inverse ratio of the latter. If these views
                    be correct, we may assume that the capacity of all bodies for caloric is
                    directly as their volume and their affinity for heat, and inversely as their
                    conducting power and their density.</p>
                <p>When a body changes its form of existence, its capacity for heat is also changed.
                    When a solid is melted, its capacity is increased, and the specific heat of the
                    same substance is still further increased when it is converted into vapour.
                    Thus, according to the best experiments, the capacity of ice is 0∙9000, that of
                    water being 1∙000, and that of steam 1∙500.</p>
                <p>This important law was applied by Dr Irvine to explain the liquefaction of
                    solids. Dr Black regarded the liquefaction as owing to the absorption of heat;
                    Dr Irvine ascribed this absorption to a change in the capacity of the body. The
                    first ascribed the melting of the solid to the absorption of the heat, whilst
                    the other attributed the absorption to the change of form. As the change of form
                    and the absorption or extrication of caloric are in such cases simultaneous, it
                    is obvious that the question cannot be decided by direct experiment. It has been
                    objected to Irvine’s theory that it assigns no cause for the change of form,
                    whilst Black’s ascribes the change to the ingress of caloric. On the other hand,
                    Black’s theory does not explain why the heat is absorbed. When we heat a solid,
                    the first effect is expansion, and this expansion keeping pace with the
                    increasing temperature, a point will be attained when the expansion has so far
                    overcome the cohesion of the solid that its particles move freely among each
                    other, that is, when the body will become liquid. Thus far the change may be
                    attributed to sensible heat; but the capacity of the body for heat has all the
                    time been increasing, and, to satisfy this increased capacity, sensible heat has
                    become latent. This appears the simplest view of the subject, ascribing the
                    change of capacity to the expansion by the sensible heat; and the difference
                    between the solid and fluid states may be conceived to depend on the prevalence
                    of one of two opposing forms, the cohesive attraction of the particles of matter
                    for each other, and the repulsive energy of caloric.</p>
                <p>Dr Black has supposed that latent heat is retained in bodies by an affinity
                    superior to that between sensible caloric and the particles of matter, and
                    liquefaction is ascribed to this more intimate union. This opinion is scarcely
                    perhaps reconcilable with the immediate effect of mixing ice cooled to 20° and
                    water a little above the freezing point, when the water parts with its latent
                    heat to raise the temperature of the ice; or with the effect of mechanical
                    pressure in causing gases to part with their latent caloric.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Absolute Quantity of Heat in Bodies.</hi></p>
                <p>It will be sufficiently obvious, that neither by the thermometer nor by the
                    capacity of bodies do we determine the whole heat which they contain at any
                    temperature. The first is evidently nothing more than an indication of changes
                    in a scale, of which the two extremes are unknown; the last mode affords us but
                    the relative quantity of caloric required to elevate the temperature of other
                    bodies compared to water, but it does not point out how many degrees any given
                    temperature is above that point at which a body is deprived of all its heat.
                    Irvine appears to have first conceived the idea of ascertaining by calculation
                    the absolute zero, or deprivation of all heat, on the supposition that the whole
                    heat in any body is proportional to its capacity. If this be granted, the whole
                    caloric it contains at a given temperature may be found by ascertaining the
                    quantity of heat it absorbs when passing from the solid to the liquid state.
                    Thus ice has the capacity of 9 to water as 10, and, when both are at temperature
                    32°, water will contain one tenth more heat than the same weight of ice; but
                    this excess is given out when water freezes, and as much is again absorbed when
                    it melts. According to Black’s experiment, ice absorbs as much caloric, whilst
                    passing into water, as would elevate an equal quantity of ice-cold water 140°
                    Fahrenheit. Therefore 10 × 140 = 1400°, will give the <hi rend="italic">natural
                    zero,</hi> or the point of the absolute deprivation of heat Almost the same
                    result is obtained by comparing the capacity of steam and water, viz. 1∙0 and 1
                    ’ 5. Water, in passing into steam, absorbs 940° of sensible heat, and 940 × 1∙5
                    = 1410.</p>
                <p>The following general formula, as applicable to this investigation, is given by
                    Professor Robison in his notes on Black’s Lectures. Let the capacity of water be
                    1. Let the quantity of water be W, and its temperature be <hi rend="italic"
                    >w.</hi> Let the quantity of the body whose capacity is tried be B, and its
                    temperature be <hi rend="italic">b,</hi> and the temperature after mixture be
                    <hi rend="italic">m.</hi> Then the</p>

                    >m</hi></p>
                <p>B X wi — <hi rend="italic">b</hi></p>
                <p>The accuracy of this conclusion, however, depends on three points: first, the
                    perfect determination of the specific heat of water, and of its two other forms
                    of existence, to which it is probably impossible to obtain any more than an
                    approximation; secondly, on the assumption that the whole heat of bodies is
                    retained in them by their capacity; and, lastly, on the supposition that while
                    the body retains its form of existence, its capacity remains unchanged. Until
                    these points be established, the theory is but an amusing speculation, in which
                    the estimates of other philosophers do not materially differ from those of
                    Irvine. Rumford, from experiments on the heat extricated by the combination of
                    hydrogen and oxygen, placed the natural zero at 1552° Fahrenheit below the
                    freezing point; Gadolin, from the cold produced by dissolving muriate of soda in
                    water, inferred it to be at — 1432°.</p>

                <p>SECT. V.—VARIATIONS OF TEMPERATURE.</p>
                <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Artificial Means of Increasing Temperature.</hi></p>
                <p>Caloric may be excited by the sun’s rays collected by a lens or by a concave
                    mirror, by friction and percussion, and by chemical action.</p>
                <p>1. When we collect the sun’s rays by a lens, it is well known that combustibles
                    may thus be fired; and if the lens be large, it produces the most intense
                    temperature we can command. In the focus of the powerful lens made in London for
                    Mr Parker (which measured three feet in diameter, three inches thick at the
                    centre, and weighed 212 lbs.), the most infusible metals were instantly melted
                    and dissipated in vapour, and most stony substances were vitrified. Another,
                    constructed at Paris, is described in the <hi rend="italic">Memoires</hi> of the
                    French academy. Lenses of great power have been also made of two curved plates
                    of glass joined together, and filled with spirit of wine. A remarkable lens of
                    this sort, formed by bending two plates of glass on a parabolic mold, and
                    filling the cavity between them with ninety quarts of spirit, was constructed by
                    Rossini of Gratz, in Styria. The diameter of the plates was 3 feet 3 inches, and
                    they were united by a strong ring of metal. The whole was mounted on a
                    heliostat, which, with the lens complete, weighed 550 lbs. This fine instrument
                    cost about L.1000; but became, a few years ago, the property of the French
                    government for L.338. In its focus a diamond was instantly kindled and
                    dissipated; and a piece of platinum, twenty-nine grains in weight, was melted
                    and thrown into violent ebullition.</p>
                <p>Concave metallic mirrors are capable also of concentrating the sun’s rays, so as
                    to produce a powerful heat. Mirrors of hammered brass, or tinned iron, are used
                    for experiments on the radiation of heat. It was by some combination of mirrors
                    that Archimedes is said to have fired the Roman fleet at the siege of Syracuse;
                    and Kircher, having found a description in Tzetzes, of the device of Archimedes,
                    from which it would seem that the mirrors were placed on <hi rend="italic"
                    >hinges,</hi> in order to adjust them to a focus, constructed a compound burning
                    mirror of this kind possessing considerable power; but Buffon, by combining as
                    many as 168 plane glass mirrors, six inches broad, showed that silver might be
                    fused at the distance of sixty feet by such an instrument.</p>
                <p>2. The capability of friction between two solids to excite heat is well known. In
                    Rumford’s experiments water was made to boil by the friction in boring a cannon;
                    and the simple experiment of rubbing a smooth metallic button on a board, by
                    which much heat is produced, is familiar to every school-boy. The firing of
                    carriagewheels, and of different kinds of machinery, whose parts, moving against
                    each other, are not well oiled, is well known. This extrication of heat takes
                    place <hi rend="italic">in vacuo</hi> as well as in the air, and appears to be
                    owing to the compression employed forcing the particles of the solid more
                    closely together, and extricating their latent caloric. Berthollet showed that
                    this extrication of caloric is not unlimited, as Rumford erroneously supposed;
                    but that, if we repeatedly compress any body, the quantity of heat extricated
                    rapidly diminishes by each application of the compressing force.</p>
                <p>Percussion acts in precisely the same manner. A piece of iron, by smart hammering
                    on an anvil, may become so hot as to fire combustibles. This process evidently
                    diminishes the capacity of the iron for heat, its specific gravity becomes
                    greater, and the loss of its latent heat renders it stiff and brittle. A similar
                    change takes place in <hi rend="italic">wiredrawing</hi> metals; so that, to
                    restore pliability and ductility, we must subject them to the fire, which
                    restores their latent heat, and renders them again ductile.</p>
                <p>3. Chemical action is a fruitful source of increase of temperature. If we mingle
                    together equal parts of sulphuric acid and water, or of alcohol and of water,
                    the ' bulk of the mixture diminishes, and heat is given out. The temperature
                    produced by chemical action will often ignite inflammables. Thus a drop of
                    sulphuric acid on a mixture of chlorate of potassa and sugar will set the
                    mixture on fire. Indeed, the process of combustion, the great source of
                    artificial heat, is nothing more than the chemical union of the oxygen of the
                    air with the combustible body. The source of the temperature is the liberation
                    of the latent heat of the oxygen, on its entering into union with the
                    carbonaceous matter of the fuel; and the increase of the temperature is in
                    proportion to the air consumed in a given time. If we wish a higher temperature,
                    we increase the quantity of air that passes through the fuel; hence the utility
                    of bellows, and of the blowpipe, in exciting a higher temperature than the
                    spontaneous combustion of the burning body would afford.</p>
                <p>The construction of furnaces for the melting of metals depends on this principle;
                    namely, that of causing a large quantity of air to pass through the fire in a
                    short period.</p>
                <p>The heating of apartments by an open fire-place partly depends on somewhat
                    different principles. We must not only secure a proper draught of air up the
                    chimney to consume the fuel, but we must secure the <hi rend="italic">radiation
                    of heat</hi> into the room. Dark and rough surfaces radiate much of their
                    communicated heat; and therefore, when any part of the grate is intended to
                    afford the heat it receives from the fire to the air of the room, it should be
                    of cast iron with some pattern on its surface, not of bright polished metal.
                    This also forms the best material for a stove; but in open fire-places the
                    heating of the apartment not only depends on what is radiated into the room, but
                    also on what is <hi rend="italic">reflected.</hi> As bright surfaces reflect
                    best, the <hi rend="italic">covings of</hi> the grate should be of bright and
                    polished metal, and placed at about an angle of 45° to the back of the grate. By
                    this disposition the heat of the fire, falling on the covings, is reflected at
                    the same angle into the room; and we thus obtain a more considerable effect from
                    the same expenditure of fuel.</p>
                <p>For large apartments, and for public buildings, heat has been more effectually
                    conveyed by the hot-air stoves of Dr Murray, and of Mr Strutt as improved by
                    Sylvester. The principle of these inventions is to heat a current of air, by
                    passing it between an interior <hi rend="italic">cockle</hi> or furnace
                    containing the fuel, and an exterior case, at the distance of a few inches from
                    the cockle. The air so heated is admitted into the space to be warmed, and
                    diffuses an equable warmth through the building. The only objection to hot air
                    so introduced is the empyreumatic odour which the heat of the cockle, when not
                    well managed, is apt to communicate to the air. But this objection is obviated
                    by the contrivance of Mr Perkins, in which hot water is made to circulate
                    through wrought iron tubes; and when more heat is required, these tubes are
                    coiled up in several convolutions in the place where the most heat is wanted. In
                    this city, the large premises of Messrs Cadell and Company, booksellers, are so
                    heated; and the General Register House will in a short period be warmed by a
                    similar apparatus.</p>
                <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Artificial Means of Diminishing Temperature.</hi></p>
                <p>There are three methods by which we can cool bodies; by placing them in contact
                    with colder substances, by the evaporation of liquids, and by the liquefaction
                    of solids.</p>
                <p>1. The first method is very familiar, and dépends on the tendency of caloric to
                    an <hi rend="italic">equilibrium</hi> in contiguous bodies.</p>
                <p>2. The conversion of a body into vapour causes, by the increase of its capacity
                    for heat, an absorption of caloric.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:193641643" xml:id="kp-eb0711-1643-0196"/>
                <p>Thus the evaporation of water from the ball of a thermometer causes the mercury
                    to fall. If we apply a still more evaporable fluid, aether, the fall of the
                    thermometer will be still lower; and, if we accelerate this process by an
                    air-pump, the cold produced will be intense; the degree of the absorption of
                    heat, or, in other words, the production of cold, being in proportion to the
                    quickness of the evaporation.</p>
                <p>. 3. The most powerful means of reducing temperature is by what are termed <hi
                    rend="italic">freezing mixtures.</hi> All these depend on the rapid melting of
                    solids by the addition of various substances. Many experiments have been made on
                    this subject by Lowitz of Petersburg, and by Mr Walker of Cambridge. Salts are
                    the solids most commonly used, and they are in general either mixed with snow or
                    with acids. Thus, if we mix common salt and snow together, the temperature falls
                    to 0° of Fahrenheit. If we pour two ounces of nitric acid diluted with an equal
                    quantity of water on three ounces of sulphate of soda, the temperature sinks
                    below the beginning of Fahrenheit’s scale. Equal parts of strong muriatic acid
                    and of snow will produce a cold of — 30° Fahrenheit; and the same proportions of
                    diluted sulphuric acid and snow, if previously cooled down to 20°, will cause
                    the freezing of mercury, reducing the temperature to — 60°. Dry muriate of lime
                    and dry powdery snow, in the proportions of two of the former to one of the
                    latter, if previously cooled by immersion in salt and snow, will sink the
                    temperature to — 66°; and three parts of muriate of lime and two of snow,
                    similarly treated, will reduce the temperature to — 73°.</p>
                <p>In all these experiments, it is the sudden conversion of sensible into, latent
                    heat that lowers the temperature of the mixtures; the substances assume the
                    liquid form, their capacity for heat is increased, and the disappearance of the
                    sensible heat is manifested by the sinking of the thermometer.</p>
                <p>3. <hi rend="italic">Natural Variations of Temperature.</hi></p>
                <p>The temperature of the earth is affected by the absorption of the solar rays. The
                    revolution of the earth on its axis brinġs successive portions of its surface
                    under the immediate influence of the sun, and this portion is greatly extended
                    on either side of the equator by the beautifully simple yet stupendous
                    contrivance of the inclination of that axis to the plane of its orbit. These
                    causes produce variations in natural temperature; and as they are uniform and
                    constant in their operation, the temperature of any place is liable to little
                    change, if compared for a series of years, however subject to inequalities in
                    short intervals of time.</p>
                <p>The mean temperature of any climate cannot be ascertained by a few observations
                    on the heat of the air; but experience has shown that the mean temperature of
                    the month of April, in our latitudes, will afford a near approximation to that
                    of the whole year. The surface of the ground absorbs the heat of the sun, and
                    becomes thereby warmed; but much of the heat so acquired is lost by radiation
                    during the night, as we have already explained. The surplus heat is slowly
                    transmitted downwards. The experiments made by Mr Ferguson, at Raith, in
                    Fifeshire, by burying very large thermometers at different depths in his garden,
                    showed that during summer the increasing heat penetrated through the ground
                    about five feet each month, or about two inches daily; so that the whole heat of
                    the summer six months would penetrate to about thirty feet, which agrees
                    remarkably with the experiments made by Saussure on the banks of the Arve, near
                    Geneva. There the heat of summer took six months to penetrate thirty-one feet;
                    and beyond that depth the temperature of the earth underwent no change from the
                    summer’s heat or the winter’s cold. Hence deep caves, or springs whose sources
                    are from a considerable depth, may be considered' as affording a tolerable
                    approximation to the mean annual temperature of the places where they occur.
                    This, however, is not always true. The writer of this article, during several
                    years, occasionally took the temperature of the largest spring in Great Britain,
                    <hi rend="italic">St Winifred’s,</hi> at Holywell, in Flintshire; and the
                    temperature of its water was always considerably higher than 50°, the mean
                    temperature . of that part of the island. In three successive years it was about
                    57°, and never but once, after heavy rain, observed so low as 55°, whilst
                    another very copious contiguous spring, the sacred well of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Einnon Asa,</hi> was no more than 50°.</p>
                <p>Latitude must exert a great influence on the temperature of the earth, as is
                    sufficiently obvious; but the extremes of temperature, at different times, in
                    the same place, are less within the tropics than toward the polar limits of the
                    temperate and in the frigid zones; for the difference of heat at different
                    seasons must be less, in those regions where the sun is twice vertical annually,
                    than in higher latitudes.</p>
                <p>There are two other causes which exert no small influence on the heat of a
                    climate, the vicinity of the ocean, and elevation above its level.</p>
                <p>From the enormous mass of the ocean, its waters, except in the vicinity of land
                    or polar ices, have a remarkable uniformity of temperature in almost every
                    climate; and hence the ocean may be considered as the <hi rend="italic">great
                    equalizer of heat</hi> over the globe, tending to mitigate the fervour of
                    tropical climates, and the rigour of the polar regions.</p>
                <p>When cold air sweeps over the surface of the ocean, it tends to cool the
                    particles of water at the surface; but by this process their specific gravity is
                    increased, and they sink, whilst their place is supplied by fresh particles from
                    below, which, becoming cooled in their turn, give rise to internal motions in
                    the water. From its immense mass, it is evident that no partial application of
                    cold air can reduce the mean temperature of its whole waters; and hence we find
                    that the temperature of islands in our latitudes is not so low in winter as that
                    of continents under the same parallel. Thus, the severity of winter in Britain
                    bears no proportion to that of France or Germany in the same parallels of
                    latitude. The most northern of the Orkney Islands is nearly in the latitude of
                    Petersburg, yet in the former a continued frost for three or four days is a rare
                    occurrence, whilst in the latter the rapid and spacious Neva is completely
                    frozen over for several months every season.</p>
                <p>On the other hand, the ocean exerts a great influence in mitigating the heat of
                    tropical regions. It is true that when the upper-particles of water become
                    heated, the internal motions from unequal temperature cease; but the rarefaction
                    produced sets a current in motion, which, aided by the trade winds, becomes very
                    manifest amongst the West Indian islands in the <hi rend="italic">Gulf
                    Stream</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> the place of which is supplied by currents
                    of cooler water perpetually setting in from the polar regions. But this is not
                    all. The temperature of the atmosphere is mightily diminished by the increased
                    evaporation from the water in warm latitudes; and we have seen, that during this
                    conversion of water into vapour, as much heat becomes latent as would raise the
                    temperature of an equal quantity of other matter by at least 900° Fahrenheit.
                    Hence tropical islands are less warm than continents under the same parallel;
                    and the intersection of continents by gulfs and seas tends to mitigate the
                    extremes of temperature. The extended form of the old continent towards the
                    eastern regions of Asia renders the inequalities of temperature much greater
                    than under the same parallels in Europe. Thus, at <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193641656" xml:id="kp-eb0711-1656-0197"/>Pekin, the thermometer in
                    winter often descends far below the freezing point, and averages, during the
                    night, for several months, 20° Fahrenheit: yet this place is under the same
                    parallel of latitude as the finest provinces of Southern Italy and the centre of
                    Spain.</p>
                <p>But of all the causes influencing the temperature of a country, there is none
                    more important than that of elevation above the level of the sea. In every
                    climate, as is well known, the temperature diminishes as we rise in the
                    atmosphere; and if mountains be very lofty, their summits are the abode of
                    perpetual winter. This is best explained by the fact, that as we rarefy air, its
                    capacity for caloric is increased; the consequence of which is, that its
                    temperature falls as its sensible is converted into latent heat. In passing
                    through air, the sun’s rays do not sensibly heat it; but when they impinge on
                    the opake surface of the earth, they are retained, raise its temperature, and a
                    part of this increased heat is communicated to the contiguous stratum of air,
                    which expands, ascends, and has its place supplied by a cooler stratum, which
                    ascends in its turn. Thus the earth warms the air near the surface; but as the
                    pressure of the column of air diminishes by its ascent, its redundant heat
                    becomes latent as the volume of the air augments; so that, at moderate
                    elevations, the atmosphere receives no genial influence from the warmth imparted
                    to the earth; and very lofty mountains, in all climates, are covered with
                    perennial snow, and where the temperature is steadily below the freezing point,
                    there is perpetual congelation. The point at which this takes place is different
                    in different latitudes. The limit is highest under the equator, and descends as
                    we approach the poles. It is obvious too that the influence of the seasons,
                    especially in those countries where there is a great difference between the
                    temperature of summer and winter, will alter the limit of perpetual congelation.
                    In such climates it will fluctuate with the seasons between two points, which
                    form what are termed the <hi rend="italic">higher and lower limits</hi> of
                    congelation. The difference between these limits is least in tropical regions,
                    but increases toward the poles. This circumstance is of great importance,
                    inasmuch as it influences the formation of the stupendous glaciers, which excite
                    the curiosity and admiration of the traveller, in the elevated regions of the
                    temperate, and on the acclivities of the arctic circle.</p>
                <p>The ascent of heated air from the heated surface of the earth might be supposed
                    to warm the superior regions of the atmosphere, were not this counteracted by
                    the increased capacity of rarefied air for heat, by which much more is absorbed
                    than the ascending air can carry with it; but, on the other hand, the too great
                    loss of heat in the lower strata of air is provided against, by the change of
                    capacity which takes place as cool air descends to supply the place of that
                    which has ascended. Its density is increased by increasing pressure,
                    consequently its capacity for heat is diminished; and the heat thus extricated
                    is imparted to the contiguous strata of air. That these two processes
                    counterbalance each other is very obvious, from the uniformity of mean
                    temperature in any spot.</p>
                <p>The influence of elevation above the level of the sea is capable of
                    countervailing the effect of low latitudes on the vegetable productions of such
                    regions. Tournefort had remarked the succession of plants on the ascent of Mount
                    Ararat, which gave him, in Armenia, the vegetable forms of different parts of
                    Europe. In Wahlenberg’s <hi rend="italic">Flora Lap-pθiiica,</hi> this
                    distribution of vegetable forms into zones is well characterized. The same is
                    remarked iń Ramond’s examination of the botany of the Pyrenees; and the
                    illustrious traveller Humboldt has given a striking illustration of the same
                    distribution, in his examination of the equinoctial Andes. After rising through
                    various parallel belts or zones of vegetation, each marked by some
                    characteristic plants, if the mountains be sufficiently high, in all latitudes
                    we arrive at the region of stunted shrubs, and of Alpine plants and grasses,
                    amongst which the genera <hi rend="italic">gentiana,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >ranunculus,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">saxifraga,</hi> are conspicuous; and,
                    finally, we trace <hi rend="italic">byssi,</hi><hi rend="italic">hepaticae,</hi>
                    and <hi rend="italic">lichenes,</hi> the last outskirts of vegetable life, to
                    the very verge of perennial winter.</p>
                <p>These various causes affecting natural temperature render it impossible to
                    estimate the mean heat of any country by its latitude; and as every formula
                    hitherto devised for calculating the mean temperature of any region is now found
                    to be erroneous, it is only by multiplied observations that we can arrive at any
                    accurate conclusion. In the mean time Humboldt has conferred a great favour on
                    meteorological science by his admirable paper <hi rend="italic">On Isothermal
                    Lines, and the Distribution of Heat over the Globe.</hi> Setting aside all
                    hypothetical views, he has traced on a chart, from the best meteorological
                    observations, lines of <hi rend="italic">equal temperatures</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">;</hi> so that at a glance we can trace the places which are found
                    to have the same mean temperature. From this map we immediately perceive how
                    widely these isothermal lines differ from the parallels of latitude; and we
                    remark, that the isothermal lines of Western Europe sink to a far lower latitude
                    as they recede on either hand. Thus, the isothermal line of temperature 54° ∙4
                    in France, in longitude 0. 37. east, passes through latitude 45. 46. north; but
                    in China, in longitude 116. 27. east, passes near Pekin, in latitude 39. 54.
                    north; and in longitude 104. west, near the mouth of Columbia River, in America,
                    it passes through 44. 40. north. The isothermal lines, however, on the eastern
                    side of the Rocky Mountains, descend still lower, compared to their position in
                    Europe, as the following table shows :—</p>

                <p>In both continents the most rapid decrease of mean temperature is between the
                    parallels of latitude 40° and 45°; a circumstance which, Humboldt justly
                    remarks, has undoubtedly had a happy influence on the civilization and industry
                    of the people inhabiting that zone, because these slight variations of latitude
                    produce considerable changes in the vegetable productions that become objects of
