                <p><label type="entry">HERCULANEUM</label>, the name of an ancient city of Campania,
                    in Italy, which was destroyed by an eruption of Vesuvius in the first year of
                    the Emperor Titus, or the 79th of the Christian era; and which has been rendered
                    interesting on account of the curious monuments of antiquity discovered and
                    disinterred from its ruins. The epoch of the foundation of Herculaneum is
                    unknown. Dionysius of Halicarnassus conjectures that it may be referred to a
                    period about half a century anterior to the war of Troy, or about 1340 years
                    before Christ; and therefore that it lasted about 1400 years.</p>
                <p>The thickness of the heap of lava and ashes by which the city was overwhelmed has
                    been much increased by successive streams vomited forth since that catastrophe,
                    and now forms a mass twenty-four feet deep, of dark gray stone, which is easily
                    broken in pieces. By its non-adhesion to foreign bodies, marbles and bronzes are
                    preserved in it as in a case made to fit them; and exact moulds of the faces and
                    limbs of statues are frequently found in this substance. The precise situation
                    of this subterranean city was not known till the year 1713, when it was
                    accidentally discovered by some labourers, who, in digging a well, struck upon a
                    statue on the benches of the theatre. Many others were afterwards excavated and
                    sent to France by the Prince of Elboeuf. But little progress was made in the
                    excavations till the Infanta Charles of Spain ascended the throne of Naples,
                    when, by unwearied efforts and great liberality, a considerable portion of
                    Herculaneum was explored, and such treasures of antiquity thence extracted, as
                    form the most curious museum in the world. To attempt removing the covering
                    being found too arduous a task, the king contented himself with cutting
                    galleries to the principal buildings, and causing one or two of them to be
                    cleared out. Of these the theatre is the most considerable. On a balustrade
                    which divided the orchestra from the stage was found a row of statues; and, on
                    each side of the pulpitum, the equestrian figure of a person of the Nonia
                    íamily. From the great rarity of equestrian statues in marble, these would have
                    been very valuable objects had their workmanship been even less excellent than
                    it is; and one of them in particular is a very fine piece of sculpture. After
                    the king of Spain left Naples, the digging was continued, but with less spirit
                    and expenditure; indeed, the collection of curiosities derived from Herculaneum
                    and Pompeii had become so considerable, that a relaxation of zeal and activity
                    ensued. These relics are arranged in a wing of the palace, and not only consist
                    of statues, busts, altars, inscriptions, and other ornamental appendages of
                    ancient opulence and luxury, but comprehend an entire assortment of the
                    domestic, musical, and chirurgical instruments used by the ancients; tripods of
                    elegant form and exquisite execution, lamps in endless variety; vases and basins
                    of noble dimensions, chandeliers of the most beautiful shapes, paterae and other
                    appurtenances of sacrifice, looking-glasses of polished metal, coloured glass so
                    hard, clear, and well stained, as <pb break="no" facs="nls:193642514"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0711-2514-0263"/>to appear emeralds, sapphires, and other precious
                    stones; a kitchen completely fitted up with copper-pans lined with silver,
                    kettles, cisterns for heating water, and every utensil necessary for culinary
                    purposes; specimens of various sorts of combustibles, retaining their form
                    though burned to a cinder; corn, bread, fish, oil, wine, and flour; a lady’s
                    toilet, fully furnished with combs, thimbles, rings, paint, ear-rings, and so
                    forth. Amongst the statues, which are numerous, the greatest share of merit is
                    allowed to a Mercury and a sleeping faun; the busts occupy several apartments,
                    but very few of the originals whom they were meant to represent are known. The
                    floors are paved with ancient mosaic. A few rare medals have been found in these
                    ruins; the most curious is a gold medallion of Augustus, struck in Sicily in the
                    fifteenth year of his reign. The fresco paintings, which, for the sake of
                    preservation, have been taken off the walls and framed and glazed, are to be
                    seen in another part of the palace. The elegance of the attitudes, and the
                    infinite variety of the subjects, stamp them as performances worthy of the
                    attention of artists and antiquaries; but no pictures yet found are masterly
                    enough to prove that the Greeks had carried the art of painting to as great
                    perfection as they did that of statuary. But we cannot suppose those authors
                    incapable of appreciating the merits of an Apelles or a Zeuxis, who with so much
                    critical discernment have pointed out the beauties of the works of a Phidias, or
                    a Praxiteles; nor can we imagine that they would have bestowed equal praise upon
                    both kinds of performances if either of them had been much inferior to the
                    other. We must therefore presume that the capital productions of the ancient
                    painters being of more perishable materials than busts and statues, have been
                    destroyed in the fatal disasters which have so often afflicted both Greece and
                    Italy. Herculaneum and Pompeii were but towns of the second order, and not
                    likely to possess the masterpieces of the great artists, which were usually
                    destined to adorn the more celebrated temples, or the palaces of kings and
                    emperors. A more valuable acquisition than bronzes and pictures was thought to
                    have been made when a large parcel of manuscripts was found amongst the ruins;
                    and hopes were entertained that many classical works, *of which time has
                    deprived us, were about to be restored to light, and that a new mine of science
                    was on the point of being opened. But the difficulty of unrolling the parchment,
                    of pasting the fragments on a flat surface, and of deciphering the obscure
                    letters, has proved so great, that little progress has hitherto been made; and
                    the value of the writings which have been unrolled has by no means corresponded
                    to the public expectation.</p>
                <p>But although the few successful results of the investigation, which have hitherto
                    been laid before the public, are indeed of such a nature as not to have
                    rewarded, by their importance, the great labour which has been bestowed on them,
                    the zeal of the lovers and patrons of literature has not allowed their ardour to
                    be subdued by the difficulties of the task. The progress of the discovery and
                    examination of these singular remains of antiquity has been described, from time
                    to time, in the <hi rend="italic">Philosophical Transactions.,</hi> and in many
                    other publications. It was in October 1752 that the first of the carbonised
                    rolls of papyrus were found; and Paderni’s account of them is accompanied by an
                    interesting specimen, which exhibits the genuine form of the characters used by
                    the Romans in their manuscripts.</p>
                <p>The precise spot where the discovery was made was the Bosco di Sant’ Agostino, a
                    shrubbery belonging to the church of St Austin, close to Portici, towards Torre
                    del Greco; it was covered with ashes, and a hard tufa or lava, to the depth of
                    about a hundred and twenty English feet. In the course of a year or two about
                    two hundred and fifty rolls had been found, some Greek and some Latin. The
                    library appeared to be an apartment belonging to a considerable palace, which
                    had not been further examined. The floor was of an elegant mosaic work; and the
                    books were in presses, inlaid with different sorts of wood, disposed in rows,
                    and ornamented with cornices. In 1754 Paderni spent twelve days in this room,
                    and found in it three hundred and thirty-seven volumes, all apparently made
                    brittle by the fire, and all in Greek; besides eighteen rolls of a larger size,
                    lying in a separate bundle, which were in Latin, and more injured than the
                    Greek. The former two hundred and fifty seem to have been in a separate room
                    belonging to the same building. Some few of the rolls had an umbilicus or roller
                    of wood in the centre. The Canon Mazzocchi began his labours about this time,
                    and found that the subject of one of the manuscripts was music, and that of
                    another the Epicurean Philosophy; a small bust of Epicurus having also been
                    found in the same room.</p>
                <p>In 1755 a further account of these operations was communicated to the Royal
                    Society by Mr Locke. “Within two years last past,” says his correspondent, “in a
                    chamber of a house, or, more properly speaking, of an ancient villa (for by many
                    marks it is certainly known that the place where they are now digging was never
                    covered with buildings, but was in the middle of a garden), there has been found
                    a large quantity of rolls, about half a palm long, and round, which appeared
                    like roots of wood, all black, and seemed to be only of one piece. One of ’them
                    falling on the ground, it broke in the middle, and many letters were observed,
                    by which it was first known that the rolls were of papyrus. The number of these
                    rolls, as I am told, were about a hundred and fifty, of different sizes. They
                    were in wooden cases, which are so much burnt, as are all the things made of
                    wood, that they cannot be recovered. The rolls, however, are hard, though each
                    appears like one piece. Our king has caused infinite pains to be taken to unroll
                    them and read them; but all attempts were in vain; only by slitting some of them
                    a few words were observed. At length Signor Assemanni, having come a second time
                    to Naples, proposed to the king to send for one Father Antonio [Piaggi], a
                    writer at the Vatican, as the only man in the world who could undertake this
                    difficult affair. It is incredible to imagine what this man contrived and
                    executed. He made a machine, with which, by means of certain threads, which,
                    being gummed, stick to the back part of the papyrus, where there was no writing,
                    he begins by degrees to pull, whilst, with a sort of engraver’s instrument, he
                    loosens one leaf from the other, which is the most difficult part of all; and
                    then makes a sort of lining to the back of the papyrus, with exceeding thin
                    leaves of onion [goldbeaters’ skin] if I mistake not; and with some spirituous
                    liquor, with which he wets the papyrus, by little and little he unfolds it. All
                    this labour cannot be well comprehended without seeing. With patience superior
                    to what man can imagine, this good father has unrolled a pretty large piece of
                    papyrus^ the worst preserved, by way of trial. It is found to be the work of a
                    Greek writer, and is a small philosophic tract, in Plutarch’s manner, on Music;
                    blaming it as pernicious to society, and productive of softness and effeminacy.
                    It does not discourse of the art of music. The beginning is wanting. The papyrus
                    is written across,’ in so many columns, every one of about twenty lines, and
                    every line is about four inches long. Between column and column is a void space
                    of ‘ more than’ an inch. The letters are distinguishable enough. Father Antonio,
                    after he has unloosened a piece, takes it off where there are no letters, and
                    places it between two [pieces of glass] for the better observation; and then,
                    having an admirable talent in imitating characters, <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193642527" xml:id="kp-eb0711-2527-0264"/>he copies it with all the
                    lâcunoe, which are very numerous in the scorched papyri, and gives this copy to
                    the Canon Mazzocchi, who tries to supply the loss and explain it. The letters
                    are capital ones, and almost without any abbreviation. The worst is, the work
                    takes up so much time, that a small quantity of writing requires five or six
                    days to unroll, so that a whole year is already consumed about half this roll.
                    The lacunae, for the most part, are of one or two words, that may be supplied by
                    the context. As soon as this roll is finished, they will begin a Latin one.
                    There are some so voluminous, and the papyrus so fine, that unrolled they would
                    take up a hundred palms’ space [or almost a hundred feet]. The curiosity of
                    these papyri is, that there is no little shaft of wood on which they were
                    rolled.”</p>
                <p>It may here be remarked, that the practice of rolling books on an umbilicus of
                    wood was by no means universal where papyrus was employed. The Egyptian
                    manuscripts, for instance, so frequently found in the catacombs, are without any
                    umbilicus, the end of the sheet being left blank, for the purpose of being
                    doubled up into a sort of core, which remained unopened, and served instead of a
                    roller. A wooden pen without a slit was found in some of the subsequent
                    excavations, together with other materials for writing. In 1755 the name of
                    Philodemus had been discovered at the end of the first manuscript; and another
                    work of the same author, on rhetoric, had been unrolled. Mazzocchi laboured in
                    translating these, and two persons were constantly employed upon other
                    volumes.</p>
                <p>Some interesting particulars respecting the history of these operations may also
                    be found in Barthélemi’s <hi rend="italic">Voyage</hi><hi rend="italic">en
                    Italie,</hi> published at Paris in 1801. “It was a long time,” says the author,
                    “before any mode could be devised of unrolling them, and in this dilemma some of
                    them were cut with a knife longitudinally, as we divide a cylinder in the
                    direction of its axis. This mode of proceeding disclosed the writing to view,
                    but completely destroyed the work. The different strata of the paper adhered so
                    closely together, that in attempting to separate them they were reduced to ashes
                    [or rather dust]; and all that could be obtained was a single column or page of
                    a manuscript that consisted perhaps of a hundred.”</p>
                <p>“Under these circumstances, a patient and persevering monk suggested a mode of
                    completely unrolling the paper. He made some attempts, which occupied a
                    considerable portion of time, but in which by degrees he was successful. He goes
                    on with his tedious labour, and in the same manner gradually and slowly
                    succeeds. His plan is this. Having found the beginning of the manuscript, he
                    fastens to the exterior edge some threads of silk, which he winds round so many
                    pegs, inserted in a small frame. These pegs he turns with the utmost precaution,
                    and the manuscript is imperceptibly unrolled. Little is to be expected from the
                    first few layers of the paper, which in general are either torn or decayed.
                    Before any pages of a work can be obtained, the manuscript must be unrolled to a
                    certain depth, that is, till the part appears which had suffered no other injury
                    than that of being calcined. When a few columns have been thus unrolled, they
                    are cut off, and pasted on linen. For unfolding one of these manuscripts several
                    months are requisite, and hitherto nothing has been obtained but the last
                    thirty-eight columns of a Greek work against music. Two other columns or pages
                    are also shown of two Greek manuscripts that were cut to pieces before the
                    method of unrolling them was discovered. Each appears to have been part of a
                    philosophical dissertation.”</p>
                <p>In some letters from the secretary of the French embassy at Naples, subjoined by
                    Μ. de St Croix, and dated 1785, 1786, and 1787, it is asserted, that of about
                    fifteen hundred or eighteen hundred manuscripts which had been discovered, two
                    hundred or more had been destroyed by a charlatan who undertook to restore them
                    with the assistance of some chemical application. It is also stated as highly
                    probable that many thousands of similar manuscripts may still exist in different
                    parts of the ruins; a conjecture so much the more interesting, as the greater
                    number of the rolls hitherto found “have been so crushed that it will never be
                    possible to open them, and several have been injured by the barbarous attempt to
                    separate the leaves with a knife.”</p>
                <p>The work of Philodemus was published at Naples in 1793, as the first volume of
                    the <hi rend="italic">Herculanensium Voluminum</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >quae</hi><hi rend="italic">supersunt.</hi> The manuscript is faithfully
                    delineated in copperplates, and the restored readings and translation are
                    printed on the opposite page, followed by an elaborate commentary. The
                    academicians of Portici are the professed editors. The title at the end stands
                    thus, the work being the fourth book only of the essay.</p>
                <p>The subsequent volumes of the series are little known in this country. But a part
                    of another manuscript was inserted in the <hi rend="italic">Herculanensia</hi>
                    of Sir W. Drummond and Mr R. Walpole, London, 1810, in 4to; together with a very
                    favourable report of the progress of the operations, which had been continued at
                    the expense of the British government.</p>
                <p>“Many obstacles,” say the authors in their dedication, “opposed themselves to the
                    accomplishment of this noble design, which address and perseverance could alone
                    remove. The difficulty of opening the rolls of papyrus, which had been reduced
                    to perfect carbo, can scarcely be conceived by those who have not witnessed the
                    process. Much time and many hands were required in carrying it on; and the
                    expense incurred was proportionate to the labour. When the manuscripts were
                    unrolled, it was necessary that persons competent to the task should decipher
                    and transcribe them; distribute the (capitaD letters into the words to which
                    they belonged; and supply those deficiencies in the text which but too
                    frequently occurred. At the head of the directors of this difficult undertaking
                    were Rosini, the editor of Philodemus; an English gentleman (Mr Hayter) sent out
                    for the purpose; and, we believe, a Neapolitan priest, supposed to be deeply
                    conversant in ancient literature. It was not until large sums had been expended
                    by your royal highness, and the success of the execution had justified the
                    boldness of the plan, that pecuniary assistance was requested and obtained from
                    parliament. Attentive as the people of this country are, and ought to be, to the
                    expenditure of the public money, they must glory in having contributed towards a
                    work which does honour to the English name.”</p>
                <p>Again, in the preface, “The first papyrus which was opened contained a treatise
                    upon music by Philodemus the Epicurean. It was in vain that Mazzocchi and Rosini
                    wrote their learned comments on this dull performance. The sedative was too
                    strong; and the curiosity, which had <pb break="no" facs="nls:193642540"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0711-2540-0265"/> been so hastily awakened, was as quickly lulled
                    to repose. A few men of letters indeed lamented that no further search was made
                    for some happier subject on which learned industry might be employed; but the
                    time, the difficulty, and the expense, which such an enterprise required, and
                    the uncertainty of producing any thing valuable, had apparently discouraged and
                    disgusted the academicians of Portici.</p>
                <p>“Things were in this state when the Prince of Wales proposed to the Neapolitan
                    government to defray the expenses of unrolling, deciphering, and publishing the
                    manuscripts. This offer was accepted by the court of Naples; and it was
                    consequently judged necessary by his royal highness to select a proper person to
                    superintend the undertaking. The reputation of Mr Hayter as a classical scholar
                    justified his appointment to the place, which the munificence of the prince, and
                    his taste for literature, had created. This gentleman arrived at Naples in the
                    beginning of the year 1802, and was nominated one of the directors for the
                    development of the manuscripts.</p>
                <p>“During a period of several years the workmen continued to open a great number of
                    the papyri. Many, indeed, of these frail substances were destroyed, and had
                    crumbled into dust, under the slightest touch of the operator.</p>
                <p>“When the French invaded the kingdom of Naples in the year 1806, Mr Hayter was
                    compelled to retire to Sicily. It is certainly to be deeply regretted that all
                    the papyri were left behind. The writer of this preface only knows, with
                    certainty, that when he arrived at Palermo in 1806, on his second mission to his
                    Sicilian majesty, he found that all the papyri had been left at Naples, and that
                    the copies of those which had been unrolled were in the possession of the
                    Sicilian government. How this happened it would be now fruitless to inquire. The
                    English minister made several applications to the court of Palermo to have the
                    copies restored, but without success, until the month of August 1807. It was
                    pretended that, according to the original agreement, the manuscripts should be
                    published in the place where his Sicilian majesty resided; that several
                    Neapolitans had assisted in correcting, supplying, and translating them; that
                    his Sicilian majesty had never resigned his right to the possession, either of
                    the originals or of the copies; and that, as a proof of this right being fully
                    recognised, the copies had been deposited by Mr Hayter himself in the Royal
                    Museum at Palermo. It was, however, finally agreed that the manuscripts should
                    be given up, <hi rend="italic">pro tempore,</hi> to Mr Drummond, who immediately
                    replaced them in the hands of Mr Hayter. In the space of about a year, during
                    which period they remained in the possession of the latter, a fac simile of part
                    of one of the copies was engraved, and some different forms of Greek characters,
                    as found in these fragments, were printed under his direction.</p>
                <p>“From some circumstances which took place in the summer of 1808, and to which we
                    have no pleasure in alluding, a new arrangement became indispensable. Mr
                    Drummond proposed to the Sicilian government that the copies should be sent to
                    London, where they might be published with advantages which could not be
                    obtained at Palermo. His proposal was acceded to, and they have been accordingly
                    transmitted to England. The manner in which their publication will be conducted
                    will, of course, depend upon the determination of his Royal Highness the Prince
                    of Wales, in whose hands they have been deposited; but it may be presumed that
                    the republic of letters will not have to lament that these interesting fragments
                    are to be brought to light under the auspices of a prince, who has always shown
                    himself to be the protector of learning and the arts. We venture not to assert,
                    but we believe, that the manuscripts will be submitted to the inspection of a
                    select number of learned men, and will be edited under their care, and with
                    their annotations and translations.”</p>
                <p>Mr Walpole informs us in a subsequent article, dated at Palermo, 1807, that the
                    whole of the manuscripts which were then in Sir W. Drummond’s house, amounting
                    to more than eighty, were Greek, with the exception of one fragment of a Latin
                    poem, which is said to have been a description of the battle of Actium and its
                    consequences, and which has been conjectured by some critics to be the work of
                    the Varius well known by name as the friend of Horace. One of the eighty has
                    appeared in the <hi rend="italic">Herculanensia</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> but
                    where are the seventy-nine? The whole of the manuscripts were reported to have
                    been presented to the university of Oxford. Has a new volcano, throwing out
                    darkness and ashes, overwhelmed them on the banks of the Isis? Or were they,
                    notwithstanding all the labour and expense of obtaining them, found too
                    imperfect to deserve publication? It seems, indeed, not improbable, that the
                    persons employed to unroll them in the first instance, who were paid in
                    proportion to the number of pages they obtained, were too strongly .tempted to
                    sacrifice such parts of the manuscript as would have required the most labour,
                    for the more profitable object of proceeding with a portion which would allow
                    them to earn the most pay with the least loss of time, and that some irreparable
                    injuries have been done to the manuscripts from these interested motives. Some
                    pages, however, of the copies were certainly very little impaired, and these
                    must at least deserve to be preserved from further accidents, by printing and
                    publishing them in the simplest form possible.</p>
                <p>It was well known, that at the time of the first arrangement between the two
                    courts respecting these operations, the king of Naples sent six of the rolls
                    unopened, as a present to the Prince of Wales; nor were the antiquaries and
                    philosophers of Great Britain inattentive to this latent treasure. Several
                    experiments were made at Carlton House, in imitation of the processes which were
                    said to have been successful in Italy; and at last two of the manuscripts were
                    intrusted to the care of an individual, who is supposed to have given an account
                    of his own further attempts, in the fifth number of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Quarterly Review.</hi></p>
                <p>“At first,” he informs us, “as it often happens in such cases, he appeared to be
                    very confident of ultimate success; but difficulties afterwards occurred, and he
                    did not continue his experiments long enough to overcome them, or even very
                    materially to lessen them; his professional engagements interfered, much of his
                    time had already been sacrificed, and the intelligence that Sir W. Drummond had
                    succeeded in obtaining possession of the whole collection of the works which had
                    been unrolled, made his own attempts appear comparatively too insignificant to
                    deserve immediate prosecution.”</p>
                <p>“One mode of treating the papyri occurred, however, to this gentleman, which
                    appeared to him to promise a decided advantage to such as might hereafter
                    proceed in the operation. This was the employment of the anatomical blowpipe, an
                    instrument which he had many years before been in the habit of using for
                    delicate purposes, in the place of a dissecting knife. The blowpipe served him .
                    . for a knife and a forceps; for the gum, the goldbeater’s skin, and the threads
                    of the Italians. No instrument can be so soft in its pressure as the air, for
                    holding a thin fragment by suction, without danger of injuring it; no edge nor
                    point can be so sharp as to be capable of insinuating itself into all the
                    crevices which the air freely enters. But the humidity of the breath he found to
                    add much to the utility of the instrument. The slight degree of moisture
                    communicated to the under or inner surface of a fold made it curl up and
                    separate from the parts beneath, where the adhesion was not too strong; while
                    dry air from a bladder was perfectly incapable of detaching it. But the process
                    <pb break="no" facs="nls:193642553" xml:id="kp-eb0711-2553-0266"/>of separating
                    every leaf in this manner was always tedious and laborious where there was much
                    adhesion, and sometimes altogether impracticable. Chemical agents of all kinds
                    he tried without the least advantage; and even maceration for six months in
                    water was unable to weaken the adhesion. It is remarkable that the characters
                    were not effaced by this operation; so that the gum which had fixed them on the
                    paper must have wholly lost its solubility, and the rest of its original
                    properties.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">“</hi><hi rend="italic">It</hi> has indeed been supposed by
                    some travellers that the manuscripts were in reality never charred, the ashes
                    thrown out by the volcano having been probably incapable of communicating to
                    them a sufficient degree of heat for producing this effect. In fact, it is said
                    that some of the spices found in an embalmed body retained a considerable
                    portion of their aromatic smell. But there is no doubt whatever that the papyri
                    are now complete charcoal, such as is formed by heat only. A small fragment of
                    their substance burns readily, like common charcoal, with a creeping combustion,
                    <hi rend="italic">without flame,</hi> and with a slight vegetable smell; fresh
                    papyrus burns with a bright flame; and almost all mineral coal, which may
                    possibly have been formed from vegetable substances, without the operation of
                    heat, flames abundantly. <hi rend="italic">Bovey coal,</hi> for example, which
                    retains much of the appearance of wood, exhibits a <hi rend="italic"
                    >considerable flame.</hi> It is highly probable that many of the adhesions have
                    been formed by the oily and smoky vapours distilled off from the hottest parts,
                    and irregularly condensed in the colder; and, so far as this conjecture may be
                    true, it would perhaps be advisable to try the effects of a <hi rend="italic"
                    >longer maceration</hi> in alcohol and in <hi rend="italic">ether</hi> than has
                    hitherto been employed. The <hi rend="superscript"> i</hi> spear of Achilles’
                    might also be applied with very reasonable hopes of success. A repetition of the
                    exposure to heat, kept up more equably and more powerfully, might very probably
                    expel the adhesive substances, without injuring the texture of the charcoal;
                    proper care being taken to preclude completely the access both of air and of
                    water, which might be done first by means of the air pump, and then by the
                    insertion of a little potassium, together with the roll, in a vessel
                    hermetically sealed. But the adhesions appear sometimes to be of a mere
                    mechanical nature, being derived from the irregular folds into which the
                    manuscripts have been pressed, or from some roughness of the contiguous
                    surfaces.” (P. 18, 20.)</p>
                <p>Mr Hayter thought it necessary to reply to some of the criticisms contained in
                    this article, and published a pamphlet entitled <hi rend="italic">Observations
                    upon α Review of the</hi><hi rend="italic">Herculanensia,</hi> London, 1810, in
                    4to, strenuously maintaining that the quotation from the <hi rend="italic"
                    >comedy</hi> of Timocles, already extant in Athenaeus, ought to be a hexameter,
                    and not an iambic; and seeming almost to believe that Pluto, and not Plato, is
                    the author of the fancifixl etymology of the name of Juno, though the passage
                    quoted happens to be found in Plato’s <hi rend="italic">Cratylus.</hi> It is
                    difficult to understand by what test the merits of such a scholar were
                    appreciated, when he was appointed to superintend the operations at Portici.</p>
                <p>The next era of our national exertions exhibits, however, a still more striking
                    example of good nature and facility. Dr Sickler of Hildburghausen, who had been
                    in Italy as a private tutor, succeeded in convincing a committee of the Royal
                    Society of Göttingen that he had unrolled a fragment of papyrus, of which he
                    exhibited a specimen. There was no evidence that the particular manuscript, on
                    which the experiment was said to have been performed, had presented any
                    considerable difficulty; and it was well known that some of the pages had been
                    read before with comparative ease. It happened, however, that the page in
                    question bore the intrinsic marks of a gross fraud. At first sight it read like
                    perfectly good Greek; and it had all the genuine rust of antiquity about it; but
                    upon examination it was found to contain a blunder which no Greek writer, nor
                    any Greek librarian, could ever have committed; for the name of a serpent is
                    made feminine, whilst in all ancient authors it is uniformly masculine; and the
                    general air of authenticity was easily understood, when it was found that it was
                    copied, with little variation, from detached passages of Diodorus Siculus, and
                    principally from the fabulous account of the voyage of Jambulus to Ceylon and
                    beyond it. In the mean time a negotiation with Dr Sickler had been commenced; an
                    account of it was published, with the specimen in question, under the title of
                    <hi rend="italic">Herculaneum Rolls. ( Correspondence relative to a Proposition
                    made by Dr Sickler,</hi> London, 1817, in 4to.) The parties thought themselves
                    too far engaged to retract; nor had they the patience to wait for the result of
                    a preliminary experiment upon a portion of a roll, which had been weighed in
                    London, and sent, carefully packed, to Hildburghausen, in order that the surface
                    developed might be accurately compared with the weight; and Dr Sickler was
                    brought to London with his family for the more effectual prosecution of his
                    operations, which in a few months were so successful as to ruin twelve chosen
                    specimens which had been sent over as a second present to the Prince of Wales,
                    with the exception, however, of a few fragments, which were left sufficiently
                    entire to be made the subject of some subsequent experiments of a chemical
                    nature.</p>
                <p>This mischievous farce was at last terminated by a Report of the Committee
                    appointed to superintend the Experiments of Dr Sickler, ordered by the House of
                    Commons to be printed, in March 1818; the committee stating, in conclusion, that
                    Dr Sickler had totally failed in his endeavours to satisfy them that his method
                    was practicable; and annexing an account of the expenditure, of something more
                    than L.1100, in the purchase of this total failure.</p>
                <p>But one advantage, and that not an unimportant one, was derived from this
                    investigation. Sir Humphry Davy had been appointed one of the superintending
                    committee; and his studies having recently been directed to the different states
                    of carbonic substances, in the course of his patriotic and benevolent researches
                    into the means of preventing explosions in coal mines, he was the more naturally
                    led to consider by what agents these apparently carbonized substances might be
                    capable of modification. The whole detail of the process which he invented has
                    never been made public, in order that it might not be abused by any unprincipled
                    projector; but there is reason to think that it bears considerable analogy to
                    the maceration in ether, which had been tried unsuccessfully, but still
                    recommended as deserving further examination, by a less fortunate operator. A
                    very interesting report of Sir H. Davy on the state of the manuscripts was
                    published in the <hi rend="italic">Journal of the Royal Institution</hi> for
                    April 1819.</p>
                <p>“My experiments soon convinced me,” says Sir Humphry, “that the nature of these
                    manuscripts had been generally misunderstood; that they had not, as is usually
                    supposed, been carbonized by the operation of fire, and that they were in a
                    state analogous to peat or <hi rend="italic">Bσveycoal,</hi> the leaves being
                    generally cemented into one mass by a peculiar substance, which had formed
                    during the fermentation and chemical change of the vegetable matter comprising
                    them, in a long course of ages. The nature of this substance being known, the
                    destruction of it became a subject of obvious chemical investigation; and I was
                    fortunate enough to find means of accomplishing this without injuring the
                    characters or destroying the texture of the manuscripts.</p>
                <p>“After the chemical operation, the leaves of most of the fragments perfectly
                    separated from each other, and the Greek characters were in a high degree
                    distinct; but <pb break="no" facs="nls:193642566" xml:id="kp-eb0711-2566-0267"
                    />two fragments were found in peculiar states; the leaves of one easily
                    separated, but the characters were found wholly defaced on the exterior folds,
                    and partially defaced on the interior. In the other the characters were legible
                    on such leaves as separated, but an earthy matter, or a species of tufa,
                    prevented the separation in some of the parts; and both these circumstances were
                    clearly the results of agencies to which the manuscripts had been exposed,
                    during or after the volcanic eruption by which they had been covered.</p>
                <p>“It appeared probable from these facts that different manuscripts might be in
                    other states, and that one process might not apply to all of them; but even a
                    partial success was a step gained, and my results made me anxious to examine in
                    detail the numerous specimens preserved in the museum at Naples. Having had the
                    honour of showing some of my results to the Prince Regent, his royal highness
                    was graciously pleased to express his desire that I should proceed in my
                    undertaking; and I found, on my arrival at Naples, that a letter from his royal
                    highness to the king, and a communication made from the right honourable the
                    secretary of state for foreign affairs to the Neapolitan government, had
                    prepared the way for my inquiries, and procured for me the necessary result of
                    such patronage, every possible facility in the pursuit of my objects.</p>
                <p>“An examination of the excavations that still remain open at Herculaneum
                    immediately confirmed the opinion which I entertained, that the manuscripts had
                    not been acted on by the fire. These excavations are on a loose tufa, composed
                    of volcanic ashes, sand, and fragments of ]ava, imperfectly cemented by
                    ferruginous and calcareous matter. The theatre, and the buildings in the
                    neighbourhood, are encased in this tufa; and, from the manner in which it is
                    deposited in the galleries of the houses, there can be little doubt that it was
                    the result of torrents laden with sand and volcanic matter, and descending at
                    the same time with showers of ashes and stones, still more copious than those
                    that covered Pompeii. The excavation in the house, in which the manuscripts were
                    found, as I was informed by Monsign. Rosini, has been filled up; but a building,
                    which is said by the guides to be this house, and which, as is evident from the
                    engraved plan, must have been close to it, and part of the same chain of
                    buildings, offered me the most decided proofs that the parts nearest the
                    surface, and, <hi rend="italic">a fortiori,</hi> those more remote, had never
                    been exposed to any considerable degree of heat. I found a small fragment of the
                    ceiling of one of the rooms, containing lines of gold leaf and vermilion in an
                    unaltered state, which could not have happened if they had been acted upon by
                    any temperature sufficient to convert vegetable matter into charcoal.</p>
                <p>“The state of the manuscripts exactly coincides with this view; they were
                    probably on shelves of wood, which were broken down when the roofs of the houses
                    yielded to the weight of the superincumbent mass; hence many of them were
                    crushed and folded in a moist state, and the leaves <hi rend="italic">of</hi>
                    some pressed together in a perpendicular direction, and all of them mixed in two
                    confused heaps; in these heaps the exterior manuscripts, and the exterior part
                    of the manuscripts, must have been acted on by the water; and as the ancient ink
                    was composed of finely divided charcoal suspended in a solution of glue or gum,
                    wherever the water percolated continuously, the characters were more or less
                    erased.</p>
                <p>“Moisture, by its action upon vegetable matter, produces decomposition, which may
                    be seen in peat bogs in all its different stages: when air and water are
                    conjunctly on leaves or small vegetable fibres, they soon become brown, then
                    black, and by long continued operation of air, even at common temperatures, the
                    charcoal itself is destroyed, and nothing remains but the earths which entered
                    into the construction of the vegetable substance. When vegetable matter is not
                    exposed to moisture or air, its decay is much slower; but in the course of ages
                    its elements gradually re-act on each other, the volatile principles separate,
                    and the carbonaceous matter remains.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">“</hi><hi rend="italic">Of</hi> the manuscripts, the greater
                    number (those which probably were least exposed to moisture or air, for, till
                    the tufa consolidated, air must have penetrated through it) are brown, and still
                    contain some of their volatile substance, or extractive matter, which occasions
                    the coherence of the leaves; others are almost entirely converted into charcoal,
                    and in these, when the form is adapted to the purpose, the layers may be readily
                    separated from each other by mechanical means. Of a few, particularly the
                    superficial parts, and which probably were most exposed to air and water, little
                    remains except the earthy basis; the charcoal of the characters, and some of
                    that of the vegetable matter, being destroyed; and they are in a condition
                    approaching to that of the manuscripts found at Pompeii, where the air,
                    constantly penetrating through the loose ashes, there being no barrier against
                    it as in the consolidated tufa of Herculaneum, has entirely destroyed all the
                    carbonaceous parts of the papyrus, and left nothing but earthy matter. Four or
                    five specimens that I examined were heavy and dense, like the fragment to which
                    I referred in the introduction to this report, a considerable quantity of
                    foreign earthy matter being found between the leaves, and amongst the pores of
                    the carbonaceous substance of the manuscripts, evidently deposited during the
                    operation of the cause which consolidated the tufa.</p>
                <p>“The number of manuscripts and of fragments originally brought to the museum, as
                    I was informed by Μ. Ant. Scotti, amounted to 1696; of these, eighty-eight have
                    been unrolled, and found in a legible state; 319 more have been operated upon,
                    and more or less unrolled, and found not to be legible; twenty-four have been
                    presented to foreign potentates. Amongst the 1265 that remain, and which I have
                    examined with attention, by far the greater number consists of small fragments,
                    or of mutilated or crushed manuscripts, in which the folds are so irregular as
                    to offer little hopes of separating them so as to form connected leaves; from
                    eighty to a hundred and twenty are in a state which presents a great probability
                    of success; and of these, the greater number are of the kind in which some
                    volatile vegetable matter remains, and to which the chemical process referred to
                    in the beginning of this report may be applied with the greatest hopes of useful
                    results.</p>
                <p>“The persons charged with the business of unrolling the manuscripts in the museum
                    informed me that many chemical experiments had been performed upon'the
                    manuscripts at different times, which assisted the separation of the leaves, but
                    always destroyed the characters. To prove that this was not the case with my
                    method, I made two experiments before them; one on a brown fragment of a Greek
                    manuscript, and the other on a similar fragment of a Latin manuscript, in which
                    the leaves were closely adherent; in both instances the separation of the layers
                    was complete, and the characters appeared to the persons who examined them more
                    perfect than before.</p>
                <p>“It cannot be doubted that the 407 papyri which have been more or less unrolled
                    were selected as the best fitted for attempts, and were probably the most
                    perfect; so that amongst the 100 or 120 which remain in a fit state for trials,
                    even allowing a superiority of method, it is not reasonable to expect that a
                    much larger proportion will be legible. Of the eighty-eight manuscripts
                    containing characters, with the exception of a few fragments, in <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193642579" xml:id="kp-eb0711-2579-0268"/>which some lines of Latin
                    poetry have been found, the great body consists of works of Greek philosophers
                    or sophists; nine are of Epicurus; thirty-two bear the name of Philodemus; three
                    of Demetrius, and one of each of these authors, Colotes, Polystratus, Carneades,
                    and Chrysippus; and the subjects of these works, and the works of which the
                    names of the authors are unknown, are either <hi rend="italic">natural</hi> or
                    <hi rend="italic">moral philosophy, medicine, criticism,</hi> and general
                    observations on the <hi rend="italic">arts, life,</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >manners.”</hi></p>
                <p>The opinion of Sir Humphry Davy, and that of the anonymous operator, with respect
                    to the state of the manuscripts, are so inconsistent with each other, that the
                    decision between them seems almost reduced to the comparison of the credibility
                    of opposite testimonies. According to the article in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Quarterly Review,</hi> “there is no doubt whatever that the papyri are now
                    complete charcoal, such as is formed by heat only; a small fragment of their
                    substance burns readily, like common charcoal, with a creeping combustion,
                    without flame, and with a slight vegetable smell; Bovey coal exhibits a
                    considerable flame.” On the other hand, Sir Humphry’s experiments convinced him
                    that the manuscripts were “in a state analogous to a peat, or Bovey coal ;” and
                    he inferred, from his examination of the surrounding objects, that they could
                    not have been acted upon “by any temperature sufficient to convert vegetable
                    matter into charcoal.” Now it seems natural to prefer, on such an occasion, the
                    authority which stands the highest with respect to the department of science in
                    question, especially when one of the parties is unknown. But in the present
                    instance some additional evidence may not be thought superfluous; and in fact a
                    portion of one of the rolls, which had been examined both by Sir Humphry and by
                    the earlier experimenter, was submitted to a new analysis, by a chemist well
                    known for the minute accuracy of his investigations, and the solidity of his
                    conclusions. He exposed the carbonaceous matter to the process of destructive
                    distillation, and he could obtain nothing whatever from it like asphaltum or any
                    other product of mineral coal. It had scarcely enough of volatile matter to give
                    any perceptible tinge of brown to the humidity absorbed by the substance, but
                    enough to afford an animal smell, extremely like that of burnt bone, which he
                    could only attribute to the glue or size of the ink not being completely
                    decomposed by the same heat which had expelled all the volatile parts of
                    vegetable origin; and upon exposing some glue, spread on paper, to the heat of
                    boiling quicksilver, he obtained a partial carbonization, which he conceived to
                    be perfectly analogous to that of the manuscripts; the substance thus formed
                    affording, when exposed to a stronger heat, very copious vapours of an
                    em-pyreumatic oil, though the products of the vegetable matter were probably
                    expelled by the heat first applied. On the other hand, the heat of boiling
                    quicksilver did not produce the animal smell from the papyrus. Hence he judged
                    that the precise temperature of the overwhelming mass might be ascertained with
                    tolerable accuracy; and he was persuaded that nothing but a heat approaching to
                    600° of Fahrenheit could have reduced the roll which he examined to the state in
                    which he found it. At any rate, when we consider that a heat a little above 220°
                    is capable of blackening, when applied for a long continuance, the wood that
                    surrounds the boiler of a steam engine, it seems very difficult to agree with
                    Sir Humphry Davy in thinking that the manuscript could not have been subjected
                    to “any heat capable of converting vegetable matter into charcoal,” unless by
                    charcoal he understands pure carbon; and in this sense his observation will
                    readily be admitted by all parties. It seems, indeed, to have been precisely
                    with this conception of the state of the manuscripts, that it was suggested by
                    the <hi rend="italic">Quarterly Re</hi><hi rend="italic">viewer</hi> that some
                    benefit might be expected from submitting the rolls to a heat more intense than
                    that which they appeared to have undergone. The experiment, however, was
                    subsequently performed with considerable care; but it failed completely of
                    success. A fragment of a roll, consisting of several thicknesses, adhering
                    together, was enclosed in a crucible, surrounded by charcoal powder, and kept
                    for some time in a red heat; but no perceptible alteration took place in the
                    state of the fragment, the adhesions were in no degree detached, nor was the
                    legibility of the characters on the surface impaired.</p>
                <p>After the failure of this experiment, in order to leave no mechanical means
                    untried, a cutting machine was contrived, consisting of a very thin circular
                    plate made into a fine saw, and put in rapid motion by wheel-work. This
                    apparatus was found perfectly capable of dividing the substance of the roll
                    without splintering it, as knives had been found to do; and it was hoped that,
                    by cutting it across wherever there was a considerable fold, it would be
                    possible to extricate many parts from each other, which were only retained in
                    contact by this accidental complication of form; and that having the advantage
                    of beginning from within, it would be easier to work down upon the successive
                    surfaces bearing the letters, the writing being always found on the inside only;
                    and no material difficulty was apprehended in reuniting the several parts, when
                    they should once have been rendered legible. It was also recollected that the
                    interior parts of the manuscript had in general been the least crushed and the
                    least adherent; and it was hoped that a part at least of each manuscript might
                    thus be rendered legible with ease, and at the same time without destroying the
                    parts remaining unopened. But the interior parts of the roll which had been thus
                    divided were found as adherent as the exterior, and the adhesions still remained
                    everywhere invincible; so that all hopes of succeeding by mechanical means only
                    were finally abandoned. The machine was afterwards sent to Naples, as it was
                    thought likely to be of use in some of the operations that Sir Humphry Davy’s
                    process would require; but it is said not to have been found necessary for this
                    purpose.</p>
                <p>With regard to Sir Humphry’s observation that vegetable matter not exposed to
                    moisture or air undergoes a much slower decay, but that in the course of ages
                    “its elements gradually re-act on each other, the volatile principles separate,
                    and the carbonaceous matter remains,” it may be remarked that the rolls of
                    papyrus do not seem to undergo any change of this nature in the course of twenty
                    or thirty centuries; for the Egyptian volumes, which are often found enclosed
                    within the bandages of mummies, are generally so free from decay, that the paper
                    has retained its primitive whiteness, without much alteration, except sometimes
                    a slight tinge of brown; and its texture is so little impaired that it still
                    bears ink well without running. When, however, a roll has been in any degree
                    pervaded by moisture, the water is found to have dissolved the gum which unites
                    the elementary leaves of the plant, and to have caused partial adhesions of the
                    contiguous surfaces of the sheets to each other.</p>
                <p>Whatever difference of opinion there may be respecting the reasoning upon which
                    Sir Humphry Davy appears to have grounded his processes, there can be no doubt
                    that they have actually been employed with Considerable advantage. Mr Burton was
                    encouraged by the British government to undertake the manipulation of the
                    chemical operations which were required; and Mr Elmsley was requested to prolong
                    his stay in Italy, and to become the superintendent of the literary department.
                    Sir Humphry appears to have been well satisfied with his success, and a great
                    variety of manuscripts have been rendered more or less legible; but their
                    contents have proved of little <pb break="no" facs="nls:193642592"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0711-2592-0269"/>more importance than might have been expected from
                    <hi rend="subscript"> l</hi> the nature of the specimens before examined. Sir
                    Humphry is of opinion, however, that an acquaintance with the contents of the
                    remainder of the collection would afford much curious and useful information
                    respecting the state of society, literature, science, and the arts, particularly
                    in the Greek colonies of Magna Graecia and Sicily, which were at one time the
                    rivals of the mother country in civilization and glory. It is highly probable,
                    indeed, that many of the works in the collection at Herculaneum were composed by
                    natives of Magna Graecia; in a collection made in that country such works would
                    not be neglected; and in cities like Tarentum, Crotona, Pompeii, and others, the
                    advanced state of civilization necessarily implied activity, both in literature
                    and in science. The schools of Pythagoras and Archytas alone must have furnished
                    numerous works, the recovery of some of which, nay even of fragments thereof,
                    would unquestionably be an object of equal interest and importance.</p>
                <p>With regard to the restoration of the mutilated manuscripts, if this delicate and
                    difficult task had been intrusted to scholars like Mr Elmsley, it would have
                    been executed in a much more satisfactory manner, and we should have met with
                    none of those errors which have disgraced some of the former restorers of the
                    Greek text; for, in fact, even the work of Philodemus on Music, which is
                    commonly supposed to have been well edited, exhibits some singular instances of
                    a want of familiarity with the idiom of the language, and of a critical
                    knowledge of its rules. In the thirty-eighth and last column, which was
                    cursorily examined, for the purpose of selecting a specimen of the characters
                    only, a passage occurs which is thus read and translated by the academicians of
                    Portici. Totfaυrα ro∕vuv i∕gηκως, <hi rend="italic">reoς</hi><hi rend="italic"

                    in replying to the arguments of some persons but “that, in proportion to the
                    plausibility of these arguments, I ought not to have extended my discussion
                    beyond a very small part of its actual magnitude.”</p>
                <p>Such mistakes, however, can do but little injury to the mutilated authors,
                    provided that the original be preserved at the same time in its unaltered state.
                    But that original, in its authentic though imperfect form, is the only object of
                    comparative value; and to delay its publication for the sake of restorations of
                    any kind, seems to be but a refined species of selfishness. “When we reflect,”
                    says the <hi rend="italic">Quarterly Reviewer,</hi> “on the shortness of human
                    life, and on our own grey hairs, we tremble to think how little chance there is
                    of our being benefited by any great proportion of the <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >eighty</hi> manuscripts still unpublished.” Many years have now elapsed since
                    these reflections were printed, and not a line of the manuscripts in question
                    has yet made its way to that public which had so equitable a claim to a full
                    communication of their contents.</p>
                <p>It must not, however, be denied, that to the great majority of readers it would
                    be far more agreeable and convenient to have the works not only restored, but
                    translated, if it could be done with tolerable accuracy, and without any very
                    great loss of time. And even where a <hi rend="italic">probable</hi> restoration
                    is beyond our reach, it might be of some advantage to substitute a <hi
                    rend="italic">possible</hi> one. Thus the specimen which has been copied from
                    the <hi rend="italic">Philosophical Transactions</hi> for 1752 might suggest the
                    three hexameters,</p>

                <p>Lines which are not indeed very harmonious or poetical, but which <hi

                <p>TRAHITURQUE. LIBIDINE. MORTIS, which are almost the only specimens that we
                    possess of the poem attributed to Varius. If several independent attempts of
                    this kind were made by different critics, the presumption in favour of those
                    restorations, which were round to be common to all, would be raised from a mere
                    possibility to a strong probability; but whether the same expense of labour and
                    talents, directed into some other channel, might not create original works of
                    still greater value, is a question not easy to be decided.</p>
                <p>Signor Rosini, the president of the Bourbon Society of Antiquaries, published, in
                    1788, the first volume of those manuscripts which had been found at Herculaneum,
                    under the title of <hi rend="italic">Herculanensium Voluminum</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">quae</hi><hi rend="italic">supersunt</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi>
                    a volume which, as we have already mentioned, contains the first book of
                    Philodemus on Music. The second volume was published in 1809, and, besides the
                    preliminary dissertation, which had originally appeared in 1797, furnished only
                    some small fragments of Epicurus. But soon after the return of Ferdinand to
                    Sicily in 1815, there was founded the Royal Bourbon Society, which is divided
                    into three academies, viz. the academy of archaeology, that of the sciences, and
                    that of the fine arts. Two academicians, Savaroni and Geterino, were intrusted
                    with the labours relative to the manuscripts found in the excavations of
                    Herculaneum; and, in the third volume of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Herculanensia,</hi> which appeared at Naples in 1827, they commented on two
                    other productions of Philodemus, the publication of which had been confided to
                    the care of Signor Rosini. The first of these is entitled Φ∕λoδ¾⅛ou <hi
                    rend="italic">πεp</hi> κα%∕ωv κa∕ ra∣v <hi rend="italic">αντικείμενων</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">αprωv και τωv tv iις tiōi xaι Tip à,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Philodemi</hi><hi rend="italic">de</hi><hi rend="italic">Vitiis et Virtutibus
                    appositis et de rerum subjectis et objectis.</hi> In this work the author treats
                    of domestic economy, and shows how a good father of a family ought to govern his
                    household, if he wishes to avoid faults, and to practise the virtues which are
                    opposed to them. The second production is entitled Φ∕λ0¾∕40u <hi rend="italic"
                    >τεp xax</hi><hi rend="italic">∣</hi><hi rend="italic">uv,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Philodemi</hi><hi rend="italic">de</hi><hi rend="italic">Vitiis.</hi> In this
                    writing the author treats of particular defects, at the same time indicating the
                    virtues which are opposed to them. Speaking of pride, for example, he
                    characterises its different species, with the manifestations and inconveniences
                    of each, and the antidotes to be applied; and of the proud he enumerates eight
                    classes, viz. <hi rend="italic">υτεp&gt;ττaι,</hi><hi rend="italic">άυόαδας,
                    αλαζόνες,</hi><hi rend="italic">aυ∂εκagτοι, rawnδnμοvες,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >ΰεμνοχοτοι ή</hi><hi rend="italic">βpv-</hi><hi rend="italic">όυομενοι,
                    ίοτελιΰται,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">ουδενωται</hi>; whilst Theophrastus, on
                    the contrary, admits only three classes. This writing of Philodemus will enrich
                    the Greek vocabularies·. It is unfortunately full of <hi rend="italic"
                    >lacunae;</hi> but in the preface, the editor, Aloi-sio Catcrino, has indicated
                    the probable import of the passages which are wanting. In 1824, the university
                    of Oxford published two volumes entitled <hi rend="italic">Herculanensium
                    Voluminum</hi><hi rend="italic">partes duoe,</hi> containing four fragments
                    lithographed from the papyri, without note, commentary, or any attempt to
                    correct the text or supply <hi rend="italic">lacunae.</hi> Two of these
                    fragments are the essays of Philodemus already mentioned; and the fourth is a
                    fragment of a work on rhetoric by Demetrius; but, from the negligent manner in
                    which they have been edited, the publication is of comparatively little value.
                    The <hi rend="italic">Herculanensium Voluminum</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >quae</hi><hi rend="italic">supersunt tomus</hi> iii. however, has been brought
                    out with greater care, and in a much more creditable manner. “Chaque page est

                    les auteurs et les personnes que Philodemus a cités; en fin, les objets qui
                    présentent quelque importance.” Prefixed to the Oxford work is a catalogue of
                    papyri, ninety-five in number, presented to the university by his majesty; but
                    we do not observe in it any thing which seems calculated to increase the regret
                    of the learned at the difficulties met with in attempting to unfold these
                    disinterred relics of ancient literature.</p>
                <p>It now only remains to notice a very singular opinion expressed by Ignarra as to
                    the epoch at which Herculaneum and Pompeii were buried under the ashes of
                    Vesuvius. According to this savant, these cities existed long after the eruption
                    of the year 79, nay even in the fifth century. The principal proof he produces
                    in support of his assertion is, that their names are found in the map of
                    Peuttinger, which, he thinks, could not have been constructed before the end of
                    the fourth century, but that they are no longer observed in the itinerary of
                    Antoninus, which could not have been composed previously to the year 471.
                    Between these two epochs, therefore, must, according to Ignarra, be placed that
                    of the destruction of these cities. But this surely is not valid reasoning. The
                    map called Peuttinger’s is probably a copy of one more ancient, made by some
                    ignorant person, who either did not know that these cities no longer existed, or
                    who did not venture to suppress any thing he found in the original which he
                    copied. Besides, it is possible that the sites which Herculaneum and Pompeii
                    occupied may have preserved the names of these cities long after their
                    destruction. The name of Stabia still remains, although of the city not a single
                    monument has been preserved. But whilst neither at Herculaneum nor at Pompeii
                    has any monument, inscription, or medal been found of a date posterior to the
                    reign of Titus, it may nevertheless be reasonably maintained that these cities
                    were not entirely overwhelmed by the irruption which Pliny the younger has
                    described with so much exactness and interest; and hence it is highly probable
                    that, as Ignarra pretends, some remains of the city of Herculaneum were still to
                    be seen in the fifth century. This is indeed placed beyond a doubt by the
                    following verses of Sannazaro:</p>
                <p>Rupe sub hac mecum sedit Galatea: videbam Et Capreas,-et quae Sirenum nomina
                    servant Rura procul; <hi rend="italic">veteres</hi> alia de parte <hi
                    rend="italic">ruinas Herculis</hi> ambusta signabat ab arce Vesevus.</p>
                <p>But what is it this teaches us? Nothing except that, several centuries after the
                    calamity described by Pliny, some ruins of Herculaneum were still visible;
                    perhaps some porticowhich, having been constructed upon a height in the town,
                    had not yet been totally covered by the lava. It is no doubt from some such
                    porticothat the village of <hi rend="italic">Portici</hi> originally derived its
                    name. “Ce qu’il y a d’étonnant,” says the editor of Count Orloff’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Mémoire sur</hi><hi rend="italic">leĩłoyaume</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >de Naples,</hi> “c’est qu’ayant sous les yeux des ruines qui ne leur
                    permettaient pas de douter que, sous le sol même, ils trouveraient Herculanum,
                    les habitans de ce pays n’aient pas eu plus tôt le désir de fouiller; que cette
                    ville ait été complètement oubliée, et qu’il ait fallu qu’un heureux hasard vint
                    de nos jours sculement en révéler l’existence.”</p>
