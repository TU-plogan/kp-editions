                    significant corrections to the OCR text, predominantly in cases of confusing "c"
                    and "e." Isolates 90 entries that were mistakenly included at the end of prior
                    entries in v1 and v2. Normalizes ordinal numbers. Separates metadata in
                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra
                    space around the <gi>pb</gi> tag. Where a word is hyphenated at a <gi>pb</gi>,

                <p><label type="entry">HERSCHEL, <hi rend="smallcaps">Sir William</hi></label>, an
                    illustrious astronomer, and inventor of the telescope which bears his name, was
                    born at Hanover on the 15th of'November 1738. He was the second of four sons,
                    all of whom were brought up to their father’s profession, which was that of
                    musician. As he evinced a peculiar taste for intellectual pursuits, his father
                    provided him with a French tutor, who instructed him in the rudiments of logic,
                    ethics, and metaphysics, and under whom he made considerable progress. But,
                    owing to the untoward circumstances of his family, his studies were soon
                    interrupted, and, at the age of fourteen, he was placed in the band of the
                    Hanoverian regiment of guards, a detachment of which he accompanied to England
                    in 1757, or, as some say, in 1759. His father came with him to England, but
                    after the lapse of a few months he returned home, leaving the young musician to
                    push his fortune, <hi rend="superscript"> 5</hi> as he best could, in London.
                    After struggling with many difficulties, he attracted the notice of the Earl of
                    Darling-’ ton, who engaged him to superintend and instruct a militaryband then
                    forming for the Durham militia. Having fui-.</p>

                <p>filled this engagement, he passed several years in the west riding of Yorkshire,
                    giving lessons to pupils in the principal towns, officiating as leader in
                    oratorios and public concerts, and employing his leisure hours in improving his
                    knowledge of English, acquiring the Italian language, which he considered as
                    necessary to the exercise of his profession, and instructing himself in Latin,
                    as well as learning a little Greek. About the close of the year 1765, he was
                    appointed to the situation of organist at Halifax, which he obtained through the
                    good offices of Mr Joah Bates, and there continued to give instructions in
                    music, though with what success does not appear. Anxious to make himself master
                    of the theory of harmony, he studied Dr Smith’s treatise on that subject; in
                    connection with this science he also cultivated the mathematics, and thus,
                    perhaps unconsciously, prepared himself for those sublime investigations which
                    were destined to open a new field of discovery, and to confer immortality on his
                    name. In the year 1766 he and his elder brother repaired to Bath, where they
                    were both engaged by Mr Linley for the Pump-room band; but the principal object
                    which attracted him to that place was the advantageous situation of organist to
                    the Octagon Chapel, which opened to him a profitable range of engagements at the
                    concerts, the rooms, the theatre, and the oratorios, besides affording him an
                    opportunity of obtaining many private pupils. This accession of employment,
                    however, was so far from abating his propensity to study, that frequently, after
                    the fatigue of twelve or fourteen hours occupied in professional avocations, he
                    sought relaxation (for to him it was really such) in extending his knowledge of
                    the pure and the mixed mathematics.</p>
                <p>Some discoveries then recently made having awakened his curiosity, he next
                    applied himself to the study of astronomy, and to that of the auxiliary science
                    of optics, in which he laboured with indefatigable perseverance during every
                    interval of leisure. Anxious to observe with his own eyes the wonders of which
                    he had read, he borrowed from a neighbour in Bath a two-feet Gregorian
                    telescope, which delighted him so much that he commissioned a friend in London
                    to purchase for him one of larger dimensions. The price demanded, however,,
                    exceeded both his calculation and his means; but, far from being discouraged, he
                    resolved to attempt with his own hands the. construction of that complicated
                    instrument which he had found himself unable to purchase; and in this, after
                    successive disappointments, which served only to stimulate his exertions, he at
                    length succeeded. In the year 1774, he had the inexpressible gratification of
                    beholding the planet Saturn through a five-feet Newtonian reflector constructed
                    by himself, and, with the prophetic instinct of genius, already discerned the
                    path of discovery opening before him. Encouraged by this success, he extended
                    his operations; constructed telescopes of seven, ten, and even twenty feet in
                    length; and worked with such indefatigable perseverance that, in perfecting the
                    parabolic figure of a seven-feet reflector, he finished two hundred specula
                    before producing one which answered his purpose in a satisfactory manner.
                    Becoming more and more attached to astronomy, he now limited his professional
                    engagements, restricted the number of his pupils, and, about the end of the year
                    1779, commenced a regular survey of the heavens by means of a seven-feet
                    reflector. In the course of his observations, which were continued during
                    eighteen months, he remarked that a star, which had been recorded by Bode as
                    fixed, was progressively changing its position; and prolonged attention to it
                    enabled him to ascertain, beyond all doubt, that it was an hitherto undiscovered
                    planet. Having determined the mean and periodic motions, and the orbit of this
                    body, he communicated the particulars to the Royal Society, who, in return,
                    awarded him their annual gold medal, and unanimously elected him a fellow. This
                    important discovery he made on the 13th of March 1781, and, in compliment to the
                    king of England, bestowed on the planet the name of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Georgium</hi><hi rend="italic">Sidus</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> but the
                    Continental astronomers chose to honour the discoverer by calling it <hi
                    rend="italic">Herschel,</hi> an appellation subsequently changed to that of <hi
                    rend="italic">Uranus,</hi> which was considered as more consistent with the
                    received astronomical nomenclature.</p>
                <p>This discovery at once established the fame of Herschel as an astronomical
                    observer; and the king having bestowed on him a handsome salary, he was enabled
                    to relinquish his profession as musician, and to devote the remainder of his
                    life exclusively to astronomy. Accordingly he quitted Bath; and having fixed his
                    residence first at Datchet and afterwards at Slough, he resumed the career of
                    discovery on which he had so auspiciously entered. His first undertaking was to
                    construct a telescope forty feet in length, which he completed in 1787; but this
                    huge instrument disappointed the expectations he had formed from it; and it was
                    by instruments of a more manageable size that he perused the great volume of the
                    heavens, and derived from it new contributions to enrich the records of science.
                    In these researches, and in the laborious calculations to which they led, he was
                    assisted by his sister Miss Caroline Herschel, whose indefatigable assiduity and
                    devotion in the performance of a task usually considered as incompatible with
                    female habits excited equal surprise and admiration. The discoveries of Herschel
                    were communicated, as they occurred, to the Royal Society, and constitute an
                    important part of the printed transactions of that body during a period
                    extending from 1782 to 1818. In 1783 he announced the discovery of a volcanic
                    mountain in the moon; and four years afterwards he communicated an account of
                    two other volcanoes in the same orb, which appeared to be in a state of
                    eruption. In prosecuting his observations on the planet discovered by himself,
                    he ascertained that Uranus was surrounded with rings, and had six satellites.
                    Although the results obtained by means of the forty-feet telescope were not such
                    as to realize the expectations he had formed, yet they were too considerable to
                    justify the somewhat contemptuous allusion made to them by Lalande in his
                    History of Astronomy. By means of this instrument he discovered the sixth and
                    seventh satellites of Saturn; and in observing the quintuple belt of Saturn, he
                    was enabled to demonstrate the length of its day, and to determine its diurnal
                    rotation. Amongst the papers communicated by this great astronomer, was a memoir
                    on the power of telescopes to penetrate into space, or to render sensible
                    distant and faint objects, which would be imperceptible without the aid of such
                    instruments; and his opinion was, that the greatest amplification cannot exceed
                    that produced by a telescope of from twenty to twenty-five feet. In 1802, he
                    presented to the Royal Society a catalogue of five thousand new nebulae,
                    nebulous stars, planetary nebulae, and clusters of stars; preceded by a view of
                    the sidéral bodies composing the universei in which he enumerated twelve species
                    of stars that enter into the composition of the heavenly host.</p>
                <p>By these and other scientific labours he established his claim to rank amongst
                    the most eminent astronomers of the age, and amply merited the distinctions
                    which were conferred on him. Oxford had previously done itself honour by
                    bestowing on him the honorary degree of doctor of laws; and in 1816, George IV.
                    then prince regent, invested him with the Hanoverian and Guelphic order of
                    knighthood. Sir William Herschel did not relinquish his astronomical
                    observations until within a few years of his death, which took place on the 23d
                    of August 1822, at the advanced age of eighty-three. He expired full of years
                    and honours, leaving behind him a considerable fortune, and, what is of far
                    greater importance, a son who inherited his father’s genius, under more
                    favourable auspices for its <pb break="no" facs="nls:193642774"
