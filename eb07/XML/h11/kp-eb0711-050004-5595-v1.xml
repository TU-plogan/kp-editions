                <p><label type="entry">HOBBES, <hi rend="smallcaps">Thomas</hi></label>, a
                    metaphysical and political writer of the greatest eminence, was born at
                    Malmesbury on the 5th of April 1588. He was the son of a clergyman; and having
                    completed his studies at Oxford, he was appointed governor to the eldest son of
                    William Cavendish, earl of Devonshire. He travelled with that young nobleman
                    through France and Italy, and at length applied himself entirely to the study of
                    literature. He translated Thucydides into English, and in 1628 published his
                    translation, in order to show his countrymen, from the Athenian history, the
                    disorders and confusions of a democratical government. In 1626 his patron the
                    Earl of Devonshire died, and in 1628 the earl’s son also died; a loss which
                    affected Mr Hobbes to such a degree, that he willingly accepted an offer made
                    him of going abroad a second time with the son of Sir Gervase Clifton, whom he
                    accordingly accompanied to France. But whilst he resided there, he was solicited
                    to return to England, and resume his charge of the hope of that family to which
                    he had so early attached himself. In 1631 the Countess Dowager of Devonshire
                    desired to put under his care the young earl, who was then about the age of
                    thirteen. This proved agreeable to the inclinations of Mr Hobbes, who discharged
                    the trust with great diligence and fidelity. In 1634 he republished his
                    translation of Thucydides, and prefixed to it a dedication to that young
                    nobleman, in which he gives a high character of his father, and represents in
                    the strongest terms the obligations he was under to the Devonshire family. The
                    same year he accompanied his pupil to Paris, where he applied his leisure hours
                    to the study of natural philosophy, and more especially to the understanding of
                    mechanism, and the causes of animal motion. Upon these subjects he had frequent
                    conversations with Father Mersenne, a man deservedly celebrated, and who
                    maintained a correspondence with almost all the learned in Europe. From Paris he
                    accompanied his pupil to Italy, where, on visiting Pisa, he became known to
                    Galileo, who freely communicated to him his discoveries; and after having seen
                    all that was remarkable in that country, he returned with the Earl of Devonshire
                    to England. Afterwards, foreseeing the civil wars, he went to seek a retreat at
                    Paris, where, by the good offices of his friend Father Mersenne, he became known
                    to Descartes, and afterwards corresponded with him upon several mathematical
                    subjects, as appears from the letters of Mr Hobbes published in the works of
                    Descartes. But when this philosopher afterwards printed his Meditations, in
                    which he attempted to establish points of the highest consequence, on the
                    assumption of innate ideas, Mr Hobbes took the liberty of dissenting from him;
                    and so also did Gassendi, with whom Mr Hobbes contracted a very intimate
                    friendship, which was not interrupted till the death of the former. In 1642 Mr
                    Hobbes printed a few copies of his book <hi rend="italic">De Give,</hi> which,
                    in proportion as it became known, raised him many adversaries, who charged him
                    with instilling principles which had a dangerous tendency. Amongst many
                    illustrious persons who, upon the shipwreck of the royal cause, retired to
                    France for safety, was Sir Charles Cavendish, brother of the Duke of Newcastle;
                    and this gentleman, being skilled in every branch of the mathematics, proved a
                    constant friend and patron of Mr Hobbes, who, having in 1645 embarked in a
                    controversy about squaring the circle, became so celebrated, that in 1647 he was
                    recommended to instruct the Prince of Wales, afterwards Charles II., in
                    mathematical learning. His diligence in the discharge of this office gained him
                    the esteem of that prince; and though he afterwards withdrew his public favour
                    from Mr Hobbes on account of his writings, yet he always retained a sense of the
                    services which the latter had rendered him, showed him various marks of favour
                    after the Restoration, and, as some say, had his picture suspended in his
                    closet. This year also was printed in Holland, under the care of Sorbière, a
                    second and more complete edition of the treatise <hi rend="italic">De Cive,</hi>
                    to which are prefixed two Latin letters to the editor, the one by Μ. Gassendi,
                    the other by Father Mersenne, in commendation of it; and in 1650 was published
                    at London his small but profound and original treatise on Human Nature, with
                    another <hi rend="italic">De</hi><hi rend="italic">Corpore</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Politico,</hi> or on the Elements of the Law.</p>
                <p>All this time Mr Hobbes had been occupied in digesting his religious, political,
                    and moral principles into a <pb break="no" facs="nls:193645608?mode=fullsize"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0711-5608-0501"/> complete system, which he called <hi
                    rend="italic">Leviathan,</hi> and which was printed in English at London in 1650
                    and 1651. After the publication of his <hi rend="italic">Leviathan</hi> he
                    returned to England, and passed the summer commonly at the scat of his patron
                    the Earl of Devonshire, in Derbyshire, and spent some of his winters in town,
                    where he had as his intimate friends some of the greatest men of the age. Upon
                    the occurrence of the Restoration in 1660, he repaired to London, where he
                    obtained from the king assurance of protection, and had an annual pension of
                    L.100 settled upon him out of the privy purse. Yet even this did not render him
                    entirely safe; for, in the year 1666, his <hi rend="italic">Leviathan</hi> and
                    his treatise <hi rend="italic">De Cive</hi> were censured by parliament; a
                    circumstance which, taken in connexion with the bringing in of a bill into the
                    House of Commons to punish atheism and profaneness, gave him serious alarm. When
                    the storm had blown over, however, he began to think of publishing a beautiful
                    edition of his pieces in Latin; but finding this impracticable in England, he
                    caused it to be undertaken abroad, where they were published in three volumes
                    quarto in 1668, from the press of John Bleau. In 1669 he was visited by Cosmo
                    de’ Medicis, then prince, and afterwards Duke of Tuscany, who gave him ample
                    proofs of esteem and respect, and having reτ ceived his picture, with a complete
                    collection of his writings, caused them to be deposited, the former amongst his
                    curiosities, and the latter in his noble library at Florence. He received
                    similar visits from foreign ambassadors and other strangers of distinction, who
                    were curious to see a person whose singular opinions and numerous writings had
                    made so much noise all over Europe. In 1672 he wrote his own life in Latin
                    verse, when he had completed his eightyfourth year; and, in 1674, he published,
                    in English verse, four books of Homer’s Odyssey, which was so well received,
                    that it encouraged him to undertake the whole Iliad and Odyssey, both of which
                    he translated and published in 1675. About this time he took leave of London,
                    and went to spend the remainder of his days in Derbyshire. He died on the 4th of
                    December 1679, aged ninety-two.</p>
                <p>As to his deportment and manners, they are thus described by Dr White Kennet, in
                    his Memoirs of the Cavendish family. “The Earl of Devonshire,” says he, “for his
                    whole life entertained Mr Hobbes in his family, as his old tutor rather than as
                    his friend or confidant. He let him live under his roof in ease and plenty, and
                    in his own way, without making use of him in any public, or so much as domestic
                    affairs. He would frequently put off the mention of his name, and say, <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ζ</hi> He was a humorist, and nobody could account for him.’
                    There is a tradition in the family, of the manners and customs of Mr Hobbes,
                    somewhat observable. His professed rule of health was to dedicate the morning to
                    his exercise, and the afternoon to his studies. And therefore, at his first
                    rising, he walked out, and climbed any hill within his reach; or, if the weather
                    was not dry, he fatigued himself within doors by some exercise or other, to be
                    in a sweat; recommending that practice upon this opinion, that an old man had
                    more moisture than heat, and therefore by such motion heat was to be acquired
                    and moisture expelled. After this, he took a comfortable breakfast; and then
                    went round the lodgings to wait upon the earl, the countess, and the children,
                    and any considerable strangers, paying some short addresses to all of them. He
                    kept these rounds till about twelve o’clock, when he had a little dinner
                    provided for him, which he ate always by himself without ceremony, ⅛oon after
                    dinner he retired to his study, and had his candle, with ten or twelve pipes of
                    tobacco laid by him; then shutting his door, he fell to smoking, thinking, and
                    writing for several hours. He retained a friend or two at court, and especially
                    the Lord Arlington, to protect him d occasion should require. He used to say,
                    that it was lawful to make use of ill instruments to do ourselves good: ‘ If I
                    were cast,’ says he, ‘ into a deep pit, and the devil should put down his cloven
                    foot, I would take hold of it to be drawn out by it.’ After the Restoration, he
                    watched all opportunities to ingratiate himself with the king and his prime
                    ministers; and looked upon his pension to be more valuable, as an earnest of
                    favour and protection, than upon any other account. His future course of life
                    was to be free from danger. He could not endure to be left in an empty house.
                    Whenever the earl removed, he would go along with him, even to his last stage,
                    from Chatsworth to Hardwick. When he was in a very weak condition, he dared not
                    to be left behind, but made his way upon a feather-bed in a coach, though he
                    survived the journey but a few days. He could not bear any discourse of death,
                    and seemed to cast off all thoughts of it. He delighted to reckon upon longer
                    life. The winter before he died, he made a warm coat, which he said must last
                    him three years, and then he would have such another. In his last sickness his
                    frequent questions were, Whether his disease was curable? and when intimations
                    were given that he might have ease, but no remedy, he used this expression, ‘ I
                    shall be glad to find a hole to creep out of the world at ;’ which are reported
                    to have been his last sensible words; and his lying some days following in a
                    silent stupefaction, did seem owing to his mind more than to his body.”</p>
                <p>Lord Clarendon says of him, that he “was a man for whom he had a great esteem,
                    and who was always regarded as a person of probity, and of a life free from
                    scandal.” As to his character as a philosopher and political writer, it is only
                    necessary here to refer to the admirable sections regarding him in the
                    Dissertations by Mr Stewart and Sir James Mackintosh, prefixed to this work. A
                    collection of his “moral and political” writings, comprised in a folio volume,
                    was published at London in the year 1750.</p>
