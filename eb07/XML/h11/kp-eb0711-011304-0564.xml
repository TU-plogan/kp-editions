                    prebendary of Wolverhampton, dean of Worcester, bishop of Exeter, and, lastly,

                    esteemed. He lamented the divisions of the Protestants, and wrote concerning the
                    means of putting an end to these schisms. In 1616, he accompanied the embassy of
                    Lord Doncaster into France, and upon his return was appointed by his majesty one
                    of the divines who should attend him into Scotland. In 1618 he was sent, with

                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Hall,</hi><hi rend="italic">Robert,</hi> a distinguished
                    writer and preacher, was born at Arnsby, a small village about eight miles from
                    Leicester, on the 2d of May 1764. His father, who had the pastoral charge of a
                    Baptist congregation in this place, was a man of talents and piety, as well as
                    an eloquent and successful preacher. Robert was the youngest of fourteen
                    children; and, whilst an infant, his health was so delicate that slender hopes
                    were entertained of his ever reaching manhood. A nurse was employed, whose duty
                    it was to carry him about in the open air; but in the discharge of her duty she
                    used to loiter in a burying-ground which lay in the vicinity of his father’s
                    house. It is worthy of notice, that amidst the memorials reared to commemorate
                    the dead, and which, by reminding man of his mortality, tend to fill the mind
                    with sentiments of religious awe, the future orator should have learned to
                    articulate that language in which he was afterwards, with the most powerful
                    eloquence, to bring home to the heart a conviction of the frail tenure by which
                    we hold this life, and the certainty of that which is to come. The nurse,
                    judging from the peculiar character and habits of the child, that he was
                    desirous of knowing the meaning of the inscriptions and carved figures upon the
                    tombstones, by their aid taught him the letters, and finally to speak and to
                    read. This occurred before he had completed his third year; and being naturally
                    of an inquisitive disposition, he was continually putting questions, and soon
                    became a rapid talker, which he always continued to be. After receiving regular
                    instructions from two female teachers, he was at six years of age placed under
                    the master of a village school situated about four miles from Arnsby. Previously
                    to this arrangement, he had evinced an extraordinary thirst for knowledge, and
                    had become a collector of books. He was in the habit of retiring to the
                    church-yard with some favourite volume, spreading it out before him, and poring
                    over it until the shades of evening reminded him of home. The course of
                    instruction pursued at the village school was by no means extensive; and the
                    ardent scholar found ample leisure to gratify his passion for reading. The books
                    which he selected were not those of mere amusement, but .such as required the
                    exercise of deep and long-continued reflection. His favourite works were those
                    of Jonathan Edwards on the Affections and on the Will, and Butler’s Analogy.
                    Before he was nine years of age, he had repeatedly perused these productions,
                    had written several essays upon religious subjects, and was in the habit of
                    calling together a juvenile congregation to hear him preach. Such indications as
                    these are not to be mistaken; they indubitably presage future eminence. At
                    eleven years of age, he was placed as a boarder at a school in the neighbouring
                    town of Northampton, where he remained about a year and a half, and, according
                    to his father’s account, made great progress in Latin and Greek. After having
                    for some time studied divinity and other collateral, subjects, principally under
                    the guidance of his father, he was, in his fifteenth year, sent to the Bristol
                    Education Society, or academy for the instruction of young men preparing for the
                    ministerial office amongst the Baptists. The system of tuition at this seminary
                    comprehended not merely the learned languages and the rudiments of science, but
                    a specific course of preparation for the ministerial office, including the
                    writing of essays and the habit of public speaking.. That the progress which
                    young Hall made in his studies was rapid, is sufficiently attested by the fact,
                    that on the 13th of August 1780, he was solemnly “set apart to public employ*’
                    as a preacher of the gospel, in connection with the body of dissenters to which
                    his father belonged. In about a year after this event, he was sent to King’s
                    College, Aberdeen, where, amongst other friendships, he made that of Mr,
                    afterwards Sir James, Mackintosh. When <pb break="no" facs="nls:193640590"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0711-0590-0115"/>these eminent individuals became first acquainted,
                    Sir James was in his eighteenth year, and Mr Hall about a year older.
                    Notwithstanding some differences of taste as well as of intellectual pursuits, a
                    strong and mutual friendship commenced between the two students. They were
                    almost inseparable, and read together much of Xenophon, Herodotus, and Plato;
                    but the arena in which they most frequently met was that of morals and
                    metaphysics, subjects which afforded ample opportunities for disputation. Many
                    years afterwards, Sir James Mackintosh, in a letter to Mr Hall, thus alludes to
                    their early attachment: “On the most impartial survey of my early life, I could
                    see nothing which tended so much to excite and invigorate my understanding, and
                    to direct it towards high, though perhaps scarcely accessible objects, as my
                    intimacy with you. Five-and-twenty years are now past (the letter is dated
                    Bombay, 1805) since first we met, yet hardly anything has occurred since which
                    has left a deeper or more agreeable impression on my mind. I now remember the
                    extraordinary union of brilliant fancy with acute intellect, which would have
                    excited more admiration than it has done, if it had been dedicated to the
                    amusement of the great and the learned, instead of being consecrated to the far
                    more noble office of consoling, instructing, and reforming the poor and the
                    forgotten.” These distinguished individuals entertained a mutual esteem and
                    veneration, which continued unabated till the close of life.</p>
                <p>In 1783, Mr Hall received an invitation from the church at Broadmead in Bristol,
                    to associate himself with Dr Evans, as assistant pastor. This offer he accepted
                    after much hesitation; and it was finally arranged, that during the interval
                    between the college sessions of 1784 and 1785, Mr Hall should reside at Bristol,
                    and then return to Aberdeen to complete his studies. In the course of his last
                    session he applied himself with much assiduity, especially to the study of the
                    Greek language, moral philosophy, and metaphysics in general, as well as to
                    other branches of learning more immediately connected with theology. After
                    completing his academical career, which was a bright one, and calculated to
                    raise the highest expectations, Mr Hall entered upon his pastoral avocations.
                    The life of a divine situated as Mr Hall was, is little distinguished by those
                    incidents which give attraction to biography. The events are in general few in
                    number, and possess a sameness which deprives them of interest. From the
                    commencement of his ministrations, Mr Hall’s preaching attracted an unusual
                    degree of attention; and if he was not listened to by such multitudes as
                    surrounded Whitfield and Wesley, he found fit audience though few in the great
                    and distinguished men of the day. His eloquence, remarkable alike for its
                    brilliancy and its force, was a general theme of praise; and by his instructive
                    and fascinating conversation in private he called forth equal admiration.
                    Besides his clerical duties, he had to perform those of classical tutor in the
                    Bristol Academy; an appointment which was conferred upon him shortly after his
                    arrival in the place, and which he held for more than five years, labouring with
                    active zeal and with commensurate success. At this period of his life, Mr Hall
                    was distinguished for the dexterity with which he wielded the weapons of wit and
                    raillery; and it would appear that the religious opinions he entertained, and
                    which in private, though never in the pulpit, he professed to hold, were
                    considered as somewhat latetudinarian by individuals of the persuasion to which
                    he belonged. Certain it is, indeed, that it was not until many years afterwards
                    that his mind became fairly settled with regard to some of the most important
                    doctrines of Christianity. On several momentous points he was considered as
                    deviating considerably from the accredited standards of even moderate orthodoxy.
                    In 1790, when he was on the eve of dissolving his connection with the church in
                    Bristol, he addressed to his congregation a frank exposition of his opinions;
                    and, amongst other startling notions, he confessed that he held that of
                    materialism. In a letter to his congregation, there is the following passage:
                    “My opinion however upon this head is, that the nature of man is simple and
                    uniform; that the thinking powers and faculties are the result of a certain
                    organization of matter; and that after death <hi rend="italic">he ceases to be
                    conscious until the resurrection’'</hi> To those who are acquainted with the
                    general character of English dissenters, and their strict adherence to what are
                    denominated the evangelical doctriues of Christianity, it will not be matter of
                    surprise, that the individual who entertained such notions, and who could
                    support them with such metaphysical acumen and powerful eloquence, was a pastor
                    rather to be admired for his genius than implicitly relied on as a spiritual
                    guide. It is not however to be inferred from this that he promulgated error from
                    the pulpit; on the contrary, he was careful to exclude such doubtful
                    speculations from his discourses: but it seems certain that they gave rise to
                    vexations and perplexities, which, with other circumstances, induced him to
                    accept of an invitation to take the pastoral charge of a church at Cambridge. He
                    entered on the new scene of his labours in 1791. In the same year he lost bis
                    father, an event which made a deep impression upon his mind, and wrought a
                    considerable change in him relative to some of his doctrinal sentiments. Amongst
                    other things, he renounced materialism, which he often afterwards declared he
                    had buried in his father’s grave.</p>
                <p>The congregation with which Mr Hall was now associated had considerably declined
                    from the orthodox standard of their church with reference to some important
                    doctrines of Christianity. Their former pastor, from the profession of orthodox
                    opinions, had become more lax in his views, which gradually degenerated into
                    Socinianism, if not for a time into infidelity itself. The contagion was ’
                    Communicated to the members of the church, not a few of whom adopted the
                    opinions of their spiritual guide. The faithfulness with which Mr Hall
                    discharged his ministerial duties under such disadvantages, is sufficiently
                    attested by the fact, that in a short time he succeeded in reclaiming from their
                    errors the greater proportion of his flock. About this period Mr Hall published
                    a pamphlet entitled An Apology for the Freedom of the Press. The author’s object
                    was a vindication of the principles maintained by the friends of liberty,
                    especially by those who avowed evangelical sentiments; and although, in a spirit
                    of self-depreciation, in which Mr Hall always indulged with regard to his own
                    writings, he did not place a very high value upon this production, it was
                    received with marked favour by the public. Several editions were rapidly sold
                    off, and it was largely quoted by the periodicals of the day. The celebrity
                    which Mr Hall now enjoyed gave rise to inconveniences which interfered with the
                    more solemn duties of his calling. It withdrew him from study, and induced
                    individuals whose conduct and character he could not approve, to intrude on his
                    retirement. He therefore resolved, without retracting his principles, to embark
                    no more on the stormy element of political debate. His next publication was in
                    more perfect keeping with the sacred office which he held, being a sermon,
                    entitled Modern Infidelity considered with respect to its Influence on Society.
                    It appeared in the year 1800, and was at once acknowledged as a masterpiece of
                    eloquence and reasoning. It is a rare felicity of circumstances that a work
                    which has excited unusual attention is allowed to enjoy popular favour without
                    censure or interruption. The sermon on Modern Infidelity formed no exception to
                    the general rule; and a controversy ensued, in which insidious attempts were
                    made to misinterpret the motives of the author, and even to depreciate his
                    character. Detrae&gt; tion, however, originating with such individuals as now
                    attacked<pb break="no" facs="nls:193640603" xml:id="kp-eb0711-0603-0116"/> him
                    had little effect, and the petty clamour was drowned in the general applause.
                    The critical journals of the day were lavish of their praise, and some of the
                    most distinguished men of the time paid their tribute of approbation to the
                    author. The reputation of Mr Hall as a profound thinker and eloquent writer was
                    now completely established; and his church became a place of frequent resort to
                    many members of the university. His next production was a sermon entitled
                    Reflections on War, which was preached on the occasion of a general thanksgiving
                    for the peace of Amiens, celebrated on the 1st of June 1802. This suspension of
                    arms, as is well known, was of short duration; and war having been again
                    declared in the following year, Mr Hall evinced his patriotism and love of
                    country by publishing a sermon entitled The Sentiments proper to the Present
                    Crisis. It was preached on the 19th of October 1803, being the day appointed for
                    a general fast. This sermon perhaps excited still more universal admiration than
                    any of the author’s previous productions’; and the latter part of it was
                    considered by the most competent judges, amongst whom was Mr Pitt, as fully
                    equal in genuine eloquence to any passage of the same length in ancient or
                    modern orations.</p>
                <p>Mr Hall bad been for some time afflicted with a pain in his back, and in 1803 it
                    had increased to such a degree, that, in order to enjoy exercise, it was found
                    advisable to remove to a place a few miles distant from Cambridge. This
                    arrangement was not ultimately productive of beneficial results; on the
                    contrary, a severe calamity which overtook him may in part be attributed to it.
                    He had always been remarkable for his love of solitary study, and frequently
                    remained for more than twelve hours together wrapt in abstract thought. The
                    effects of this violent infringement of the physical laws of our nature were in
                    some measure alleviated at Cambridge, by the pretty regular habit which he had
                    of spending his evenings in the society of the intelligent classes oſ his
                    congregation. Such a source of relief from severe study was denied him in the
                    place to which he had removed; and he was likewise cut off from the tender
                    sympathies of his flock, by whom he was much beloved. The consequence was, that
                    being left too much alone, and exposed to the morbid influences of a diseased
                    body and an overwrought mind, the latter lost its equilibrium; and he who had so
                    long been the theme of universal admiration now became the object of as
                    extensive sympathy. This afflicting event occurred in November 1804; but it was
                    of short duration; for, by the assiduous care of his medical adviser, he was in
                    about two months restored to mental and bodily health. About twelve months
                    afterwards a recurrence of the same malady again laid him aside from public
                    duty. He soon, however, recovered; but it was deemed essential to his complete
                    restoration to health and vigour that he should resign his pastoral charge at
                    Cambridge, abstain from preaching, and avoid as far as possible all strong
                    excitement.</p>
                <p>It may be well believed that two visitations of a calamity so humiliating were
                    calculated to make a powerful impression upon a mind so alive to religious
                    influences as that of Mr Hall. Without dwelling upon this theme, it is
                    sufficient to state in what light they were regarded by the sufferer himself. He
                    was persuaded that, however strong his religious convictions, and however
                    correct his doctrinal sentiments had hitherto been, yet that he had not
                    undergone a thorough transformation of character until the first of these
                    attacks. The permanent impression upon his character was.hence exclusively
                    religious. His piety assumed a more exalted tone, his habits became more
                    strictly devotional, and his exercises more fervent and elevated, than they had
                    ever hitherto been; and he watched with jealous care over the whole tenor of his
                    conduct, as well as every movement of his heart.</p>
                <p>For some time Mr Hall enjoyed in his native village, and other places, an
                    exemption from active duty, during which period his attention was engaged in
                    biblical study, and in other pious and literary occupations, which could be
                    abandoned or resumed at pleasure. He also preached occasionally, especially at
                    Leicester; and from a church in this place he accepted of an invitation to
                    become its stated pastor. Over this congregation he presided twenty years; a
                    period undistinguished by any incident of particular moment excepting his
                    marriage, which took place in March 1808. This was a fortunate event for Mr
                    Hall; for, whilst it called into livelier activity those sympathies with which
                    his mind was richly fraught, and thus gave greater variety to the exercise of
                    his mental powers, it likewise reclaimed him from those habits of abstract
                    speculation, the indulgence in which had already proved so pernicious, and
                    rendered him more familiar with the everyday events of life, and the common
                    feelings, aims, and pursuits of human nature. The endearments of domestic life
                    also served to compensate the physical pain to which he was doomed to be a
                    martyr till the close of his career, whilst they deepened his impressions of
                    tenderness, benevolence, and sympathy. In proof of this, his biographer, Dr
                    Olinthus Gregory, produces a beautiful instance. “Not long after his marriage,”
                    says he, “when his own pecuniary resources were much restricted, he proposed to
                    fast on certain days, that he might have it in his power to distribute more
                    among the needy; and he thought it wrong to have more than two coats, when so
                    many persons around him were clothed in rags.” During his residence at
                    Leicester, Mr Hall gave to the world several valuable productions, which
                    extended his fame and his influence over society. He occasionally appeared as a
                    critic in the Eclectic Review and other periodicals, and published various
                    sermons, of which that on the death of the Princess Charlotte in 1817 is allowed
                    to surpass all that were produced upon the occasion, if not to stand unrivalled
                    as a model of pulpit eloquence. A controversy on what is called The Terms of
                    Communion, engaged some share of his attention. The Baptists as a body were, and
                    still are, very strict in their administration of the Lord’s Supper. Mr Hall,
                    with his usual energy and eloquence, and with considerable success, advocated
                    the principle of more open communion. In the year 1823 he engaged in a
                    controversy of another description, with a Unitarian preacher, who had provoked
                    him to the contest by delivering what are usually denominated challenge
                    lectures. Mr Hall preached twelve lectures, which were serviceable in checking
                    the diffusion of Socinianism. These compositions, however, were not published,
                    although he was strongly urged to take this step; but a concise outline of them
                    has been given in his works. By his constitutional complaint Mr Hall was
                    subjected to severe suffering, which increased so much with his growing years,
                    that, to alleviate the pain, he was compelled to take copious draughts of
                    laudanum. His mental vigour, however, was but slightly impaired; yet a little
                    difference was discernible in his conversation, which had always been
                    remarkable'for its brilliancy and vivacity.</p>
                <p>In 1825 Mr Hall received an invitation to assume the pastoral charge of the
                    church at Broadmead, Bristol. This he accepted; and after taking a touching
                    farewell of his Leicester friends, he removed in 1826 to Bristol, the place
                    where his ministerial career began, and where it was destined soon to come to a
                    close. Reading and study, which had always been at once his bane and antidote,
                    suffered no abatement on account of his increasing infirmities. His opinion was,
                    that every species of knowledge might be rendered subservient to religion; and
                    works of almost every description he laid under contribution. When above sixty
                    years of age he commenced the study of the Italian <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193640616" xml:id="kp-eb0711-0616-0117"/>language, of which he had
                    been before ignorant, in order ' to settle a point of interest relative to the
                    Divina Comedia of Dante. His pastoral duties were discharged with his usual
                    faithfulness; but the decay of locomotive power, which age brought in the train
                    of its infirmities, was a source of much uneasiness to his mind, as it prevented
                    him from associating privately with his flock. Besides his old disease,
                    indications of a plethoric habit of body became more and more apparent, until in
                    1830 he was compelled to try a change of air and scene. No ultimate benefit was
                    derived from this treatment, and after suffering severely from a complication of
                    disorders, he departed this life on the 21st of February 1831. By his marriage
                    Mr Hall had five children, of whom four, with their mother, survived him.</p>
                <p>Mr Hall was not only the most distinguished ornament of the Christian body to
                    which he belonged, but as a preacher his claims to pre-eminence were
                    acknowledged by the ablest judges of every creed. Dr Parr has drawn his
                    character in language strong, concise, and comprehensive. “Mr Hall,” says he,
                    “has, like Bishop Taylor, the eloquence of an orator, the fancy of a poet, the
                    acuteness of a schoolman, the profoundness of a philosopher, and the piety of a
                    saint.” “As a preacher,” says Mr John Foster, who knew him intimately, “none of
                    those contemporaries who have not seen him in the pulpit, or of his readers in
                    another age, will be able to conceive an adequate idea of Mr Hall. His personal
                    appearance was in striking conformity to the structure and temper of his mind. A
                    large-built, robust figure, was in perfect keeping with a countenance formed as
                    if on purpose for the most declared manifestation of internal power; a power
                    impregnable in its own strength, as in a fortress, and constantly, without an
                    effort, in a state for action. That countenance was usually of a cool unmoved
                    mien at the beginning of the public service; and sometimes, when he was not
                    greatly excited by his subject, or was repressed by pain, would not acquire a
                    great degree of temporary expression during the whole discourse. At other times
                    it would kindle into an ardent aspect as he went on, and toward the conclusion
                    become lighted up almost into a glare.”</p>
                <p>His voice was somewhat feeble, but his articulation was distinct, although he
                    spoke with great rapidity. At the commencement of his discourse attention was
                    secured by the simplicity and solemnity of the speaker’s deportment; and as he
                    advanced and became animated with his subject, such was the impression which he
                    produced, that his auditors one by one rose from their seats, “until,” says Dr
                    Gregory, “long before the close of the sermon, it often happened that a
                    considerable portion of the congregation were seen standing.” His mental
                    endowmentswere of the highest order, and his excellency consisted not in the
                    predominance of one, but in the exquisite proportion and harmony of all his
                    powers. A mind naturally of great capacity had been enriched by a course of
                    reading which extended nearly to the limits of human investigation, and he was
                    thus enabled to draw his illustrations from an infinite variety of sources. He
                    also possessed a wonderful ability for comprehensive reasoning; whilst his
                    quickness of apprehension, his powers of analysing a subject, and seizing on the
                    most essential points, and of placing in a clear, intelligible light, what was
                    before obscure or perplexed, were of the very highest order. His oratory was
                    brilliant, but not unnecessarily showy, or encumbered with poetical images. The
                    works of this great preacher display a union of elevation with elegance, to
                    which it will be difficult to find a parallel amongst the works of divines. With
                    high excursive powers of imagination, and an equal talent for close reasoning
                    and metaphysical speculation, he neither indulged in meretricious ornament or
                    rhetorical flourishes, nor perplexed his hearers with subtile distinctions. No
                    writer ever displayed more taste and discrimination in the choice of language,
                    and he formed for himself an ideal standard of excellence which could not be
                    reached. His style is at once clear and simple; and the construction of his
                    sentences is characterised by ease, united with strength and compactness. There
                    is no pomp of words in his most magnificent excursions of fancy, and he rises to
                    the summit of eloquence without the least effort or appearance of straining
                    after greatness. He is elaborately correct, yet perfectly inartificial, and free
                    from antithesis; pregnant with weighty meaning, yet easily understood. In him
                    are united richness with simplicity, transparency with depth, and symmetry with
                    strength. The reader of his works frequently meets with passages of
                    extraordinary beauty; but these will in no instance be found to have been
                    introduced simply for effect; they are inseparably connected with the subject,
                    and, seeming to grow out of it, appear with all the appropriateness of a natural
                    relation. “He displayed in a most eminent degree,” says Mr Foster, “the rare
                    excellence of a perfect conception and expression of every thought, however
                    rapid the succession. There were no half-formed ideas, no misty semblances of a
                    meaning, no momentary lapses of intellect into an utterance at hazard, no
                    sentences without a distinct object, and serving merely for the contiguity of
                    speaking; every sentiment had at once a palpable shape, and an appropriateness
                    to the immediate purpose.” If such was a characteristic of his preaching, part
                    of which was extemporaneous, it is almost unnecessary to say that the same
                    excellence distinguishes the sermons which he prepared for the press. He
                    surpasses perhaps all preachers of modern times in having always a definite
                    purpose, a distinct assignable object in view in his discourses. Hence each of
                    them affords afine specimen of a comprehensive and perfect whole. The piety of
                    Mr Hall was pure, sincere, exalted, and untainted by bigotry or intolerance. As
                    a pastor he was zealous, affectionate, and indefatigable in the discharge of his
                    duties. His fame as an orator receives additional lustre from the excellence of
                    his moral nature. In him benevolence and humility were conspicuous, and his
                    affections were as warm as his intellect was strong. In social life he was open,
                    communicative, sincere, unostentatious. His conversation was on a level with his
                    preaching, and displayed the same varied excellences. He had, however, an
                    inclination to sarcasm, which in some of his earlier productions he allowed to
                    poison the edge of his polemical weapon. Occasionally, also, he argued more
                    perhaps for victory than for truth; but he never voluntarily chose the wrong
                    side of a question, or allowed himself to tamper with the sanctities of
                    religion. Mr Hall took the degree of A. Μ. at King’s College, Aberdeen; and that
                    of doctor in divinity was conferred on him unsolicited by Marischal College;
                    but, either from his humility, or from some scruples as to propriety, he never
                    assumed the title.</p>
                <p>Mr Hall’s works consist of, 1. Christianity consistent with the Love of Freedom,
                    being an Answer to a Sermon by the Rev. John Clayton, 1791, 8vo; 2. Apology for
                    the Freedom of the Press, and for general Liberty, with Remarks on Bishop
                    Horsley’s Sermon, preached 13th January 1793, 8vo; 3. Modern Infidelity
                    considered with respect to its Influence on Society; a Sermon preached at
                    Cambridge, 1800, 8vo; 4. Reflections on War, a Sermon on June 1, 1802, being the
                    Day of Thanksgiving for a General Peace; 5. The Sentiments proper to the present
                    Crisis, a Fast Sermon at Bristol, October 19,1803; 6. The Effects of
