                    rend="italic">sativa</hi> of Linnaeus, is a very valuable plant, from which
                    clothsand cordage of various kinds are manufactured. It does not appear that the
                    ancients were acquainted with the use of hemp, in respect of the thread it
                    affords. Pliny, who speaks of the plant in his natural history (lib. xx. c. 23),
                    says not a word of this, contenting himself with extolling the virtues of its
                    stem, leaves, and root. In fact, what some writers on Roman antiquities remark,
                    that the hemp necessary for the use of war was all stored up into two cities of
                    the western empire, Ravenna and Vienne, under the direction of two procurators,
                    called <hi rend="italic">procuratores linifica,</hi> must be understood of <hi
                    rend="italic">linum</hi> or flax.</p>
                <p>Hemp is supposed to be a native of India, but it is now cultivated in various
                    other countries, where it forms an article of very considerable commercial
                    importance. Its uses, culture, and management are nearly the same as those of
                    flax, but it is stronger and coarser in the fibre than that article. When pulled
                    green, hemp is considered as a cleaner of the ground, but when grown for seed it
                    is a very exhausting crop. Little of it is grown in this country, its
                    cultivation not being deemed profitable; and the quantity raised in Ireland is
                    also inconsiderable. But in Russia and Poland it is very extensively cultivated;
                    and Italy yields not an inconsiderable quantity. Very good <hi rend="italic"
                    >huckaback</hi> for towels and table-cloths, and different kinds of wearing
                    apparel, are made from hemp; but its great consumption is in the manufacture of
                    sail-cloth and cordage, to which purposes it is exceedingly well adapted by the
                    strength of its fibre. Amongst the Hindus a favourite intoxicating liquor called
                    <hi rend="italic">banga</hi> is extracted from hemp; and in Egypt it is applied
                    to the same purpose.</p>
                <p>Great quantities of hemp are exported from Russia. It is assorted, according to
                    its quality, into clean hemp, or firsts; out-shot hemp, or seconds; half-clean
                    hemp, or thirds; and hemp codilla. Of the first three sorts there are annually
                    exported from St Petersburg 2,000,000 poods; sixty-three of which make an
                    English ton. English and American vessels are chiefly employed in this trade;
                    and particular care is taken to ship the hemp in dry weather, as it is totally
                    spoiled if it gets wet. Riga hemp brings a higher price than that of St
                    Petersburg. It is divided into three sorts, viz. rein, rhine, or clean,
                    out-shot, and pass hemp. Of 530,820 cwt. of undressed hemp imported into this
                    country in 1831, 506,803 were brought from Russia, 9472 from the East Indies,
                    7405 from Italy, 2262 from the Philippine Islands, 2248 from the United States,
                    and ' some small quantities from a few other places. In 1832 the duty on hemp
                    was reduced from 4s. 8d. to Id. per cwt. a reduction which cannot fail to be
                    beneficial to the trade.</p>

                    ‘Manilla white rope. Mr Crawfurd gives the following account of this article :—
                    “Of the wild banana, one kind <hi rend="italic">(Musa</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >textilis)</hi> grows in vast abundance in some of the most northerly of the
                    Spice Islands. In the great island of Mindanao, in the Philippines, it fills
                    extensive forests. From the fibrous bark or epidermis is manufactured a kind of
                    cloth, in frequent use among the natives. It also affords the material of the
                    most valuable cordage’ which the indigenous products of the Archipelago yield.
                    This is known to our traders and navigators under the name of Manilla rope, and
                    is equally applicable to cables, and to standing or running rigging.” <hi

                    and most durable species is produced at Comercolly. During those periods of the
                    late war when the intercourse with the Baltic was interrupted, and hemp bore an
                    enormous price, large quantities of sunn were imported; but the fibre being
                    comparatively weak, the article was not found to answer, and the importation has
                    since been discontinued. (Milburn’s <hi rend="italic">Orient.
