                <p><label type="entry">HOSPITALITY</label>, the practice of entertaining strangers.
                    Dr Robertson, speaking of the middle ages, says, “Among people whose manners are
                    simple, and who are seldom visited by strangers, hospitality is a virtue of the
                    first rank. This duty of hospitality was so necessary in that state of society
                    which took place during the middle ages, that it was not considered as one of
                    those virtues which men may practise or not, according to the temper of their
                    minds and the generosity of their hearts. Hospitality was enforced by statutes,
                    and those who neglected the duty were liable to punishment. The laws of the
                    Salvi ordained that the moveables of an inhospitable person should be
                    confiscated, and his house burnt. They were even so solicitous for the
                    entertainment of strangers, that they permitted the landlord to steal for the
                    support of his guest.”</p>
                <p>The hospitality of our British ancestors, particularly of the great and opulent
                    barons, has been much admired, and considered as a certain proof of nobleness
                    and generosity of spirit. The fact indeed is well attested. The castles of the
                    powerful barons were capacious palaces, daily crowded with numerous retainers,
                    who were always welcome to plentiful tables. They had their privy councillors,
                    their treasurers, marshals, constables, stewards, secretaries, chaplains,
                    heralds, pursuivants, pages, henchmen or guards, trumpeters, minstrels, and, in
                    a word, all the officers of a royal court. The etiquette of their families was
                    an exact copy of that of the royal household; and some of them lived in a degree
                    of pomp and splendour little inferior to that of the greatest kings. Richard
                    Neville, earl of Warwick, we are told, “was ever had in great favour of the
                    commons of the land, because of the exceeding household which he daily kept in
                    all countries wherever he sojourned or lay; and when he came to London, he held
                    such an house, that six oxen were eaten at a breakfast, and every tavern was
                    full of his meat.” The Earls of Douglas in Scotland, before the fall of that
                    great family, rivalled or rather exceeded their sovereigns in pomp and profuse
                    hospitality. But it is highly probable these great chieftains were prompted to
                    indulge this style of living by a desire of increasing the number and attachment
                    of their retainers, on which, in those turbulent times, their dignity, and even
                    their safety, depended, as much as to the innate generosity of their tempers.
                    Those retainers did not constantly reside in the families of their lords; but
                    they wore their liveries and badges, frequently feasted in their halls, swelled
                    their retinues on all great solemnities, attended them in their journeys, and
                    followed them into the field of battle. Some powerful chieftains had constantly
                    at their command so great a number of these retainers, that, setting the laws at
                    defiance, they became formidable to their sovereigns, and terrible to their
                    fellow-subjects; and several laws w ere made against giving and receiving
                    liveries. But these laws produced little effect at this period.</p>
                <p>Hospitality was not confined to the great and opulent, but was practised rather
                    more than it is at present by persons in the middle and lower ranks of life. But
                    this was owing to necessity, arising from the scarcity of inns, wduch obliged
                    travellers and strangers to apply to private persons for lodging and
                    entertainment; and those who received them hospitably acquired a right to a
                    similar reception. This was evidently the case in Scotland in the first part of
                    this period. In the year 1424, James I. procured the following act of parliament
                    :—“It is ordanit, That in all burrow townis, and throuchíàiris quhair commoun
                    passages ar, that thair be ordanit hostillaries and resettis, havand stables and
                    chahners; and that men find with thame bread and aill, and all uther fude.
                    alsweil for horse as men, for reson-able price.” But travellers had been so long
                    accustomed to lodge in private houses, that these public inns were quite
                    neglected; and those who kept them presented a petition to parliament,
                    complaining, “That the liegis travelland in the realme, quhen they cum to
                    burrowis and throuchfairis, herbreis thame not in hostillaries, bot with thair
                    acquaintance and freindis.” This produced an act prohibiting travellers to lodge
                    in private houses where there were hostelries, under the penalty of forty
                    shillings, and subjecting those who lodged them to the same penalty»</p>

                <p>The inhabitants of the Highlands of Scotland and the Western Isles were anciently
                    remarkable for their hospitality to strangers, and still happily retain, in no
                    inconsiderable degree, the same kindly disposition.</p>
