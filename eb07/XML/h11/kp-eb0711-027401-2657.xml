                <p><label type="entry">HERESY</label>, an offence against Christianity, consisting
                    in a denial of some of its essential doctrines, publicly and obstinately avowed.
                    It is defined <hi rend="italic">sententia rerum</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >divinarum</hi><hi rend="italic">humano</hi><hi rend="italic">sensu</hi><hi

                    rend="italic">et pertinaciter defensa.</hi> And here it must be acknowledged,
                    that particular modes of belief or unbelief, not tending to overturn
                    Christianity itself, or to undermine the foundations of morality, are by no
                    means the object of coercion by the civil magistrate. What doctrines therefore
                    should be adjudged heresy, was left by our old constitution to the determination
                    of the ecclesiastical judge, who had therein a most arbitrary latitude allowed
                    him. The general definition of an heretic, given by Lyndewode, extends to the
                    smallest deviations from the doctrines of the holy church. <hi rend="italic"
                    >Haereticus est qui dubitat</hi><hi rend="italic">de</hi><hi rend="italic">fide
                    catholica,</hi><hi rend="italic">et qui ncgligit</hi><hi rend="italic">servare
                    ea,</hi><hi rend="italic">quee</hi><hi rend="italic">Romana ecclesia

                    decreverat,-</hi> or, as the statute 2 Hen. IV. c. 15, expresses it in English,
                    “teachers of erroneous opinions contrary to the faith and blessed determinations
                    of the holy church.” This was very contrary to the usage of the first general
                    councils, which defined all heretical doctrines with the utmost precision and
                    exactness. But what ought to have alleviated the punishment, namely, the
                    uncertainty of the crime, seems to have enhanced it in those days of blind zeal
                    and pious cruelty. It is true, that for the crime of heresy the sanctimonious
                    hypocrisy of the canonists went at first no farther than enjoining penance,
                    excommunication, and ecclesiastical deprivation; though afterwards they
                    proceeded boldly to imprisonment by the ordinary, and confiscation of goods <hi
                    rend="italic">in pios usus.</hi> But in the mean time they had prevailed upon
                    the weakness of bigoted princes to make the civil power subservient to their
                    purposes, by making heresy not only a temporal, but even a capital offence; the
                    ecclesiastics determining, without appeal, whatever they pleased to consider as
                    heresy, and shifting to the secular arm the odium and drudgery of executions,
                    with which they themselves were too tender and delicate to intermeddle. Nay,
                    they pretended to intercede on behalf of the convicted heretic, <hi
                    rend="italic">id</hi><hi rend="italic">citra</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >mortis</hi><hi rend="italic">periculum sententia</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >circa</hi><hi rend="italic">eum moderetur</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> well
                    knowing that at the same time they were delivering the unhappy victim to certain
                    death. Hence the capital punishments inflicted on the ancient Donatists and
                    Manichaeans by the emperors Theodosius and Justinian; and hence also the
                    constitution of the emperor Frederic mentioned by Lyndewode, adjudging all
                    persons without distinction to be burned with fire who were convicted of heresy
                    by the ecclesiastical judge. The same emperor, in another constitution,
                    ordained, that if any temporal lord, when admonished by the church, should
                    neglect to clear his territories of heretics within a year, it should be lawful
                    for good Catholics to seize and occupy the lands, and utterly to exterminate the
                    heretical possessors. And upon this foundation was built that arbitrary power,
                    so long claimed and so fatally exerted by the supreme pontiff, of disposing of
                    the kingdoms of refractory princes to more dutiful sons of the church. The
                    immediate consequence of this constitution was something singular, and may serve
                    to illustrate at once the gratitude of the holy see, and the righteous
                    punishment of the royal bigot; for, upon the authority of this very
                    constitution, the pope afterwards expelled Frederic from his kingdom of Sicily,
                    and gave it to Charles of Anjou.</p>
                <p>Christianity being thus deformed by the demon of persecution upon the Continent,
                    we cannot expect that our own island should have been entirely free from the
                    same scourge; and accordingly we find amongst our ancient precedents a writ <hi
                    rend="italic">de</hi><hi rend="italic">haereticocomburendo,</hi> which is
                    thought by some to be as ancient as the common law itself. From this writ it
                    appears that the conviction of heresy by the common law was not in any petty
                    ecclesiastical court, but before the archbishop himself in a provincial synod;
                    and that the delinquent was delivered over to the king to be dealt with
                    according to the royal pleasure. Thus the crown had a control over the spiritual
                    power, and might pardon the convict by issuing no process against him; the writ
                    <hi rend="italic">de</hi><hi rend="italic">haereticocomburendo</hi> being not a
                    writ of course, but issuing only by the special direction of the king in
                    council.</p>
                <p>But in the reign of King Henry IV., when the eyes of the Christian world began to
                    be opened, and the seeds of the Protestant religion, though under the
                    opprobrious name of <hi rend="italic">Lollardy,</hi> took root in this kingdom,
                    the clergy, taking advantage of the king’s dubious title to demand an increase
                    of their power, obtained an act of parliament, which sharpened the edge of
                    persecution to its utmost keenness. By that statute, the diocesan alone, without
                    the intervention of a synod, might convict of heretical tenets; and unless the
                    convict abjured his opinions, or if after abjuration he relapsed, the sheriff
                    was bound <hi rend="italic">ex officio,</hi> if required by the bishop, to
                    commit the unhappy victim to the flames, without waiting for the consent of the
                    crown. By the statute 2 Henry V. c. 7, Lollardy was also made a temporal
                    offence, and indictable in the king’s courts; which thereby gained not an
                    exclusive, but only a concurrent, jurisdiction with the bishop’s consistory.</p>
                <p>Afterwards, when the reformation of religion began to advance, the power of the
                    ecclesiastics became somewhat moderated; for though it was not then precisely
                    defined what heresy was, yet people were informed in some points what it was
                    not. The statute 25 Henry VIII. c. 14, declared that offences against the see of
                    Rome were not heresy; and the ordinary was thereby restrained from proceeding in
                    any case upon mere suspicion; that is, unless the party delated were accused by
                    two credible witnesses, or an indictment of heresy had been previously found in
                    the king’s courts of common law. And still the spirit of persecution was not yet
                    abated, but only diverted into a lay channel. For in six years afterwards, by
                    statute 31 Henry VIII. c- 14 the law of the six articles was made, which
                    established the six most contested points of popery, namely, transubstantiation,
                    communion in one kind, the celibacy of the clergy, monastic vows, the sacrifice
                    of the mass, and auricular confession; points which were “determined and
                    resolved by the most godly study, pain, and travail of his majesty, for which
                    his most humble and obedient subjects, the lords <hi rend="italic"
                    >spiritual</hi> and temporal and the commons, in parliament assembled, did not
                    only render and give unto his highness their most high and hearty thanks,” but
                    did also enact and declare all oppugners of the first to be heretics, and to be
                    burned with fire, and of the five others to be felons, and to suffer death. The
                    same statute established a new and mixed jurisdiction of clergy and laity for
                    the trial and conviction of heretics; the reigning prince being then equally
                    intent on destroying the supremacy of the bishops of Rome, and at the same time
                    establishing all their corruptions of the Christian religion.</p>
                <p>Without perplexing this detail with the various repeals <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193642670" xml:id="kp-eb0711-2670-0275"/>and revivals of these
                    sanguinary laws in the two succeeding reigns, we proceed to the reign of Queen
                    Elizabeth, when the reformation was finally established with temper and decency,
                    unsullied with party-rancour or personal caprice and resentment. By statute 1
                    Eliz c. 1, all former statutes relating to heresy were repealed, and the
                    jurisdiction of heresy was left as it stood at common law, viz. as to the
                    infliction of common censures in the ecclesiastical courts; and in case of
                    burning the heretic, in the provincial synod only. Sir Matthew Hale is indeed of
                    a different opinion, and holds that such power resided also in the diocesan;
                    though he agrees that in either case the writ <hi rend="italic">de
                    haeretico</hi><hi rend="italic">comburendo</hi> was not demandable of common
                    right, but grantable or otherwise merely at the king’s discretion. But the
                    principal point now gained was, that by this statute a boundary was for the
                    first time set to what should be accounted heresy. For the future nothing was to
                    be determined heretical but only such tenets as had been heretofore so declared,
                    first, by the words of the Holy Scriptures; or, secondly, by the first four
                    general councils, or such others as had only used the words of the Holy
                    Scriptures; or, thirdly, which should thereafter be so declared by the
                    parliament, with the assent of the clergy in convocation. Thus was heresy
                    reduced to a greater certainty than before; though it might not have been amiss
                    to have defined it in terms still more precise and particular, as even yet a man
                    continued liable to be burned for what perhaps he did not understand to be
                    heresy till the ecclesiastical judge had so interpreted the words of the
                    canonical scriptures.</p>
                <p>But the writ <hi rend="italic">de haeretico</hi><hi rend="italic">comburendo</hi>
                    remained still in force; and we have instances of its being put in execution
                    against two Anabaptists in the seventeenth of Elizabeth, and two Arians in the
                    ninth of James I. But it was totally abolished, and heresy again subjected only
                    to ecclesiastical correction, <hi rend="italic">pro salute animae,</hi> by
                    virtue of the statute 29 Car. II. c. 9; for, in one and the same reign, our
                    lands were delivered from the slavery of military tenures, our bodies from
                    arbitrary imprisonment by the <hi rend="italic">habeas corpus</hi> act, and our
                    minds from the tyranny of superstitious bigotrybyremoving this last badge of
                    persecution from the system of English law.</p>
