                    pensionary of Holland by successive quinquennial re-elections, from the year
                    1689 until his death on the 3d of August 1720, at the age of seventy-nine, was
                    one of the statesmen who, during this memorable period, exercised the greatest
                    influence on the affairs of Europe. Marlborough, Prince Eugene, and Heinsius,
                    formed the famous triumvirate so resolutely determined to humiliate France, and
                    which steeped in bitterness the declining years of Louis XIV He saw his country
                    avenged for the misfortunes which that monarch had inflicted on it in 1672; and
                    he also saw himself avenged; for, after the peace of Nimeguen, having been sent
                    to the court of France on affairs connected with the principality of Orange, he
                    had experienced the ill nature of the haughty and insolent Louvois, who did all
                    but threaten to have him shut up in the Bastille. Heinsius commenced his public
                    career as councillor-pensionary of the town of Delft; and, faithful to his
                    commission, he sometimes, in this capacity, pursued a line of conduct not
                    calculated to make him be considered as a person devoted to the interests of the
                    stadt- <pb break="no" facs="nls:193641799" xml:id="kp-eb0711-1799-0208"/>.
                    holder. But at a subsequent period the Prince of Orange honoured him with the
                    most unlimited confidence; and Heinsius, in return, rendered him the most
                    important services. He continued to enjoy the same favour when that prince
                    became king of England, and even after he had been succeeded by Queen Anne.
                    After the death of King William, however, his political conduct in regard to
                    France appears to have experienced some modification, though not to such an
                    extent as to enable the French court to flatter themselves with any decided
                    change in his views. Voltaire, in his <hi rend="italic">Siècle</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">de Louis XIV.,</hi> represents Heinsius as a Spartan, proud of
                    having humbled the king of Persia, when, in 1709, Louis sent his minister De
                    Torcy to the Hague to sue for peace. De Torcy himself, in his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Mémoires</hi> (tom. ii. p*3), describes the grand pensionary “as a man of
                    consummate ability in the management of affairs, cold in his manners, polished
                    in his conversation, having nothing repulsive in his demeanour, and rarely
                    warmed, far less excited, by debate. His exterior,” adds the same authority,
                    “was simple, and his house plain; an establishment composed of a secretary, a
                    coachman, a laquais, and a female servant, by no means indicated the credit of a
                    prime minister.” De Torcy further informs us that “he was never accused, either
                    of seeking to prolong the war on account of the consideration which its
                    continuance necessarily gave him, or from any views of private interest or
                    personal ambition.” This is the testimony of an enemy, and cannot, therefore, be
                    suspected of partiality. Μ. de Haren, in a note to his poem of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Gueux,</hi> renders the same justice to the calmness and sobriety
                    of Heinsius; but supposes that his seclusion from society prevented him
                    acquiring that knowledge of the human heart which a statesman ought to possess,
                    and thus led him to disregard intelligence, of which one better acquainted with
                    mankind would at once have discerned the importance. “Hence, when the refugee
                    pastor Basnage, in 1707, apprised him of a certain secret convention entered
                    into between the courts of Vienna and Versailles to defeat the projected
                    enterprise against Toulon, Heinsius neglected this information, not imagining it
                    possible that a minister of the gospel could be better initiated in the secrets
                    of cabinets than a grand pensionary.” But Fagel did not share this security, nor
                    was it justified by the event. Μ. de Haren also mentions a singular anecdote of
                    Heinsius. Soon after the peace of Utrecht be was attacked by the pestilence in
                    the midst of the Hague, and cured without the appalling fact being suffered to
                    transpire. On this occasion he displayed admirable prudence and self-possession.
                    The secret was confined to himself, his physician, and Count de
                    Wassenaer-Starrenburg, and was kept with inviolable fidelity until after his
                    death. Heinsius was the last of the magistrates and ministers of the states of
                    Holland who wore the costume of the gown and band. <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >(a.)</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">Heinsius,</hi><hi rend="italic">Daniel,</hi> a
                    Dutch philologist, was descended of a distinguished family, and born at Ghent in
                    1580. In the troubles of the Low Countries, his father, a man without ambition,
                    but of an elevated character, took a part, which proved fatal to his own repose
                    and that of his family. Daniel was sent to Veere, in Zealand, whence, with his
                    parents, he passed over into England; and soon afterwards he accompanied them on
                    their return to Holland. They established themselves first at Delft, then at the
                    village of Ryswick, and lastly at the Hague. The father of Heinsius consoled
                    himself under his misfortunes by devoting his attention to the education of his
                    son; but circumstances obliged the latter to return to Zealand, where he was
                    placed under good masters, though at first he showed no great disposition to
                    profit by their instructions, and preferred play to study. Having, however,
                    evinced a predilection for verse, he composed, at the age of ten, a Latin elegy,
                    which gave a favourable presage of future eminence. As his father intended him
                    for the bar, he was, at the age of fourteen, sent to Franeker to study law; but
                    this intention was defeated by the passion which he had conceived for Greek.
                    Having remained about six months at Franeker, he passed thence to Leyden, whose
                    rising university already shone with great lustre. Here he attracted the notice
                    of Scaliger, whilst Marnix de Sainte-Aldegonde, and the elder Douza, honoured
                    him with particular attention. Between Heinsius and Scaliger there was
                    established an intimacy, founded on affection on the one hand and veneration on
                    the other. A noble emulation now fired the soul of Heinsius, who, though
                    ambitious to rival, despaired of ever approaching so great a model, and spent
                    many sleepless nights in the most anxious and unremitting labour. Douza,
                    however, judiciously attempted to moderate the ardour of his young friend
                    without repressing his ambition, and procured him agreeable relaxation by
                    occasionally carrying him to his country residence at Nordwick, two leagues
                    distant from Leyden. Heinsius was only eighteen when he was attached to the
                    university of Leyden, first to explain the Latin classics, and not long
                    afterwards the Greek; and at the age of twenty-five he was appointed to the
                    chair of history and politics. Scaliger, who died in 1609, had wished to leave
                    him the whole of his library; but Heinsius only accepted part of it. On the
                    death of Paul Merula, the office of librarian to the academy of Leyden devolved
                    on him, and he also discharged the duties of secretary. His increasing
                    reputation now attracted to Leyden a great number of pupils; and as other
                    countries envied Holland the possession of a man of such distinguished merit,
                    propositions were made to him on the part of France, Germany, and Italy. In 1616
                    Heinsius writes that the Italians had paid him flattering compliments, and that
                    he was strongly solicited to repair to Rome. “Valde Itali nos amant, et jam
                    clanculum <hi rend="italic">s∕ς rnv</hi><hi rend="italic">ίπταλοφον,</hi>
                    ingenti praemio, videndae urbis causa, invitamur.” If we may credit Balzac,
                    Heinsius, in his relations with Rome, acted with more adroitness than sincerity
                    (“ménageait un peu la chèvre et le chou”). In the apology for his <hi
                    rend="italic">Herodes Infanticida</hi> against the strictures of Balzac, a work
                    which he sent to Rome, a passage of the text in which the pope is mentioned as
                    <hi rend="italic">ipsum</hi><hi rend="italic">Ecclesiae caput,</hi> is rectified
                    in the <hi rend="italic">errata</hi> into <hi rend="italic">ipsum</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Ecclxsioe Romance caput.</hi> “The text,’ says Balzac, “was for
                    Rome, the errata for Leyden; on the one hand Heinsius wished to please the pope,
                    who w ould probably not read his errata, and on the other to have the means of
                    justifying himself to the ministers, ií he should be accused of being a bad
                    Huguenot, and of keeping up an understanding with the enemy.” But, in the first
                    place, this duplicity is irreconcilable with the known character of Heinsius;
                    secondly, it was not Heinsius himself who edited his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Epistola</hi><hi rend="italic">qua</hi><hi rend="italic">Dissertationi</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">D∙ Balzacii ad</hi><hi rend="italic">Herodem Infanticidam
                    respondetur,</hi> but Boxhorn; thirdly, the erratum in question is not placed,
                    as usual, at the end of the volume, but is interposed between the dedication and
                    the Epistle; and, lastly, it appears from the statement of Thysius, in his
                    funeral oration on Heinsius, that, in the propositions made to him by Pope Urban
                    VIII. and Cardinal Barberini, in order to draw him to Rome, nothing had been
                    stipulated in reference to religion. Various honours were, however, conferred
                    upon Heinsius. The republic of Venice created him knight of the order of St
                    Mark; the king of Sweden, Gustavus Adolphus, named him his historiographer, to
                    which he added the title of privy councillor; and the states of Holland rewarded
                    him for his attachment to his country, and the refusal of various foreign
                    propositions, by choosing him their historiographer, and attaching to the title
                    a liberal salary. Heinsius alienated many friends by accepting, in 1618, the
                    office of secretary to the famous synod<pb break="no" facs="nls:193641812"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0711-1812-0209"/> of Dordrecht. At the age of thirty-five he
                    married Ermengarde, sister of Janus Rutgersius, by whom he had a son, Nicoas,
                    and a daughter, Elizabeth, and whom he survived many years. Being endowed with a
                    strong constitution, Heinsius, notwithstanding his unremitting labours, was
                    rarely indisposed; but a particular symptom accompanied the decline of his days,
                    namely, an almost total extinction of memory. He died at Leyden on the 23d of
                    February 1665, when he had nearly completed the eighty-fourth year of his age.
                    Heinsius was not less remarkable for the excellence of his character than for
                    his vast erudition. Modesty, sensibility, benevolence, and candour, formed its
                    distinctive features; and, though he was naturally grave, he loved to joke with
                    his friends, and to indulge in innocent pleasantries. He had some disputes, more
                    or less serious, with Salmasius, Balzac, and a minister of the gospel called
                    John de Croy, who had sought his acquaintance by means of adulation and
                    sycophancy; but being naturally of a mild and peaceable disposition, he avoided
                    controversy as much as possible, and bad probably fewer enemies than almost any
                    eminent man of his time. Notwithstanding his great knowledge, or rather because
                    he knew so much, he adopted as his motto, <hi rend="italic">Quantum</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">est</hi><hi rend="italic">guod</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >nescimus.</hi> The works of Heinsius are, 1. Editions of the Greek and Latin
                    classics, or works of criticism connected with them, amounting to eighteen in
                    number; 2. Latin poetry, particularly <hi rend="italic">Iambi, Auriacus</hi> a

                    preceding, was born at Leyden on the 29th of July 1620, and there received,
                    under the auspices of his father, the most careful education. The same studies
                    in which his parent had distinguished himself became in some measure the passion
                    of his life. He visited England in 1642; but not finding the English very
                    communicative of their literary treasures, he made only a short stay in their
                    country, where, however, he collated some manuscripts of Ovid, a poet whose
                    works he had already undertaken to illustrate. In 1644 he repaired to Spa for
                    the benefit of the waters, from which he derived great advantage, and on his
                    return traversed Belgium, where he formed useful connections, and acquired new
                    riches for his Ovid. The following year he revisited Spa, and towards aŉtumn
                    proceeded to Paris, where his merit and his name procured him the friendship of
                    the most eminent men, and opened all the libraries to his researches, and where
                    also he published a collection of Latin poems, which met with the most
                    flattering success. Next year he visited Rome, where, through the good offices
                    of Holstenius, he obtained access to the inedited Greek work of John Lydus on
                    the Roman magistracies, and was otherwise well received. From Rome he proceeded
                    to Naples, but the troubles which broke out in that city in the summer of 1647
                    obliged him to return to Leghorn, whence he proceeded first to Venice and next
                    to Padua, where, under the title of <hi rend="italic">Italica,</hi> he published
                    two books of elegies in 1648. After an absence of three years he returned to
                    Leyden; but his stay there was short, for, having yielded to the solicitations
                    of Queen Christina of Sweden, who had invited him to join her literary court, he
                    set out for Stockholm, where he established himself in 1650. The queen undertook
                    to purchase books and manuscripts for his library; but Heinsius, unwilling to
                    take immediate advantage of the generosity of Christina, made advances of which
                    he afterwards found great difficulty in obtaining the reimbursement. At
                    Stockholm he met the ardent enemy of his father, Salmasius, who, in concert with
                    Michon Bourdelot, endeavoured to overwhelm him with every species of annoyance,
                    and to drive him from the court in disgust» But the musè of Heinsius avenged him
                    on his implacable adversary; and nothing but the obstinate malevolence of
                    Salmasius can excuse a piece so virulent as the <hi rend="italic">Scazon</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">in</hi><hi rend="italic">Alastorem,</hi> which we find in his
                    poems. During the following years Heinsius traversed Italy in all directions, to
                    make interesting acquisitions for Christina, whether in books and manuscripts,
                    or in medals and antiquities. Salmasius had not ceased to intrigue against him
                    during his absence; but the credit of Bochart counterbalanced this hateful
                    influence, and Salmasius died in 1653, whilst proceeding to take the benefit of
                    the waters of Spa. Next year Heinsius returned to Stockholm, but it was only to
                    demand of Christina, whose tastes began to take another direction, permission to
                    retire, and the reimbursement of the sums which he had expended. Her letter,
                    which is in the form of a <hi rend="italic">placet,</hi> and exceedingly
                    remarkable, may be found in the <hi rend="italic">Sylloge</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Epistolarum</hi> of Peter Burmann (tom. V. p. 766, et seqq.). The Queen of
                    Sweden attempted to dissuade Heinsius from carrying his resolution into effect;
                    and, on the 7th of October 1654, the states of Holland appointed him their
                    resident at Stockholm, which induced him to remain some time longer in the
                    Swedish capital. But in the month of February 1655, having lost his father, he
                    resolved to return to his native country. Like Grotius, he was at the point of
                    death on the road; but, more fortunate than that illustrious man, he escaped
                    from a malady which detained him thirty-six days at Dantzig. On his arrival at
                    the Hague, the states, in order to testify their satisfaction with his conduct
                    in Sweden, offered him his choice of the Prussian or Danish legations; but the
                    state of his health prevented his accepting either of those appointments; and,
                    in 1656, he established himself at Amsterdam, where he was appointed secretary.
                    The repose of his latter days was disturbed by a process brought against him by
                    a courtesan, called Margaret Wullen, whom he had known at Stockholm, and who
                    pretended to have rights over him which he refused to recognise. In 1658 he
                    resigned his secretaryship, and then went to establish himself at the Hague,
                    where Virgil, Valerius Flaccus, the Latin muse, and literary correspondence,
                    occupied all the leisure which the process in question left at his disposal. It
                    appears that he also meditated continuing the Annals of Grotius after 1609, but
                    the design was not carried into' execution. Being again appointed resident at
                    the court of Sweden, he set out for that country, and on the road met his debtor
                    Christina, who was on her way to Denmark; she received him kindly, and lavished
                    on him the most flattering distinctions, but forgot to pay her debt, which would
                    have been much more acceptable to Heinsius. About this time, also, Louis XIV.
                    included him in the number of the foreign men of letters to whom he granted
                    pensions; but the post which he occupied at the court of Sweden prevented his
                    enjoying this favour. He never neglected his favourite studies; and it was
                    therefore with regret that, in the year 1667, he found himself charged with a
                    mission to the czar of Muscovy. In 1671 he once more returned to the Hague, but
                    with his health much impaired; and next year the public calamities forced him to
                    withdraw to East Friseland, then to Bremen, Minden, Paderborn, Mayence, Worms,
                    Spire, and Heidelberg. Upon his return to the Hague he occupied himself
                    principally with Valerius Flaccus and Petronius; but being entangled in new
                    processes, he withdrew to Maarssen, in the province of Utrecht, where he
                    established himself about the month of December 1674. This retreat, however, did
                    not shelter him from the annoyances to which he was exposed, and <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193641825" xml:id="kp-eb0711-1825-0210"/>at length he sought repose in
                    the small town of Viane, where his friend Graevius took pleasure in visiting
                    him. Family affairs having recalled him to the Hague, he died there, on the 7th
                    of October 1681, at the age of sixty-one, having expired in the arms of
                    Graevius, whom he charged with his last instructions. Nicoas Heinsius published
