                <p><label type="entry">HAMPSHIRE</label>, or, as it is sometimes called, the county
                    of <hi rend="smallcaps">Southampton,</hi> or of <hi rend="smallcaps">Hants,</hi>
                    a shire of England, on the British Channel. It is bounded on the east by Surrey
                    and Sussex, on the north by Berkshire, on the west by Wiltshire and Dorsetshire,
                    and on the south by the sea. Its extreme length is fifty-five miles, but, owing
                    to a projection at its south-west extremity, its mean length is not more than
                    forty-four miles, and its breadth thirty-nine miles. Its area, including the
                    Isle of Wight, which is at the extreme points twenty-three miles long and
                    thirteen broad, is 1645 square miles, or 1,052,800 statute acres.</p>
                <p>The whole population amounted in 1801 to 219,656, in 1811 to 245,080, in 1821 to
                    283,208, and in 1831 to 314,700. It appears, by the registers of burials, that
                    the deaths between 1801 and 1811, were one in forty-six of the whole number of
                    inhabitants, that from 1811 to 1821 they were one in fifty-four, and from 1821
                    to 1831, notwithstanding an increase of mortality by the cholera, they were only
                    one in fifty-six; thus a great and regular increase of the longevity of the
                    population has become apparent. The occupations, at the last census, were as
                    follow: Occupiers of land employing labourers, 2774; occupiers of land not
                    employing labourers, 1234; labourers employed in agriculture, 24,675; persons
                    employed in manufactures, 292; employed in retail trade or handicraft, 23,164;
                    capitalists, bankers, and others, 3784; labourers not agricultural, 10,348;
                    other males twenty years of age, 10,348; male servants, 3295; female servants,
                    12,724.</p>
                <p>As a whole, few counties in England are superior to this, or have a less
                    proportion of uncultivated land. But at the western extremity, bordering on
                    Dorsetshire, a small por- ' tion of sandy heath is scarcely productive of any
                    thing but pasture for sheep, or honey. A considerable tract, extending from
                    Winchester to the northern extremity of the county, is down land, principally
                    used for sheep-pasture, but, when brought under the plough, is very fertile in
                    barley, turnips, clover, and sainfoin. Another portion is forest land, including
                    the <hi rend="italic">New Forest</hi> of about 92,000 acres, but within whose
                    boundary a great part of the land is highly cultivated, and very fertile. The
                    abundance of timber trees of large dimensions, the open glades between, and the
                    variety of foliage, as well of the trees as of the underwood, render the scenery
                    of the district highly delightful. The oaks are the principal beauty of this
                    forest; they do not grow to a great height, but swell to large dimensions in the
                    trunk, and shoot out strong crooked branches, which give them a very picturesque
                    appearance, and add to their value as naval timber, by being well adapted to be
                    used as knees for ships of the largest size. The beech trees also grow to a very
                    great size, and contribute to the beauty as well as the profits of the forest.
                    The other forests are Alice, Holt, and Woolmer, extending over about 15,500
                    acres, of which nearly one half belongs to the crown, and affords excellent oak
                    timber; and Bere Forest, of 16,000 acres, whose timber has been much neglected.
                    In these forests there are abundance of deer belonging to the crown, some of
                    which are annually killed, and distributed, according to ancient prescription,
                    to the various officers of the government and the royal household. The greater
                    part of the county is enclosed, and even the down lands are so in a great
                    measure.</p>
                <p>The principal rivers are the Itchen, which forms a part of the estuary of
                    Southampton Water; the Avon, which falls into the sea at Christchurch Bay; the
                    Boldre, which empties itself at Lymington. The Anton, which falls into the Tees,
                    receives many small brooks before it reaches Southampton, where it is lost in
                    that arm of the sea. The canals of the county are but two. The Bassingstoke was
                    begun in 1778, to communicate between that town and London. It is thirty-seven
                    miles in length, and terminates near Guildford, in the river Wey, which falls
                    into the Thames. It passes through a tunnel, near three quarters of a mile in
                    length, under Grewell Hill, near Odiham. This canal was not completed till 1794⅛
                    when it had cost L.100,000; and the tolls are not yet sufficient to pay the
                    interest. The Andover Canal was begun in 1789 at that town, and terminates at
                    Redbridge; and is useful to con ∙ vey coals and other heavy commodities to the
                    centre of the county.</p>
                <p>The soil of this county is very various, but, in almost every part, it rests on a
                    calcareous subsoil. The uplands are generally appropriated to breeding sheep,
                    and hence the culture of turnips has been much extended. After the turnips are
                    fed on the land, barley is usually sown, and with it clover, or other artificial
                    grass-seeds. To the clover succeeds sometimes wheat or oats, and, when the land
                    is somewhat heavier in texture, occasionally beans; but in few parts of England
                    are the rotations of crops more diversified. The average produce of corn on
                    these high lands is not more than sixteen bushels of wheat, twenty-two of
                    barley, and twenty-four of oats to the acre. The, ploughing is almost
                    universally performed by horses, which are of a very excellent race. On much of
                    the stiffer lands four of these strong horses are thought necessary; but on
                    lighter lands, and with a single-wheeled plough, sometimes two or three are
                    used, and very rarely are harnessed abreast of each other. On the higher lands,
                    the hay for winter consumption is generally made from sainfoin, a plant which
                    peculiarly flourishes when the subsoil is calcareous. It is <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193640772" xml:id="kp-eb0711-0772-0129"/>laid down with much care in
                    extirpating all weeds, and every other description of grasses, and will usually
                    continue for ten years to be fit for mowing; and on some soils it has been found
                    to last even twenty years, and yield abundant crops of hay. There is no part of
                    England in which this valuable grass is so well or so extensively
                    cultivated.</p>
                <p>The corn lands on the lower levels of the county are much more productive; but on
                    those districts they have no occasion for sainfoin, and scarcely for clover, as
                    their rich water meadows supply them with a sufficiency of hay. Some of these
                    meadows are perhaps the most valuable of any lands in this island, and are
                    managed with great skill and attention. Where a rapid stream of water can be
                    passed over them during the whole winter, it seldom becomes frozen; and the
                    grasses grow during the cold weather, so as to be fit for pasture at an early
                    period in the spring, before any traces of vegetation appear in the surrounding
                    fields. This young grass is a provision for the sheep, when no other green food
                    is to be found, and supplies them to the beginning of May, when it is laid up,
                    and in six or eight weeks it is fit to be mowed, and yields most abundant
                    quantities of hay. There is much of this valuable description of land in the
                    fertile valley that extends from Overton to Redbridge, by Stockbridge.</p>
                <p>In the eastern part of the county, bordering on Surrey, there are extensive hop
                    plantations, the produce of which is equal in flavour to those in the adjoining
                    villages of that country near Farnham.</p>
                <p>The original race of Hampshire sheep were white faced, with horns; but these have
                    been so often crossed with other races, that few of an unmixed breed are left.
                    Most of the flocks now are of the Southdown kind; they are found to be more
                    beneficial, both on account of the superior quality of their wool, and the
                    tendency to fatten with a less quantity of food than any others. The cows are
                    not much attended to, and are not generally of the best kind. The introduction
                    of the Welsh breed has made some improvement, but there is room for much
                    more.</p>
                <p>The breeding and fattening of pigs has long been a most important part of
                    Hampshire husbandry. The bacon from them is the principal animal food of the
                    rural inhabitants. In the vicinity of the forests they are fed on acorns and
                    beech-mast; and those so fattened are considered as the best, either as pickled
                    pork, or when converted into bacon. The average weight of these animals, when
                    deemed fit for slaughter, is abóut 440 or 450 pounds, but many of them weigh 800
                    pounds.</p>
                <p>The manufactures of this county are neither numerous nor extensive, except those
                    carried on at Portsmouth, for warlike purposes. Besides the ship-building in the
                    royal yard, there are many vessels, both for war and trade, built on the river
                    Itchen at Buckler’s Hard, on the river Boldre, and on the banks of Southampton
                    Water. The manufacturing of their woollen goods upon a small scale is carried on
                    at Andover, Romsey, Alton, and Basingstoke. Paper is made at Romsey and at
                    Overton. The mills at the latter place have supplied the whole of the thin paper
                    used by the Bank of England for their notes, ever since the reign of George I.
                    Ringwood has been long celebrated for the excellence of the strong beer brewed
                    there, but the quantity has declined of late years. On the sea-shore at
                    Lymington, and on the island of Hayling, near Havant, some salt is made by the
                    evaporation of sea-water. The quantity depends on the degree of heat which
                    prevails during the summer season, as the first part of the process of
                    evaporation is performed by the heat of the sun alone; the brine is afterwards
                    conveyed to iron pans, and the process completed by artificial heat, which, as
                    coals, the only fuel, are dear, makes the whole expensive, and prevents the
                    proprietors from competing with the northern manufacturers of salt.</p>
                <p>The foreign commerce of the county is inconsiderable. Many merchant ships repair
                    to Portsmouth with stores for the naval arsenal; and, in time of war, many
                    prizes are carried thither for sale, which creates some extensive trade.
                    Southampton imports much wine from Portugal, which, before the introduction of
                    the bonding system, used to be deposited in the islands of Guernsey and Jersey,
                    to save the interest upon the amount of the duties. At Christ-church there are a
                    few vessels fitted for the Newfoundland fishery.</p>
                <p>The most populous town in the county is Portsmouth, which, with its adjuncts,
                    Portsea and Gosport, with the adjacent villages, contains between fifty and
                    sixty thousand inhabitants. The far greater part of these are the families of
                    officers of the navy, army, and marines, and of the arsenal, with the various
                    artificers.</p>
                <p>The harbour of Portsmouth is perhaps one of the best in the world. Its entrance
                    is narrow, and therefore easily defended. The approach to that entrance is
                    defended by batteries, that can rake any ship before it reaches the fire of the
                    castles, at the two narrowest points. The depth of water is sufficient for the
                    largest ships, and the interior spreads out into an extensive basin of still
                    water, in which there is room for all the British fleet to anchor. The system of
                    building no ships of war in private yards has much increased the number of
                    artificers of every description. The mast-making, anchor-making, cable-making,
                    and particularly the making of blocks, are all conducted within the. walls of
                    the arsenal, which, as a whole, is a most astonishing combination of vast powers
                    simply and economically directed to naval purposes. The gun-wharf, victualling
                    office, the king’s mill, and many other public buildings, merit rather a
                    detailed description than such brief notices as our limits allow. One of the
                    finest objects depending on the naval establishment is the hospital for sick and
                    wounded seamen at Haslar. It is 567 feet in length. It is divided into 100
                    wards, each sixty feet long and twenty-four broad, calculated to receive twenty
                    patients, with apartments adjoining for nurses and attendants.</p>
                <p>Southampton is celebrated for the beauty of its environs, the elegance of the
                    streets and buildings, and the purity and salubrity of its air; and it is much
                    frequented for salt-water bathing, as well as on account of a chalybeate spring
                    of considerable repute. In the'summer season it is a place of fashionable resort
                    to those who wish to enjoy rides amongst the pleasing scenery of the New
                    Forest.</p>
                <p>Winchester, a city of ancient date, has fallen into decay, and now depends on its
                    being the county town, the see of the bishop of an extensive diocese, the
                    station of his courts, and a collegiate place, in which many youths of the first
                    families in the kingdom receive their classical education. The cathedral and the
                    castle are venerable piles of antiquity, though the former was much damaged and
                    the latter blown up by the soldiers of Cromwell, after his capture of the
                    city.</p>
                <p>The antiquities of this county are very numerous, and may be contemplated in the
                    ruins of numerous castles, abbeys, and shattered towers, which add not a little
                    to the beauty of the scenery. The most remarkable of these are Calshot Castle,
                    Netley Abbey, Hurst Castle, Porchester Castle, and Beaulieu Abbey. Antiquities
                    of more early date, of ancient British or of Roman origin, are scattered over
                    the county. The numerous barrows are ascribed to the former, and many vestiges
                    of intrenched camps and castles to the latter.</p>
                <p>The beauty of the country has attracted to it a greater number of families of
                    rank and fortune than almost any other county can enumerate, the bare list of
                    which would fill a page.</p>

                <p>By the law of 1832 this county has, for election purposes, been divided into the
                    northern and southern parts, each of which returns two members to the House of
                    Commons. The northern division contains about 2400 voters. The place of election
                    is Winchester, and the other polling places are, Alton, Andover, Basingstoke,
                    Kingsclere, Droxford, Odiham, and Petersfield. The southern division has about
                    3150 voters; the election is held at Southampton, and the other polling places
                    are Farcham, Lymington, Ringwood, and Romsey. By the same law the boroughs of
                    Whitchurch, Stockbridge, Yarmouth, and Newton have been disfranchised, and the
                    boroughs of Petersfield and Chrlst-church, which used to elect two members, now
                    choose only one each. The towns which now return two members each are,
                    Winchester, Southampton, Andover, Lymington, Newport, and Portsmouth, with which
                    has been incorporated the adjacent large town of Portsea.</p>
