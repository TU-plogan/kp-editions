                <p><label type="entry">HOLDER, <hi rend="smallcaps">William</hi></label>, an English
                    divine, was born in Nottinghamshire, educated in Pembroke Hall, Cambridge, and
                    appointed rector of Blechingdon of Oxford in 1642. In 1660 he received the
                    degree of doctor in divinity, and afterwards became canon of Ely, fellow of the
                    Royal Society, canon of St Paul’s, sub-dean of the chapel royal, and sub-almoner
                    to his majesty. Dr Holder was an accomplished scholar, and distinguished himself
                    by teaching a young gentleman of rank who was born deaf and dumb, to speak. This
                    gentleman’s name was Alexander Popham, son of Colonel Edward Popham, who was for
                    some time an admiral in the service of the Long Parliament. The cure was
                    performed by him at Blechingdon in 1659; but Popham losing what he had been
                    taught by Holder after he returned home to his friends, was sent to Dr Wallis,
                    under <pb break="no" facs="nls:193645699" xml:id="kp-eb0711-5699-0508"/>whom he
                    recovered the use of speech. Holder published a book entitled the Elements of
                    Speech, being an inquiry into the natural production of letters, with an
                    appendix concerning persons who are deaf and dumb, 1669, 8vo. In the appendix he
                    relates how soon, and by what methods, he brought Popham to speak. In 1678, he
                    published a Supplement to the Philosophical Transactions of July 1670, with some
                    reflections on Dr Wallis’s letter there inserted, in 4to. This was written to
                    vindicate the merit of having taught Popham to speak, which Wallis in the letter
                    referred to had claimed to himself; but Dr Wallis soon afterwards published a
                    Defence of the Royal Society, and the Philosophical Transactions, particularly
                    those of July 1670, in answer to the Cavils of Dr W <hi rend="superscript">
                    r</hi> illiam Holder, 1678, in 4to. Holder was skilled in the theory and
                    practice of music, and wrote a treatise on the Natural Grounds and Principles of
                    Harmony, 1694, 8vo. He also wrote a Discourse concerning Time, with application
                    of the natural day, lunar month, and solar year, &amp;c. 1694, in 8vo. He died
                    at Amen Corner in London, on the 24th of January 1696, and was buried in St
                    Paul’s.</p>
