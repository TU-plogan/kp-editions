                    Christian</hi></label>, lord of Zeeł-hem, was the second sou of Constantine
                    Huygens, secretary and counsellor to the princes of Orange, and born at the
                    Flague on the 14th of April 1629. He was one of those rare men who, from the
                    most subtile theories, know how to deduce the most useful applications, and
                    wjioιn admirable inventions in the arts, as well as the sciences, place on the
                    same level with the Archimedeses and the Newtons. His family, originally from
                    Brabant, was rich and respected; and the important post which his father held
                    under three successive princes of Orange had been filled by his grandfather, as
                    it subsequently was by his elder brother Constantine, who in this capacity
                    attended King William in the celebrated expedition to England, which <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193649040" xml:id="kp-eb0711-9040-0765"/> issued in the
                    Revolution of 1688. His father, a distinguished man of letters, whose poetical
                    compositions had attained much celebrity, was not slow in remarking the happy
                    qualities of his genius, and, full of paternal solicitude for his improvement,
                    became his first instructor. He early taught his son music, arithmetic, and
                    geography; and, about the age of thirteen, initiated him in the knowledge of
                    mechanics, for which young Huygens showed a surprising aptitude. At fifteen he
                    received the assistance of a master in the mathematics, a geometer of Amsterdam
                    named Stampioen, of whom Descartes has left an unfavourable impression, but who
                    in a short time enabled his pupil to make great progress. At the age of sixteen
                    he was sent to Leyden to study law under the learned jurisconsult Vinnius, who
                    dedicated to him his Commentary on the Institutions; but he did not permit
                    jurisprudence to divert him from his mathematical studies, which he prosecuted
                    at this place, as well as afterwards at Breda, where an university had been
                    erected, and where, being placed under the direction of his father, he resided
                    from 1646 to 1648. In these two cities he had as masters two very able
                    geometers, Francis Schooten and John Pell; and his first essays were so
                    successful that they attracted the notice of Descartes, to whom the author had
                    communicated them. The genius of this great man divined instinctively that of
                    Huygens. “It is some time,” said he, in a letter written at this period, “since
                    Professor Schoo-ten sent me a writing by the second son of Μ. de Zuylichem
                    touching a mathematical invention which he had attempted to make; and although
                    he has not yet found his account in the pursuit (which is not wonderful, seeing
                    he sought a thing which no one has ever been able to find), yet he has taken
                    such a bias towards geometry, that I feel assured he will become excellent in
                    that science, of which I scarcely see any one who knows anything.” On his part,
                    the young geometer was filled with admiration of the great philosopher; and he
                    wrote to Father Mersenne that, for ages, no one comparable to him had appeared.
                    Nevertheless, Huygens had not the good fortune to see him. Descartes had quitted
                    Holland, and when, in 1649, Huygens, having left the university, travelled with
                    Henry Count de Nassau, he regretted much not having it in his power to pass from
                    Denmark to Sweden, whither Descartes had repaired, out of complaisance to the
                    imperious Christina. After this tour, he settled in his native country; and it
                    was then that he commenced that series of inventions which have rendered his
                    name so justly celebrated. In 1651 he published at Leyden his <hi rend="italic"

                    work which afforded a favourable specimen of his genius for mathematics, and
                    gave promise of still greater excellence. In 1655 he travelled into France, and
                    took the degree of doctor of laws at Angers. In 1658 he published at the Hague
                    his <hi rend="italic">Horologium osciilatorium,</hi><hi rend="italic"

                    <hi rend="superscript"> ,</hi> pendulum; but as some persons, envious of his
                    reputation, laboured to deprive him of the honour of the invention, he wrote his
                    <hi rend="italic">Horologium osciilatorium</hi> to explain the construction of
                    his pendulum, and to show that it differed from the astronomical pendulum
                    invented by Galileo. In 1659 he published his <hi rend="italic">Systema
                    Saturninum, sive</hi><hi rend="italic">de</hi><hi rend="italic">causis
                    mirandorum Saturni</hi><hi rend="italic">phenomenon,</hi><hi rend="italic">et
                    comite ejus planeta novo.</hi> Galileo had endeavoured to explain some of the
                    appearances exhibited by the planet Saturn; he had at first perceived two
                    attendant stars, but some time afterwards was surprised to find that they had
                    disappeared. Huygens, desirous to account for these changes, laboured with his
                    brother Constantine to improve the construction of telescopes; and having at
                    length made an instrument of this kind, possessing greater power than any which
                    had yet been contrived, he proceeded to observe the phases of Saturn, and to
                    record all the different aspects of that planet. The results were of equal
                    interest and importance to the science of astronomy. He discovered a satellite
                    of that planet, which had hitherto escaped the notice of astronomers; and, after
                    a long course of observation, he showed that the planet is surrounded with a
                    solid and permanent ring, which never changes its situation. In 1660, he took a
                    second journey into France, and the year following he visited England, where he
                    communicated the art of polishing glasses for telescopes, and was admitted as a
                    member of the Royal Society. The air-pump, then recently invented, he materially
                    improved; and about the same time he also discovered the laws of the collision
                    of elastic bodies, as did afterwards our own countrymen, Wallis and Wren, who
                    disputed with him the honour of the discovery. After a stay of some months in
                    England, Huygens returned to France, where, in 1663, his merit became so
                    conspicuous, that Colbert resolved to bestow on him such a pension as might
                    induce him to establish hitnself at Paris. But this resolution was not carried
                    into effect until 1665, when letters written in the king’s name were forwarded
                    to the Hague, where he then resided, inviting him to repair to Paris, and
                    offering him a considerable pension, with other advantages. Huygens accepted the
                    proposal of the French minister, and, from 1666 to 1681 resided at Paris, where
                    he was admitted as a member of the Royal Academy of Sciences. During this period
                    he was occupied with mathematical pursuits; he wrote and published several
                    works, which were most favourably received; and he invented and perfected some
                    useful instruments and machines. But, by continued application, his health began
                    to be impaired; and although he had twice had recourse to his native air, and on
                    both occasions derived benefit from the change, the improvement was only
                    temporary, and he at length found it necessary to quit France and return to his
                    own country. It is not improbable that his departure was accelerated by the
                    revocation of the edict of Nantes; for although he had received an assurance
                    that he would be permitted to enjoy the same liberty as before, without being
                    molested on account of his opinions, he had but little encouragement to remain
                    in a country where his religion was proscribed, and those who professed it
                    subjected to the most cruel persecution. He accordingly left Paris in 1681;
                    passed the remainder of his life in his own country, occupied with his usual
                    pursuits; and died at the Hague on the 8th of June 1693, in the sixty-seventh
                    year of his age, whilst his <hi rend="italic">Cosmotheoros,</hi> a treatise on
                    the plurality of worlds, was passing through the press. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >Opera</hi><hi rend="italic">Varia</hi> of Huygens were published in 1700, 4to,
                    and his <hi rend="italic">Opuscula Posthuma</hi> appeared soon afterwards,
                    Leyden, 1703, in 4to. The former collection, which is generally bound in four
                    volumes, contains the greater number of the pieces which he published
                    separately, and is divided into four parts; the first comprising the pieces
                    relating to mechanics; the second, those relating to geometry; the third, those
                    relating to astronomy; and the fourth, miscellaneous productions, which could
                    not be arranged under any of the preceding heads. ’ sGravesande had the care of
                    this edition, in which he inserted various additions to the different pieces
                    extracted from the manuscripts of Huygens. The same individual also
                    superintended the publication of his <hi rend="italic">Opera</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Reliqua,</hi> which appeared at Amsterdam in 1728, in two vols.
                    4to, and contain, 1. his Treatises on Light and Gravity; and, 2. his <hi
                    rend="italic">Opuscula Posthuma,</hi> originally printed in 1703. For a masterly
                    account of the genius and labours of Huygens, the reader may consult the
                    Dissertations by Professors Playfair and Sir John Leslie, prefixed to this work.
                    This illustrious man gave his whole time to science; he loved a <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193649053" xml:id="kp-eb0711-9053-0766"/>quiet studious life, and
                    found sufficient enjoyment in pursuing curious and useful researches. He was
                    modest, amiable, cheerful, and in all respects as estimable in private life as
                    he was eminent in science. It is not a little singular, that the discovery of
                    the real nature, or at least of the true figure, of the luminous belt or ring
                    which encompasses the planet Saturn should have been made by the same individual
                    who invented the pendulum clock and the micrometer. <hi rend="smallcaps"
