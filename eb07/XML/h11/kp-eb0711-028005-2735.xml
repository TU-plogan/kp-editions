                    Agnes de Herrera, it being the custom of that country to bear the mother’s name,
                    was born in 1565. He was at first secretary to Vespasian de Gonzaga, viceroy of
                    Naples, but was afterwards appointed historiographer of the Indies by <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193642748" xml:id="kp-eb0711-2748-0281"/> Philip II. who
                    granted him a liberal pension. Whilst he held this office, he wrote his General
                    History of the Indies from 1492 to 1554, in four volumes folio. Of all the
                    Spanish authors, Herrera is the one who has given the most exact and
                    circumstantial recital of the conquest of Mexico and the other events in
                    America. Hence, to use the words of Dr Robertson, his work “furnishes the
                    fullest and most accurate information concerning the conquest of Mexico as well
                    as every other transaction of America. The industry and attention with which he
                    consulted, not only the books, but the original and public records, were so
                    great, and he usually judges of the evidence before him with so much
                    impartiality and candour, that his decades may be ranked among the most
                    judicious and useful historical collections.” His death, which happened at
                    Madrid on the 29th of March 1625, prevented him from occupying the office of
                    secretary of state, to which Philip IV. had just raised him. Besides the work
                    above mentioned, Herrera wrote in Spanish, 1. Description of the West Indies,
                    Madrid, 1601, in folio; 2. History of what passed in England and in Scotland
                    during the forty-four years of the life of Mary Stuart, queen of Scotland,
                    Lisbon, 1590, in 12mo; 3. Five Books of the History of Portugal, and the
                    conquest of the Açores in the years 1581 and 1583, Madrid, 1591, in 4to; 4.
                    History of the affairs of France from the year 1585 until the end of the year
                    1594, Madrid, 1598, in 4to; 5. History of the world under the reign of Philip
                    II. from the year 1584 until the year 1598, Valladolid, 1606, in three vols.
                    folio; 6. Historical Treatise, Relation, and Discourse, of the Movements which
                    took place in Aragon in the years 1591 and 1592, in 4to; 7. Commentary on the
                    Proceedings of the Spaniards, the French, and the Venetians, in Italy, from the
                    year 1285 until the year 1559, Madrid, 1624, in folio.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Herrera,</hi><hi rend="italic">Ferdinand de,</hi> a Spanish
                    poet of the sixteenth century, was born at Seville about the year 1516. He was
                    thoroughly conversant with the Greek, Latin, Italian, and French languages, and
                    also passed for a profound theologian; but he applied himself, in preference, to
                    poetry, and was the first of the four Spanish poets who obtained the surname of
                    divine. Although he had taken holy orders at the age of thirty, all his verses
                    are addressed to a distinguished lady of Andalusia, whom he celebrates under
                    various names; but his love was as pure and platonic as that of Petrarch, whom
                    he endeavoured to imitate, in following the footsteps of Boscan and Garcilaso.
                    Herrera died in his native place about the year 1595. The collection of his
                    poetry, entitled <hi rend="italic">Obrasde Herrera,</hi> Seville, 1619, contains
                    sonnets, songs, lyrics, and elegies, full of spirit, grace, and expression; but
                    his style is at times deficient in correctness. Herrera was also the author of,
                    1. Relacion de la Guerra de Cypre y batalla de Lepanto, Seville, 1572; 2. Vida y
                    Muerte de Thomas Moro, ibid. 1592, translated from the Latin of Stapleton; 3. An
                    edition of the Poems <hi rend="italic">of</hi> Garcilaso de la Vega, with
                    interesting notes, Seville, 1580, in 8vo. <hi rend="smallcaps">(a.)</hi></p>
