                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">The</hi> Horse is a distinct genus belonging to the order of
                    <hi rend="italic">Belluoe,</hi> or large beasts, and in himself the most
                    serviceable of all quadruped animals, as well as the swiftest of those brought
                    under the dominion of man.’ Notwithstanding these high qualifications, ancient
                    history informs us, that, in the primitive ages of the world, the ass was used
                    in preference to him, not only as a mere beast of burthen, but for the purpose
                    of conveying, from place to place, persons of the highest distinction. This,
                    however, may be satisfactorily accounted for. Previously to the art of
                    horsemanship being known, the ass, a superior race of animal perhaps to that
                    generally found in Europe, was more easily managed than the horse, and better
                    suited to the kind of food usually met with for his support. He was, in fact,
                    found to answer every purpose of horses, until mankind increased in numbers and
                    in wealth, when the complicated interests that were the result brought their
                    services into use, and they were trained to the art of war. But another reason
                    may be given for the late introduction of horses. Their use was interdicted by
                    the Almighty in the early ages of the world, first, lest his favourite people,
                    the Israelites, should be led to idolatry, by carrying on commerce with Egypt;
                    secondly, by their dependence on a well appointed cavalry, they might cease to
                    trust in the promised aid of Jehovah; and, thirdly, that they might not be
                    tempted to extend their dominion by such means, and then, by mixing with
                    idolatrous nations, cease in time to be that distinct and separate people which
                    it was His intention they should be, and without which the prophecies relative
                    to the Messiah could not be fully accomplisned. Thus, in the Book of Psalms, the
                    horse commonly appears only on the side of the enemies of God’s people; and so
                    entirely unaccustomed to the management of him were the Israelites, at the
                    period of their signal defeat of the Philistines and other idolatrous nations,
                    that David, their commander and king, caused the greater part of the horses of
                    the cavalry prisoners to be cut down, from his ignorance of any use to which he
                    could apply them. In the reign of Solomon, however, a cavalry force was
                    established, but to no great extent.</p>
                <p>In the infant state of all nations, indeed, we can readily account for the
                    restrictive use of horses. A great deal of land that might be applied to the
                    production of human food is requisite for their maintenance in all countries;
                    and, in hot and sterile ones, the camel answered better, and was found ready at
                    hand. It is true they were used in the armies of the ancient Greeks and Romans,
                    which were not considered as complete without them. In Greece they were not so
                    numerous; but in a war with the Italic Gauls, the Romans are said to have had no
                    less than seventy thousand horses, and seven hundred thousand foot, to attack
                    their formidable enemies.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    in Thrace, after it had passed the Hellespont, is reported by Herodotus,
                    contemporary with him, to have contained eighty thousand horse; but the
                    judicious reader will be inclined to make considerable abatements from the
                    boasted amount of that celebrated but ill-fated expedition, resting, as it does,
                    entirely on the authority of Grecian writers, who represented facts in the light
                    the most unfavourable to their enemies, and the most glorious to their own
                    gallant countrymen.</p>
                <p>As in the scale of excellence, the horse ranks first of all animals coming under
                    the denomination of cattle, and, as Buffon justly says of him, “possesses, along
                    with grandeur of stature, the greatest elegance and proportion of parts of all
                    quadrupeds,” it is not a matter of surprise, that, as an image of motive vigour,
                    he should have been the subject of the chisel and the pencil of the first
                    artists in the world, or that the description of him by the pen should have been
                    not considered as unworthy the greatest writers of antiquity. But it is in his
                    native simplicity, in those wild and extensive plains where he was originally
                    produced; where he ranges without control, and riots in all the variety of luxu
                    rious nature, that we can form an adequate idea of this noble animal. It is here
                    that he disdains the assistance of man, which only tends to servitude; and it is
                    to a description of his release from this servitude, his regaining his natural
                    liberty, that we are indebted for two of the finest similes of the immortal
                    Greek and Roman epic bards. The return of Paris, with Hector, to the battle of
                    Troy, is thus given in the sixth book of the Iliad :—</p>

                <p>And Virgil is considered to have even exceeded Homer, in that splendid passage in
                    the eleventh book of the Aeneid, where Turnus turning out fully accoutred for
                    the fight, is compared to a horse that has just broken loose from his stall
                    :—</p>
                <p>“Qualis, ubi abruptis fugit praesepia vinclis, Tandem liber equus, campoque
                    potitus aperto, Aut ille in pastus armentaque tendit equarum, Aut, assuetus
                    aquae perfundi flumine noto, Emicat, arrectisque fremit cervicibus alte
                    Luxurians; luduntque jubae per colla, per armos.”</p>
                <p>It is impossible, at this distance of time, to fix upon the native country of the
                    horse, as he has been found, in various forms, and of various sizes, in every
                    region of the Old World. The difference in size is easily accounted for. The
                    origin of all animals of the same species was doubtless the same in the
                    beginning of time, and it is chiefly <hi rend="italic">climate</hi> that has
                    produced the change we perceive in them. Warmth being congenial to his
                    constitution, and cold naturally injurious to him, he is produced in the most
                    perfect form, and in the greatest vigour, when subject to the influence of the
                    one, and not only diminutive, but misshapen and comparatively worthless, when
                    exposed to the evils of the other. Buffon, however, is wrong in making the horse
                    indigenous to Arabia, as is clearly proved by a reference to the Sacred
                    Writings. In the reign of Saul, horsebreeding had not yet been introduced into
                    Arabia; for, in a war with some of the Arabian nations, the Israelites got
                    plunder in camels, sheep, and asses, but still no horses. Even at the time when
                    Jerusalem was conquered and first destroyed by Nebuchadnezzar, Arabia appears to
                    have been without horses, as the Tyrians brought theirs from Armenia. That the
                    earliest available uses of the active powers of horses was adopted by the
                    Egyptians, the same authority satisfies us; for we read in the third chapter of
                    Genesis, that when Joseph carried h s father’s re mi ns from Egypt to Canaan,
                    “there went up with him both chariots and horsemen.” One hundred and fifty years
                    afterwards, the horse constituted the principal strength of the Egyptian <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193646466" xml:id="kp-eb0711-6466-0567"/> army; Pharaoh
                    having pursued the Israelites with “six hundred chosen chariots, and with all
                    the chariots of Egypt·” The earliest period now alluded to was 1650 years before
                    the birth of Christ; and 1450 years before that event, the horse was so far
                    naturalized in Greece, that the Olympic Games were instituted, including chariot
                    and horse races.</p>
                <p>The origin of the native horse of our own country is now merely a question of
                    historical interest, the discussion of which would not lead to much practical
                    benefit. That experiments, founded on the study of his nature and properties,
                    which have from time to time been made to improve the breed, and bring the
                    different varieties to the perfection in which we now find them, have succeeded,
                    is best confirmed by the fact of the high estimation in which the horses of
                    Great Britain are held in all parts of the civilized world; and it is not too
                    much to assert, that, although the cold, humid, and variable nature of our
                    climate is by no means favourable to the production of these animals <hi
                    rend="italic">in their very best form,</hi> we have, by great care, and after a
                    lapse of nearly two centuries, by our attention to breeding, high feeding, and
                    good grooming, with consequent development of the muscles, brought them to the
                    highest state of perfection (with one exception<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The exception is the English cart-horse, as
                    will be stated hereafter.</p></note>) of which their nature is susceptible. They
                    may be classed under the following heads, and treated of individually, viz. the
                    Race-Horse, thorough-bred and not thorough-bred; the Hunter; the Hackney, for
                    various purposes; the Charger; the Troop-Horse; the Coach, Chariot, and Gig
                    Horse; the Stage-coach and Post Horse; and the Draught or Cart Horse.</p>
                <p>THE RACE-HORSE.</p>
                <p>Although we may safely pronounce that the native-breed of English horses, however
                    esteemed for other purposes, could not <hi rend="italic">race,</hi> in the
                    present acceptation of that word, yet it is equally obvious that they formed the
                    parent stock of the renowned English racer. The first step to improve it by a
                    cross with eastern blood, appears to have been taken by James the First, who
                    gave the enormous sum (in those days) of L. 500 for an Arab stallion, which,
                    however, the Duke of Newcastle, in his work on Horsemanship (great authority at
                    that time), wrote down, on account, chiefly, of his comparatively diminutive
                    size. At the Restoration, however, there appears to have been a tolerably good
                    breed of horses in England, which Charles the Second improved by an importation
                    of Barbs and Turks, whose blood was engrafted on the original stock, already
                    very considerably ameliorated by the services of a stallion called Place’s White
                    Turk, imported by Oliver Cromwell’s Master of the Horse, who bore that name; and
                    afterwards by those of the Helmsley Turk, followed by Fairfax’s Morocco Barb.
                    The change was at this time so visible, that the Lord Harleigh of that day
                    expressed his fears lest it might be carried to such an extreme as to extirpate
                    the strong and useful horse, which, perhaps, the majority of his countrymen were
                    well satisfied with before. In the latter end of Queen Anne’s reign, however,
                    the first great trump turned up, to secure future success. This was a stallion,
                    called Darley⅛ Arabian, purchased in the Levant, by a Yorkshire merchant of that
                    name, although without any real attestation of his pedigree, or country. The
                    prejudice against Arabians, and other eastern horses, the effect of the Duke of
                    Newcastle’s anathema against them, having now, for the most part, subsided, a
                    good deal of their blood had been infused into the mares of that day, when
                    another stallion, whose services were still more signal, accidentally made his
                    appearance. We allude to the Godolphin Arabian, as he was called, pureliased out
                    of a cart in Paris, and consequently of uncertain caste, but evidently the horse
                    of the Desert; who, as will be hereafter shewn, may be said to have won the
                    game. Although at first thought so meanly of as only to be used as a teazer,
                    yet, fortunately for the Turf, he lived twenty years after his services became
                    notorious (by the accident of his being the sire of a capital racer, out of a
                    mare which the stallion to which he was teazer refused to cover), and, strange
                    to say, no very superior race-horse has appeared in England, for many years,
                    that cannot be traced to his blood. The success of this horse was much
                    facilitated by the lucky coincidence of his arrival in England at a critical
                    time, that is to say, when the stock from Darley’s horse, and the several Arabs,
                    Barbs, and Turks, together with the Royal Mares imported by Charles the Second,
                    had been “crossed,” as the term is, on each other; and had produced mares worthy
                    to be the channel of imparting his own transcendant qualities to posterity.
                    Taking it for granted, then, that the English race-horse is descended from
                    Arabian, Turkish, and African (Barb) blood; and also taking into consideration
                    the various peculiarities in the form and power of each of those kinds,
                    requiring modification of shape, qualities, and action suited to the purposes
                    for which they were intended, it cannot be denied, that a task of no ordinary
                    difficulty was imposed on the English horse-breeders, and that they have
                    executed that task with a masterly hand. If other countries furnished the blood,
                    England has made the race-horse.</p>
                <p>With the exception of one Eastern horse, called the Wellesley Arabian, the
                    grandsire of a winner of the Oaks in 1826, also of Dandizette, who ran second
                    for that stake in 1823, and one or two more good runners, the English Turf has
                    benefited nothing, during the last half century, from the importation of foreign
                    blood. The fact is, that having once gotten possession of the essential
                    constitutional parts necessary to form the race-horse, and which will be
                    described hereafter, we ourselves have, by a superior knowledge of the animal,
                    and the means of availing ourselves of his capabilities, not only by rearing and
                    training, but by riding him also, brought him to a pitch of excellence which
                    will not admit of further improvement. Superior as is the air of the desert,
                    which is said to be so free from vapours, that the brightest steel is not
                    affected with rust, if exposed to it for a night, to that of our humid and
                    ever-varying climate; and propitious as it must be to animals found, <hi
                    rend="italic">as the horse was found,</hi> in the greatest perfection when
                    reared in it; yet were the finest Eastern horse that could be procured, brought
                    to the starting-post at Newmarket, with the advantage of English training
                    to-boot, he would have no chance at any weight, or for any distance, with even a
                    second-rate English race-horse. It may not, however, be uninteresting to point
                    out what are the essential racing points originally imparted to the horse of our
                    own breed by these foreign stallions and mares, and without which they never
                    would have arrived at any thing approaching the excellence which they have, for
                    the last century, attained.</p>
                <p>A good deal of pains has been taken to define the meaning of the term “blood,” as
                    applied to the horse called thorough-bred. Osmer, an old but accredited writer
                    on the Horse, pronounced it to be a certain elegance of parts, derived from air,
                    climate, and food, which, being suitable to the true natural conformation of the
                    animal, enables him to perform extraordinary feats of activity and motion,
                    coupled with great endurance of the highest bodily exertion; and hence the
                    expression, “he shews a vast deal of blood,” means nothing more than that he is
                    a truly formed race-horse. Where, he asks, is the blood of the Ostrich, whose
                    speed is so great, that it can “laugh at the horse <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193646479" xml:id="kp-eb0711-6479-0568"/>and his rider ?” “If the good
                    qualities of the race-horse,” says he, “depend upon blood, we could not, as we
                    often do, see one horse very good, and his own brother, with equal advantages of
                    good keep and training, very bad.” it was the opinion of this writer, that it
                    has been to the lolly of expecting, that what is termed high-blood, in the
                    Eastern horses, unaccompanied with essential form, will produce a racer, so many
                    failures in the attempt to breed race-horses have occurred; that the virtue of
                    what racing men call “blood,” has been too much insisted upon, not being
                    sufficiently influenced by the fact, that it can never be considered as
                    independent of form and matter. We conceive there is a great deal of truth in
                    each of the foregoing observations. Blood cannot be considered independently of
                    form and matter, inasmuch as the excellence of all horses must depend on the
                    mechanism of their frames, which, if duly proportioned, and accompanied with
                    superior internal, as well as external organization, gives them stride, pace,
                    and endurance. The quickness of repeating this stride also, and the power of
                    continuance, will depend upon vigour of muscle, capacity of chest, and strength
                    of the constrained lungs. The result, then, of this argument is, that when we
                    speak of some of the celebrated stallions of former days having transmitted the
                    good properties of their blood, or high eastern descent, to the race-horses of
                    the present time, we can only imply, that they have imparted that true formation
                    of parts, that firmness of bone and sinew, and that general superior
                    organization, competent to give facility of action; together with great powers
                    of respiration, which will enable horses to last under the severest trials of
                    their powers. In fact, their excellence is in a great manner mechanical. Were it
                    not so indeed, did they not excel each other according to the degrees of
                    difference in their form and shape, and all the constituent parts, full brothers
                    and sisters would prove of equal goodness on the race-course, health and
                    condition being on a par. But this is very far from being the case; ’and again,
                    if it depended on blood, the same horse would run alike on every description of
                    ground, which we know rarely happens; but of this we may be assured, that it is
                    a superiority of muscular substance, united with justly proportioned shape, and
                    not innate blood, which enables a horse to bear to be pressed, on any
                    description of ground, still more so upon such as is severe, as several of our
                    racecourses are.</p>
                <p>Yet if there must be this elegance of form, these nice proportions in the limbs,
                    or moving levers of the race-horse, how is it that so many of those called
                    “cross-made,” plain, and apparently disproportioned horses, possess the power or
                    parts conducive to speed and action? If blood can be defined the peculiar
                    elegance in the texture of the external parts, how happens it that several very
                    ugly horses and mares have at all times distinguished themselves on the Turf?
                    Arc there certain occult causes, not discoverable to the eye, that produce this
                    excellence to which the rules and laws of action appear to be opposed? On these
                    points it may be observed, first, that the force and effect of muscular motion
                    is nearly beyond our ken; and, secondly, such horses are really not misshapen,
                    inasmuch as there are hidden virtues in the mechanism of their internal frames,
                    which the eye cannot detect; and where deficient in one point, they are
                    recompensed by additional powers in others. They possess the essential points,
                    although not so elegantly displayed; and this, we believe, is the case with
                    other animals than the horse; although, generally speaking, true symmetry in all
                    is attended with corresponding excellence in their useful properties, and
                    adaptation to the purposes of man.</p>
                <p>I hose persons who insist upon an innate quality in what is termed “blood,” are
                    led to believe that there' is something in the <hi rend="italic">nature</hi> of
                    a thorough-bred horse, which enables him to struggle in a race far beyond his
                    natural capabilities, and which is distinguished by the term “game.” We do not
                    think there is. We learn from experience that horses often allow themselves to
                    be <hi rend="italic">beaten</hi> by others which are inferior to them, from
                    sheer ill temper; but their efforts to <hi rend="italic">win</hi> a race, we
                    consider to be merely limited by their physical powers, the effect of a proper
                    arrangement of their parts; and that the operation of the mind, or spirit, has
                    nothing at all to do with it. The hero at the Olympic Games had, and the
                    champion of the British boxing ring may have had, feelings which, from the
                    superiority of their nature, and the fact of their character, interest, and
                    future happiness, being all involved in the event, might have induced them to
                    struggle even to the very verge of life; but the same sense of honour, and the
                    same spirit of emulation, cannot be ascribed to the race-horse. If his own
                    acting powers be unequal to those of others opposed to him in the race, he
                    yields to that superiority, although it must be admitted, that what arc called
                    sluggish horses will not try to exert themselves to the utmest, unless urged to
                    it by the spur and whip; and others, when spurred and whipped, slacken, instead
                    of increasing, their speed. The final result of this discussion then is, that
                    when, as has been previously suggested, we speak of such horses as King Herod,
                    Highflyer, or Eclipse, having transmitted their blood to the past and present
                    generations of running horses, we can only admit that they have transmitted that
                    true formation of parts necessary to enable them to run races at a prodigious
                    rate of speed, and to endure the severity of training for them.</p>
                <p>Although we have spoken in disparagement of horses of the East as racers, upon
                    the same terms with those of our own breeding, we are willing to allow them the
                    merit of being the parent stock of all our racing blood; as it is quite evident
                    the indigenae of our own country, or of those European ones which approximate to
                    it, would never have produced the sort of race-horse now seen on the British
                    Turf. The nature and character, indeed, of the horse of the Desert, are
                    peculiarly adapted to an animal who, like the race-horse, is called upon to put
                    its physical powers to the severest test to which nature, aided by art, can
                    submit. In the first place, the Arabian horse possesses a firmness of leg and
                    sinew unequalled by any other in the world. This excellence, which he owes to
                    climate, arises from his having larger muscles and <hi rend="italic">smaller
                    bone</hi> than other horses have ;—muscles and sinews being the sole powers of
                    acting, and on them depend the lasting qualities of an animal going at the top
                    of his speed. Bones being the weight to be lifted, serve only to extend the
                    parts; and it is evident, that such as are small, but highly condensed, like
                    those of the deer, and the horse of the Desert, are, by occupying less space,
                    and containing less weight, more easily acted upon by muscular force, than such
                    as arc large and porous, and for a greater duration of time, without fatiguing
                    the acting powers. But the excellence of the Arabian horse, or horse of the
                    Desert, does not end with his highly condensed bone, and flat and wiry leg, so
                    much esteemed by the sportsman. All the muscles and fibres of his frame are
                    driven into closer contact than those cf any other breed; and, by the membranes
                    and ligaments being composed of a finer and thinner substance, he possesses the
                    rare quality of union of strength with lightness, so essential to the endurance
                    of fatigue in all quick motions. He thus moves quicker and with more force, by
                    reason of the lightness and solidity of the materials of which his frame is
                    composed; and when to these qualifications, are added the peculiar and deer-like
                    elegance of his form, and extraordinary share of muscular power for his inches,
                    he appears to furnish all the requisites of the race-horse on a small scale.</p>
                <p>We have already accounted for the present breed of English race-horses being no
                    longer susceptible of improvement<pb break="no" facs="nls:193646492"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0711-6492-0569"/> from any foreign blood. But it is worth inquiring
                    into the reason of the improvement of the horse of the Desert, and indeed of all
                    the countries of the East, not advancing towards perfection, as that of our own
                    breed has done. No doubt it was intended that we should improve upon animal
                    nature, as we improve our own, and nowhere has the attempt been so successful as
                    upon our varieties of domestic cattle; but the horse of the Desert now, if he
                    have not retrograded in his good qualities, is the same animal that he was
                    nearly two centuries back. With the exception of the Wellesley Arabian, said to
                    have been bred in Persia (but the assertion is unaccompanied by proof), who
                    measured fifteen hands two inches high, all the rest that have been imported
                    have been little better than Galloways, which must be attributed to two causes;
                    first, the want of being forced, as our own horses are, in their colthood, by
                    high keep; and, secondly, by adhering too closely to the indigenous breed, or
                    that whose blood is unmixed, by which means it has dwindled. Accurate observers
                    must have noticed, that the greater part of the horses brought to this country
                    as Barbs and Arabians, have exhibited a palpable deficiency in the points
                    contributing to strength, and the want of general substance is apparent at first
                    sight. It is true that, of late years, their estimation has so diminished in
                    this country, that no great pains have been taken to procure stallions of the
                    highest caste, and scarcely any mares have been imported; and several of those
                    sent over have been accompanied by very unsatisfactory pedigrees. We are, how
                    ever, inclined to think that, as the immediate descendants of such horses are
                    found quite inefficient as race-horses, and but few of the second or third
                    generation have turned up trumps, unless as a rational experiment, the breeding
                    of <hi rend="italic">race-horses</hi> from Arabians is at an end.</p>
                <p>In corroboration, however, of the good qualities of form and texture of this
                    comparatively Lilliputian breed, we give the following extract from a letter of
                    the late Captain Gwat-kin, head of one of the Honourable India Company’s studs,
                    on the subject of crossing the English thorough-bred horse with foreign blood,
                    dated Hauper, Bengal, September 1828, to shew, by their rate of going, their
                    great endurance under the combined pressure of weight and speed; for to have run
                    these lengths in the time specified, their height only averaging fourteen hands
                    one inch, and of course unfavourable to speed, in addition to the ground being
                    sandy, and therefore void of elasticity, the pace must have been severe from end
                    to end of the course. Unfortunately the ages are not given, or a still better
                    judgment would be formed of the lasting powers of these little animals under
                    more than average weight.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                <p>We have reason to believe, that the best use to be made of Eastern horses, would
                    be for the production of the English hunter, by the best-shaped hunting mares,
                    nearly thorough-bred. By the help of the dam, and our present improved system of
                    keeping young horse-stock, there would be little fear of the produce not coming
                    to a good size, even in the first generation, as it is, for the most part, the
                    property of these horses to beget stock larger than themselves; but by crossing
                    the female produce in the second with our large thorough-bred horses, hunters
                    for heavy weights might be looked for, with every prospect of success. We know'
                    that the virtue of the blood, or constituent parts, of the horse that was no
                    racer (Marske, the sire of Eclipse, for example) has produced a racing son, by
                    acquiring proper formation of parts from the dam; and if to the fine form of the
                    English hunter, could be added the firmness of leg and sinew' for which the
                    Eastern horse is so conspicuous, but in which the English hunter is too often
                    deficient, in conjunction with the larger muscles, more highly condensed bone,
                    and well-known powers of endurance of the Eastern horse, not omitting his
                    action, which is generally first-rate, but of which a proper judgment could be
                    formed previously to the choice of the stallion, a great improvement upon our
                    present race of hunters would be effected; and all such as were known to be thus
                    bred, would meet a ready sale. It is a well knowm fact, that some of the most
                    brilliant hunters England ever produced, were got by Arabian stallions; and one,
                    by Lord Clive’s Arabian, was decidedly the best horse in Leicestershire, in Mr
                    Meynell’s day, over every description of country. He was the property of the
                    late Mr Childe, of Kinlet Hall, Shropshire, who is said to have been the first
                    to introduce the present very spirited style of riding after hounds. A powerful
                    Toorkoman stallion would not, we think, fail in getting hunters out of good
                    English mares. That breed is the largest of any of the Eastern horses, owing to
                    being reared on better land.</p>
                <p>One word more on the subject of the Eastern horse, as connected with the English
                    Turf. Owing to the doubts and uncertainties that hang over the pedigrees and
                    countries of the most celebrated stallions and mares which laid the foundation
                    of our present breed of racers, it is impossible to determine to which
                    individual breed, whether to the Turkish, the Barb, the Arabian, or the Persian,
                    are the greater advantages derived from them to be attributed. They appear to us
                    to be pretty equally divided. To the Byerly Turk we are indebted for the Herod
                    blood (sire of Highflyer); to the Godolphin Arabian, said to be a Barb, for the
                    Matchem blood, the stoutest of any; to the Darley Arabian (the sire of Flying
                    Childers), for the Eclipse blood; and to the Wellesley Arabian, believed to be a
                    Persian horse, to the only real advantage gained to English race-horses<pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193646505" xml:id="kp-eb0711-6505-0570"/>, by a foreign
                    cross, in later years. It must, however, be observed, that the most famous
                    horses of the last century, such as Childers, Old Crab, Eclipse, and King Herod,
                    did not appear on the Turf before they were five years old; which leads us to
                    suppose, that the failure of horses subsequently bred, as they themselves were
                    bred, from Oriental blood, and trained at an early age, may, in great part, be
                    attributed to the fact, of the immediate produce of such horses requiring more
                    time to come to maturity, or even to a certain degree of maturity, than those,
                    like our present breed of race-horses, further removed from such blood; and the
                    cause may be attributed to climate. It is reasonable to suppose, that the
                    produce of stallions and mares bred in the Torrid Zone, would come slower to
                    perfection in a damper and colder country than it would have done in its own;
                    and we may infer from this, that, in proportion as horses were brought earlier
                    to the post, and races shortened in distance, Eastern blood got into
                    disrepute.</p>

                <p>Amongst the many things in the history of Ancient Greece that have called forth
                    the admiration of mankind, the celebrated games of Olympia claim the foremost
                    place. Independently of their religious association, and advancement of literary
                    spirit, they were highly serviceable to the country; and none proved more so
                    than those at which horse-racing was introduced, which appear to have been
                    completely established in the twenty-fifth Olympiad. That the improvement of the
                    native breed of horses was the chief object of the government, is beyond all
                    doubt, as it has been that of all others who have given encouragement to racing;
                    and it is equally apparent, that the Thessalian courser, so highly extolled by
                    Pindar, and likewise so terrible in war, was the result of a foreign cross. So
                    essential, indeed, was this object considered in Greece, where horses were very
                    scarce even after the time of Pindar, that it is stated, on the authority of
                    Aretius, in a note on Pindar’s second Isthmian Ode, that there was a general law
                    in Greece, requiring all, who were able, to breed horses. As to what state of
                    perfection their horses were bred in at this early period, is beyond the power
                    of conjecture; but in Great Britain, from the highly cultivated knowledge of the
                    mechanical structure of living bodies, with the junction of best shapes,
                    although but for the stimulus given by racing, this knowledge would have been
                    comparatively in its infancy, the horse has arrived at the highest state of
                    perfection of which his nature is capable; and in whatever country, and in
                    whatever climate, his racing powers are put to the test, he has scarcely found a
                    rival, excepting under very disadvantageous circumstances. It is true his <hi
                    rend="italic">lasting</hi> qualities were doubted, and he was challenged to
                    rebut the charge; and the following was the result. On the 4th of August 1825,
                    two second-rate English racers, Sharper and Mina, contended against the most
                    celebrated Cossack horses from the Don, the Black Sea, and the Ural, in a race
                    of the cruel length of forty-seven miles. At starting, Sharper and Mina ran away
                    with their riders more than a mile, and up a steep hill, when the latter horse
                    broke down, and pulled up. Half the distance was run in an hour and forty
                    minutes. In the last half, only one of the Cossack horses was able to contend
                    with Sharper, who, notwithstanding every foul advantage was taken by changing
                    the weight, and dragging along his opponent by a rope, won his race in gallant
                    style, performing the distance in two hours and forty-eight minutes. At
                    starting, the English horses carried three stone more weight than the Cossacks;
                    and, during the latter half of the race, the one Cossack who remained in it was
                    ridden by a mere child.</p>
                <p>From the great export trade to the Continent of English horses, and particularly
                    those of full blood, joined to the low price of horse-food during the last
                    twenty years, and on which there is not much prospect of an advance, occupiers
                    of land cannot turn their attention to a much surer source of profit than that
                    of breeding horses, provided they go judiciously to work. But, unfortunately for
                    the speculators in this branch of rural economics, too much is left to chance
                    and experiment, and thus horse-breeding becomes absolutely a matter of
                    speculation, instead of a matter of judgment. It is true, those noblemen and
                    gentlemen whose studs have become eminent on the Turf cannot be included in this
                    charge; but even with the benefit of great experience, and various other
                    advantages, the utmost exercise of their judgment is required, to insure even a
                    prospect of success against such a field as they have to contend with. Having
                    said this, we will lay down a few practical rules for breeding and rearing the
                    various kinds of horses now used in Great Britain, commencing, as before stated,
                    with that of the Race-Horse.</p>
                <p>In the first place, it may be observed, there has been a great deal of discussion
                    in various publications on Sporting, but to very little purpose, on the much
                    agitated question, “What constitutes full blood, or, what is termed, a
                    thorough-bred horse ?” We consider this question as very easily decided; the
                    term “thorough-bred horse” merely implying one that can be traced through the
                    Stud-Book, by sire and dam, to any Eastern stallion, or to what were called the
                    Royal Marcs, imported by Charles the Second, as they, together with two or three
                    of the first imported stallions, form the <hi rend="italic">ne</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">plus ιdtra</hi> of all racing pedigrees. As to the assertion,
                    that, for a horse' to claim the title of thoroughbred, it is necessary he should
                    be of pure Oriental descent, it cannot for a moment be supported; as,
                    independently of the fact, that only two mares are stated in the Stud-Book, or
                    elsewhere, on authority, to have been imported into England, in the early days
                    of racing, it is well known that the first British race-horses were those of
                    British breed, changed, ameliorated, and, at last, perfected by the admixture of
                    Eastern blood, and judicious crossing afterwards.</p>
                <p>The effect of what is called crossing blood is as follows: The first cross gives
                    one-half, or 50 per cent.; the second 75 per cent.; the third 87⅜ per cent.; and
                    the fourth 93∣ per cent. In sheep, after this, if the ewes have been properly
                    selected, the difference in the wool between the original stock and the mixed
                    breed is scarcely perceptible; but with the horse, the breeder must not stop
                    here, if he means to produce a race-horse; and a curious fact is stated
                    respecting sheep, on the authority of the Count Veltheim, of Brunswick, an
                    extensive breeder of that species of stock. “It has frequently occurred to me,”
                    says he, “that rams,* which, after an improvement of four or five descents, have
                    rivalled all the <hi rend="italic">visible</hi> qualities of the purest Merinos,
                    when employed in propagation, have got very ordinary lambs, and consequently
                    they are not fit to be used for breeding. On the other hand, a fact may be
                    stated, wherein, after a very opposite cross, pure blood, with evident
                    improvement upon the original stock, was procured on the eighth descent. The
                    late Lord Oxford, very celebrated for his greyhounds, finding them degenerating
                    in courage, crossed his best bitches with a bull-dog. The result was, after
                    several recrossings with pure blood, that breed of greyhounds for which he was
                    so eminently distinguished. The immediate descendants, however, of the Eastern
                    horses, have almost, without an exception, proved so deficient of late years,
                    that our breeders will no more have recourse to them, than the farmer would to
                    the natural oat, which is little better than a weed, to produce a sample that
                    should rival that of his neighbours, in the market.”</p>
                <p>Much speculâtion haS also been indulged in, as to the effect of close affinity,
                    in breeding the race-horse, or what is called breeding in-and-in; a system which
                    has eminently succeeded in breeding cattle, and also with Lord Egremonts <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193646518" xml:id="kp-eb0711-6518-0571"/> racing stud.
                    Beginning with Flying Childers, several of our very best racers have been very
                    closely bred; and it certainly appears reasonable that, as like is said to
                    produce like, if we have high form and superior organization in an own brother
                    and sister, that high form and superior organization would be very likely to be
                    continued to their incestuous produce. In a work called “Observations on
                    Breeding for the Turf,” published a few years back, by Nicholas Hankey Smith,
                    who resided a long time among the Arabs, the author gives his opinion, that
                    colts bred in-and-in show more .blood in their heads, are of better form, and
                    fit to start with fewer sweats, than others; but when the breed is continued
                    incestuous for three or four crosses, the animal, he thinks, degenerates. By
                    breeding in-and in, however, he does not insist upon the necessity of breeding
                    from brother and sister, or putting a mare to her own sire, or the sire to her
                    own dam; but after the first cross, to return to original blood. A recent proof
                    of the good effect of a close affinity in race-horses may be found in the
                    produce of the dam of his late Majesty’s favourite mare Maria. By those
                    celebrated stallions, Rubens and Soothsayer, they were worthless; but by
                    Waterloo and Rainbow, grandsons of Sir Peter, and thus combining much of her own
                    blood, they could run to win.</p>
                <p>We now come to the most certain source of producing, good racers, namely, the
                    choice of stallions and mares, and the treatment of the produce in their
                    colthood. But as regards the two first-named requisites, reference must be had
                    to the parts of the country in which horses are intended to run. If, for the
                    short races of Newmarket, so much the fashion of the present day, a differently
                    formed animal would be required to one intended to clear his way on the
                    provincial courses. But whether it be one description of a race-hosre or
                    another, although the laws of nature are not always certain, a proper junction
                    of shape, or similarity in formation of horse and mare, together with a due
                    regard to blood, gives the fairest prospect of success. We admit it is difficult
                    to account for the degrees of excellence between the running of two full
                    brothers or sisters, where it does not arise (a common case we conceive) from
                    some violence or impression on the womb, when the foetus is in a soft state, or
                    from a decline in the constitution of the mare, subsequent to her last produce;
                    but when we find the produce of two highly-bred animals, both proved to be good,
                    and with a proper admixture of blood, unable to race, we can attribute it to no
                    other cause than a dissimilitude of parts in the horse and the mare, or a
                    similitude of some parts tending to an extreme in both. Without going so far as
                    to assert that there is no innate quality in blood, we may safely pronounce it
                    so far from being, as some have supposed it to be, independent of form and
                    matter, that, unless accompanied with suitable form and action, it is of very
                    little value in a race-horse. “Sometimes,” as Sancho says, “we look for one
                    thing and find another but we know of no instance of a bad misshapen horse and a
                    bad misshapen mare, however highly bred, producing good runners.</p>
                <p>The first and most important point in the choice of a blood-mare for a racing
                    stud, is the soundness of her constitution and limbs; although, of course, it is
                    desirable she should be of good size and shape, with substance. How highly so
                    ever she may be bred, and however well she may have run, if she have not a sound
                    frame, she cannot be depended upon to breed racers. If she have never been
                    trained, of course the risk is increased; but, in either case, her form and
                    action must not be overlooked, as it too often is, ' rendering the breeding of
                    thorough-bred stock a mere matter of chance. Should she have appeared in public,
                    her racing capabilities are to be consulted. For example, if pace (speed)' was
                    her best, as the jockies say, a stallion should be selected, who, by the known
                    stoutness of his running, is likely to tie her produce to pace, or, in other
                    words, to give them both speed and endurance in a race. Her frame should be
                    roomy, or her produce will be apt to be small, although, it must be admitted,
                    there are exceptions to this rule. She should be of, what is termed, fashionable
                    blood, for, if she be not, and her produce should come to the hammer, <hi
                    rend="italic">previous to trial,</hi> they would prove utterly worthless in the
                    market.</p>
                <p>It cannot admit of a doubt, that it is trespassing on the powers of nature to
                    expect a mare, or any other female animal, to nourish her foetus, in embryo, so
                    perfectly during the time she is giving suck, as if she were dry or without
                    milk. Nevertheless, it is customary to put all blood mares to the horse the
                    ninth day after foaling, and it is almost too much to expect that the owners
                    will let them lie fallow, although they may in some measure resemble the man who
                    cut up his goose to get at the golden egg. During the period of gestation,
                    however, the thorough-bred mare should be highly kept. All animals well fed,
                    produce their species of a superior description to those which are not well fed;
                    and nothing more forcibly shows the beneficial effect of warmth in rearing
                    superior varieties of the horse, than that the half-starved horse of the desert
                    should be as good as he is even now found to be.</p>
                <p>In a racing-stud, the period of putting mares to the horse is much earlier in the
                    year than that of any other sort, by reason of their produce being almost always
                    called upon to go into work before they are two years old. In fact, they can
                    scarcely be dropped too soon in the commencement of a new year, where proper
                    accommodations are provided for them. A peep into the three volumes of the
                    Stud-Book will satisfy inquirers into these matters, that some mares have
                    produced more than twenty colts and fillies, and, in a few instances, the
                    greater part of them proved good runners; but, we should be inclined to think
                    that the average would not exceed six, as the produce of each mare. It sometimes
                    occurs that mares are put into a breeding-stud, when affected by severe lameness
                    in the feet. When this is the case, the operations of neurotomy or unnerving is
                    recommended; as pain, by producing fevers, not only is injurious to the
                    formation of the foetus, but often causes abortion. Bad, putrid, smells, or
                    being struck on the nose, also produce abortion in brood mares.</p>
                <p>Virgil, in his excellent remarks on breeding horses, tells those of his readers
                    who wished to gain a prize, to look to the dam; and, until of very late years,
                    it was the prevailing opinion of Englishmen, that, in breeding a racer, the mare
                    is more essential than the horse to the production of him, in his highest form,
                    and we know it to have been the notion entertained by the late Earl of
                    Grosvenor, the most extprisjve, though not perhaps the most successful, breeder
                    of thorough-bred stock England ever saw. The truth of this supposition, however,
                    has not been confirmed by the experience of the last half century, and much more
                    dependence is now placed on the stallion than on the mare. The racing calendar,
                    indeed, clearly proves the fact. Notwithstanding the' prodigious number of very
                    highly bred and equally good mares that are every year put to the horse, it is
                    from such as are put to our very best stallions that the great winners are
                    produced. This can in no other way be accounted for, than by such horses having
                    the faculty of imparting to their progeny the peculiar external and internal
                    formation absolutely essential to the first-rate racq-horse; or, if the term
                    “blood” be insisted upon, that certain innate but not preternatural virtue,
                    peculiarly belonging to some horses but not to others, which, when it meets with
                    no opposition from the ' mare, or, in the language of the stable, when “the
                    cross nicks” by the mare admitting of a junction of good shapes, seldom fails in
                    producing a race-horse, in his very best form. It is obvious, then, that owners
                    of racing-studs should not hesitate <pb break="no" facs="nls:193646531"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0711-6531-0572"/>at paying the difference between the price of a
                    first-rate stallion and an inferior one; and there is always one of the former
                    to be found, to suit every description of mare. Breeders of all kinds of horses,
                    but of the race-horse above all others, scarcely require to be cautioned against
                    purchasing, or breeding from, mares, or putting them to stallions,
                    constitutionally infirm. By “constitutionally infirm,” is chiefly implied having
                    a tendency to fail in their legs and feet, during their training, which too many
                    of our present racingbreed are given to; although the severity of training is
                    not equal to what it was some years back. It would be invidious to particularize
                    individual sorts; but we could name stallions and mares, from which the greatest
                    expectations were raised, whose progeny have sacrificed thousands of their
                    owners’ money, entirely from this cause. It having been clearly shewn, not only
                    in theory but in practice, that the diseases and defects of horses are for the
                    most part hereditary, we may be induced to give credit to the assertion, that
                    the Arabians, after having brought their breed of horses to the highest pitch of
                    improvement of which they themselves considered them capable, have preserved
                    their chief perfections, namely, great endurance of fatigue, with highly
                    organized matter, and natural soundness of limb,—∙ by restricting the use of
                    stallions until approved of by a public inspector of them. Indeed, in several
                    European states, similar precautions are taken, and stallions are provided by
                    their governments, for the use of farmers and others who breed horses, and care
                    is taken in the selection of them to avoid all such as have proved naturally
                    unsound, or been affected by any disease, the influence of which may be
                    hereditary. No part of veterinary pathology is more interesting than that which
                    relates to the hereditableness of disease; and, as an eminent French writer
                    (Professor Dupuy), on the veterinary art, observes, “That person will render an
                    important service to his country, and to rural economy in general, who may show,
                    by incontestible evidence, that those organic diseases (farcy and glanders) are
                    very often hereditary. I knew a mare whose body on dissection presented every
                    appearance of glanders; her filly died at the age of years of the same
                    tuberculous affection. The other offspring of this mare inherited her particular
                    conformation, and her propensities to bite and kick.” The Professor produces
                    three similar instances of inherited disease, all of which, he says, were too
                    evident and well-marked to admit the possibility of any serious mistake, and
                    were attested by the professors of the Veterinary School at Alford. Similar
                    observations follow in relation to the diseases of oxen, cows, sheep, and swine,
                    as also of ophthalmia in horses, all of which are transmitted from one
                    generation to another, the effect of hereditary influence. “These
                    considerations,” continues the Professor, “to us are of the greatest moment,
                    since we have it in our power, by coupling and crossing well-known breeds, to
                    lessen the number of animals predisposed to these diseases. Acting up to such
                    ideas, our line of coħduct is marked out. We must banish from our
                    establishments, designed to improve the breed, such animals as show any signs of
                    tuberculous disease, or any analogous affection. Above all, no stallion should
                    be allowed to remain in a Wet or cold situation, in consequence of the evils
                    likely to result therefrom.”</p>
                <p>In consideration of the preference given to the stallion over the mare, in the
                    propagation of racing-stock, may be quoted the following passage, from Part 3d
                    of Percival’s Lectures on the Veterinary Art (London 1826). <hi rend="italic"
                    >“</hi><hi rend="italic">It</hi> might be supposed that the part the male takes
                    in fecundation is comparatively a very unimportant one; it must be remembered,
                    however, that the copulative act is the essential first cause, that therein the
                    action of the organs is natural and sympathetic, and that the result is the
                    generation of a new animal, bearing a likeness to one or both of the parents;
                    from which it would appear, although the physical part of the male is simply to
                    project the sperm into the female, who alone has the power of rendering it
                    efficacious, that the influence of the sperm is much greater in the generative
                    process than we seem to have any notion of, or aţ least than we have been able
                    to reveal the nature of in physiology.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>See Lecture 59, On the Physiology of the organs of

                    Young Racing Stock.</hi></p>
                <p>Under all circumstances, there is too much resemblance between the speculations
                    of the Turf and a lottery; but, as the prizes it exhibits are valuable, the most
                    effectual means of obtaining them should be adopted. It signifies little what
                    care and circumspection have been exercised in the selection of stallions and
                    mares, with a view of breeding racers; the prospect of success is very limited
                    indeed at the present day, unless the produce be reared according to the
                    improved system acted upon in our first-rate racing establishments. Such was the
                    pertinacity of opinion, combined with long-established prejudices, and in direct
                    opposition to the daily acknowledged fact, of dry and warm countries having been
                    the first to produce the ĥorse in perfection, that it is only within a very few
                    years that young thorough-bred stock has been reared in the manner in which it
                    should be reared. A thorough-bred colt may now be said to be in training from
                    the day on which he is dropped, so great is the care taken to force him into
                    shape and substance. Not only is he drawing from the teats of his dam the milk
                    of a highly fed animal, and consequently, in itself highly nutritious, but,
                    before he is twelve months old, he eats nearly two bushels of oats per week. The
                    time for expansion of frame is youth, and, when we see a two year old at the
                    post, with eight stone four pounds on his back, which is to be seen in every
                    meeting at Newmarket, and looking like a horse able to carry a light man after
                    hounds, we most cordially assent to the answer given by the most experienced
                    Newmarket trainer of the present age to the question, What is the best method of
                    rearing a racing colt? “First observe,” said he, “that the blood, or cross, is
                    good; secondly, breed him as you would a sheep, from a roomy dam; and thirdly,
                    give him as little green meat as possible, and as much corn as he will eat.” The
                    trainer we allude to has now retired, but he had all the young stock of the Duke
                    of Grafton, and many of the first and most successful sportsmen in England,
                    through his hands, and the annual disbursements of his establishment exceeded
                    ten thousand pounds. That dry and hard food, as it is called, is the natural
                    food of the parent stock from which our race-horses are descended, is beyond all
                    doubt; and that the firmness of their acting parts is attributable to that, and
                    to the warmth and dryness of the climate, is also admitted. Is it, then, to be
                    wondered at, that breeders of horses, and not only of race-horses, have at
                    length found out that dry food and warmth have the same effect in the Temperate
                    as they have had, and now have, in the Torrid Zone? that they have discovered
                    that, when colts are bred on rich succulent food, and subject to a humid
                    atmosphere, the bulk of the body increases out of proportion to the strength of
                    the bones; and to these predisposing causes are to be attributed most of the
                    false points which we find in horses, such as fleshy shoulders, deficiency of
                    muscle, weak pasterns, and flat feet? Virgil discovered this nearly two thousand
                    years ago, and, when speaking in praise of Epirus, as suitable to the breeding
                    of horses, emphatically observes <pb break="no" facs="nls:193646544"

                <p>So careful, however, now are some of our principal and most successful breeders
                    of race-horses to avoid these evils, that not only is a thorough-bred colt
                    eating grass <hi rend="italic">ad libitum</hi> become a rare sight, but he is
                    not suffered to be exposed to rain, even in the midst of summer, no, not even to
                    a temporary shower. The effect of rain upon horses’ backs, is found to produce
                    the worst of diseases—glanders, for instance, as is well known to all cavalry
                    officers who have been on service with their regiments; and it cannot be
                    innocuous to the highly-bred foal, or colt. That he should be sheltered from the
                    cold of winter, need scarcely be insisted upon here, although we are rather
                    inclined to think, that, in the generality of breeding establishments, he is
                    more exposed to weather in the winter than he ought to be. There is no objection
                    to a <hi rend="italic">moderate</hi> allowance of carrots, and a little green
                    food; but according to the old Greek proverb, Aλλβς ∕3&lt;oς αλλ&lt;z <hi
                    rend="italic">^iΛira, another life, another diet,</hi> we must hear no more of
                    the “natural food” of an animal insisted upon by many, who is so far called upon
                    to outstrip the laws of nature as to begin to work at fourteen months old, and
                    to appear at the starting-post at two years old, displaying the form, character,
                    and strength of one nearly arrived at maturity. Neither is the land on which a
                    racing-stud is situated oftentimes sufficiently considered; but a want of such
                    consideration has been the source of great loss. It is in vain to expect success
                    unless upon that which is dry, and consequently of sound subsoil; and what is
                    termed “upland ground” is most favourable; Walls, independently of security, are
                    preferable to hedges, for inclosures to breeding paddocks, as the latter harbour
                    flies, which are very injurious to young stock, and also to their dams, in hot
                    weather; but the present small dimensions of breeding paddocks, not exceeding a
                    quarter of an acre, and many still less, preclude the use of hedges.</p>
                <p>Racing colts are physicked when foals, and periodically afterwards; their hoofs,
                    also, are pared with a drawing-knife, that, by shortening the toe, the heel may
                    have liberty to expand. Physic, in this case, may be termed the safety valve,
                    and such it is in reality, for this System of forcing nature cannot be free from
                    danger. It is found, however, materially to promote growth, as indeed does the
                    work that our racing-colts perform at such a very early age. Muscular action
                    produces muscular strength, and growth will be the result. We have seen a colt
                    that measured upwards of fifteen hands in height on the day twelvemonth which he
                    had been weaned from his dam.</p>
                <p>Racing colts can scarcely be handled too soon .∙—∙</p>
                <p>“Dum faciles animi juvenum, dum mobilis actas,”</p>
                <p>as Virgil says of the bulls; and Horace illustrates the necessity of early
                    erudition of the human species by the excellence of horses which have been well
                    broken in when young. The first breaking in of colts is also alluded to by Ovid,
                    who, like Horace, is in favöür of very <hi rend="italic">careful</hi> treatment
                    of them, and reminds us of the necessity of it in the following beautiful line
                    :—-</p>
                <p>“FraenaqUe vix patitur de grege captus equus.”</p>
                <p>The system of breaking colts, however, is not only thoroughly well understood in
                    our racing establishments, but is accomplished with much less severity than it
                    formerly was, and consequently wdth less danger to the animal.</p>
                <p>The time of foaling is one of great interest to owners of valuable brood mares,
                    and particularly so when the produce is engaged, perhaps heavily, or when they
                    are of what is termed a running family. The attention of the studgroom is
                    directed by sundry forewarnings, the most palpable of which is what is called
                    “waxing of the udder,” and appearance of milk, which generally precede
                    parturition two or three days, but in some instances more. As the mare brings
                    forth on her legs, there is little fear of the foal being overlaid by the
                    mother; but the less she is disturbed the better, lest she should trample on its
                    legs. Her treatment afterwards is now so well understood, that nothing requires
                    to be said about it; but a bran mash, with from four to six ounces of nitre
                    dissolved in it, given as soon as she has brought forth, keeps off fever. The
                    great preventive of accidents to foals, is the simple contrivance of rollers on
                    the sides of the door-frames, which' secure them from being injured as they rush
                    out of the hovel or shed by the side of their dams, especially in cases of
                    alarm.</p>
                <p>Some persons prefer purchasing to breeding young racing stock, and it is
                    difficult to determine between the advantages and disadvantages of the systems.
                    It is true that, in the first case, the purchaser has a certainty of some return
                    for his money, inasmuch as he gets his colt or filly, which the breeder may
                    never get, after incurring a great expense on the mare. The price of a promising
                    yearling,- from three to five hundred guineas, is a large sum to begin with; and
                    we cannot, in this instance, say with Varro, that “a good horse is known from
                    the first.” If purchased after he has appeared in public, at two years old, of
                    fashionable blood, and having run in front, he is not to be purchased mμch under
                    a thousand guineas, which is a large sum to realize, when added to concomitant
                    expenses. Nothing but the immense amount of stakes for young racing-stock can
                    justify such a speculation. For example, in 1824, a filly of the Duke of
                    Grafton’s won four thousand four hundred and fifty guineas, public money, by
                    only Starting twice.</p>
                <p>One of the principal drawbacks from the’ prospects of success in a racing
                    establishment, is a complaint called the Distemper, a sort of catarrhal fever,
                    the cause of which is generally attributed to atmospheric influence, and also to
                    any other which may produce what is termed a cold. Unlike common catarrhs,
                    however, the distemper will run through a whole stud of horses; and if it do
                    not, as it frequently does, end in an affection of the lungs, it leaves a
                    lassitude behind it, which requires some time to remove. As a hot sun, with cold
                    winds in spring, and the humid air of the autumn, are the chief predisposing
                    causes of this complaint, an even temperature in the stable, and warm clothing
                    when out of it, together with avoiding exposure to extremes of heat and cold,
                    are the best safeguards against its attacks. It may be compared to a frost over
                    the blossoms, which in one night blasts all former hopes of a crop. A most
                    interesting event to a breeder of thorough-bred stock is the trial of their
                    racing powers, which at once decides the question of their being worth the
                    expense of training to run, or not. There is a great deal of judgment necessary
                    in the act of trying even bld horses, but still more is required to form a just
                    estimate of a young one, from the difficulty of knowing when he is quite up to
                    the mark, as well as of keeping him there till it may be convenient to try him
                    ;—and it is not always so, owing to bad weather, the trial of young things being
                    generally very early in the year. This subject, however, coming more properly
                    under the head of Training the Race-horse, will be treated of at a future
                    time.</p>
                <p>But we have not yet spoken of the form of the racehorse, which we will now
                    describe; and as nothing can be considered characteristic of a species, but what
                    is perfect of its sort, we will so far endeavour to make the pen perform the
                    task of the pencil, as to portray his cardinal points, as nearly perfect as such
                    means will admit of. Nature herself, perhaps, rarely exhibits perfect models in
                    the animal world, leaving the completion of her skill to human sagacity; neither
                    is undeviating symmetry absolutely necessary in a race-horse. In every
                    composite, however, beauty consists in the apt connexion of its parts with eaćh
                    other; and just proportions in the limbs and moving levers, coupled <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193646557" xml:id="kp-eb0711-6557-0574"/> with that
                    elegance of form <hi rend="italic">in which there is no unnecessary weight to
                    oppress the muscles,</hi> so peculiar to the highly bred race-horse, is all that
                    need be insisted upon in a racer. It is nevertheless hard to say what horse will
                    make a racer; and also what will not, until put to the test; for, how many
                    horses have appeared, which the eye of the sportsman would not wish to study,
                    and yet have proved themselves very capital runners? This excellence, however,
                    in those “cross-made horses,” as they are termed, not misshapen ones, arises, as
                    has been before observed, from their possessing parts conducive to speed and
                    action, not, perhaps, very strikingly displayed, but, by means of greater length
                    and depth, and a peculiar manner of setting on of the acting parts, enabling
                    them to excel others, much handsomer to the eye, but wanting in either proper
                    declivity, length, or, what is still more probable, in circular extent of those
                    parts. Thus, as the wise man, according to the Stoics, alone is beautiful, so is
                    a race-horse to be admired solely for those points which make him a good
                    race-horse.</p>
                <p>Although symmetry and proportion form a perfect figure, and they become
                    deformities when any of the component parts exceed or fall short of their due
                    proportions, yet it is not always necessary to measure by the standard of
                    perfec-&gt; tion. Suffice it, then, to state the generally approved points of
                    the English race-horse.</p>
                <p>We commence with the head, not merely because it has always been considered as
                    the most honourable member in the human frame, but as it is one of the leading
                    characteristics of the thorough-bred horse. His broad, angular forehead, gives
                    him that beautiful expression of countenance which no other breed possesses; and
                    the tapering of the face from the forehead to the muzzle, forms a striking
                    contrast with the large face of the cart-horse, and the forehead scarcely wider
                    than the face. The race-horse should have a black, lively, and rather prominent
                    eye, which denotes a sound constitution; and as horses do not breathe through
                    the mouth, but only through the nose, the nostrils should be rather expanded and
                    flexible, that they may accommodate themselves to quickened respiration, as the
                    speed of the animal increases. Bπt they should not be over large. “Naribus <hi
                    rend="italic">non</hi><hi rend="italic">angustis,</hi><hi rend="italic">”</hi>
                    says Varro, and he is right. Beauty in the head of the race-horse, however, is
                    only a secondary consideration to the manner in which it should form a junction
                    with the neck, as on that, in a great mea-. sure, depends the goodness of his
                    wind in a race. His jaws should not only be thin, and not approach too near
                    together at the throat, but they should not extend too high towards the onset,
                    or they will impede his freedom of breathing. The neck of all horses should be
                    muscular; but what is called a loose neck in a race-horse, is not so
                    objectionable as in a hunter, and is considered as indicative of speed. But as
                    the bead .of a horse may be called the helm which guides his course, changes,
                    and directs his motions, it is not only desirable that, as he cannot move his
                    head, but with the muscles of his neck, those muscles should be pliant, but that
                    he should also have what is termed a good mouth. It is asserted that the weight
                    of the head and neck, the effect increasing with their distance from the trunk,
                    adds to the speed of the horse, by throwing his weight forward; but this is no
                    argument for <hi rend="italic">additional</hi> weight or length in those parts,
                    which ought to be duly proportioned to the trunk. The neck of the race-horse
                    should be in no extreme, but rather long than otherwise, and not too much
                    arched.</p>
                <p>As horses are said to go with their shoulders, these may be considered as highly
                    important points. They vary in form more than any other part of the horse’s
                    frame. Those of Flying Childers rose very high and fine towards the withers;
                    whereas, a firkin of butter is said to have rested, unsupported, on the withers
                    of Eclipse, when in covering condition. I prjght shoulders, however, being an
                    impediment to speed, obliquity of the scapula is absolutely necessary, but we do
                    not insist upon their running fine at the withers. We consider the shoulders of
                    Eclipse to have resembled those of the greyhound, wide at the upper part, and
                    nearly on a line with the back. Large, or even what are called coarse shoulders,
                    contribute greatly to strength, and are no impediment to speed, if there is
                    proper declivity of the scapula, or shoulder-bone. The withers, when high, or
                    thin, should enlarge gradually downwards, and. there should be four or five
                    inches between the fore-thighs, but less between the feet.</p>
                <p>. The true position of the limbs is a most material point in the race-ĥorse, as
                    it causes him to stand over more ground than one which is otherwise formed,
                    although possessing a more extended frame. One of these essential points is, the
                    setting on of, and length in, the fore-arm, or part from shoulder to knee in the
                    fore-leg; and, another, is the declension of the haunch to the hock in the hind
                    leg, which is termed “well let down in the thigh.” It is from having those
                    points in excess, that enables <hi rend="italic">the hare</hi> to describe a far
                    greater circle, and cover more ground at one stroke, than any other animal
                    nearly double her size. In fact, the arm should be set on at the extreme point
                    of the shoulder, which insures this act of extension, and also adds to the
                    declivity of the shoulder. The knee should be broad and flat, and if appearing
                    somewhat prominent, the better. All the Herod legs had prominent knees (and no
                    legs stood work better than they did), concussion in galloping being diminished
                    in legs so formed. The cannon, or shank, from knee to fetlock, should be of
                    moderate length in the racehorse (longer than in the hunter), and, above all,
                    the leg should appear flat, not round, with sinews and bones distinct; and the
                    former appearing to be very firmly braced. The pastern of the race-horse should
                    be long, lax, and rather small than otherwise; length and laxness serving as
                    springs, and smallness contributing to agility, and consequently to perseverance
                    or bottom. Some comparison will hold good between this point in a horse, and the
                    “small of the leg,” as it is called, of a man, in contradistinction to the calf.
                    Under the pressure of fatigue, no man complains of the “<hi rend="italic"
                    >small</hi> of his leg” giving him uneasiness, but his calves often give him
                    notice that he has done too much. The hoof of the race-horse should be of
                    moderate size in proportion with the leg above.</p>
                <p>. We have already alluded to the bone of the thoroughbred horse, which much
                    exceeds that of any other variety of this animal, in its compactness and
                    solidity; which qualities, as the span in the gallop must give a shock in
                    proportion to its length, are admirably adapted to the racehorse. We cannot say
                    of him, what Job said of the behemoth, that “his bones are like bars of iron ;”
                    yet, as in proportion to the muscular power of the animal, is the dense quality
                    of the bone, that of the race-horse need not, nor should not, be large.
                    Experience teaches us, that bones very rarely break; fractures, when they do
                    occur in racing, being almost invariably in the joints; and rather small bone in
                    the leg of a race-horse, supported by broad and well-braced sinews and tendons,
                    placed distinct from the bone, and forming what is called a flat and wiry leg,
                    is most desirable, and found to be indicative not only of speed and endurance,
                    but likewise of soundness in severe work. It is only those who are ignorant of
                    the anatomical structure of animals, that fix the basis of strength in the bony
                    substances alone, not considering the muscular appendages, which constitute the
                    main-spring of strength and action.</p>
                <p>As the strongest bodies owe their vigour to the milk they receive in their
                    infancy, our recommendation to keep brood mares well will not be -considered as
                    unsuitable; but the connexion between milk and bone is also deserving of a
                    remark. When animal bones are divested of their oil and jelly, the earth which
                    remains is chiefly lime, united with phosphoric acid. It is worthy of notice,
                    that phosphate of <pb break="no" facs="nls:193646570"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0711-6570-0575"/>lime is found in abundance in milk. ∙ This seems
                    to indicate, that Nature thought fit to place, in the first nourishment of
                    animals, a quantity of osseous matter, with a view to the necessary celerity of
                    the formation and growth of the bones in the earliest stage of their lives. This
                    is one of die numerous instances of the beneficence of the Creator, exemplified
                    by the science of chemistry, and shews the advantages to be expected from a good
                    flow of milk in a mare that is well fed; and it is a remarkable fact, that the
                    nearer the female approaches to the period of parturition, the more is the milk
                    charged with this calcareous phosphate. Nor is it until the digestive organs of
                    the foot are sufficiently strengthened, to answer the purposes and work of
                    animalization, that this earthy salt disappears. .</p>
                <p>But to proceed with the form of a race-horse. The race-horse should have length,
                    but the length should be in his shoulders and in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >quarters</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> that is, the part posterior to the hips,
                    and not in his back. To give him that elegance of form for which he is so
                    conspicuous, there should be no acute angle or any straight line. His shoulders
                    should go into his neck at the points, <hi rend="italic">unperceived,</hi> and
                    his back should sink <hi rend="italic">a little</hi> behind the withers, which
                    gives his rider a good seat, and does not in the least diminish his strength.
                    Ç)n the contrary, horses with very straight backs are generally deficient in
                    their fore-quarters, as well as in their action; and we have known some very
                    good racers even what is termed hollow-backed. There should be a little rise in
                    the loins, just behind the saddle; but the race-horse should not be too closely
                    ribbed up. The ribs should stand out from the spine, producing what is called a
                    round barrel, together with depth of carcass, a formation which not only gives
                    strength of body and constitution, but, by admitting the intestines to be
                    comfortably lodged within the ribs, imparts freedom of breathing, activity and
                    beauty to the whole frame of the horse, other parts being proportional. These
                    useful points, however, must not be carried to an extreme, or the horse may be
                    what is termed “too heavy for his legs and we know that lightbodied horses save
                    their legs much in their gallops, which accounts for marcs and geldings standing
                    the severity of training to a later period of life than stallions, by reason of
                    the former requiring less work, from not generally carrying so much flesh as the
                    latter.</p>
                <p>There is no part, excepting the head, so truly characteristic of high breeding in
                    the horse, as his haunch. If a little of the elegance of the parts, however, is
                    diminished by the width of the hips, it will be recompensed by increased
                    strength in the animal, as is the case with broad-shouldered men; and when
                    accompanied with good loins, these protuberances of the ilium can scarcely be
                    too great for the purposes of power and action. We next come to the thigh, the
                    form and substance of which is most material to the racc-horsc; for although
                    horses are said to go with their shoulders, the power to give the impetus in
                    progressive motion comes from behind. With all animals endowed with, and
                    requiring extreme rapidity of, motion, the thigh is furnished with extraordinary
                    powers and length: the hare, for example, whose thighs are let down to a great
                    extent for their size, and the lower part of the hinder leg placed under them,
                    as that of the racer should be, from a proper curve of the hock. The speed of
                    the ostrich arises from the power of the muscles from the pelvis to the foot;
                    and the thigh of the fighting cock is a point much considered by breeders. It is
                    not necessary that a race-horsc’s thigh should be very large, but it should
                    exhibit well developed muscle. Descending lower in the limb, we arrive at the
                    hock, a very complicated joint, but the form of which is most important in the
                    race-horse. It should be large and lean, and the point of it projecting behind
                    the body, which greatly increases the power of the lever in action, as will
                    presently be most satisfactorily shewn.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Sire.</hi></p>
                <p>The point of perfection in most things lies at a middle distance between two
                    extremes, and such is the case here. The medium height, about fifteen hands two
                    inches, four inches to a hand, is the best for a race-horse. As the lone beam
                    breaks by its own weight, so large animals have rarely strength in proportion to
                    their size. In fact, if there were ańy land animals larger than those we know,
                    they would hardly be able to move at all. On the English Turf, however, the very
                    large horses that have appeared at various periods of its existence, have, with
                    a very few exceptions, not been found so good under high weights, as those of a
                    medium height; and several instances are on record (Meteora, Whalebone, and
                    others, for example) of the best horse of his year being very nearly the
                    lowest.</p>
                <p>The following are amongst the principal and essential points of a race-horse,
                    pointed out by Mr Darvill in the second volume of his “Treatise on the Care,
                    Treatment, and Training of the English Race-horse,” London, 1834.</p>
                <p>“His head should be small and lean; his ears small and picked; his eyes
                    brilliantly large; his forehead broad and flat His throat should be clean, and
                    fine from the butt of the ear down to its centre, with a good wide space between
                    th&amp; jaw -bones, which latter should be thin. . . . The neck should be
                    moderate in length. I prefer its being wide; I mean its width should be formed
                    by the substance of muscles which pass along each side of the top part of it;
                    from the withers to the head it may gradually rise a little in its centre, but
                    by no means to any extreme, as I have a great aversion to a high-crested
                    racehorse. Indeed, I would prefer that his neck should be as I have described
                    his face, rather of the ewe or deer-like shape, than that it should be loaded on
                    top, which I will by-and-by explain. As to the lower part of the neck, I have no
                    very particular remarks to make, further than the trachea or windpipe should be
                    spacious and loosely attached to the neck on its way to the lungs.</p>
                <p>“The withers may be moderately high, and, if the reader like, they may also be
                    moderately thin; but, with respect to this latter point, I am not so very
                    particular, provided the shoulders lay well back. From the withers the back
                    commences. I confess, that appearance may be in favour of a horse that has his
                    back a little low or hollow. As a saddle-horse this may be all very well, but
                    for a race-horse, to have strength and liberty of stride, his back should be
                    straight and moderately long, with the shoulders and loins running well in at
                    each end. The loins should have great breadth and muscular substance, so much so
                    as for them to have the appearance of being raised as it were on their surface;
                    and those muscles posterior to the loins should fill up level the top part of
                    the quarters to the setting on of the tail, which latter should be set on pretty
                    high up.”</p>
                <p>After describing the fundament, which, if small, close, and tight, and rather
                    projecting than otherwise, Mr Darvill considers as a good constitutional point,
                    he thus proceeds :—“I now come to speak of the body, or what is by some people
                    commonly called the ‘ middle piece’ of the horse, and which is divided,
                    internally, into two cavities by a muscular substance called the <hi
                    rend="superscript"> i</hi> diaphragm.’ The anterior cavity, the chest, contains
                    the lungs, the heart, &amp;c. The posterior one, the abdomen, contains the
                    stomach, intestines, liver, kidneys, &amp;c, Now, with respect to the external
                    form of the body, which contains and protects all those numerous organs so
                    important to life, I shall first make my observations on the chest. To use a
                    common phrase, and somewhat an expressive one, a horse in this part should be
                    what is called ‘ well over the heart,’ that is, he should be deep in his girth,
                    round or well arched in his ribs. I mean by this, that a rider on the back of a
                    racehorse (as they are generally better about the chest than <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193646583" xml:id="kp-eb0711-6583-0576"/>horses in common use), should
                    feel he has some breadth or substance between his legs; and there should be a
                    good swell of muscle before his knees, or the centre of the flaps of the saddle.
                    The chest, thus spaciously formed, gives room for respiration, so that, in
                    training, the horse’s wind can be brought to the greatest perfection, which
                    enables him to run on in long lengths. The next part to be treated of is the
                    abdomen or belly, or what is usually called the carcass. It may perhaps appear a
                    little strange, but I have a great aversion to what is commonly called a good
                    carcassed horse, nor am I particularly partial to a large sheathed one. I like
                    both these parts to be in the medium, as I do also that of his being well ribbed
                    up. It is true that a horse being well ribbed up denotes strength, and a short
                    close made race-horse is, in running, handy at his turns, and, as I have already
                    noticed, he is generally a pretty good one under high weights over a small round
                    cock-pit course; but this description of course and sort of running is not now
                    so much practised as formerly, or rather it is a sort of racing that does not
                    exactly suit long-striding horses, as most of those are that run in Newmarket.
                    Another thing is, that horses with large carcasses are mostly great gluttons;
                    they put up flesh very rapidly, and are very difficult and troublesome to train,
                    in consequence of their constitutions being too strong, or proportionably too
                    much for their feet and legs. Such horses not only. seldom remain long in
                    training, but they cannot remain long in condition without their becoming stale
                    in themselves, as also on their legs, and those are my reasons for objecting to
                    very large carcassed horses; yet I do not wish horses to be what is termed ‘
                    tucked up’ or waspish in their carcasses. I like a horse’s carcass to be in the
                    medium; that is, it should be straight and handsome from behind the girths of
                    his saddle; and what will make up sufficiently well, and give him sufficient
                    strength of constitution, is the well formation of the parts already noticed, as
                    the chest, the loins, and the fundament.</p>
                <p>“To return to the fore-extremities. The shoulders commence from a little below
                    the withers; they should lie most particularly well back, should be deep, broad,
                    and muscu-larly strong; yet those muscular parts should appear to the eye as
                    being moderately so, that is, not unproportionally loaded: These muscles should
                    be distinctly seen, there should be no appearance of fat, or, as it is
                    technically termed, ‘ adipose membrane.’ The shoulders cannot well be too
                    oblique in their descent to the front of the chest; here, on each side, a joint
                    is formed by the lower part of the scapula or shoulder-blade being united with
                    the upper part of the humerus or arm-bone. Those joints, thus formed, arc
                    usually called the points of the shoulders, which points should appear straight
                    or level. There should be no coarse, projecting, or heavy, appearance about the
                    points of the shoulders of such horses as are intended to race; nor indeed does
                    this often occur, unless where it happens that the chest or counter of the horse
                    is unproportionally wide. In taking a front view of the chest, it should appear
                    moderate as to breadth; and if its prominency is at all to the extreme, it
                    should be in consequence of the fulness or substance of those muscles covering
                    the breast, which muscles should be lengthy, and their divisions distinctly to
                    be observed. The fore-arm should be broad and long, and most particularly well
                    furnished with muscles on its top parts, inside as well as out; I mean by this,
                    that the muscles on the top and inside of the arm should here be so large as to
                    leave but a moderate space between the fore-legs, immediately under the chest,
                    and which muscles should appear, as those in front of the chest, distinctly
                    divided· The posterior part of the top of the arm is called the <hi
                    rend="superscript"> t</hi> elbow,’ this should appear (the horse in condition)
                    somewhat on a level with the body; if it at all deviates from this appearance, I
                    would prefer its standing in, to that of its standing unproportionally out. The
                    knee-joint should be large, broad, and flat in front; generally speaking, the
                    larger and broader all joints are in reason the better and stronger they are;
                    and the longer, coarser, and rougher, their projecting points or <hi
                    rend="italic">processes</hi> arc, the greater and more secure will be the lever
                    for the muscles or tendons to act upon, provided such projecting parts or joints
                    (as the hocks and pasterns) do not amount to disease, as that of producing
                    spavins and ring bones. The legs from the knee to the fetlock, cannot well be
                    too short, neither can they well be too broad or too flat, nor their flexor
                    tendon scarcely be too large or appearing too distinctly divided, as it were,
                    from the leg. The fetlock-joint should also be large, and the pastern
                    proportionally strong, but its length and obliquity should be in the medium. The
                    wall or crust of the feet should also be moderately oblique, with the heels
                    open, and frogs sound; this, indeed, is generally the state of racing-colts on
                    first bearing their paddocks, if their feet have been paid proper attention to
                    during the time they may have remained there. Yet, the feet of such of them as
                    have been some time in work will occasionally get out of order; they grow
                    upright and strong; the horn gets hard and brittle, and the heels more or less
                    contracted, almost all of which defects are too often occasioned from the want
                    of proper attention being paid to them at the time of shoeing, and of proper
                    applications being applied to them in the stables. 'With regard to the structure
                    of such horses feet, and the diseases of them, as also the method of shoeing and
                    plating them, a description will be found in the different chapters on those
                    subjects in the first volume. Previous to concluding my remarks on the fore
                    extremities, it may not be amiss to observe to the reader, that, supposing him
                    to stand opposite to those parts of the horse, if the animal is formed in them,
                    as I have already described the centre of the top part of the fore-arm, to be
                    well placed, ought to be nearly or quite in a parallel line with the top or
                    fore-part of the horse’s withers; and again, from the top part of the fore-arm
                    down to the foot, for the horse to stand firm and well, and have the power of
                    using his fore-legs well, he should stand perfectly straight on them; I mean by
                    this, they are not to appear too much under him, or too much out or away from
                    him. Suppose again, for example, a man standing in front of the horse, and here
                    taking a view of the foot, the centre part of the wall or crust should be in or
                    on a parallel line with that lower part or joint of the shoulder, commonly
                    termed its point. A horse’s feet, thus placed, will neither be too much out or
                    too much in; but should his feet deviate from what I have here observed, by
                    amounting to a fault, in turning too much out or too much in, I should prefer
                    their being a little out, to that of the other extreme of turning in, and being
                    what is called <hi rend="superscript"> t</hi> pigeon-toed.’</p>
                <p>“I shall now proceed to describe the hind-quarters or posterior extremities. As
                    may be supposed, the well formation of those parts is of the utmost importance
                    to a racehorse in his running; it is, therefore, necessary that they should be,
                    in breadth, substance, and length, of very superior dimensions. The hips should
                    have a great breadth between them; and if they are a little coarse or projecting
                    so much the better, provided such coarse projections are not in the extreme, or
                    appear vulgar or unsightly. From the centre and posterior part of the loins to
                    the top of the tail is called the <hi rend="superscript"> i</hi> croup,’ and
                    should be of great length; and, if it deviates from that of a straight line, it
                    may be somewhat arched in the centre; the croup being thus formed gives great
                    breadth to the top of the quarters, the length of which, from the croup down to
                    the hock, cannot scarcely be of too great an extent, in order that there may be
                    sufficient room here for the attachment of those broad, powerful, lengthy, and
                    distinctly divided muscles on the outside of the quarters and thighs; and there
                    should also be a similar portion of such muscles on the inside of the <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193646596" xml:id="kp-eb0711-6596-0577"/> quarters and
                    thighs; so that a man, who is a good judge, taking a posterior view, may observe
                    how the horse is made. In this position he should be, as it were, struck by the
                    appearance of the great breadth and length of the back part of the quarters, and
                    as he moves his head to the right or left, the centre and outside of the
                    quarters and thighs, and the swell of the muscles, should appear beyond a level
                    with the hips. The upper part of the muscles on tire inside of the quarters
                    should appear quite close to each other, so that no vacant space should be
                    visible between them, as that of an appearance of the horse being (if I may thus
                    express myself) chucked up in the fork. Such should be the lengthy and muscular
                    quarters of a well made racehorse.</p>
                <p>“The stifle-joint should be in a direct line under the hip, and the length from
                    this joint to that of the hock cannot reasonably be too long, and the farther
                    out of the angular or oblique position of the thigh-bone the better, so as to
                    admit of the back part or projecting point of the hock appearing some distance
                    out beyond the top of the hind quarters; those parts being thus formed, admit of
                    a very considerable lever for the main tendon here to act upon the tendon
                    Achilles, which, like the flexor one of the leg, can scarcely be too large or
                    too distinctly seen in its commencement, from the lower part of the quarter to
                    its insertion into the posterior or projecting point of the hock, the os calcis.
                    The hock should be broad and wide, with a clean lean appearance, and those soft
                    parts which are occasionally the seat of through-pins and bog spavins, in a
                    sound well formed hock, should appear more as cavities than as having the
                    above-mentioned projections, and which are sometimes the cause of lameness. The
                    hind-leg, like the fore one, should be short, broad, flat, and straight; the
                    trifling angle formed by the hock should, together with the moderate obliquity
                    of the pastern, bring the extremity of tire toe nearly under the
                    stifle-joint.”</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Action of the Race-Horse.</hi></p>
                <p>As amongst the Egyptians, the lion was the hieroglyphic of strength, so was the
                    horse of agility; and truly nothing displays it more elegantly than he does,
                    when gamboling in a state of liberty. In the race-horse, action, as in
                    eloquence, is the next thing to substance; and <hi rend="italic">virtus</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">in</hi><hi rend="italic">actione,</hi> should be the
                    horse-breeder’s motto. But the action of the race-horse is of a nature peculiar
                    to his calling. He must not only possess great stride in his gallop, the result
                    of great proportion in his limbs and moving levers, but also a quickness in
                    repeating that stride, or he would lose in time what he gains in space. It is
                    then when stride and quickness are united, that the fleet racer is produced; and
                    in his race with Diamond, Hambletonian is asserted to have covered twenty-one
                    feet at a stroke at the finish of it; and Eclipse is generally believed to have
                    covered eighty-three and a half feet of ground in a second, when going at the
                    top of his speed, which, by a calculation by Monsieur Saintbel, amounted to
                    about twenty-five feet of ground covered at a stroke.</p>
                <p>The action most approved of in a racer, as describing the greatest extent, with
                    the least fatigue to the animal, is what is termed on the Turf “round action
                    that is, when, on a side view being taken of a horse in his gallop, his fore
                    legs appear to form a wheel or circle. Different ground, however, requires
                    different action; and the large, long striding horse may be beaten on a hilly,
                    or turning course, by one of a smaller size, but with a shorter stride, which
                    prevents the Newmarket courses being a certain criterion of a good runner at
                    Epsom, which is very trying ground. The state of the ground, likewise, whether
                    wet or dry, soft or hard tells so much in a race, as often to give it to a horse
                    very little thought of at starting, as was the case with Tarrare, winner of the
                    St Leger, at Doncaster, in 1826. The celebrated Euphrates, the winner of so many
                    gold cups, and who ran till he was in his teens, was nearly a stone below his
                    usual form, after even a hard shower of rain. This variation of fleetness
                    corroborates our assertion, that the virtue of what is termed blood is
                    mechanical, or, what is the same thing, that the excellence of all horses is
                    mechanical, and that the smallest deviation from a true formation of the acting
                    parts operates so powerfully as to render them, under certain exertions, nearly
                    valueless.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Wind.</hi></p>
                <p>It is true, “speed wins the race but to make it available to the race-horse, it
                    must be accompanied by endn ∙ rance, or “bottom.” A great promoter of this is
                    clear wind, or freedom of respiration, the want of which makes the war-horse
                    rebel in the manege, the hunter run into his fences, the draught-horse fall, as
                    if he were shot, and the racer either stop, or bolt out of the course. In fact,
                    when the organs of respiration are fatigued, all animals are nearly powerless.
                    The cause of good wind may be distinguish able to the eye, and arises chiefly
                    from depth in the forequarters, which implies a capacious thorax or chest.
                    However wide a horse may be in his foreparts, he will not be good-winded unless
                    he is, at the same time, deep. But still wind in the race-horse depends on
                    something more, on the nature of his constituent and component parts, which, if
                    in proper proportion, impart to him strength and agility, giving him that easy
                    action which will not readily fatigue these organs of respiration; and so enable
                    him to run on, when others, less gifted by nature than himself, are forced to
                    slacken pace. The good effect of clear wind in a race-horse is in fact twofold;
                    first, It gives him signal advantage in a race; and, secondly, Horses thus
                    organized require less work to make them fit to start.</p>
                <p>The following passage on this point is worthy of remark: “When the animal
                    powerfully exerts himself, a more ample supply of pure blood is required to
                    sustain the energies of life, and the action of the muscles forces the blood
                    more rapidly through the veins; hence the quick and deep breathing of a horse at
                    speed; hence the necessity of a capacious chest, in order to yield an adequate
                    supply, and the connexion of this capacity of the chest with the speed and the
                    endurance of the horse; hence the wonderful relief which the mere loosening of
                    the girths affords to a horse blown and distressed, enabling the chest to
                    expand, and to contract to a greater extent, in order to yield more purified
                    blood; and hence the relief afforded by even a short period of rest, during
                    which this expenditure is not required, and the almost exhausted energies of
                    these organs have time to recover. Hence, likewise, appears the necessity of an
                    ample chest for the accumulation of much flesh and fat; for, if a considerable
                    portion of the blood be employed in the growth of the animal, and it be thus
                    rapidly changed, there must be provision for its rapid purification; and that
                    can only be effected by the increased bulk of the lungs, and the corresponding
                    largeness of the chest to contain them.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    VI. p. 182.</p></note></p>
                <p>Certain thorough-bred horses would deceive an inexperienced observer as to the
                    real state of their organs of respiration, by an appearance of difficulty of
                    breathing, which, in reality, they do not possess. The term for this apparent
                    defect is, in one instance, hard breathing, or high-blowing, and in another
                    “cracking the nostrils.” Of the first description was the celebrated Eclipse,
                    whose breathing, in <pb break="no" facs="nls:193646609"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0711-6609-0578"/>his gallop could be heard at a considerable
                    distance; and of the latter (still more common) may be reckoned many of the best
                    racers of past and present days. Indeed, a racehorse cracking his nostrils in
                    his exercise, and snorting well afterwards, are considered indicative of
                    good-windedness. On the other hand, when a race-horse becomes a roarer, which is
                    a common effect of a severe attack of the epizootie, called the Distemper, he is
                    rarely able to struggle in a race, although there have been several instances of
                    winners under such very unfavourable circumstances.</p>
                <p>Temper is a property of much importance to the racehorse, subject as he is to its
                    influence under more trying circumstances than most other descriptions of
                    horses. In the first place, his fine and nearly hairless skin, softened and
                    cleansed as it is by frequent copious perspiration, is so highly sensible to the
                    friction of the wisp and brush, as to induce him to try to rid himself of his
                    tormentor, by attacking the person who is dressing him, and thus becomes vicious
                    in the stable. It will also be recollected that he is at this time, perhaps, in
                    the very highest state of condition and good keep of which his nature is
                    susceptible. On the race-course, again, he has often to encounter the (to him)
                    unnatural sound of music, and many strange objects; perhaps two or three false
                    starts before he gets into a race; and too often, when doing his best in a race,
                    very severe punishment both by whip and spur. It is in his race, however, and
                    chiefly in the last struggle for it, that the temper of the race-horse is most
                    put to the test; and, if really bad, he either runs out of the course, to the
                    great danger of his rider, and to the inevitable loss of his owner and those who
                    have betted on his winning, or he “shuts himself up,” as the term is, and will
                    not head his horses, although in his power to do so. It is evident, then, that
                    breeders should not send mares to stallions of known bad temper, as nearly all
                    those propensities are found to be hereditary; and we could name one or two of
                    the best horses of the present day, who are generally rejected as stallions to
                    breed racers from, by reason of these propensities.</p>
                <p>It would be absurd to draw a comparison between the English race-horse in
                    training, and the horse of the Desert, “educated,” as Mr Gibbon eloquently says
                    of him, “in the tents, among the children of the Arabs, with a tender
                    familiarity, which trains him in the habits of gentleness and attachment.”
                    Nevertheless, we are inclined to believe that the tempers of many naturally
                    quiet horses are made uncertain, and oftentimes decidedly vicious, by want of
                    proper judgment, as well as good temper, in those also who have the management
                    of them. Brutes, like men, demand a peculiar mode of treatment, when we require
                    them to do their utmost for us; and it is certain that this principle holds good
                    in regard to both, namely, <hi rend="italic">that, in general, kindness gains
                    its point, cruelty provokes resistance, and a proper degree of severity produces
                    obedience.</hi> The panther in the fable knew who fed her with bread, and who
                    pelted her with stones; and we may be assured, that so noble and high-spirited
                    an animal as the horse feels with acuteness sensations of pleasure and pain.</p>
                <p>We often hear it asserted that the British thorough-bred horse has degenerated
                    within the last few years, and is no longer the stout and long-enduring animal
                    that he was in the bygone century, particularly during the last twenty years of
                    it. We are inclined to believe that there is some truth in this. We do not think
                    we have such good ſour-mile horses, as they are termed, as formerly, which we
                    consider easily accounted for. They are not wanted, very few four-mile races
                    being now run, even at Newmarket or in the country, and, therefore, a different
                    kind of race-horse is sought for. It may, however, be true, that the inducement
                    to train colts and fillies, at a very early period of their lives, for these
                    short races, has had an injurious effect on their stamina, and, consequently, on
                    the stock bred from them.</p>
                <p>Formerly a horse was wanted for a lifetime, now he is cut up in his youth to
                    answer the purposes of perhaps but one day ;—a system, we admit, quite at
                    variance with the original object of horse-racing, which was intended to benefit
                    the community, by being the means of producing, as well as displaying, the
                    constitutional strength of the horse in its very highest perfection. Another
                    cause may have operated in rendering thorough-bred horses less powerful than
                    they were, or less capable of enduring severe fatigue. During the period of high
                    weights and long courses, horses and marcs were kept on in training until after
                    they had arrived at the age of maturity, neither did they begin to work so soon;
                    whereas now, no sooner have they won, or run well for some of our great three
                    year-old stakes, than they are put into the stud to produce racing stock, which
                    is perhaps to be used much in the same manner as they themselves have been used,
                    or, we should have rather said, abused.</p>
                <p>But, admitting this alleged falling off in the powers and performances of the
                    British thorough-bred horse, it may be the result of causes unconnected with
                    those already noticed. Although there may be no era of greater intellectual
                    brightness than another in the history of any animal but man, yet, as is
                    signified by Plato in the eighth book of his Republic, there have always been
                    periods of fertility and sterility of men, animals, and plants; and that, in
                    fertile periods, mankind, as well as animals, will not only be both more
                    numerous, but superior in bodily endowments, to those of a barren period. This
                    theory is supported by the relations of ancient historians, in the accounts they
                    give of animals which no where exist at present, and in the properties they
                    ascribe to some of those which now'do exist.</p>
                <p>But to return to the alleged alteration for the worse in the British race-horse.
                    We admit the fact, that he is not so good at high weight over the Beacon at
                    Newmarket, or any other ſour-mile course, as his predecessors were, whose
                    descent was closer than his is to the blood of Herod and Eclipse, and the
                    descendants of that cross, said to be the stoutest of any. Nevertheless he is,
                    in his present form, more generally adapted to the purposes to which the horse
                    is applied. He has a shorter, but more active, stroke in his gallop than his
                    predecessors had, which is more available to him in the short races of the
                    present time than the deep rate of the four-milers of old times; and as he is
                    now required to start quickly, and to be on his legs, as the term is, in a few
                    hundred yards, he is altogether a more lively active animal than formerly; and,
                    as such, a useful animal for more ends than one. In former days, not one trained
                    thorough-bred horse in fifty made a hunter. Indeed few sportsmen had the courage
                    to try the experiment of making him one. He went more upon his shoulders, as
                    well as with a straighter knee, than the modern race-horse does, and required
                    much greater exertion in the rider to pull him together in his gallop. All those
                    sportsmen, however, who remember such horses as the late Earl Grosvenor’s, John
                    Bull, and Alexander, must admit, that, in form and substance, they were equal to
                    carrying the heaviest weight across a country, and the last mentioned horse was
                    the sire of several very powerful, at the same time very brilliant hunters. But
                    as it is action after all that carries weight, the thorough-bred horses of this
                    day arc not deficient in that respect, unless undersized; and there are more
                    thoroughbred hunters at this period, and have been more for the last thirty
                    years, than were ever known before. This improvement in action also qualifies
                    the full-bred horse for the road, whereas formerly not one in a hundred was fit
                    to ride oft turf. Indeed daisy-cutters and thorough-bred horses were nearly
                    synonymous terms; but at present a young lady on a bit of blood is an every day
                    sight; and a young gentleman on any thing else in the parks, or on his road to
                    hounds, is become rather a rare one. This is a very saving <pb break="no"

                    race-horses, as a market is now generally found for such as are undersized, or
                    tried to be deficient in speed for racing; whereas in former days, a bad
                    race-horse was, like Rosinante, neither saleable nor pawnable.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Speed of the Race-Horse.</hi></p>
                <p>All animals in a state of domestication exhibit powers far beyond those that are
                    natural to them in their wild state, and writers on the horse have advanced to
                    the utmost verge of possibility, in recording the maximum speed of the English
                    race-horse. Most of the instances stated by them, such as Flying Childers having
                    run a mile in a minute, are unsupported by authority, and therefore not worthy
                    of regard. That the horse, however, has ever been considered the swiftest beast
                    of the forest, may be gathered from the frequent allusions to his fleetness by
                    inspired as well as by heathen writers. Thus, the chariot-horses of Oenomaus,
                    King of Elis, were said to be begotten by the winds, emblematical of their
                    prodigious swiftness; and Homer represents the steeds of Achilles to be the
                    produce of Zephyrus (the west wind, said to be the swiftest of any), and
                    Podarge, whose name signifies speed. Nor is Virgil far behind the rest in his
                    encomium on the fleetness of his colt, which he makes to challenge the very
                    whirlwind itself. As it is speed, however, that wins the race, it is most
                    essential to the race-horse, provided it be accompanied by stoutness; and unless
                    we wish to fly through the air like Pacolet on his wooden horse, we may be
                    contented with the speed of the present English race-horse. Perhaps the
                    following is a fair specimen, and, as it is of so late a date, the same
                    uncertainty does not attach to it that hangs over the unsupported traditions of
                    our earlier racing days. In 1832, Theodore, the property of the Honourable
                    Edward Petre, and winner of the Doncaster St Leger stakes, ran the distance,
                    being one mile six furlongs and one hundred and thirty-two yards, in three
                    minutes and twenty-three seconds, carrying 8 stone 6 lb. He was trained and
                    tamed by the late Mr Croft, who also trained the second and third horses in the
                    same race.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Expenses of a Breeding Racing-Stud.</hi></p>
                <p>Some persons must be breeders of race-horses, but whether to profit or loss,
                    depends on various circumstances. Amongst them may be reckoned the following
                    :—Judgment in selecting the parent stock or blood; conveniences for keeping the
                    produce well and warm, and on land suitable to breeding; and plenty of money at
                    command, to enable a breeder to purchase mares of the very best racing families,
                    and to put them to the best of stallions. When this is the case, we think
                    breeding (we mean quite distinct from risk in racing) would seldom fail to pay,
                    if the foals were sold off at weaning time, or even at a year old. A few years
                    back, eight of the Earl of Durham’s <hi rend="italic">foals</hi> realized L. 200
                    a-piece; and, still later, several of Mr Nowell’s (of Underley Hall,
                    Westmoreland) yearlings fetched the enormous sum of L. 500. No doubt, in all
                    studs, great loss is sustained by a certain prope rtion of the young stock which
                    promise to be small and not worth training; but here breeders are often
                    deceived. For example, the late Lord Grosvenor sent Meteora, the best mare in
                    England of her day, to Chester Fair, when two years old, to be sold for L. 16,
                    because she was considered as too small; and he also suffered Violante, the best
                    four-mile racer of her day, to be sold, <hi rend="italic">untried</hi> for L.
                    50, but fortunately purchased her again. The great prices, however, occasionally
                    paid to breeders for some horses (4000 guineas, for example, to the Earl of
                    Jersey for Mameluke, and 3000 guineas a-piece have lately been given for other
                    three year-old colts) make up for the loss inseparable from such as, by
                    misshape, diminutive size, and casualties, are culled out, and sold for what
                    they will fetch, which seldom amounts to much.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Value of Stakes and Prizes.</hi></p>
                <p>Agamemnon is made to say, that that man would be rich who had treasures equal to
                    the value of the prizes the horses had won, which he offers to Achilles. We are
                    inclined to think, that if this king of Argos could come amongst us now, he
                    would find prizes more valuable than any contended for in his time; and that
                    sterling cash, and not “the bubble honour,” is the main object of the British
                    sportsman on the Turf. But here is the inducement to the great expenses of a

                <p>The beauty of forms observable in the animal system is subordinate to their
                    general utility, and they please us in proportion to their aptitude to unite
                    these two objects. We admire the elegant make of a swan, but the pleasure is
                    doubled when we behold the ease and dignity of its motion. The colours, however,
                    which Nature has bestowed with such profusion upon the surface of some of these
                    animals, birds in particular, exhibit beauties independent of aptitude, and
                    could only have been intended for their adornment. The prevailing colour of the
                    thorough-bred horse is peculiarly elegant and chaste, being a bright bay, with
                    black mane and tail, and black legs to correspond, although occasionally
                    relieved with a small white star on the forehead, or a white heel of the leg. It
                    is remarkable, that what may be termed vulgar colours, such as light sorrel, or
                    dun, or brown with mealy muzzle, are very seldom met with in the thorough-bred
                    horse; and we know but one instance of the pie-bald, and very few roans.<note

                    best racers, almost all the Trumpator blood, have been of that colour. The real
                    chestnut prevails a good deal, and is quite equal to the bay in the richness and
                    brightness of its hues. Such was the colour of Eclipse, and, as is the case with
                    game-fowls, in the breeding of which there are instances of a reversion to the
                    original colour, after fifteen descents, it is not uncommon for thorough-bred
                    stock to be chestnuts, although got by a bay stallion out of a bay mare, or from
                    sire and dam of any other colour, provided the blood runs back to his,
                    Eclipse’s, source. Indeed, a small dark spot which that celebrated horse had on
                    his quarter, has been frequently found in his descendants in the fifth or sixth
                    generation.</p>
                <p>It is an old and trite saying, that “a good horse cannot be of a bad colour
                    nevertheless, colours of horses are, to a certain extent, indices of their
                    physical powers. Such has proved to be the case with men; and it was found in
                    the ill-fated Russian campaign, that men of dark complexions and black hair bore
                    the severity of the climate better than men of an opposite appearance to them.
                    It is, however, rather a remarkable fact, that by far the greater number of
                    eminent English prize-fighters have been men of light, not dark, complexion. The
                    ancients reckoned thirteen colours of horses, giving the preference to bay
                    (badices). ’.</p>

                <p>A second-rate description of racer has lately been very prevalent in England,
                    Newmarket excepted, known by the term “cock-tail,” or <hi rend="italic"
                    >half-bred</hi> horse, as he is called, but improperly so termed, because the
                    stain in him is generally very slight indeed, and too often difficult to be
                    traced. Many objections are raised by sportsmen, who are thorough racing men,
                    and who wish well to the Turf, against the cock-tail racer, and for very good
                    reasons. In the first place, if really half-bred, he resembles the royal stamp
                    upon base metal, for no half-bred horse is deserving the name of racer, nor will
                    he stand the necessary preparation. Secondly, what are called half-bred stakes,
                    some of which are very good, have been the cause of a great many frauds being
                    committed, by bringing horses to run for them under false pedigrees, which will
                    ever be the case, from the great difficulty of proving a horse to be
                    thorough-bred, whose dam may have been purchased by accident, or in some
                    clandestine way, and still perhaps of pure racing blood. Again, as there is no
                    scale by which the degree of impure blood, which qualifies a horse for those
                    stakes, can be measured, the breeder of the cock-tail, of course, avails himself
                    of the parent stock in which the slightest possible stain can be shewn, which
                    indeed has been attempted to be shewn in some of the best race-horses of later
                    times. In this case, an animal is produced against which no half-bred horse, in
                    the proper acceptation of the term, has a chance, and he sweeps the country of
                    all the good stakes; and some such horses, (Habberley, for example) have proved
                    themselves superior to many of the thorough-bred racers of their year. But the
                    breeding of horses for these stakes is any thing but beneficial to the country,
                    the great object of racing. It encourages a spurious race of animals, often
                    possessing the faults of the blood horse without the strength and activity of
                    the hunter, and it was for the latter description of horse that this stake was
                    first intended. <hi rend="italic">Bona fide</hi> hunters’ stakes would be
                    advantageous, if <hi rend="italic">open to all horses</hi> bringing certificates
                    of their having been regularly hunted throughout a season, but not merely ridden
                    by a boy to see a fox found; and giving no allowance to the horse called
                    “half-bred.” Let the best hunter win, which would encourage the breeding of
                    strong thorough-bred horses, which make the best hunters of any ;—a fact no one
                    who has ridden many of them will deny.</p>

                <p>To assist in the detection of spurious blood, and the correction of inaccurate
                    pedigrees, is the chief purpose of this excellent publication, now increased to
                    a third volume, and forming a part of every sportsman’s library. Some attempts
                    have been made by Mr John Laurence, a voluminous, but by no means a correct,
                    writer on the Horse, to disturb the pedigrees of several of the first stallions
                    of their time, and from which several of the distinguished racers of the present
                    day are descended; and all upon hearsay evidence, without being able to
                    substantiate one single fact in proof of his vague assertions. He has doubted
                    the pedigree of Eclipse, put the blood of Sampson into Highflyer, where it never
                    existed, and has thought proper to pronounce Sampson to have been a low-bred
                    horse, on the authority of some old Yorkshireman he picked up on the road,
                    although in his last work on the Horse he admits him to have been one of “the
                    truest four-mile horses that our Turf has produced; was but once beaten, and
                    also proved a capital stallion, as sire of Bay Mollon, Engineer,” &amp;c. Such
                    matters as this would be scarcely worthy of notice, were it not with a view of
                    cautioning the public, foreigners in particular, from being led into errors
                    respecting the purity of our racing blood. Sampson was an animal of immense
                    power, so were John Bull and Alexander; he might have had coarse points, so have
                    the stock of Partisan and Blacklock, two of the best stallions of the present
                    day; but who would deny their purity of blood on that account? Mr Laurence has
                    been often called to account for these and similar misstatements, but he is
                    inaccessible to correction. <hi rend="italic">Sic</hi><hi rend="italic"

                    assertions; and he claims the woman’s privilege of having the last word.</p>
                <p>THE HUNTER.</p>
                <p>There is no description of horse which could be applied to so many purposes,
                    racing excepted, as the powerful English Hunter. Setting aside his own peculiar
                    services in the field, he is fit to carry a man on the road, in the field of
                    battle, and he answers for every kind of draught. Indeed, we are inclined to
                    believe no horse would equal him in ploughing; and as for road-work on harness,
                    either slow or fast, nothing could touch him, in a carriage properly suited to
                    his powers. It is, however, no less true than singular, that out of a hundred
                    sportsmen assembled at the meeting of a pack of fox-hounds, not half-a-dozen
                    would be found mounted on horses which they themselves had bred. This arises
                    from two causes: First, the greater part of them have not patience to await the
                    arrival of a young horse at his best, and consequently sell the few they do
                    breed, without giving them a fair trial; and, secondly, such has, of late years,
                    been the prejudice against riding mares in the hunting field, that they have
                    been chiefly left in the hands of farmers and yeomen, who are become the
                    principal breeders of English hunters. Neither do hunters find their road direct
                    from the breeder to the studs of noblemen or gentlemen. They generally go
                    through the hands of an inferior country dealer, from whom they arc bought by
                    the principal London and country dealers, and sold by them to the sportsmen of
                    the various hunts. There are, of course, exceptions to this proceeding. A great
                    proportion of English yeomen and farmers are very excellent horsemen, and, as
                    such, having the capability of making their young horses into hunters, and,
                    distinguishing them by riding them afterwards with hounds, obtain now and then
                    as high a price for them as they fetch after having passed through the hands we
                    have described. It is, however, to be lamented that the last-mentioned
                    description of persons, the breeders and trainers of young hunters, do not, for
                    the most part, realize such large prices as the first, although fully entitled
                    to it, as a reward for their trouble and skill.</p>
                <p>It is impossible to lay down any precise rules for breed- . ing hunters, so many
                    collateral circumstances being necessary to be taken into consideration. For
                    example, Pennant, in his Zoology, says, “Our race-horses are descended from
                    Arabian stallions, and the genealogy faintly extends to the hunter.” From this
                    we learn the interesting fact, that a wonderful change, within the last sixty or
                    seventy years, has taken place in the form and character of this sort of horse,
                    inasmuch as, in the opinion of some of the first of our English sportsmen, and
                    such as put the powers of the horse to the most severe test, the hunter of the
                    present day is not in his perfect form unless quite thoroughbred. This part of
                    the subject we shall discuss hereafter; but as there are several of our hunting
                    counties not at all suited to this description of horse, the thorough-bred
                    hunter, and a large portion of our sportsmen who, some by reason of their
                    weight, and others from prejudice against them, neither can nor will ride them,
                    we may safely assert, that not more than a twentieth part of English hunters are
                    at this time of quite pure blood. We will, however, set forth what we consider
                    the best properties of the full-bred and the half-bred hunter, as he is called,
                    as also the most probable means of breeding each kind to advantage; at the same
                    time venturing an opinion, that, when their indivι-dual<pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193646648" xml:id="kp-eb0711-6648-0581"/> capabilities are put into
                    the scale of excellence, the balance will incline to the former.</p>
                <p>One great obstacle to the general success in breeding hunters is, not so much the
                    difficulty of access to good stallions, but of making breeders believe that it
                    would be their interest to send their mares to such as are good, although at an
                    extra expense. Most rural districts, in other respects favourable to
                    horse-breeding, swarm with covering stallions, the greater part of which have
                    proved very bad racers; but which, falling into the hands of persons who are
                    popular characters in their neighbourhood, and covering at a low price, get most
                    of the farmers’ brood marcs sent to them, their owners never reflecting, as they
                    gaze upon these misshapen animals, that Nature will not go out of her course to
                    oblige them, but that, in the animal creation, “like begets like.” Neither does
                    the evil stop here. So much is this made a matter of chance instead of one of
                    judgment, should the produce of a mare sent to one of these bad stallions be a
                    filly foal, and she proves so defective in shape and action as to be unsaleable
                    at a remunerating price, she remains the property of her breeder, and in time
                    becomes herself a brood-mare. What, then, can be expected from such produce?
                    Why, unless chance steps in and supplies the defect of judgment, in the first
                    instance, admitting that she is sent to a better stallion than her sire was, by
                    the procreative powers of the male so far exceeding those of the female, as to
                    produce a foal free from the defects of the dam, another shapeless, unprofitable
                    animal is produced. Nevertheless, in the course of time, perhaps this produce,
                    if a female, however bad she may ι&gt;rove, is also bred from, and thus a
                    succession of shape-ess horses is produced, to the certain loss of the breeder,
                    and much to the injury of the community. Under the most favourable
                    circumstances, and with the aid of good judgment, we cannot consider
                    horse-breeding to be a certain source of gain: yet there are many inducements to
                    try it as one branch of rural economics. The money goes out a little at a time,
                    or by degrees, and therefore it is suitable to such occupiers of land as cannot
                    embark in more extensive speculations, and it returns in a lump, oftentimes at a
                    most welcome moment, and, in ⅛any instances, of sufficient amount to render the
                    average of former less profitable years sufficient to cover expenses, if not to
                    leave a profit. There is likewise another inducement to breeding horses; we mean
                    the interest inseparable from all human speculations, from which more than an
                    ordinary return may be looked for, which is the case here; added to the nearly
                    universal interest attached to the breeding and rearing of every species of
                    domestic animals.</p>
                <p>With respect to brood-mares designed for breeding hunters, we admit that
                    circumstances, not always within control, have their weight. An occupier of land
                    is possessed of a mare or two which he thinks <hi rend="italic">may</hi> breed
                    hunters, and having them, it may not be convenient to him to replace them by
                    those which might be more likely to breed good ones. But the choice of a
                    stallion is always within his control, and he should not spare trouble, and
                    moderately increased price, in his selection. It is well known to all hunting
                    men, that the stock of certain horses have been remarkable for making good
                    hunters (we could name many of present and past times), and that there are such
                    horses always to be found, on seeking for them. A few pounds extra, laid out by
                    the breeder in putting his mares to such horses, are sure to be amply repaid;
                    for the produce would be generally sought after and purchased, even previously
                    to their being tried. Englishmen know of no such restrictions, nor do we wish
                    they ever should; but the interference of the governments of several European
                    states as to stallions for the use of their respective countries, reads us a
                    useful lesson on this head; for it is well known, on the other hand, that a
                    great number of stallions to which</p>
                <p>English hunting mares have been put, have been equally remarkable for begetting
                    soft infirm stock, quite unequal to endure, for any length of time, the severe
                    work of a hunter. It should also be borne in mind, that even a firstrate racer
                    may not be a propagator of first-rate hunters. The former is called upon to
                    exert his powers on very different ground, and under very different weight to
                    the latter, and the action which may suit one may not suit the other. This
                    accounts for the stock of certain thorough-bred horses, which were very
                    indifferent racers, proving very excellent hunters. We have already given it as
                    our opinion, that a cross of Arabian blood is a great desideratum in that of an
                    English hunter, and we need not urge this point farther; but if breeders would
                    reflect, that the expenses of rearing a bad colt equal those of rearing a good
                    one, they would attend more than they do to the following nearly unerring
                    directions.</p>
                <p>First, Observe similarity of shape in horse and mare. As length of frame is
                    indispensable in a hunter, if the mare be short, seek for a stallion likely to
                    give her length. Again, if the mare be high on her legs, put her to a
                    short-legged stallion, and <hi rend="italic">vice versa</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >;</hi> for it is possible that even a hunter’s legs may be too short, a racer’s
                    certainly may be. In fact, to form a complete hunter, it is necessary he should
                    be more perfect in his shape than a racer, which will admit of imperfections
                    that would quite disqualify the other.</p>
                <p>Secondly, Look to constitution. As no description of horse endures the
                    long-continued exertion that a hunter does, this is a point to be attended to.
                    But it may be overdone. Horses of a very hard nature, very closely ribbed up,
                    consequently great feeders, with large carcasses, seldom make the sort of
                    brilliant hunter now the fashion in England. Besides, one of this description
                    requires so much work to keep him in place and in wind, that his legs must
                    suffer, and often give way when his constitution is just in its prime. Horses
                    with moderately sized carcasses last longest; and, provided they are good
                    feeders, will come out quite as often as they ought to do, and are invariably
                    good winded and brilliant, if well-bred and of good form, with a few other
                    requisites. We never saw a very closely-ribbed, large carcassed horse, brilliant
                    as a hunter, and we know such form is not approved of in the race-horse.</p>
                <p>Thirdly, and lastly, Let the breeder of any kind of horse be careful in avoiding
                    either sire or dam that has proved constitutionally infirm. As has been already
                    shown on very high authority, perfect or defective conformation is not more
                    likely to be the result of a proper selection of horse and mare, than disease to
                    be inherited from parents that have been constitutionally diseased. We could
                    name stallions whose stock have been blind; others afflicted with splents,
                    curbs, and spavins, and a mare which produced three roarers by three different
                    sires. But it may be said, that splents, curbs, and spavins, are the result of
                    malconformation of the parts. Granted; but avoid all such malformation which is
                    quite apparent to the eye in a breeding stud. It may perhaps be carrying this
                    objection too far, <hi rend="italic">-were</hi> we to say, we would not breed
                    from a mare or horse, which had become groggy or lame in the feet, from diseased
                    navicular joints. Had the feet been more vigorously constituted, perhaps such
                    lameness might not have occurred; yet it is but too probable that here the
                    predisposing cause may be traced to over-severe treatment, and not to
                    constitutional defect.</p>
                <p>We have already expressed a regret at the prevailing prejudice against mares as
                    hunters, admitting, however, that they are not to be so much depended upon at
                    certain periods as the other sex. Nevertheless, no year passes over our heads
                    that we do not hear of mares eminently distinguishing themselves on the
                    race-course, in the hunting field, and on the road. Indeed, the majority of the
                    extraordinary feats performed en the road have been performed <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193646661" xml:id="kp-eb0711-6661-0582"/>by mares. As relates to
                    breeding hunters, however, this prejudice against them is most injurious in two
                    ways. First, it takes off so much from the value of a filly, as in few cases to
                    leave the mere cost of breeding and rearing her; and, next, many a mare, which
                    would have proved acapital hunter, had she been tried, and, as is reasonable to
                    suppose, a capital brood mare as well, is lost to the hunting world by being
                    sold for harness purposes; and then, if good, so ruined in constitution as to be
                    totally unfit to breed from. On the other hand, were mares more generally used
                    as hunters, all such as proved themselves good, that is, were they stout, and
                    had the peculiar kind of action that enabled them to go well on deep ground,
                    over ridge and furrow, and were good leapers, they might for the most part be
                    relied upon for producing good ones to succeed them. It may likewise be observed
                    that, as in this case, the risk would be diminished, more people would breed
                    hunters than do at present; and it is very generally admitted, that, at this
                    time, so great is the scarcity of young horses likely to make hunters, w ere it
                    not for those annually imported from Ireland, the demand would far exceed the
                    supply.</p>
                <p>Next in importance to the judicious selection of sire and dam, is the rearing of
                    the colt, which it is intended should make a hunter. It was the remark of a
                    gentleman, who kept fox-hounds more than half a century, that “great part of the
                    goodness of a horse goes in at his mouth,” and nothing is more true. Nimrod, in
                    his Letters on the Condition of Hunters (p. 223, first edition), says, “It is my
                    confirmed opinion, that unless a colt be what is called ‘ deformed,’ it is in
                    the power of good keep, exercise, and physic, to make him what is termed <hi
                    rend="superscript"> i</hi> a fine horse,’ and one which will sell for a large
                    price, either for harness or the saddle. No one who has not witnessed it, is
                    aware of the improvement in shoulders, thighs, gaskins, &amp;c. from good old
                    oats, accompanied by regular work and proper riding.” Breeders of hunters may be
                    assured that such is the case; and that it is of little use to breed colts with
                    the expectation of their making first-rate horses, unless they keep them <hi
                    rend="italic">very well</hi> in their colthood. They should also be treated <hi
                    rend="italic">as horses</hi> at a very early age. They should be ridden gently,
                    and by a light man, or boy, with good hands, at three years old, across rough
                    ground, and over small fences; and at four they should be shewn hounds; but they
                    should only follow them at a distance, and after the fences are broken down;
                    for, if put to take large leaps at that tender age, they are apt to get alarmed,
                    and never make first-rate fencers afterwards. Above all things, avoid getting
                    them into boggy ditches, or riding them at brooks; but they should be practised
                    at leaping small ditches, if with water in them the better, in the middle of a
                    field, the rider putting them at them in rather a brisk gallop. This gives them
                    confidence, and, the natural result, courage. With respect to the use of the
                    bar, and teaching colts to leap standing over it, the practice is now condemned,
                    and the system of letting them become timber jumpers, by taking it, as it comes,
                    in crossing a country, is preferred, the present rate of hounds not admitting of
                    the time occupied in a standing leap.</p>
                <p>Some sportsmen adopt, and we believe with good effect, what is termed the
                    “circular bar.” Every description of fence that a hunter is likely to meet with,
                    is placed within a prescribed circle of ground, and in this is the colt lodged,
                    the man who holds him standing upon a stage in the centre. As another man
                    follows him with a whip, he is forced to take his fences at a certain pace; and,
                    in a very short time, a good tempered colt will take them with apparent
                    pleasure.</p>
                <p>At five years old it is customary to consider a horse as a hunter; but we are
                    inclined to demur here. It is true, that a colt has been very well kept, on the
                    hard meat system, he is enabled to go through a good day’s work with hounds at
                    five years old, being quite equal to a six-year old, which has been kept on soft
                    food, and not sufficiently forced by corn; yet it is always attended with danger
                    of injury to his joints and sinews, if not to his general constitution; and we
                    cannot pronounce a horse to be a hunter until he has passed his fifth year. As
                    muscular action, however, produces muscular growth, he should not be kept in
                    idleness during his fifth year, but should be ridden to cover, or with harriers,
                    before Christmas; and when the ground gets dry and light in the spring, a good
                    burst with foxhounds may not do him harm. We do not, however, consider any
                    five-year old horse fitting or safe to carry a gentleman over a country, as he
                    cannot be sufficiently experienced to take a straight line.</p>
                <p>We have known some masters of fox-hounds who have preferred purchasing yearling
                    colts, or weanlings, at Michaelmas, to breeding them for their own use. The
                    classical reader cannot fail calling to his recollection here the practical
                    lesson which Virgil, in his third Géorgie, imparts on this head; neither can the
                    purchaser of such animals do better than follow it to the very letter. Should he
                    fix upon the one which, as he describes him,—</p>
                <p>“Primus et ire viam, et fluvios tentare menaces Audet, et ignoto sese committere
                    ponti,”</p>
                <p>he would be pretty certain of having in due time a first-rate hunter, that would
                    turn his tail to nothing. Nor should the breeder overlook the poet’s advice to
                    keep bis young stock well, if he wishes to have them in the high form (and can
                    any thing be finer ?) in which the one of his own choice is presented to us in
                    this most splendid passage.</p>
                <p>There are undoubtedly certain advantages attending purchasing yearling colts,
                    with the view of making hunters of them. Such only may be selected as appear
                    calculated for the country they are intended to cross, and the weights they will
                    be called upon to carry; whereas, were the master of hounds to depend on the
                    produce of his own mares, he might be disappointed in being able to select the
                    number he would require to replace, in due time, the vacancies which occurred
                    annually in his stud. We should consider the sum of thirty-five or forty guineas
                    for a good colt, at weaning time, a fair remuneration to the breeder, and well
                    laid out by the purchaser.</p>
                <p>Previously to giving directions for the purchase of a full-grown hunter, we shall
                    proceed to exhibit him in his highest form, although we are aware of the
                    difficulty, on certain subjects, of conveying, clearly, an idea from our own
                    mind to that of another. We shall, however, endeavour to make ourselves
                    understood by describing each individual point. As to the form and shape of a
                    hunter’s head, as we do not ride upon it, it is not of much consequence,
                    provided it be well hung on, and that is of the very highest importance, not
                    only, as we have shewn in the race-horse, on account of his respiration or wind,
                    but unless it be so, he cannot be pleasant to ride. Not only must his jaw s be
                    wdde, but when we consider that the head of a horse hangs in a slanting position
                    from the extremity of the neck, and that the neck itself projects a considerable
                    distance from the chest, on the muscular strength and proper formation of the
                    neck must also depend whether a horse be light or heavy in hand, and
                    consequently pleasant or unpleasant to ride. A weak or loose neck may not be so
                    material, as we have before observed, to the race-horse; he is generally ridden
                    in a martingal, and in that case always; add to which, his race is soon run.
                    Nevertheless, we like to see the neck of the race-horse rise out of the shoulder
                    with a tapering curve, in which case he is pleasant to ride in his gallop, and,
                    if a hard puller, his jockey has much more pow er over him than if his neck werc
                    loose and low. But, in a hunter, the proper position of his head is a <hi
                    rend="italic">point of the greatest moment,</hi> as without it his rider cannot
                    handle him properly <pb break="no" facs="nls:193646674"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0711-6674-0583"/>at his fences; and if he be not a regular
                    star-gazer, he is always dangerous to ride over a country. The proper junction
                    of the head with the neck, and the carrying of it well or ill, depend chiefly on
                    two particular muscles contained in the neck. The most important of these is
                    called the splenius muscle, which constitutes the principal bulk of the neck
                    above, and its action is sufficiently evident, namely, very powerfully to
                    elevate the head and neck. 'The principal beauty of the neck, indeed, as well as
                    the carriage of the head, depends on this muscle; and its ample developement is
                    a point the sportsman should attend to in the choice of horses that are to carry
                    him with hounds. A certain degree of muscularity of the neck is absolutely
                    necessary in a hunter, and it is greatly promoted by good keep in colthood; also
                    by delaying the period of castration till the second year, which should
                    invariably be done, when the want of this muscularity is apparent in the first.
                    It must, however, be observed, that there is a medium in this muscularity of the
                    neck, although excess is the better extreme of the two; for when the neck of a
                    horse appears, like that of a sheep, to rise out of the chest, and so far from
                    being arched above, and straight below, is hollowed above, and projects below,
                    such a horse is nearly worthless for any pleasurable purpose, as his head
                    cannot, by any means whatever, be got into a proper place.</p>
                <p>It has been said, that a horse with a long neck will bear heavy on the hand. We
                    do not believe that either the length of the neck, or even the bulk of the head,
                    has any influence in causing this. They are both counterbalanced by the power of
                    the ligament of the neck. The <hi rend="italic">setting on</hi> of the head is
                    most of all connected with heavy bearing on the hand; and a short-necked horse
                    will bear heavily, because, from the thickness of the lower part of the neck
                    consequent on its shortness, the head cannot be rightly placed. The head and
                    neck, however, should be proportioned to each other. A short head on a long
                    neck, or a long head on a short neck, would equally offend the eye.</p>
                <p>Although length of neck in a hunter is not desirable, length of shoulder is
                    indispensable. Horses have raced well with short upright shoulders; but it is
                    impossible that one so formed, however good he may be in his nature, or even in
                    his general action, can be a safe hunter, and for this reason: A hunter is
                    constantly subject, by down-hill leaps, leaping into soft ground, and getting
                    his fore-legs into grips, or unsound ground, to have the centre of gravity
                    thrown forward beyond the base of his legs; and it is more or less recoverable
                    according to the length or shortness of his shoulder. By length of shoulder is
                    meant obliquity of the scapula, or shoulder-bone, by which the point of the
                    shoulder is projected forward, and which, added to the obliquity of the scapula,
                    enables the rider to sit considerably behind, instead of nearly over the
                    fore-legs, or pillars of support, which, on a short and upright-shouldered
                    horse, he must do. One remark, however, must be made respecting the oblique
                    shoulder. It is sometimes not sufficiently supplied with muscle, with which the
                    upright shoulder generally abounds. We therefore recommend purchasers of young
                    horses for hunters, to give the preference to what may <hi rend="italic"
                    >appear</hi> coarse shoulders, nay, even inclined to be somewhat round, or flat
                    on the withers, provided they are accompanied by the necessary and absolutely
                    essential obliquity of the shoulder-bones.</p>
                <p>The setting on of the arm, which should be strong, muscular, and long, is of much
                    importance to a hunter. By the length of this part in the hare, as we have
                    already observed, added to the obliquity of her shoulder, she can extend her
                    fore-parts further than any animal of her size: in fact she strikes nearly as
                    far as the greyhound that pursues her, by the help of this lever. The proper
                    position of the arm, however, is the result of an oblique shoulder.</p>
                <p>When issuing out of an upright shoulder, the elbow joint, the centre of motion
                    here, will be inclined inward; the horse will be what is termed “pinn’d in his
                    elbows,” which causes his legs to fall powerless behind his body; and he is
                    seldom able to go well in deep ground. There are exceptions, but they are rare.
                    A full and swelling fore-arm is one of the most valuable points in a horse, for
                    whatsoever purposes he may be required; and although we have occasionally seen
                    hunters with light thighs carry weight well, we never have seen it so carried by
                    horses deficient in their arms.</p>
                <p>If sportsmen w ere to see the knee of the horse dissected, they would pay more
                    attention to the form and substance of it than they generally do. It is a very
                    complicated joint, but so beautifully constructed that it is seldom subject to
                    internal injury. Its width and breadth, however, when considerable, are great
                    recommendations to hunters, as admitting space for the attachment of muscles,
                    and for the accumulation of ligamentous expansions and bands, greatly conducive
                    to strength. Below the knee is a point on which we will not say much here, as we
                    have already alluded to it in our remarks on the race-horse. We mean the shank,
                    or cannon bone, and its appendages. It can scarcely be too short in a horse that
                    has to carry a heavy man; round legs are almost sure to fail; those of the
                    hunter should be flat, with the back sinews strong and well braced. This
                    constitutes what sportsmen call a “wiry leg.”</p>
                <p>The fetlock is also a complicated joint, and very liable to injury. In a hunter
                    it should be large and strong. But as regards his action, the pastern is still
                    more material, and also to his standing sound. Very few horses with short
                    pasterns can go well in deep ground, and for this obvious reason: The action of
                    the joint is destroyed by getting below the surface of the ground, and is of
                    course sooner immersed than when it is longer. But a greater evil than this
                    attends a short pastern. It is the predisposing cause of navicular lameness,
                    particularly in horses carrying weight, owing to the foot being deprived of that
                    elasticity which a longer pastern affords, and which consequently relieves the
                    concussion on the foot coming to the ground in gallopping and leaping, as well
                    as on the hard road. Horses with short and, consequently, upright pasterns
                    cannot be pleasant to ride, and they seldom stand many seasons’ work. Excess in
                    either should be avoided, but of the two, a hunter is less objectionable, from
                    the extreme of length, than of shortness, in this most material part.</p>
                <p>That the foot of the hunter should be wide, is also obvious to the meanest
                    capacity, independent of its being the form most conducive to health. The nature
                    of the ground he has to travel over requires at times the widest base he can
                    present to it, as a foundation for his great bulk, and thus the farmer carries
                    out his manure upon tender land, in a broad and not a narrow w heel cart.
                    Xenophon relates, that certain people of Asia were accustomed, when snow lay
                    deep on the ground, to draw socks over the feet of their horses, to prevent them
                    sinking in it up to their bellies; and we knowwhy an ox sinks less in soft
                    ground than a horse does. It is because his foot enters it expanded, by means of
                    the division of the claws, and when he draws it out it is contracted. The foot
                    of the hunter, however, should not be too wide, or it may operate against his
                    speed.</p>
                <p>The position of the fore-legs of the hunter admits of more latitude than that of
                    his hinder ones, or indeed of any other part of his frame. We have seen
                    brilliant hunters standing in all positions and postures as regards their
                    forelegs. Some very much over the knees, that is, with the knees bent and
                    projecting outward; many upon very twisted fetlocks, turning the toes out; and a
                    few, though only a few, turning the toes in. In the human frame, a certain
                    squareness in the position of the feet is consistent with strength, as we see in
                    the statues of Hercules, but the <pb break="no" facs="nls:193646687"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0711-6687-0584"/>lightness of a Mercury is indicated by the
                    direction of the toe outwards. This is to a certain extent the case with the
                    horse. Although, if measured by the standard of perfection, his toe is required
                    to be in a direct line with the point of his shoulder, yet we have seen and
                    heard of some of the speediest and best racers and hunters, the position of
                    whose fore-feet have deviated considerably from this supposed essential line;
                    but the inclination of the toe outwards is so common in horses used for these
                    purposes, that it can scarcely be called a fault. Indeed, some persons argue,
                    that a leg so placed affords a broader base to the superincumbent weight, than
                    when quite in a line with the shoulder, that is, provided the twist arises from
                    the fetlock, and not from the setting on of the arm. Be this as it may, we are
                    well assured that, provided the hinder legs and quarters are good, a hunter will
                    admit of a considerable deviation from the true line in the fore-legs, and carry
                    his rider brilliantly; It is well known, that a much more twisted fore-legged
                    horse could not well be seen, than the celebrated Clipper, the property of the
                    equally celebrated Mr Lindow, for many years said to be the most brilliant
                    hunter in Leicestershire.</p>
                <p>But there is one portion of the fote-quarters of the hunter to which a rule must
                    be applied, that will not admit of an exception. He must be deep in his chest or
                    brisket, that is, from the top of the withers to the elbow. Numerous are the
                    narrow, but deep horses, in their “girth,” as the term is, that have carried
                    heavy weights in the first style with hounds; but no matter how wide a horse may
                    be, if he have not depth, he cannot carry weight, and is very seldom a
                    good-winded horse, even under a light man. One of the greatest compliments,
                    then, that can be paid to a hunter, at first sight, is, that he appears two
                    inches lower than he really is. Such, however, is the case with horses whose
                    growth has been forced in their bodies by good keep when young, and thus they
                    come under the denomination of “short-legged horses,” so much esteemed by hard
                    riders. They are likewise, for the most part, better leapers than such as have
                    less growth in the body, and stand upon longer legs.</p>
                <p>We have before observed, when speaking of the racehorse, that large bone is not
                    required in his cannon or shank (the part from knee to fetlock), neither is it
                    in the hunter. The real power of all animals is in the muscles, sinews, and
                    tendons; and the leg best calculated to carry weight and endure to a good old
                    age, is that in which the bone is small, but of a dense and perfect texture, and
                    in which three convexities can be very plainly distinguished, namely, the bone;
                    the elastic ligament behind the bone, called the sinew; and, behind that, <hi
                    rend="italic">theflexor tendons, large, round, and strong.</hi> The rare
                    combination of strength, with lightness, is here beautifully displayed, and is
                    one of the many instances which might be produced, to show how Nature delights
                    to work with the least possible expense of materials.</p>
                <p>The hunter should have length in his shoulders and quarters, and, to a certain
                    extent, also in his back. It is true that horses with short backs carry weight
                    best up a steep hill, which, as that is the worst method in which this animal
                    can employ his strength (in man it is the best), shows that heavy men should
                    ride short-backed horses. For hunters, however, that are ridden in our best
                    hunting countries, which, previously to being laid down in grass, were thrown up
                    by the plough into high ridges, with deep furrows, must have <hi rend="italic"
                    >moderate</hi> length of back, or they cannot go smoothly over such ground. Good
                    loins, with width of haunch (the <hi rend="italic">vis a tergo</hi> being so
                    necessary in leaping, as well as gallopping on soft ground), need scarcely be
                    insisted upon; and we now proceed to the hinder-legs, the proper or improper
                    form of which makes the difference between a good or bad hunter, if a horse with
                    badly formed hinder-legs can be called a hunter at all. But a horse with short,
                    straight, and weak thighs, cannot make a <hi rend="italic">good</hi> hunter.
                    Even admitting that they are not weak, but short and straight, yet the objection
                    remains, because he cannot, in the latter case, be pulled together in his
                    gallop, nor have his stride collected to enable him to take his fences properly;
                    and, what is not generally known, he is almost certain to be a hard puller.
                    Indeed, some good judges go so far as to assert, that horses with straight
                    hinder legs, never have good mouths, and there is much truth in the remark, as
                    their form will not admit of theit’ being “pulled together,” as the horseman’s
                    term is, in their quick paces, and without it no horse is safe. A long and
                    muscular thigh, then, with a clean well-placed hock, is one of the most material
                    points in a hunter, and also one by which the duration of his services may very
                    nearly be measured; as when much out of the true form, either inclining inwards,
                    like the cow, or outwards, like the bandy-legged man, disease is almost certain
                    to attack this very complicated but beautifully contrived joint, when put to
                    severe exertion, especially in soft ground. The sĥank-bone of the hinder leg,
                    below the hock, ought to be equally well supported by sinews and tendons with
                    that of the fore-leg; and the pastern of the hind-leg should resemble that of
                    the foreleg, moderately long, strong, and oblique.</p>
                <p>But such is the paramount importance of the hock in the hunter, that we
                    transcribe the following admirable description of one most material point in it,
                    (from Part IX. of “The Horse,” Farmer’s Series, p. 272.) “The most powerful of
                    the flexor or bending muscles are inserted into the point of the hock, or the
                    extremity of the os calcis; and in proportion to the projection of the hock, or,
                    in other words, the length of this bone, will two purposes be effected. The line
                    of direction will be more advantageous, for it will be nearer to a
                    perpendicular; and the arm of the lever to which the power is applied will be
                    lengthened, and mechanical advantage will be gained to an almost incredible
                    extent. Suppose this bone of the hock to be three inches in length, the joint
                    formed by the tibia and the astragalus is evidently the centre of motion, and
                    the weight concentrated about the middle of the shank is the obstacle to be
                    overcome. If the weight be four times as far from the centre of motion as the
                    power, a force equal to four times the weight would raise it. It is, however,
                    here to be remembered, that it is not merely the weight of the leg which is to
                    be raised, but the weight of the horse, for the time resting upon the leg, and
                    that weight to be propelled or driven forward. At what shall we calculate this?
                    We may fairly suppose that the muscles, whose tendons arc inserted into the
                    point of the hock, exert an energy equal to 4000 lb. Let us further suppose,
                    that an inch is added to the point of the hock, which will be an addition of
                    one-third to its length: a muscular power of less than 3000 lb., will now effect
                    the same purpose. The slightest lengthening, therefore, of the point of the hock
                    will make an exceedingly great difference in the muscular energy by which the
                    joint is moved, and a difference that will wonderfully tell in a long day’s
                    work. On this account, the depth of the hock, or the length of the bone of which
                    we arc speaking, is a point of the greatest importance. There is, however, a
                    limit to this. In proportion to the length of this bone, must be the space which
                    it passes over, in order sufficiently to bend the limb; and in that proportion
                    must be the contraction of the muscle, and consequently the length of the
                    muscle, that it may be enabled thus to contract; and, therefore, if this bone
                    were inordinately lengthened, there would require a depth of quarter which would
                    amount to deformity. A hock of this advantageous length is, however, rarely or
                    never met with, and it is received among the golden rules in judging of the
                    horse, that this bone of the hock cannot be too long.”</p>
                <p>Hunters which carry very heavy men cannot excel in <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193646700" xml:id="kp-eb0711-6700-0585"/>the field, unless they
                    exhibit those just proportions in their limbs, and all the moving levers,
                    necessary to produce full liberty of action, but not too long a stride. Well
                    placed hinder legs, with wide hips, well spread gaskins, and great depth of
                    chest, are essentials, and as much of the <hi rend="italic">vis a tergo,</hi> as
                    is consistent with a not unsightly back, commonly called “hog-backed.” Well knit
                    joints, short cannon bone, moderately oblique pasterns, with rather large feet,
                    are not only points from which great physical powers may be expected, but they
                    are necessary to the duration of them in the horse we are now alluding to. As,
                    however, it is an axiom in the animal creation, that the parts which add to
                    strength diminish swiftness, hunters to carry more than sixteen stones well with
                    hounds, at the pace they now run, are always difficult to be procured, and ought
                    to command good prices. The stamp of animal most approved of for this purpose,
                    is the short-legged, thick, but well-bred horse, not exceeding sixteen hands in
                    height, but appearing, to the eye, half a hand below that standard. As for his
                    general appearance, it is “handsome is, that handsome does,” in this case; and
                    we must not look for beauty in all his points.</p>
                <p>Having now described each individual external part of the horse essential to his
                    being a good hunter, we shall, in a few words, exhibit him to the reader’s view
                    in what we consider his best form. He should have a light head, well put on,
                    with a firm, but not a long neck; lengthy, and consequently oblique, shoulders,
                    with very capacious chest, and great depth of girth; a long, muscular fore-arm,
                    coming well out of the shoulder, the elbow parallel with the body, neither
                    inclining inward nor outward; a short cannon or shank, with large tendons and
                    sinews, forming a flat, not round leg; an oblique pattern, rather long than
                    short, and an open circular foot; the back of moderate length, with well
                    developed loins and fillets, and deep ribs, making what is termed by sportsmen a
                    good “spur-place.” From the loins to the setting on of the tail, the line should
                    be carried on almost straight, or rounded only in a very slight degree. Thus the
                    haunch will be most oblique, and will produce a corresponding obliquity in the
                    thigh-bone, which formation is peculiarly characteristic of the well bred horse.
                    The dock of the tail should be large, the buttocks close together, and the
                    fundament small, and somewhat resembling the front or eye of the pippin apple.
                    The thighs should be muscular and long, rather inclining inwards, with large
                    lean hocks, the points appearing to stand somewhat hehind the body, which will
                    bring the lower part of the hind-leg, or shank, under it. The shank, fetlock,
                    and pastern of the hinder-leg, should exactly resemble those of the fore-leg, as
                    also should the foot. The legs should appear short, from the great depth of
                    chest, and well-proportioned substance of the body, or middle-piece.</p>
                <p>The stature of the horse is no more absolutely fixed than that of the human body,
                    but a medium height is considered as best for a hunter, say fifteen hands, two
                    or three inches. For one good horse over this height, there are a hundred under
                    it. In fact, there are, in the operations of nature as well as of art, limits
                    which they cannot surpass in magnitude, and it is known that no very large
                    animal has strength in proportion to its size. That the horse has not, the pony
                    affords proof, if any other were wanting. Even the heaviest weights find horses
                    about the height we have fixed upon best calculated to carry them. There have
                    been many extraordinary instances of horses, little more than fourteen hands
                    high, being equal to the speed of hounds over the strongest counties in England,
                    for example, Mr William Coke’s “Pony,” as he was called, many years celebrated
                    in Liecestershire; but they are not pleasant to ride, by reason of the fences,
                    when high, appearing higher to the rider than when he is mounted on a taller
                    horse.</p>
                <p>Temper and mouth are essential points in a hunter. The former adds much to his
                    value, not only as it contributes to the pleasure and safety of his rider, but a
                    horse of a placid temper saves himself much in a long day’s work with hounds,
                    and especially when there is much leaping. Indeed, fretful horses are
                    proverbially soft, and not generally to be depended upon at a pinch, which
                    caused Shakspeare to make them the symbol of false friends. Thus Julius Caesar
                    exclaims,</p>
                <p>“Hollow men, like horses, not at hand, Make gallant show, and <hi rend="italic"
                    >promise of</hi> their mettle; But when they should endure the bloody spur, They
                    fall their crest, and, like deceitful jades, Sink in the trial.”</p>
                <p>A hunter should have courage, but nothing more, to make him what he is required
                    to be, namely, not afraid to leap at any fence his rider thinks proper to put
                    him at. His mouth will depend upon two things; first, upon the judgment of the
                    person who breaks him in, in his colthood, and, secondly, upon the position of
                    his hinder legs, but chiefly upon the first. It ought to be endowed with so
                    great sensibility, that the slightest motion of the bit should give him warning,
                    and direct his course, which is significantly implied by Horace, when he said,
                    “the ear of a horse lies in his bridle.” It is true, that what we call the
                    “mouth” of a horse, is an artificial feature, at all events, a figurative term
                    for his being easily acted upon by the bridle; but it is a point of the utmost
                    importance in a hunter. Without it, in short, he is absolutely dangerous to
                    ride; for although the skill and power of his rider may prevent his running
                    away, yet he is always in danger of being placed in some unpleasant situation or
                    other by him. In the first place, he cannot be a large fencer, nor safe at all
                    sorts of leaps, if he will not suffer his rider to pull him together, to collect
                    him for the effort of rising at them. Secondly, he is as dangerous in going
                    through gates, only partly opened. Thirdly, if the horse immediately before him
                    should fall at a leap, he is very apt to leap upon him, or his rider; and,
                    lastly, his strength is sooner exhausted than that of a horse, perhaps not
                    naturally so good, which is going quietly, and within himself, by his side.</p>
                <p>No doubt many of the ancient writers were good judges of horses, although they
                    were deficient, compared with the moderns, in availing themselves of their
                    highest capabilities. Were a purchaser of a hunter to look no further than the
                    first chapter of Xenophon wες&lt; ⅛jr.χηj, he would find hints that would be
                    well worthy his attention; and nothing can be more expressive of the evils
                    attending a bad mouth, in a horse of this description, than the following
                    sentence from Pliny, “Equi sine fraenis deformis ipse cursus, rigida cervice, et
                    extento capite, currentium,” which may be thus translated: The career of a horse
                    without a bridle is disagreeable, carrying his neck stiff, and his nose in the
                    air. When we consider how often it is necessary to pull up, or to turn a horse
                    very short in crossing enclosed countries, the value, even on the score of
                    comfort, of a good mouth cannot be too highly appreciated by the sportsman.</p>
                <p>We now come to the action of the hunter, which, after all, is the main
                    consideration. He should have energy in all his paces, but he may have too much
                    of what is generally called action. Nothing conveys to us a better idea of that
                    which is adapted to his business, than the concluding sentence of a huntsman of
                    former days, when describing to his master a capital run with his hounds. “The
                    old mare,” said he, “<hi rend="italic">carried me like oil.”</hi> The action of
                    the hunter should be <hi rend="italic">smooth,</hi> or it will not last. His
                    stride in his gallop should be rather long than otherwise, provided he brings
                    his hinder legs well under his body; and the movement of the fore-legs should be
                    round, but by no means high. Above all things, there should be no “<hi
                    rend="italic">dwel~</hi><pb break="no" facs="nls:193646713"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0711-6713-0586"/><hi rend="italic">ling”</hi> as it is called, in
                    the limb coming to the ground; a great obstacle to speed, but often the
                    accompaniment of excessive action in the fore-legs. But the test of action in
                    the hunter, is in what sportsmen call “dirt,” that is, in soft, tender ground,
                    or when passing over such as appears dry on the surface, but is not sufficiently
                    so to bear his weight. It is not exactly in the power of the best judges to
                    determine whence this peculiar excellence, which some horses possess over others
                    apparently well-proportioned, arises, for which reason the eye should never be
                    depended upon in the selection of horses for the field. Wisdom here can only be
                    the produce of experience; and many sportsmen have paid dear for it on this
                    particular point. In fact, nothing next to ascending steep hills under great
                    weight, puts the physical powers of a horse to so severe a test as carrying a
                    heavy man, at a quick rate, over a country that sinks under him at every step.
                    Mere strength alone will not do it. It must be the result of a combination of
                    strength with agility, good wind, and speed, to produce which, the most perfect
                    arrangement of the acting parts, although the exact symmetry and proportion of
                    them may not be exactly discernible to the eye, are requisite, and, we may be
                    assured, are present. As the beauty of all forms is, in great part, subordinate
                    to their utility, a horse of this description, that is, one which can carry
                    sixteen stones well up to hounds in any or in all countries, at the rate they
                    now run, not only, as has before been observed, commands a very high price, but,
                    to a person who loves to study nature, presents a feast to the eye.</p>
                <p>A hunter should be what is called very quick as well as very fast; by which is
                    implied, that he should not only have great speed, but that he should be very
                    quick in regaining his speed after taking his leap, or being pulled up from any
                    other cause. One so gifted will cross a country, especially a close one, in less
                    time than one that is more speedy, but not so “quick on his legs,” as Jockies
                    term it. It is also very agreeable that a hunter should be safe in his slow
                    paces on the road; and, if a fast trotter, he relieves himself by changing the
                    action of the muscles, when the pace of hounds so far abates as to allow him to
                    break into a trot.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Leaping.</hi></p>
                <p>One of the greatest accomplishments in a hunter is being a perfect and safe
                    leaper. The situation of a sportsman riding a horse that is “uncertain,” as the
                    term is, at his fences, may be compared with that of the philosopher which
                    Cicero describes in his Tusculan Questions, (5. c. 21), as seated on the throne
                    of Dionysius, gazing upon the wealth and splendour that surrounded him, with a
                    naked sword suspended over his head by a single thread. But a horse following
                    hounds often leaps under very great disadvantages, which accounts for the
                    numerous falls sportsmen get. Putting aside the labour of rising from the
                    ground, which, to the horse, with a weight on his back, must be great, from the
                    earth’s attraction and the body’s gravity, he has often to take his spring
                    without any fixed point for support; whereas, in most other cases, leaping takes
                    place on a fixed surface, which possesses the power of resistance in consequence
                    of its firmness. Nevertheless, although the surface yield to a certain degree,
                    leaping can still be performed, notwithstanding the retrograde motion of the
                    surface produces a great diminution in the velocity of the leap, compared with
                    that which is made from firm ground; and the velocity is always greater in
                    proportion as the resistance is perfect Thus it is, that we find horses able to
                    cover much greater obstacles in Leicestershire, and the other grass countries,
                    where the taking off for the leap is generally good and sound, than they can
                    cover in ploughed and marshy districts, where they have not that advantage, from
                    the less firm state of the soil. We shall now endeavour to point out the form
                    most likely to constitute a good leaper.</p>
                <p>The very worm that crawls on the ground first carries its contraction from the
                    hinder parts, in order to throw its fore parts forward; and it is chiefly from
                    the <hi rend="italic">vis a tergo,</hi> or strength of back, and hinder
                    quarters, that the power of leaping in a horse is derived. It must, however, be
                    admitted that oblique shoulders give him a great advantage, by enabling him to
                    extend his fore quarters; but if his loins be loose and weak, and his hinder
                    legs ill placed, with weak hocks, he cannot make, in any one’s hands, a safe and
                    perfect leaper. But the position of his head has something to do with it. A
                    plank placed in equilibrio cannot rise at one end unless it sinks at the other;
                    and although a horse in light harness cannot, for appearance’ sake, carry his
                    head too high, provided he be obedient to the rein, the hunter should carry his
                    low. A colt, running wild, never raises his head when he leaps, but rather
                    lowers it, and so should the hunter; and he is always less liable to fall in
                    gallopping over a country when he carries his head low; likewise, in horses with
                    lengthy shoulders, the seat of the rider is rather benefited than injured by
                    it.</p>
                <p>The sort of fence that stops hunters more than any other description of obstacle,
                    is a wide brook; and, like all other wide places, it takes a good deal out of
                    him, if he clears it. Lengthy horses are the best brook jumpers; but they
                    require good loins and hinder quarters as well, and, above all things, <hi
                    rend="italic">courage.</hi> Unless a horse takes a wide brook in his stroke, he
                    is almost sure to be in it; for which reason he is generally ridde <hi
                    rend="superscript"> l</hi> n fast at it, and, for the most part, not allowed to
                    see it till he comes close to it. Immense space has been covered by horses when
                    jumping brooks, particularly when there has been a difference of elevation of
                    the banks in favour of the horse. We have heard of thirty feet and upwards from
                    hind foot to hind foot; but half that space <hi rend="italic">in water</hi> is
                    considered a good brook, and even if the banks are sound, stops a great part of
                    the field. When unsound, it requires a horse, coming under the denomination of a
                    “good brook-jumper,” to clear it without a fall, and particularly, if towards
                    the end of a run.</p>
                <p>To be a good timber leaper is a great desideratum in a hunter, although many
                    horses are great timber leapers, but, from their form, can never make good
                    hunters. It only requires a short backed, truss-horse for this purpose; and he
                    can dispense with the general length so necessary to the complete hunter. Good
                    and well-formed thighs, however, are necessary. For those hunting countries,
                    such as Cheshire, where the hedge is generally placed on a bank or “cop,” as it
                    is there styled, rather a short but very active horse performs best. But he must
                    be very good in his hinder legs, and very*quick in the use of them. Wall jumpers
                    come within the same class with timber jumpers as to make and shape.</p>
                <p>There is one faculty in which the horse is wanting, that would, if he possessed
                    it, give him a great advantage in leaping. In the human species, the power and
                    influence of feeling are inherent, in a great degree, to the very tips of the
                    fingers; but the horse has no proper organ of feeling or touch. When a man takes
                    his spring for a leap, or leaps on the top of any substance, he has a distinct
                    and certain sense or knowledge of the nature of the ground from which he has
                    sprung, and of the substance on which he has alighted; but, from the insensible
                    nature of the horse’s hoof, such feeling is, in a great measure, denied to him,
                    and indispensably so too. Still, however, there are a few instances upon record
                    of horses going very well over a country even after having undergone the
                    operation of neurotomy, by which all sensibility, from the fetlock downwards,
                    has been destroyed.</p>
                <p>Looking at the pace of hounds, and the manner of riding after them, which have so
                    materially changed within the last <pb break="no" facs="nls:193646726"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0711-6726-0587"/>half century, it is insisted upon by some that the
                    hunter of the present day ought to be of full blood. Reasoning from analogy
                    indeed, between the powers and capabilities of one and another, we are decidedly
                    in favour of that breed which has the greatest share of strength within the
                    smallest compass, and such is decidedly the character of the thorough-bred
                    horse. Independently of this, the thoroughbred horse, when perfect, and with
                    substance, is peculiarly fitted for what a hunter is called upon to perform; and
                    those persons who assert to the contrary, can only do so in ignorance of the
                    nature of his constituent parts. lie has more depth and declivity in the
                    shoulders than the lower bred horse has, and is consequently clearer in his
                    wind. By these means, he can better extend and elevate his fore feet in going
                    over rough ground, and at his leaps; and, by the curve or circular figure he
                    makes with his hinder legs, he stands more secure on all kinds of ground, and,
                    above all things, he bears being pressed better than any other description of
                    horse; for, although blown, he soon recovers his wind. Having said this, it may
                    scarcely be necessary to add, that several of our first-rate sportsmen of the
                    present day will not ride any thing that is not of full blood; and such
                    description of horse, when perfect in his work, as well as in his form, commands
                    the highest price.</p>
                <p>Nevertheless, the <hi rend="italic">necessity</hi> for the thorough-bred horse in
                    the field is belied, by the experience of all unprejudiced sportsmen, and even
                    in Leicestershire, where the best studs are to be found, not a twentieth part of
                    the hunters are of that description. But this perhaps arises from three causes.
                    First, there is a difficulty in procuring full-bred horses to carry even
                    moderate weights, and speed is but a second attribute to a hunter. He must have
                    sundry other qualifications, and the mc⅛t prevailing objections to the
                    thorough-bred horse are generally these: He is apt to be deficient in substance
                    to carry high weights over rough and deep countries, without trespassing too
                    much on the virtue of his high descent. Secondly, he is inclined, and especially
                    if he have been trained, to be shy of facing rough and thorny fences, by reason
                    of the delicate nature of his skin, rendered so by repeated sweats in clothes,
                    when in training. It often happens, indeed, that even the cheering influence of
                    hounds, which has so much effect on other horses, will not induce him to take
                    them. In faet, which may appear extraordinary, he does not appear to have in the
                    field the courage of the half-bred horse. Lastly, his feet are apt to be small,
                    in which case he sinks deeper in soft ground than does the lower-bred horse,
                    whose feet are larger and wider, and thus suffers more than the latter does, in
                    crossing a deep country. As for his powers of endurance under equal sufferings,
                    they doubtless would exceed those of the eocktail, and being, by his nature what
                    is termed a “better doer” in the stable, he is sooner at his work again than the
                    other. Indeed, there is scarcely a limit to the work of full-bred hunters of
                    good frame and constitution and temper.</p>
                <p>A sportsman, partial to thorough-bred hunters, should either breed them, or
                    purchase them, not exceeding two years old. If he breeds them, he should select
                    large and bony mares, putting them to horses who have hunting action, such as
                    Tramp had, and several more we could name; and, if he buy them, it will be his
                    fault if he do not buy those of the right stamp. From their never having been
                    trained, but ridden over rough ground in their colthood, they would have freer
                    and higher action, and, when eastrated at a proper age, would very rarely fail
                    making first-rate hunters. But it may be asked, why subject them to the
                    enervating operation of eastration, which, as Perceval says, stamps their form
                    and character with the seal of imbecility and pusillanimousness? Our answer here
                    is, that we would not do it, if experience did not shew that by far the greater
                    jiumber of entire horses, used as hunters, are either dangerous in a crowd, and
                    when pressed upon in gateways; or given to refuse their fences, when they feel
                    themselves somewhat distressed; and, if once well tired, are not to be depended
                    upon afterwards. When free from these defects, they are doubtless superior to
                    either geldings or mares.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Purchase of a Hunter.</hi></p>
                <p>Although it may not be necessary that a person should be perfeetly acquainted
                    with the mechanical structure of the horse’s frame, according to the laws of
                    nature, to render him a good judge of a hunter, yet, fortunately for such as
                    have them to sell, vast numbers of persons purchase hunters from very slight
                    experience of them, regardless of the proverb of, “he hath a good judgment who
                    doth not rely on his own.” There is also another proverb, prevalent, we believe,
                    in Spain, which well applies here :—“He that would buy a mule without a fault
                    must not buy one at all and, although faultless hunters may be as rare as
                    faultless riders of them, we will offer a few hints to a person in the act of
                    purchasing one, addressing him in the colloquial style.</p>
                <p>First, bear in mind the country you are about to hunt in, whether flat, hilly,
                    firm, soft, open, or enclosed, and refer to the remarks we have made on the sort
                    of horse we have adapted to each; only be assured that in an open country,
                    especially if a hilly one, nothing has a chance with a thoroughbred horse, in
                    good form, and not over-weighted. Secondly, consider well your weight, and be
                    sure to have at least a stone to spare. A light man on a light horse throws away
                    all the advantage of being light, and can go no faster, or leap larger fences,
                    than a heavy man on a strong horse, <hi rend="italic">for strength will be
                    served.</hi> Until you try him, it is hard to say what horse will make a hunter,
                    but the following indices may induce you to try him: If he appear well-bred,
                    with a loose, bright skin, which may be called his complexion; observe that liis
                    hair does not stand hollow from the skin, particularly about the poll of his
                    neck. If you find him standing over a good deal of ground, it is a sure sign
                    that he has got length where it ought to be; not in the back, but from the
                    obliquity of his shoulders, and the arm being set on at the extreme point of his
                    shoulder, which so much contributes to the act of extension of the fore parts in
                    gallopping, leaping, and clearing grips. Next examine minutely his thighs and
                    hoeks, being especially careful to observe the position of the point of the hock
                    bone. Above all things, avoid a short, or an overtopped horse. The former will
                    never carry you to your satisfaction, however good he may be in his nature; and
                    the latter, from being too heavy for his legs, will seldom last many years. As
                    for the minor points, common observation alone is wanting. Have his head placed
                    in such a situation as will enable you to satisfy yourself that he has perfectly
                    organized eyes, free from incipient cataraet, sometimes rather difficult to be
                    detected; and as for his age, there are but two ways of satisfying yourself on
                    that point. By his teeth till about eight years old; afterwards by the state of
                    his legs, which are, in fact, the best test of his value, the best proof of what
                    he has done, and the sure source of speculation as to what he may hereafter be
                    expected to do. Observe, also, his joints, that no material injury has been done
                    to them by blow, &amp;c., and that they are strong.</p>
                <p>But the purchaser of a hunter must not trust to his eye. Neither must he be
                    satisfied with him, how well soever he may gallop with him upon <hi
                    rend="italic">sound</hi> land. It is the peculiar excellence of “going well
                    through dirt” that renders a horse valuable for all our best hunting countries;
                    and no man can assure himself that a horse has this peculiar excellence, until
                    he puts him to the test. The best method of doing it is this: The rider should
                    put him along at a <pb break="no" facs="nls:193646739"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0711-6739-0588"/>good pace, with a slack rein, upon sound ground,
                    letting him find himself all at once upon that which is soft and holding. If, on
                    quitting the former, he cringes more than might be expected under the weight,
                    and shortens his stroke much, he must not purchase him for a hunter. He may go
                    well over a light, down country, but he will never distinguish himself over a
                    heavy one, as he will be going in distress, when other horses are going
                    comparatively at their ease. Horses possess gradations of excellence in this
                    natural qualification, or gift, more than in any other, but in it consists the
                    <hi rend="italic">summum</hi><hi rend="italic">bonum</hi> in a hunter; inasmuch
                    as, whatever may be his other good qualities, they are all useless, when the
                    acting parts are, from this cause, deep ground, easily over-fatigued. With
                    regard to his wind, he must not judge hastily of that, in a horse not in work.
                    Should he not perceive any thing like whistling in his respiration, when he puts
                    him along at a quick pace, and his chest is capacious and deep, and his head
                    well set on, he is not to reject him, in case he appears blown by a short
                    gallop. Condition and work will rectify that; but many a good hunter has been
                    rejected on this account, by persons not taking into consideration the state of
                    his bodily condition, in a trial of this nature.</p>
                <p>The price of the hunter varies with the times, and, no doubt, is as much
                    regulated by the price of wheat as the quartern loaf is. During the war prices,
                    the sum of a thousand guineas was occasionally given, and that of five hundred
                    guineas frequently. Half the last-mentioned sum now commands a first-rate
                    hunter. But first-rate horses, in all ages of the world, have ever produced
                    extravagant prices. It is recorded of Alexander the Great, that he gave four
                    Roman talents for Bucephalus, which approaches near to the Melton Mowbray
                    prices, and those, we may safely conclude, stand at the head of the list.</p>
                <p>THE HACKNEY.</p>
                <p>Under this term are comprised the following: The Cover Hack, the Park Hack, the
                    Lady’s Horse, the Roadster, the Cob, the Galloway, and the Pony.</p>
                <p>The difficulty of procuring really good hacks is admitted by all persons who have
                    kept them for the various purposes of either business or pleasure, and for the
                    following obvious reasons. First, very few people try to breed hackneys,
                    therefore, although we require them to be nearly perfect in shape and action
                    (and perfect they should be to be “really good hacks ”), they may be said to be
                    failures in the breeding stud after all. Secondly, by reason of their appearing
                    to be failures in their colthood, they are not forced into good shape, as more
                    promising young horses are, by high keep and care. Lastly, If a man has a really
                    good hack, he is unwilling to dispose of it at the price generally given for
                    such animals. But a question arises, What is a good hack? It cannot be answered
                    but with reference to another question, namely, What description of person is he
                    to carry? The horse that a sober citizen of London or Edinburgh would call a
                    perfect hackney to carry him to his country seat, would not be worth five
                    shillings to a Newmarket or a country jockey, or as a cover hack to a
                    Leicestershire or Warwickshire sportsman. We will commence, then, with the cover
                    hack, and describe the others in their turns.</p>
                <p>. The Cover Hack of the present day is very difficult to be procured, because he
                    must unite, with the good qualities of the roadster, the requisites and
                    accomplishments of the hunter. In fact, he must be a hunter in miniature; and,
                    after all, the form of the hunter is the best calculated for a roadster. He must
                    be fast in all his paces, able to gallop well on deep or soft ground, and equal
                    to carrying his rider over moderately-sized fences; .and if taught to leap
                    timber, standing, his value is proportionally increased. But, above all things,
                    he must go from twelve to fifteen miles in the hour, when wanted, without
                    showing any symptoms of distress; and he is too often unnecessarily called upon
                    to perform much more than this, by his owner delaying the period of his leaving
                    home in the morning, for the purpose of meeting hounds. It may also be observed,
                    that it is not every sportsman who keeps two cover hacks, although he may keep
                    six or eight hunters; and it often happens that the cover hack does more work
                    than any horse in the stable, although in justice it should be stated, that the
                    same care in the stable is now taken of him as of the best hunter in it.</p>
                <p>Unless to carry a great weight, the cover hack should be all but thorough-bred,
                    if he cannot be procured of quite full blood; with excellent legs and feet,
                    lengthy and elevated shoulders, and with a susceptibility of mouth that will not
                    only enable his rider to keep him well on his haunches, to guard against danger
                    when going fast on all sorts of roads, but as tending to lessen the fatigue of
                    riding him; and the strength of his rider should be reserved for his day’s
                    diversion after hounds. The chief pace of a cover hack should be the canter, and
                    his temper should not be overlooked, for if fractious, and a puller, he will add
                    much to the fatigue of a severe day’s sport. A horse of this description, nearly
                    fifteen hands high, young and sound, will command from sixty to a hundred
                    pounds. The other points essential to a good road hackney, which will be noticed
                    hereafter, apply equally to the cover hack.</p>
                <p>The Park Hack of the present day is the race-horse in miniature. To be quite <hi
                    rend="italic">à</hi><hi rend="italic">la mode,</hi> he should be thoroughbred,
                    with a very neat head, beautifully set on, and a switch tail; and so well bitted
                    as to be ridden with a slack rein. He should have much liberty in his walk,
                    which, and the canter, should be his chief paces. He must have great obliquity
                    of shoulder, with a corresponding true formation of hinder quarters, and above
                    all, the well-bent hinder legs; in which case, if the position of his fore-legs
                    enable him to put his feet down properly, which will be explained in describing
                    the general action of the hackney, he will be, if good tempered, and not given
                    to fret, the perfect park hack.</p>
                <p>The Lady’s Horse is, after all, the most difficult to obtain, because he ought to
                    approach very near to perfection. His paces, mouth, and temper, should each be
                    proportioned to the power and capability of his rider; and he should be proof
                    against alarm from either noises or sights, which otherwise might cause him to
                    run away. This description of horse should likewise be well bred, as in that
                    case his action will be easier, and his appearance and carriage more in
                    character with the generally elegant appearance of his rider. His pace should be
                    the canter; the trot causes an ungraceful movement in the person of a woman, to
                    enable her to rise to it; and if she do not rise to it, she is much shaken in
                    her scat. Neither is the form of the side-saddle fitted for the trot; and the
                    canter of a well-bitted horse is more safe, because his haunches are more under
                    him in that pace than they can be in the trot. A good, bold, walk, however, with
                    the head in proper place, is essential to a horse that has to a carry a woman;
                    and his action should be very true, that is, he should not “dish,” or throw his
                    legs outward, as the term is, in any of his paces, or he w ill cover the lower
                    garments of his rider with mud when the roads are wet and dirty. To provide
                    against the latter inconvenience, however, all horses intended for this purpose,
                    should not be much under fifteen hands and a half in height, which size
                    corresponds with the lengthened drapery of a lady’s riding costume. As a
                    preventive against accidents, ladies’ horses, however well broken and bitted,
                    should not be too highly fed; and, if at all above themselves, should be ridden
                    bγ a careful servant, with good use of his hands, <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193646752" xml:id="kp-eb0711-6752-0589"/>before ladies mount them. It
                    is, however, an acknowledged fact, that horses go more quietly under women than
                    they do under men, which is accounted for by the lightness of their hand, and
                    the backward position of the body, in the saddle. We have, in fact, known
                    several instances of horses being very hard pullers with men, standing up in
                    their stirrups, and, consequently, inclining their bodies forward, but going
                    perfectly temperate and at their ease under women.</p>
                <p>The power and parts conducive to action in the roadster, or hackney, are derived
                    much from the same shape and make as we have shewn to be best fitted for the
                    hunter; but it is desirable that he should be more up in his forehand than the
                    hunter is required to be, as such form gives confidence to the rider. <hi
                    rend="italic">The most dangerous</hi> form he can exhibit, if we may be allowed
                    such a term, is, with his forelegs standing too much behind the points of his
                    shoulders, <hi rend="italic">and those points loaded.</hi> Even with the
                    best-formed hinder legs, the centre of gravity being thrown so far forward
                    beyond the pillars of support, is, in this case, with great difficulty preserved
                    on the horse making a stumble; but with straight hinder legs, a horse so formed
                    in his forequarters is only fit for harness, where he can recover himself by the
                    assistance of his collar, having no weight on his back. Provided a hackney do
                    not cut his legs, by striking one against the other, which is oftener caused by
                    imperfection in the upper than the lower extremity of the legs, he is not to be
                    rejected because he may turn out his toes a little, some of the very best,
                    fastest, and safest road-horses being so formed. Cutting the hinder legs is a
                    worse failing than cutting the fore ones, as it is a certain sign of weakness;
                    and although we may be told that shoeing will prevent it, we bring to our
                    recollection the old adage, that “a goose always goes like a goose.” What is
                    called the “speedy cut” with the fore-legs, arises from excess of action, and is
                    a great objection, by reason of the wound given to the leg, which is struck just
                    under the knee. Many good hunters, especially when ridden in hilly countries,
                    such as parts of Surrey, where they traverse the hills on loose and stony
                    ground, are subject to this failing, which is remedied by a boot; and, after
                    all, the danger attributed to speedy cut, in throwing horses down, is much
                    overrated.</p>
                <p>The size for a road hackney must be regulated by the size of the person to ride
                    him; but, generally speaking, from fourteen hands to fourteen hands and a half,
                    is the proper height. His strength must also be thus calculated, for a light man
                    does not ride pleasantly on a horse equal to double his weight. But a road
                    hackney should have strength of shoulder, with a round barrel, but nota large
                    carcass, which only wears out his legs. His constitution and feeding can only be
                    proved upon trial; but there are certain indices, such as deep ribs, hardy
                    colour, brown muzzle, &amp;c. which very rarely deceive us. As to the necessity
                    of well-placed hinder legs, it is most clearly shewn by the answer given to the
                    following question: If a horse make a serious blunder forward, and the centre of
                    gravity of his body fall beyond the pillars of support, and is for a moment
                    lost, what restores the equilibrium? Is it merely the chuck under the chin to an
                    animal of his bulk and weight, and that “chuck” given perhaps by the weak,
                    powerless wrist of a feeble old man, or delicate young lady? No: the main effect
                    of the bit, or curb, in this case is, first, warning the horse of his danger;
                    and, next, by the momentary raising of his head, he is better able to bring a
                    hinder leg <hi rend="italic">instantly</hi> to his assistance, by advancing it
                    under his body, and thus restoring the equilibrium. In the walk, in fact, the
                    horse actually begins to move by advancing the hinder-leg under the body, before
                    the fore-leg quits the ground; and if he did not do so, there would be no equal
                    support for the body, during the suspension of the fore-leg in the air; nor
                    could the body be moved forwards, until the hinder leg had, by quitting its
                    station, taken a new point of support. Seeing then, that in the walk, as in all
                    other paces, the centre of gravity in the horse is maintained, as well as the
                    body propelled, by the action of the hinder legs, the greatest attention should
                    be paid to the position and action of them in the hackney, as the best safeguard
                    against his falling. We should observe, then, when he is exhibited to our view,
                    that, in his walk, the hinder foot oversteps the fore foot, at least a shoe’s
                    length, which a horse with straight, ill-formed hinder legs cannot do; and if
                    such action be accompanied by generally good hind quarters, it is a great
                    indication of safety, as far as one-half of the body of the horse is concerned.
                    But as the false step is made, not with the hinder, but the fore leg, the chief
                    safeguard against falling is to be found elsewhere, namely, first, in the length
                    of the shoulder, which throws the centre of gravity further back than a short
                    one; and, secondly, proceeding also from the free use of the shoulder, in the
                    act of setting the fore-foot down on the ground. It is a general but very
                    mistaken notion, that the safety of a roadster depends upon his lifting his
                    fore-feet high from the ground, when he is said to “go well above his ground
                    whereas it all depends on the manner in which he places them down upon it. Not
                    only are the highest goers often the most unsafe to ride, for, when they do
                    fall, they fall with a violence proportioned to the height of their action; but,
                    although we do not advocate such extremes, there are thousands of instances of
                    horses going <hi rend="italic">very near</hi> to the ground, and never making a
                    ’ trip. It is, however, a well established fact, that if the form of a horse’s
                    shoulder, and the position of the fore-leg, enable him to put his foot to the
                    ground <hi rend="italic">flat,</hi> with the heel well down, his lifting up his
                    foot high is not at all necessary; whereas, on the other hand, if, by an
                    improper position of the leg, issuing out of a short, upright, ill-formed
                    shoulder, the toe touches the ground first, and, as it were, digs into it; no
                    matter how high such a horse may lift up his leg, in any of his paces, he will
                    always be dangerous to ride. And this will be clearly shewn, if we consider the
                    position of the fore-leg, when off the ground, or in action. It is bent in the
                    form of a <hi rend="italic">C,</hi> and the foot suspended in the air, turning
                    inwards, with a curve towards the body. When in this state, were the foot to
                    come in contact with a stone,· or any other substance, it would pass over it
                    without resistance, the limb being at that time in a flaccid state; but when it
                    approaches the ground, the limb being extended, and having the whole weight of
                    the fore-quarters about to be thrown upon it, if it strike against a stone, or
                    any hard substance, then the case is greatly altered, and a stumble is the
                    inevitable consequence. The base now requires to be firm and even, which it can
                    only be by the foot being placed flat upon the ground. Man, in fact, walks very
                    near the ground, but his toe rarely strikes it. If it did so frequently, he
                    would soon become a cripple, putting falling out of the question. His action
                    proceeds from his hips; that of the horse, as regards the fore-legs, from his
                    shoulders; but the principle is the same with each; each is a piece of
                    curiously-wrought mechanism, and according to the correctness of that mechanism
                    is their action true. A wrong notion, however, prevails here, which may lead the
                    purchaser of a hackney astray. It has been asserted by various writers, that, if
                    the shoe of a roadster be found worn at the toe, it is a sure sign of his
                    possessing the dangerous action to which we have alluded. This is false; many
                    horses wear at the toe, solely by the act of picking up the foot, and quite
                    independently of placing it down. That many hackneys, however, fall from their
                    shoes being neglected and suffered to wear too much at the toes, we are well
                    aware, as well as from their pressing upon the hcèls and quarters, from the want
                    of being removed in proper time. When a horse is given to wear at the toe, the
                    wearing part should be steeled.</p>
                <p>The best method of ascertaining the manner of putting <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193646765" xml:id="kp-eb0711-6765-0590"/>down the foot, on which we
                    have shewn the safety of a hack- <hi rend="superscript"> j</hi> ney depends, is,
                    to ride a horse with a slack rein, on a footpath, on which there are trifling
                    undulations, scarcely perceptible, but sufficient for our purpose. If he walk
                    smoothly over such ground, and do not strike it with his toe, we may be sure he
                    puts his foot properly down, and will not, from that cause, be a tumble-down.
                    But there are various ways in which horses fall on the road; bad shoeing, as we
                    have already said, being one of them, and bad condition another. What is called
                    a false step, very different from a stumble, may occur to any horse, and is
                    occasioned by his accidentally putting his foot on a loose stone, that rolls
                    away from under it, when, of course, his footing is lost. In this case, his
                    chance of recovering himself is in his shoulders being oblique and lengthy (for
                    upright shoulders are always short) and well placed hinder legs. Thrushes and
                    corns are likewise the cause of stumbling; as likewise is starting, one of the
                    worst failings a hackney can have. In some horses it is a nervous affection,
                    rather difficult to account for in animals of such strength of frame; and often
                    arises from imperfectly formed eyes, such as flatness of the cornea, or outward
                    surface of the eye, generally a small one, causing short-sightedness. In the
                    latter case, this fault in a hackney may be guarded against, by employing a
                    veterinary surgeon to inspect him previous to purchase.</p>
                <p>The old adage of “No foot, no horse,” applies particularly to the road-horse. The
                    hunter can cross a country upon feet that are very far from good; and by the
                    help of bar-shoes, the coach-horse, with no weight on his back, and with the
                    support the harness gives him, gets pretty comfortably over his stage on unsound
                    feet; but the roadhorse must have sound feet. Previously to the use of
                    horse-shoes, the value of a solid hoof was so great as to have been made the
                    image by which the Prophet Isaiah set forth the strength and excellence of the
                    Babylonish cavalry, “whose hoofs,” says he, “shall be counted as flints.” Both
                    Homer and Virgil mention it as an indispensable requisite in a good horse, the
                    latter making it to resound as it strikes the ground,</p>
                <p>“ — — et solido graviter sonat ungula cornu.”</p>
                <p>We are not going here to enter on a long discussion upon the foot, but only to
                    observe, that the wide hoof and expanded heel of the hunter is not so essential
                    to the road-horse as many persons suppose. Indeed the hoof that has been’ found
                    to stand <hi rend="italic">severe</hi> road-work best, is one rather high at the
                    heel, and not very wide, provided the pastern above do not approach too near the
                    perpendicular; forming what is called <hi rend="superscript"> a</hi> an upright
                    pastern,” which, by the jar the foot receives from it, when it comes to the
                    ground, is nearly certain to produce disease. The strong foot, however, of which
                    we are speaking, is one that requires care, by being frequently drawn out with
                    the knife, to prevent its becoming too strong; and by giving moderate pressure
                    to the frogs, to prevent the heels getting nearer together than we find them,
                    and they already approximate to contraction in a foot of this description. The
                    just form of the hoof in front, upon which mainly depends its form behind, is
                    said by Clarke to be at an elevation from the ground of thirty-three
                    degrees,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>White says
                    forty-five.</p></note> and we are inclined to think, that a much greater
                    elevation than this would approach too near the perpendicular, for any kind of
                    foot. As the inner heel or quarter has more weight thrown upon it than the
                    outer, it is the principal seat of corns and sandcracks, for which reason great
                    care should be taken that an even bearing to the whole of the crust be given by
                    the smith to the foot of the hackney, previously to his setting on the shoe, the
                    inner heel being given to wear away more than the outer on that account.</p>
                <p>In the action of the hackney consists his chief merit. It should be smooth, and
                    with not too long a step, or stride, or he will tire. He should also go straight
                    on his legs, as the term is; for although horses that dish their legs may be,
                    and commonly arc, safe goers, yet they are disagreeable to ride in wet roads, as
                    they cover the rider with mud. As we have already observed, the action of a
                    hackney should not be high <hi rend="subscript"> r</hi> as that tends to fatigue
                    the rider and destroy himself; and if he puts his foot well down on the ground,
                    he will never fall by reason of his action being low, and he will last the
                    longer for its being low.</p>
                <p>The paces of the hackney are in a great measure dependent on the will of his
                    owner. The walk and the canter are most essential to what may be called the
                    pleasure hackney; but for general purposes, the trot is the most useful and
                    available pace in a roadster, and one in which he will continue longer,
                    according to the rate he is going at, than in the canter. There are instances,
                    however, and here is perfection in a hackney, of horses with very oblique
                    shoulders, and excellent hinder legs, being able to carry their riders in a
                    canter, over every variation of road, downhill, as well as uphill, without
                    offering to break into a trot, for a great distance of ground; and, although not
                    <hi rend="italic">appearing</hi> to go more than at the rate of nine miles in
                    the hour, are really going twelve. This is the result of the perfection of the
                    points to which we have alluded, and can never be looked for in horses of a
                    contrary make, whose shoulders are short and stiff, and their hinder legs
                    straight. Above all things, what is called “fighting action” in a hackney should
                    be avoided; neither ought the fore leg to be thrown out with a dart, as it is
                    always attended with a dwelling, or temporary suspension of the foot, previously
                    to its reaching the ground.</p>
                <p>Most horses have some peculiarities about them, if not absolute “tricks,” as
                    vicious practices in horses are designated. Starting has already been noticed;
                    but plunging is still more dangerous, as in that case, a horse seldom stops
                    until he have unseated his rider, at least made many attempts to do so, or
                    thrown himself upon the ground. This latter trick often proceeds, not from sheer
                    vice, but from a sense of pain in the horse, from being too tightly girthed; or
                    from the, to him, very unpleasant sensation of a cold saddle, with a weight upon
                    it, being pressed to his back; and having once taken a dislike to it, he is very
                    apt to continue it. Against each of these evils, it is in our power to provide.
                    Against the first, by not girthing the horse tightly, for the doing of which
                    there is no good reason; and against the second, by having the saddle put on an
                    hour before the horse is wanted, in which time it will become warm, and not
                    disagreeable to the skin of his back, which, in some horses, we know to be
                    extremely susceptible. It is upon this principle that the collars are left day
                    and night upon such road coach-horses as are given to “jib” at starting, the
                    consequence of tender shoulders. But there is one failing to •which hackneys are
                    subject, not proceeding from vice, but still attended with danger, as it is
                    often the cause of their falling; and we will endeavour to exhibit this failing.
                    We need scarcely insist upon a good mouth, with neck and head in good place, in
                    the best description of road-horse; nevertheless, if he will not suffer his
                    rider to avail himself of those advantages, they are useless to him. Such,
                    however, is the case when a hackney, as he is going along in his fast paces,
                    throws his head backwards, which he has always the power to do, his rider being
                    unable to prevent him. Twofold danger attends this fault. First, when in the act
                    of doing it, he sees not where he places his feet; <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193646778" xml:id="kp-eb0711-6778-0591"/>secondly, his rider loses his
                    mouth for the moment, and in ' that moment he may fall. Independently of this,
                    it gives the rider the idea that the horse is becoming fatigued, and doubtless
                    it is an indication to that effect. Our idea, then, of a <hi rend="italic"
                    >perfect</hi> hackney to carry a gentleman, is this: A well-bred, short-legged,
                    lengthy horse, with <hi rend="italic">very good legs and feet,</hi> not under
                    fourteen nor above fifteen hands high, that will walk four miles in the hour,
                    trot eleven or twelve, and, if wanted, will go fifteen in that time in a canter
                    or handgallop, <hi rend="italic">without once throwing up his head,</hi> or
                    requiring to be pulled up. We are, of course, supposing him to be in good
                    condition, and in strong work, or it would not be fair to exact so much from
                    him. But it is only in cases of necessity that any horse should be made to
                    perform the latter task; for we are averse to trespassing unnecessarily upon the
                    powers and capabilities of so noble an animal. On the contrary, we recommend
                    every indulgence that can be granted to him on a journey, and especially in hot
                    weather. At all times, indeed, it is our interest to do so; but, in very hot
                    weather, a few sips of soft water, often given, keep off fever, and replenish
                    the loss he sustains by exhaustion from excessive perspiration.</p>
                <p>One word more respecting action. We are no advocates for <hi rend="italic">very
                    fast trotting.</hi> It forces the animal to the very extent of his powers,
                    which, of course, wears him out; it induces his owner either to be constantly
                    displaying these powers in private, or matching him against time in public. Add
                    to this, fast trotting is not a gentlemanlike pace; that is, it has not a
                    gentlemanlike appearance, neither is it agreeable to the rider. This is apparent
                    at first sight, when we follow two horsemen on a road, one on a fast trotter,
                    and the other on a good canterer; although going at the same rate, the cantering
                    h <hi rend="subscript"> v</hi> Qrse and his rider are both much more at their
                    ease. With the ancient Romans, indeed, a trotting horse was called a tormentor.
                    Nevertheless, we admit that fast trotting is a proof of action, in excess, but
                    of a peculiar nature, and is, perhaps more than any other, transmitted from sire
                    to son, as the produce of the various Norfolk and American trotters have shewn.
                    The amble is a pace very little known in England, although very general on the
                    Continent, where the act of rising in the stirrups by the horseman, in the trot,
                    is not practised. We wonder, however, that horses are not oftener broken to this
                    pace than they are, for the use of women, or of men unequal to fatigue. Although
                    the amble is not allowed to be a pace in the manege, the walk, trot, and gallop
                    being all, it is said to be the first pace of the horse when a foal, but when he
                    has strength to trot, he quits it. Another peculiarity attends it. A horse, we
                    know, can be put from a trot to a gallop without stopping, but he cannot be
                    forced from an amble to a gallop without a halt.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">The Pack-Horse.</hi> This description of horse is not now in
                    use. His capabilities were prodigious in carrying weight, but were abused by
                    being trespassed upon. When crossed with the heavy cart-horse, a most useful
                    breed for draught was produced, as also what was called the farmer’s hackney,
                    that is, a sturdy animal between the cart-horse and the hackney, useful for all
                    purposes of agriculture, as well as for carrying his owner, and always ready to
                    give help, upon a pinch, either in the plough, the harrow, or the
                    harvest-cart.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">The Cob.</hi> The word cob is one of new mintage in the
                    sporting world, signifying a powerful, short-legged horse, about fourteen hands
                    high, without any pretensions to blood, but able to carry a great weight, at a
                    certain pace, on the road. He is generally the produce of a light, active
                    cart-mare, and either a thorough-bred or half-bred stallion; and, failing to
                    grow in height, often increases in lateral growth to subitance equal to that of
                    the old pack, or miller’s horse, of former days. When gifted with action,
                    combined with good shape and appearance, this description of horse is much
                    sought after in London, as also in the country, and often sells for a hundred
                    pounds, to carry heavy elderly gentlemen. The attempt to breed him, however, is
                    a hazardous one, as in case of fault in his action for the saddle, he is not
                    suitable to the coach-horse market, the present rate of travelling requiring
                    more lofty as well as higher bred cattle.</p>
                <p>The term <hi rend="italic">Galloway</hi> now applies to any horse not exceeding
                    fourteen hands in height, although it originated with a breed peculiar to a
                    province of Scotland known by that name. In the early days of English racing,
                    there were several capital thorough-bred galloways in training, at the head of
                    which was the Bald Galloway, sire of Cartouch, and also of the Carlisle Gelding,
                    who, as the Stud-Book informs us, “was remarkable for having supported the
                    fatigue of running as a trial horse in private, and with success in public, till
                    the age of eighteen, at which period, after winning a heat at Sawtry, in
                    Huntingdonshire (1731), he broke his leg, and died.” The celebrated Mixbury
                    Galloway, of the middle of last century, was only thirteen hands two inches in
                    height.</p>
                <p>Previously to the improved system of coaching, and the cheapness and expedition
                    of that mode of travelling, the well-bred galloway was the favourite hackney of
                    jockies, graziers, horse dealers, and cattle jobbers, and in fact of all light
                    weights who had occasion to travel long distances on the road, in a short space
                    of time; and no description of horse is better adapted to the purpose. Some
                    years since, there was a little entire horse in Devonshire, called Kat-terfelto,
                    the sire of many most extraordinary galloways, to whose labours on the road,
                    indeed, there appeared scarcely to be any limit.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">The Pony.</hi> A horse is called a pony when under the height
                    of thirteen hands, four inches to the hand. It is difficult to account for this
                    diminutive breed, unless we believe it to have been imported from countries
                    farther north than Great Britain, which appears probable from the fact of ponies
                    being found in greater abundance in Scotland and Wales than in any other part of
                    the island; the effect, no doubt, of climate. In Ireland they are very rare.</p>
                <p>There is no animal that improves in form and character so much as the pony does
                    from the effect of good grooming and high keep. A real Welsh mountain pony, in
                    very good condition, especially if not castrated, is a perfect war-horse in
                    miniature, uniting almost every good property his species possesses. As a proof
                    of one essential quality, we can state upon authority, that the Earl of Oxford
                    had a mare pony, got by the Clive Arabian, her dam by the same horse, out of a
                    Welsh mare pony, which could beat any of his racers four miles at a feather
                    weight. Whether Welsh, Scotch, or Hampshire (New Forest), ponies have properties
                    belonging to them, which should attract the notice of the hippopathologist,
                    among the most prominent of which are the following: They are never lame in the
                    feet, or become roarers. A broken winded pony is a very rare sight, and they
                    live to the extreme of old age, if not unfairly treated. They are also very
                    little susceptible of disease, in comparison with other horses; and as for their
                    powers of endurance, they stagger belief. A rare instance of the latter
                    excellence may be produced, from the well-known fact of the pony, Sir Teddy,
                    only twelve hands high, accompanying the royal mail from London to Exeter, and
                    arriving in that city fifty-nine minutes before it, distance 172 miles, in
                    twenty-three hours and twenty minutes. It may scarcely be necessary to state
                    that he carried no weight, being led between two horses all the way;
                    nevertheless it was a task that we think no full-grown horse would have
                    performed. A correct likeness of this pony was painted by the elder Marshall, of
                    Newmarket. In 1784, a Shetland pony, eleven hands and a half high, carried<pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193646791" xml:id="kp-eb0711-6791-0592"/> a rider weighing
                    five stones from Norwich to Yarmouth, and back, forty-four miles, in three hours
                    and forty-five minutes. As a proof, also, of their powers in crossing a country,
                    the fact may be stated of the late Sir Charles Turner riding a pony ten miles in
                    forty-seven minutes, and taking thirty leaps in his course, for a wager of 1000
                    guineas with the late Duke of Queensberry, then Earl March. During the drawing
                    of the Irish lottery, the expresses from Holyhead to London were chiefly
                    conveyed by ponies, at the rate of nearly twenty miles in the hour.</p>
                <p>The only bad use to which the pony is applied, is in what is called the “pony
                    chaise,” or phaeton. The carriage itself is dangerous, by reason of its extreme
                    lightness and shortness, by which it is so easily overturned; and the lowness of
                    the driver’s seat prevents proper command over the animal drawing it. It is too
                    often the case, also, that “the pony” is a pet, and for that reason pampered in
                    the stable, and not much worked. On the least alarm, then, such as any unusual
                    noise, horses gallopping past him, or, as there have been too many fatal
                    instances, some part of the fore-carriage touching his hocks in de scending a
                    hill, away he goes, gallopping and kicking until he has rid himself of his load.
                    The safest way of using ponies in harness, is in pairs, in double harness, with
                    the pole of the carriage raised a little at the futchels, to prevent their
                    kicking over it in their play.</p>
                <p>THE CHARGER.</p>
                <p>No kind of horse, no animal, indeed, of any sort, makes so prominent a figure in
                    history, sacred or profane, as “the goodly horse of the battle,” or war-horse.
                    The description of*him by Job is admitted to exceed the powers of human
                    eloquence; “and,” as Μ. Rollin says of it, “every word would bear an explication
                    to display its merits.” The <hi rend="italic">Guardian</hi> (No. 86) has a very
                    ingenious critique upon it; and Bochart devotes seventeen pages to this, and all
                    the other passages in Scripture in which the horse is mentioned. Virgil’s
                    representation of him, in his third Géorgie, is considered as the nearest
                    approach to that of the sacred writer; and the speech, in the tenth Aeneid, of
                    the hero Mezentius to his favourite charger, when on the point of sallying forth
                    to avenge the death of his son, is not exceeded, in the pathetic, by any other
                    passage in the poem. Homer is blamed for his too frequent allusions to the
                    horse; but the history of all wars produces materials for panegyrics on this
                    noble animal. The far-famed Bucephalus is said to have preserved the life of
                    Alexander, by carrying him out of reach of the enemy, although he had received
                    his mortal wound, and dropped down dead immediately on his (Alexander’s)
                    alighting from his back. In the battle which was to decide the fate of Persia,
                    on the ground upon which the great Nineveh once stood, the merit of the victory
                    was chiefly ascribed, by the Byzantine historians, not to the military conduct,
                    but to the personal valour of their favourite hero, in which his horse bore his
                    share. “On this memorable day,” says the eloquent Gibbon, “Heraclius, on his
                    horse Phallas, surpassed the bravest of his warriors. His lip was pierced with a
                    spear, the steed was wounded in the thigh, but he carried his master safe and
                    victorious through the triple phalanx of the barbarians.” How many British
                    soldiers have owed the preservation of their lives to the courage and docility
                    of their horses.</p>
                <p>The movement of turning being the most difficult with the horse, by reason of the
                    inflexible nature of his backbone, the one selected for a charger should have
                    great freedom of action, having his hinder legs well bent under his body, so
                    that he may be easily thrown upon his haunches; also much liberty in his
                    shoulders, and pliancy in the muscles of the neck; in which case he will seldom
                    fail in having the proper requisites for his calling. The position of his hinder
                    legs, however, is most particularly insisted upon, because, should they be
                    straight, that is, not inclining inwards from the hock, after the form of the
                    ostrich’s leg, he will with great difficulty be made the supple, shortturning,
                    handy animal that he ought to be, to render him perfectly available to his
                    rider, at the head of his regiment, or in the ranks. Perhaps those horses which
                    were destined to mount our ancient nobility, or courteous knights of old, for
                    feats of chivalry, and gained them the palm in that field of romantic honour,
                    were more highly “dressed”, as the term is, in the manege, than an officer’s
                    charger of these days should be; nevertheless, as Colonel Peters observes, in
                    his Treatise on Equitation (London, 1835), “Although it might spoil a good horse
                    for military purposes, to form him perfectly after the higher manege principles,
                    yet he would be equally unfit for that duty, if he were left in a raw and
                    ignorant state.”</p>
                <p>Amongst the ancient Greeks, all horses, as well as all men, were strictly
                    examined before they were admitted into the cavalry; and the precedent cannot be
                    too closely followed. It is well known, that in the various campaigns of the
                    last war, several British officers lost their lives, in consequence of being
                    mounted on chargers not equal to their weight over every description of ground.
                    In one particular instance, a colonel of a light dragoon regiment was cut down
                    in retreating, by reason of his handsome, but powerless charger, being unable to
                    gallop with him over a deeply-ploughed field. At the battle of Waterloo, the
                    ground became excessively wet and soft, owing to continued rain; and, in
                    consequence of it, the Duke of Wellington gave a large price to an officer on
                    his staff for a fine, powerful mare, which had been purchased out of an English
                    foxhunting stud. In fact, the sort of horse best fitted for an officer’s
                    charger, is one which possesses most of the essential qualifications, as well as
                    accomplishments, of a hunter, as his rider, when on service, knows not how soon
                    they may be called for. He should, however, be of airy form, with light action,
                    and well-bred, or he will not look in character with the smart costume of his
                    rider; but to his appearance there must not be sacrificed those essential
                    points, substance and strength, which will enaþle him to struggle through
                    difficulties, in which a weaker, though more highly-bred, animal might sink. But
                    a trifling deviation in form in the charger, from the points insisted upon in
                    the hunter, may be admitted. For example, the shortness of leg, that is, in the
                    cannon or shank bone, is not exactly desirable in the charger, as his action is
                    required to be of a grander and more showy appearance than we wish to see in the
                    hunter. A moderate length of leg, then, is favourable to such 'action, and gives
                    lightness, as well as gracefulness, to his movements.</p>
                <p>We cannot imagine any brute animal more likely to insure the gratitude of man,
                    than the horse which has borne him in safety throughout even a single campaign;
                    and it is not to be wondered at its having been made a subject for rebuke to
                    Cato, that he left his charger in Spain, to avoid the expense of bringing him
                    home; or that it should be recorded in praise of Andromache, that she fed the
                    horses of Hector with her own hand. A case parallel with the first, we would not
                    produce if we could; but without having recourse to history beyond the period of
                    our own time, we may set forth a flattering resemblance to the second. The late
                    Duchess of Wellington, during her Grace’s residence at Strathfieldsaye, in
                    Hampshire, seldom omitted, for a day, feeding, with her own hands, the favourite
                    charger of her gallant husband.</p>
                <p>The height of a charger should not exceed fifteen hands and a half, horses of
                    that size being more easily set upon their haunches, and also made to turn more
                    readily than taller ones. His colour must depend upon circumstances; <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193646804" xml:id="kp-eb0711-6804-0593"/> but next to the
                    silver gray, which best displays his trappings, and which, we may presume, was
                    the colour of the celebrated Phallas (the Greeks called a gray horse bay, black,
                    and chestnut, are the best.</p>
                <p>THE TROOP-HORSE.</p>
                <p>A change for the worse has taken place in this description of horse, in several
                    British light dragoon regiments, the effect of which was apparent in the late
                    war. It originated in a wish to imitate the style and character of the Hussar,
                    without taking into consideration the fact, that that description of cavalry was
                    intended more for out-parties and skirmishing, than for coming in contact with
                    the body of an enemy; and that consequently, the slender sort of horse on which
                    the English light dragoon has of late been mounted, has not been found
                    efficient, under the immense weight he carries when in marching order, or even
                    in battle, which averages at least sixteen stones. The heavy dragoon horse is,
                    indeed, very little more powerful now than that of the light dragoon was, thirty
                    or forty years back.</p>
                <p>The horse best calculated for a light dragoon trooper, is something between the
                    modern coach-horse and the hackney; upon short legs, with good bone, and with
                    much substance in the body. His back should be short, and well ribbed up, his
                    barrel round and large, to allow plenty of room for food, as he is often a long
                    time without it; and hardiness of constitution is a very material point in a
                    soldier’s horse. When we look at dragoon regiments, however, the heavy horse
                    regiments, in particular, our surprise is excited at the fine appearance the
                    horses make, contrasting it with the price allowed by government for the
                    purchase of them. It is true they are purchased when young, many of those for
                    the household troops, at three years old; and their good keep, upon hard food of
                    the best quality, forces them into shape, and makes them what we see them.</p>
                <p>THE COACH-HORSE.</p>
                <p>If it cannot be absolutely asserted that the first use of the horse was in
                    harness, it is quite certain that the chariothorse was held in high estimation
                    in very early times, and is alluded to by poets and historians of all nations
                    and in all languages. Homer says that Diomed, an Asiatic prince, had ten
                    chariots, with a particular sort of horses for each; and he also makes Nestor,
                    at the funeral games of Patroclus, harness the horses for his son with his own
                    hands; and, by his skill in directing him in the race, he wins it. But the
                    Grecian bard goes still further into minutiae. He even represents Menelaus, on
                    the same occasion, using Oethe, one of the horses of Agamemnon, with one of his
                    own; and Priam is found harnessing his favourite steeds to the car, in which he
                    returns, with the dead body of his father, from Achilles’s camp, on the plains
                    of Troy. It would be endless to turn to other writers, to shew the estimation in
                    which the chariot-horse has been held.</p>
                <p>In its present acceptation, the term “coach-horse” includes two varieties;
                    namely, the horse that draws the gentleman’s carriage, and the one that is
                    employed in those public conveyances, called “stage-coaches.” As regards the
                    former animals, we believe a similar alteration has taken place in the form,
                    appearance, and breeding of them, as has been seen in the English hunter, within
                    the last half century. The Flanders mares, so highly esteemed, and seen only in
                    the carriages of families of distinction; the well buckĭed-up, long-tailed
                    blacks and roans, have all disappeared, and we find, in their stead, the sort of
                    horse nearly approaching to the one which was formerly considered quite
                    well-bred enough for the chase. But the fact is, such is the present rage for
                    rapid travelling, both in private and public carriages, that nothing but
                    well-bred horses have a chance to stand what is called harness-work on our
                    roads. Those used also for “town-work,” as the term is, are of a superior
                    description, amongst which hundreds of good hunters might be selected; but such
                    have been the high prices given for them by the dealers, at an age which would
                    not admit of their being tried in the field, they have found their way into
                    harness, and, when once there, they remain in it.</p>
                <p>The form, however, of what may be termed a splendid town coach-horse, need not
                    be, by any means, perfect; and were a judge to examine minutely the points of
                    vast numbers of those handsome horses seen in the carriages in London, or other
                    large towns, he would find them very deficient in several points, essential to
                    any purpose but harness, shoulders and hinder legs especially. But it is
                    fortunate for breeders of horses, that it does not require true symmetry and
                    action to form a grand coach-horse. His false points are, for the most part,
                    concealed by his trappings; and if he be any thing near the following form, he
                    will make an excellent appearance in harness. His head is not so material, as
                    the bridle covers so much of it; but his neck should rise well out of his
                    shoulders, as the higher he carries his head the better, provided the form of
                    his neck admits of its being drawn inward by the bearing rein, when only
                    moderately tight, in which case he will be easily acted upon by the driving
                    rein. The back of the coachhorse is a material point, as, without an easy slope
                    behind the withers, his fore-hand will not appear grand, nor will the pad sit
                    well upon him. His hinder quarters should be straight and blood-like; his
                    gaskins well spread; and his tail should be set on, high. His action should not
                    be too short for townwork, but the knee should be thrown well up in the trot, to
                    give him a grand appearance. This peculiar action, the result of strong flexor
                    tendons, suited nearly to this purpose only, is observable in colthood, but is
                    increased afterwards by the horse being thrown more upon his haunches by the
                    bit; and the act of drawing is not unfavourable to it. Light work in harness,
                    indeed, is favourable to all action, that of gallopping excepted.</p>
                <p>The county of York may be called the modern Epirus, as in that and Lincolnshire
                    are the greater part of the London coach-horses bred. The most usual cross is
                    between the thorough-bred horse and the Cleveland-bay mare; but the appearance
                    of too many of them incline us to believe, that, losing sight of their own
                    interest, breeders have recourse, oftener than they should, to the half-bred
                    horse, as well as to the half-bred mare. This, added to the rich grass land they
                    are bred upon, accounts for the coarse, ill-placed shoulders and flat, fleshy
                    feet that so many of the London coach-horses exhibit. For road-work, in noblemen
                    and gentlemen’s carriages, horses cannot be too nearly full blood, provided they
                    have strength equal to their work. Here, as over a country, “it is the pace that
                    kills and as, in considerable velocity, the power of a horse is nearly exhausted
                    in moving his own body, he needs every advantage we can give him.</p>
                <p>The colour of the gentleman’s coach-horse is, for the most part, bay; but by far
                    the most imposing in harness is the silver-gray, with black mane and tail. This
                    colour was held sacred by the ancients; and Camillus is said to have given great
                    offence to the Romans by being drawn through Rome, in his triumph, by four gray
                    horses, no general having before ventured to do so. Gray coachhorses, however,
                    require the nicest grooming, and the best appointed harness, otherwise all the
                    good effect is lost. The piebald look conspicuous, and commands a high price, as
                    no doubt he always did. Virgil was partial to the piebald, or party-coloured
                    breed, and mounts young Priam upon one of them in the fifth, and Turrus in the
                    ninth, Aeneid, both Thracian horses.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:193646817" xml:id="kp-eb0711-6817-0594"/>
                <p>The stage coach-horse has undergone a still greater change in the last half
                    century, and particularly the last twenty years. In fact, his physical condition
                    may now be said to be better than that of the man who lives by the sweat of his
                    brow, for he works but one hour in twenty-four, whereas the man works twelve.
                    The coach-horse also lives on the best fare, which cannot be said of the
                    labouring man. As all kinds of horses of a light description find their way into
                    coaches, it is useless to attempt to fix a standard by which they should be
                    measured, as to height, length, width, or strength. But as all horses draw by
                    their .weight, and not by the force of their muscles, which could not act
                    against a load for any length of time, the object of the breeder or purchaser of
                    the road coach-horse should be, to have as much power in as small a compass as
                    may be possible, combined with good action. Substance is a <hi rend="italic"
                    >sine qua non</hi> on roads that are heavy or hilly; for, as before observed, it
                    is the weight of the animal which produces the draught, whilst the play and
                    force of its muscles serve to continue it.</p>
                <p>There are, however, a few points very necessary to be observed in the purchase of
                    the road coach-horse. As in drawing, the force applied proceeds from the fulcrum
                    formed by the hinder feet, well spread gaskins and thighs form a main
                    excellence. His fore-legs also should be good to make him a safe wheel-horse,
                    nor can he throw his whole weight into his collar, unless he be sound in his
                    feet. But alas, how many are thus deprived of their natural powers, by being
                    worked upon unsound feet, and expected to exert themselves to the utmost.</p>
                <p>There is no truth so easily proved, or so painfully felt by the post-master, at
                    least in his pocket, as that, <hi rend="italic">it is the pace that kills.</hi>
                    A horse at a dead pull, or at the beginning of his pull, is enabled, by the
                    force of his muscles, to throw a certain weight into the collar. If he walk four
                    miles in the hour, some part of that muscular energy must be expended in the act
                    of walking; and, consequently, the power of drawing must be proportionally
                    diminished. If he trot eight miles in the hour, more animal power is expended in
                    the trot, and less remains for the draught; but the draught continues the same,
                    and, to enable him to accomplish his work, he must tax his energies to a degree
                    that is cruel in itself, and that must speedily wear him out.</p>
                <p>Let it be supposed, what every horse cannot accomplish, that he shall be able, by
                    fair exertion and without distress, to throw, at a dead pull, a weight into his
                    collar, or exert a force equal to 216 lb.; or, in other words, let him be able
                    to draw a load which requires a force of 216 lb. to move. Let him next walk at
                    the rate of four miles in an hour; what force will he then be able to employ? We
                    have taken away some to assist him in walking, and we have left him only 96 lb.,
                    being not half of that which he could exert when he began his pull. He shall
                    quicken his pace to six miles an hour, more energy must be exerted to carry him
                    over this additional ground. How much has he remaining to apply to the weight
                    behind him? 54 lb. only. We will make the six miles an hour ten; for it seems
                    now to be the fashion for the fast coach, and for almost every coach, and every
                    vehicle, to attempt this pace. How stands the account with the poor beast? We
                    have left him a power equal to 32 lb. only to be employed for the purpose of
                    draught.</p>
                <p>The load which a horse can draw is about fifteen times greater than the power
                    exerted, supposing the road to be hard and level, and the carriage to run with
                    little friction; and the horse which, at starting, can throw into the collar a
                    weight or force equal to 216 lb., will draw a load of 3200. Let him, however, be
                    urged on at the rate of ten miles in the hour; deduct the power used in
                    swiftness of pace from the sum-total of that which he possesses, and what
                    remains? not a sixth part, not that which is equal to a quarter of a ton, or, if
                    it be a stage-coach, the energy exerted in draught by the four horses will not
                    be equal to a ton.</p>
                <p>The coach, and its passengers, and its luggage, weigh more than this, and the
                    whole is still drawn on, and must be so. Whence comes the power? from the
                    overstrained exertion, the injury, the torture, the destruction of the horse.
                    That which is true of the coach-rose, is equally true of every other. Let each
                    reader apply it to his own animal, and act as humanity and interest dictate.</p>
                <p>It would be in vain to attempt any standard for road coach-horses. They must be
                    picked up where they can be found, and, if possessed of action, the rest must be
                    left to chance. A good constitution is desirable, for many die in the
                    “seasoning,” as it is called, on the road, and a young, green horse cuts a poor
                    figure in a fast coach. Coachmasters are too much given to purchase infirm
                    horses, by which they incur loss, for, if quite sound, it is as much as can be
                    expected that they remain so for any moderate length of time; and we believe the
                    average duration of horses in fast work is not more than four years, if
                    purchased sound. Unsound horses, then, cannot be supposed to last nearly so
                    long, independently of the cruelty of driving them. The most likely horse,
                    however, to stand sound, and do his work well in a fast coach, is one, that,
                    with sufficient strength, and a good set of limbs, has action sufficiently
                    speedy to admit of his keeping time without going at the top of his pace. When
                    this is the case, he runs his stage, from end to end, within himself, and is as
                    good at the last as he was at the first; but when he cannot <hi rend="italic"
                    >command</hi> the pace, he soon becomes distressed, and is weak at the end of
                    his stage. This accounts for sundry accidents having occurred by wheel-horses
                    being unable to hold back a loaded coach down hill, at the end of the stage,
                    although they would have been more than equal to it at the beginning of it. In
                    fact, many coach-horses are very good for eight miles, but very bad for ten, so
                    nicely are their powers measured in harness. Above all things, we recommend good
                    legs and feet in working horses, if they are to be had; and an extra price is
                    well laid out in procuring them. Whether they are strong in their harness, in
                    very fast work, cannot be discovered until they are tried; but well bred ones,
                    having substance, are most likely to prove so.</p>
                <p>Dr Johnson, in his Rasselas, makes the Artist of the Happy Valley tell the
                    prince, he had long been of opinion that, instead of the tardy conveyances of
                    ships and chariots, man might use the swifter migration of wings. There appears
                    something prophetic here, when we read of the contemplated transmission, by
                    all-powerful steam, of a man’s person from· London to Liverpool in two hours,
                    which would be at a rate that the very “wings of the winds” never yet equalled.
                    But surely our coaches now travel sufficiently fast, and we should be sorry to
                    see their speed increased beyond what it now is, in consideration for the
                    sufferings of the horses employed in them. Were they not always <hi
                    rend="italic">running home</hi> (for each end of the stage is their home), they
                    would not perform their tasks so well as they now perform them; and it is owing
                    to that circumstance that the accidents in fast coaches are not so numerous as
                    might be expected, night work, and many other things being taken into
                    account.</p>
                <p>Coach-horses are subject to many accidents, and some diseases nearly peculiar to
                    themselves. Amongst the former is the fracture of a leg, or the coffin-bone of
                    the foot, occasioned generally, it is supposed, by treading on a stone, or any
                    other uneven surface, when the limb is strained in draught. It, however,
                    sometimes happens when the horse is trotting along on very fair ground, and in
                    such cases the accident is rather difficult to account for. In very heavy
                    draught, when the foot is much overcharged with the weight and pressure of the
                    body, a fracture will sometimes take place at the first step the horse takes.
                    Perhaps <pb break="no" facs="nls:193646830" xml:id="kp-eb0711-6830-0595"/>these
                    accidents may be independent of what is called shape and make, but coach
                    proprietors would do well to purchase their horses with good legs and feet, and
                    then they are less liable to these accidents, and, with good care and good
                    shoeing, may last many years in very quick work.</p>
                <p>The diseases peculiar to coach-horses are, the megrims, and the lick. The former
                    attacks the head, and is caused by irregular motion of the fluids within the
                    vessels of the brain, stopping, for a time, all voluntary motion. The horse in
                    consequence staggers and falls, if not immediately pulled up, and that does not
                    always prevent him. This species of vertigo is generally produced by the effect
                    of a hot sun, especially if the horse be running in the face of it, for which
                    reason horses subject to megrims are generally worked at night. In fact, many
                    coach-horses are good horses by night, although they cannot keep their time by
                    day, <hi rend="underline">in</hi> the summer, particularly thick-winded horses.
                    Blind horses also do not like sun, but “as healthy as a blind horse in the
                    winter” is a proverb.</p>
                <p>The lick can scarcely be called a disease, but it greatly injures the condition
                    and appearance of coach horses. λVhen under its influence, they are almost
                    constantly, when not feeding, licking each other’s skins, or else the rack or
                    manger. It proceeds from a heated state of the stomach, from the excitement of
                    high food, and almost daily profuse sweating, and is invariably removed by
                    alterative medicines or physic.</p>
                <p>A great mistake is made by too many coach-masters in being <hi rend="italic"
                    >under</hi> instead of <hi rend="italic">over</hi> horsed for their ground.
                    Instead of keeping five horses to work a certain length of ground, and feeding
                    them very high to perform it, it would answer them better to keep six horses on
                    the same allowance of corn that the five horses are eating. The stock would last
                    longer, and the money they cost be “kept together,” as the term is, longer, by
                    such means. Each horse would then rest two days out of six, when they were all
                    fit for work, which would keep him very fresh in condition; and there would
                    always be one spare horse left, in case either of the six wanting physic or
                    rest. It is the almost every-day excitement that breaks down the constitution of
                    coach-horses.</p>
                <p>THE GIG-HORSE.</p>
                <p>A few years back, a country parson and his wife, or a wealthy old farmer, were
                    the only persons seen in England in two-wheeled carriages, then called Whiskies.
                    They were useful though far from ornamental vehicles, having what is termed “a
                    head” to protect the inmates from weather, and, with a very quiet horse, were
                    considered as nearly equal in security to close four-wheeled carriages. In the
                    character and appellations of these carriages, however, a wonderful alteration
                    has taken place within the last fifty years, and even royalty itself has been
                    seen seated in gigs, cabriolets, Stanhopes, and Tilburies; the two last taking
                    their names from the inventors of their peculiar forms. The build of these
                    two-wheeled carriages has reached the very summit of perfection, not only as
                    regards their firmness but their elegance; and it is scarcely necessary to add,
                    that the horses driven in them, as likewise their harness, have equally altered
                    their character. From two to three hundred guineas (and, in one instance, seven
                    hundred guineas were paid) have been no uncommon prices given for gig and
                    cabriolet horses; and for gentleman’s work we might put sixty as the average of
                    the last forty years.</p>
                <p>The choice of a gig-horse (for we confine ourselves to that term for the present)
                    must be regulated by local circumstances. If for London streets, his action
                    should be rather lofty or “grand,” as the term is, than fast; that is to εay, he
                    should step with his knee much elevated, which of course is unfavourable to
                    speed. His appearance also should be of the first order of his species, not
                    under fifteen hands two inches in height; and if of a fancy colour, the more
                    money will he fetch in the market. He must be well bitted, carrying his head
                    high, and very quick in getting into his trot, or “upon his legs,” as coachmen
                    say, to enable his driver to make his way in crowded streets. We should also
                    add, that this quickness in his motions should be accompanied by perfectly good
                    temper, and freedom from all vice; in which case he is always worth one hundred
                    guineas, or more, if in the prime of life and sound.</p>
                <p>For the country a different sort of gig-horse is required. In drawing a gig on a
                    soft or newly-gravelled road, the resistance is much the same as a continual
                    bill; and therefore a horse with a quick, short step is best calculated for the
                    road, as such action fatigues less than that which we have recommended for
                    London. For all purposes, however, a horse in single harness, to be safe, should
                    be well up before; that is to say, he should go with his fore quarters high up,
                    and not boring on his shoulders. In this case, if he have well-placed shoulders,
                    good legs, and sound feet, free from corns and thrushes; good natural courage to
                    induce him to “run up to his bit,” and a good mouth, there will be very little
                    danger of his falling down in a gig; but accidents from vice must depend upon
                    other circumstances. These accidents, however, are often the result not of real
                    vice, or even of ill temper, but of want of knowledge in his owner of putting
                    him properly into his harness, as well as of driving him afterwards.</p>
                <p>Innumerable accidents to horses in gigs arise from some part of the harness
                    pinching him, particularly about his withers or back, when he will endeavour to
                    kick himself out of it, to rid himself of the torment. Indeed we. have more than
                    once seen a road coach-horse, in regular work, set a-kicking merely from a
                    twisted trace, rubbing edgeways against the outside of his thigh.</p>
                <p>We consider mares objectionable in single harness, for reasons which are obvious;
                    and few of them are to be trusted at certain periods of the year, particularly
                    in the case of a rein getting under the tail. When driven, the precaution of the
                    safety rein should not be omitted. We are also of opinion that numerous
                    accidents from gigs would be prevented, if horses intended for them were to be
                    broken in to them, in bridles without winkers, as a great portion of the horses
                    on the Continent are driven. The not knowing what they have behind them is a
                    natural cause of alarm.. and would by this means be obviated.</p>
                <p>THE POST-HORSE.</p>
                <p>This description of horse is one of the most useful we have, and is of very
                    ancient date. He is spoken of by Xenophon, in allusion to the posts instituted
                    by the first Cyrus, and as the most expeditious method of travelling by land
                    (<hi rend="italic">Cyrop&lt;zdia,</hi> 1. viii. p. 496, edit. Hutchinson);
                    although, perhaps, he was chiefly made use of to forward public despatches.
                    Augustus was the first to.introduce post-houses, and consequently post-horses
                    and.post-chaises, amongst the Romans, disposed at convenient distances (Snet.
                    <hi rend="italic">in</hi><hi rend="italic">vit.</hi><hi rend="italic">Aug.</hi>
                    vi. 49), but these were chiefly for the purpose of political intelligence. Thus,
                    in a letter from Pliny to Trajan, we. find him informing the emperor of his
                    having granted a courier a warrant to make use of the public posts, as he wished
                    him to be quickly in possession of some important facts, communicated to him by
                    the King of Sardinia; and he subsequently (Letter cxxi.) apologizes .to his
                    royal master for having ventured, on his own responsibility, to grant an order
                    for his wife to be forwarded by post-chaises, on occasion of a domestic
                    affliction. His letter produced a kind answer from the emperor, approving, <hi
                    rend="italic">in</hi><hi rend="italic">this peculiar</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >instance,</hi> of the use of the warrants which he had entrust-» ed to his
                    care.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:193646843" xml:id="kp-eb0711-6843-0596"/>
                <p>A most material and agreeable change has taken place in the character and
                    appearance of this class of horse, who may truly be said to have marched with
                    the times. Up to the end of the last century the post-horse was, except in a few
                    instances, an object of commiseration with travellers. With galled sides and
                    sore shoulders, and scarcely a sound limb, he would not go without the lash or
                    spur, whereas he now comes out of his stable in high condition, and runs his ten
                    miles’ stage in an hour, with a carriage of the average weight, and twelve, if
                    required, with a light one. He is also seen to perform either of these tasks
                    without being distressed, unless in immoderately hot weather, when humane
                    persons would check his speed. Montaigne says, “there is a certain general claim
                    of kindness and benevolence which every creature has a right to from man,” a
                    sentiment in which we heartily concur; for although man may be considered as the
                    delegate of Heaven over inferior animals, he has no right to go to the very
                    extremity of his authority. It is, however, much to be feared, that a
                    thoughtless indifference to the sufferings of the post-horse is too frequently
                    to be laid to travellers in our own country, who, without any sufficient reason,
                    urge him to a rate of speed which cannot be unattended with suffering.</p>
                <p>The form of the post-horse should resemble that of the hunter which is generally
                    ridden in the deep and close hunting countries of Great Britain; that is, with
                    as much blood as can be got, in conjunction with good bone and strength. The
                    riding horse of the pair must have sound legs and 'feet; but if a little the
                    worse for wear, an old hunter makes an excellent hand-horse, and innkeepers
                    generally avail themselves of the saving occasioned by putting horses of a less
                    price in that place than the one which carries the driver. Notwithstanding this,
                    the average purchase money of a useful pair of post-horses cannot be estimated
                    at less than from L. 40 to L. 60.</p>
                <p>THE CART-HORSE.</p>
                <p>Errors detected by experience are allowed to be equal to demonstration; but this
                    truism is not admitted by a vast majority of English farmers, who persevere in
                    the use of the heavy black horse for agricultural purposes, for which, solely,
                    he is by no means fitted, from the slowness of his step (independently of his
                    weight), unless very highly fed. As long, however, as the ponderous vehicles
                    made use of in London and elsewhere, for the transmission of heavy goods, are
                    persevered in, this equally ponderous animal may be necessary; but it is certain
                    that lighter horses, in lighter vehicles, would do the business better, that is,
                    more speedily, and at less cost. Notwithstanding the objections to him, the
                    heavy black cart-horse pays well for rearing; for being always saleable at two
                    years old, a certain profit is insured, as, for the first year, the expense of
                    keeping him is trifling. If on a large scale, and promising to be fit for the
                    London market, or the best-conducted road waggons, he commands a price that
                    leaves a handsome surplus to the breeder</p>
                <p>The chief desiderata in the cart-horse are substance and action. If possessed of
                    the latter, his shoulders and fore quarters can scarcely be too coarse and
                    heavy; for drawing being an effort of the animal to preserve himself from the
                    tendency which his weight gives him to the centre of gravity when he inclines
                    forward, so the more weighty he is before, and the nearer he approximates this
                    centre, the more advantageously will he apply his powers. Notwithstanding this,
                    we are not advocates of heavy horses for farmer’s work, much less on the road.
                    The lighter horse gets over in eight hours what would take the heavy one ten;
                    and the great improvement in the present mode of culture, and the implements
                    used for agricultural purposes, do not require more weight or strength than what
                    the Suffolk, Clydesdale, Cleveland-bay, and other lighter breeds, are masters
                    of. Besides, there are periods of the year when despatch of business is of great
                    moment to the farmer, which he cannot command in those mountains of horse-flesh
                    which we see labouring in most of the finest districts in England, tiring
                    themselves by their own weight.</p>
                <p>Travellers on the Continent, occupying land in England, should carry in their eye
                    the form and action of the horses which draw the public carriages, particularly
                    those bred in Picardy, in France. The prevailing colour is <hi rend="italic"
                    >iron</hi> roan, and their nature appears to sympathise with that colour; for,
                    speaking figuratively, they are as hard as iron itself. It is not unusual to
                    find four or five of them drawing those cumbrous diligences, weighing perhaps
                    six or seven tons, a twenty-mile stage, at the rate of six miles an hour,
                    preserving up their condition to the highest pitch; and this with hay and corn
                    very inferior in quality to that grown in England. To keep up the condition of
                    the English black cart-horse, requires him to consume nearly as much as his
                    labour is worth; and unless he lives well, he is only half alive, which his
                    sluggish action denotes. In fact, his chief fault lies in his having too great a
                    body, and too little spirit, consequently he exhausts himself in the mere act of
                    carrying that body. The nimbleness of the smaller kinds of carthorses to which
                    we have alluded, is owing to their moderate size; and their immense powers in
                    lifting weight (with the Suffolk, Punch, and Clydesdale breeds, in particular)
                    to the same cause, combined with the low position of the shoulder, which
                    occasions weight to be acted upon in a just and horizontal direction. The Welsh
                    cart-horses, especially those in use in the counties of Denbigh, Merio-nith, and
                    Montgomery, are eminently adapted to all agricultural purposes, combining much
                    strength with a great share of activity; and the general criteria of wide
                    breast, with low shoulders, good carcass, and small head, indicate their being
                    good workers, with hardihood of constitution. Their height is about fifteen
                    hands two inches; and their colour black or brown.</p>
                <p>THE IRISH HORSE.</p>
                <p>The Irish hackney may be reckoned amongst the indigenae of his country, a <hi
                    rend="italic">sui generis</hi> animal, not mixed, as the English hackney is,
                    with the black cart-horse, originally brought from Flanders, of which sort
                    Ireland has none. He is remarkable for the general soundness of his feet, which
                    are stronger in the heels than those of English horses, and he stands his work
                    well, if not too much abused in his youth. Almost all Irish horses coming under
                    this description have been broken in to the plough and the car, so they, for the
                    most part, go in harness; but the worst fault they have is not having been
                    properly broken in, and bitted, which is the cause of many of them being
                    restive.</p>
                <p>The Irish hunter is a very different animal from what he was half a century back.
                    He was always celebrated for leaping, but until lately the want of breeding
                    rendered him nearly useless as a hunter, in the countries which require speed,
                    as well as the accomplishment of leaping. At the present time great numbers of
                    excellent well-bred Irish hunters are annually imported into England, and being
                    found to answer well, fetch good prices. This is the result of horse-breeders in
                    Ireland seeing the necessity of putting their hunting mares to thorough-bred
                    stallions, and not, as before, to the slow, <hi rend="italic">great-jumping</hi>
                    hunter, no matter how low his breed. The improved cross, being again put to the
                    thorough-bred stallion, of course has produced a still better kind of animal,
                    and thus are Irish hunters “progressing” towards perfection.</p>
                <p>The method of leaping of the native Irish horse is pe <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193646856" xml:id="kp-eb0711-6856-0597"/>culiarly suited to some of
                    our English counties, Cheshire and Lancashire, for example, and likewise to
                    those inclosed with walls both in England and Scotland. To use an expressive
                    Irish phrase, “they have always a leg to spare,” implying that they have a ready
                    use of their hinder legs; which is the fact, in tipping or touching walls or
                    banks, with one or both, which gives them a fresh fulcrum, from which they can
                    extend their leap, in case of their finding an unforeseen difficulty or obstacle
                    on the landing side. In the wall counties of Ireland, indeed, the horses are
                    taught to alight on their hinder legs upon the summit of the wall, after the
                    manner of the dog when he leaps a gate, which, if the wall be broad and firm,
                    adds to the facility of the exertion, as also to the safety of the rider. Irish
                    hunters are generally good brook jumpers, being educated, indeed bred, amongst
                    drains; but field gates, or stiles, being of rare occurrence in the pastoral
                    districts of Ireland, they are not to be relied upon as timber leapers, until
                    they have been initiated to that description of fence.</p>
                <p>Persons who have had experience in Irish hunters have found them very shy of
                    having a whip, with a thong to it, made use of by the rider, either for the
                    purpose of smacking it, or to strike an unruly hound. This we fear proceeds from
                    unnecessary severity in the exercise of the whip in breaking, but which would be
                    obviated if breeders were aware of the inconvenience it occasions to servants,
                    who are called upon to ride Irish horses with hounds, in the capacity of
                    huntsmen or whippers-in. We have seen a few of these horses nearly useless from
                    this cause, as servants’ horses; although well suited in every other respect, to
                    this peculiar purpose, from their style of fencing and hardiness.</p>
                <p>The Irish race-horse was formerly far behind the English, neither is it probable
                    that he will ever be his equal, from circumstances unnecessary to detail. Some
                    horses, however, coming under the denomination of good runners, have been
                    imported from Ireland within the last twenty years; for which we are principally
                    indebted to Lords Sligo and Rossmore, and to the late Mr Bowes Daly, who was
                    esteemed the best judge of breeding racers that Ireland ever could boast of. It
                    must, however, be admitted, that horses bred and trained in one country, and
                    running in another, meet their rivals under disadvantageous circumstances.</p>
                <p>THE SCOTCH HORSE.</p>
                <p>Like all cold countries, Scotland is unfavourable to breeding the race-horse in
                    his best form; and the only prospect of rearing him to any thing approaching
                    perfection, is to shelter him with unusual care from the weather, when either
                    cold or wet, and to force him with the highest keep. Scottish-bred hunters,
                    however, are esteemed in the hunting world as a stout, hardy race, and they,
                    like the Irish, are now well enough bred to live with hounds at the present
                    speedy rate at which those animals run, according to the fashion of the present
                    day. Of the native Highland pony, it is unnecessary to say much, its merits
                    being so well known; and the Scotch cart-horses are decidedly the best in Great
                    Britain. The peculiar variety known as Clydesdale horses, stand first in repute.
                    Of the origin of this race, various accounts have been given, but none of them
                    so clear or so well authenticated, as to merit much notice. They acquired their
                    appellation, not because they are peculiar to Clydesdale, as the same
                    description of horses are bred in the other western counties of Scotland, and
                    over all that tract which lies between the Clyde and the Forth, but because the
                    principal markets at which they are sold, namely, Lanark, Carnwath, Rutherglen,
                    and Glasgow, are situated in that district, where they are also preserved in a
                    state of greater purity than in most other parts. They are rather larger than
                    the Suffolk-punch, and the neck is somewhat longer; their colour is black,
                    brown, or grey; all the essential points for heavy draught are very
                    conspicuously developed; and they are extremely docile withal, and excellent at
                    what is called a dead pull. Some magnificent specimens of this breed are to be
                    seen in the streets of Glasgow, in the service of the merchants and carriers;
                    and a beautiful plate of an entire one forms one of the illustrations of the
                    article <hi rend="smallcaps">Agriculture</hi> in the present Work (Plate XIII.)
                    We have reason to believe, that, if tried by a dynamometer, the Clydesdale horse
                    would exceed any other of his inches and weight in his powers of draught; and
                    his quick step adds much to his value.</p>
                <p>GENERAL TREATMENT OF HORSES.</p>
                <p>Humanity and mercy are esteemed the choicest characteristics of man; and there is
                    hardly a greater instance of ill-nature, or a more certain token of a cruel
                    disposition, than the abuse of dumb animals, especially of those who contribute
                    to our convenience and pleasures. Judge Hale beautifully expresses himself on
                    this subject in his Contemplations: “There is a degree of justice,” says he,
                    “due from man to the creatures, as from man to man; and an excessive use of the
                    creatures’ labour, is an injustice for which he must account. I have therefore
                    always esteemed it a part of my duty to be merciful to my beasts.” But we might
                    as well expect mercy from the hyaena, as compassion for the sufferings of horses
                    in the possession of a certain portion of the community, who purchase them when
                    nearly worn out, and work them till nature sinks. We know of no remedy for this;
                    but it is pleasing to reflect, that, in the better classes of society, so noble,
                    generous, and useful an animal as the horse, is now freed from many evils to
                    which he was formerly subjected. The short-docking of the carthorse, the effect
                    of prejudice and ignorance, it being supposed to add strength to his back, is
                    very generally discontinued, and he is allowed the use of a full tail, the only
                    natural defence against the torment of flies in the summer. Those barbarous
                    operations, nicking the tail, and cropping the ears of pleasure horses, are very
                    seldom had recourse to; neither is firing the limbs nearly so frequent a remedy
                    as it was, veterinary science having substituted other equally efficacious, but
                    less painful means. And, though last, not least, the improved condition, and the
                    effect of better stable management, of all horses employed in fast work, whether
                    on the race-course, in the field, or on the road, has very considerably lessened
                    their sufferings. On this subject we offer the following remarks :—</p>

                <p>Nothing has more largely contributed towards the celebrity of the horses of Great
                    Britain, than the superior management of them in the stable, or what is termed
                    their “condition.” Every species of horse has experienced the benefit of it, and
                    we have reason to believe it has attained perfection, under the improved system
                    adapted to each variety of the animal. The training of the racehorse is brought
                    to such a nicety, that his running can be calculated nearly to a certainty by
                    his work, that is, by the number of sweats and gallops he has had before his
                    race; and the stage-coach and post-horse now come forth from their stalls in all
                    the pride of health and spirits, instead of being the pitiable objects they were
                    not fifty years back. Not only the hackney, but the agricultural horse, has
                    partaken of this advantageous addition to natural powers, and which, if not
                    unnecessarily trespassed upon, very considerably diminishes the severity of his
                    daily labour. But the greatest change for the better has been effected in the
                    physical condition of the hunter, who now appears at the cover side in' the
                    vigorous state of the race-horse; in a state, in fact, in which he ought to
                    ap-&lt; pear, inasmuch as he is called upon to go at a racing pace and yet, if
                    fairly ridden throughout the chase, he is by thi means rendered nearly superior
                    to fatigue. How all this ha <pb break="no" facs="nls:193646869"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0711-6869-0598"/>been accomplished, we will endeavour to shew; and
                    at the, same time to make it apparent, that although Nature never presents us
                    with animals in what we call condition (a state altogether artificiaD, yet she
                    is ever ready and desirous to meet the demands of Art, when scientifically and
                    judiciously made upon her.</p>
                <p>The improvement in training the race-horse has been the result of two distinct
                    causes, each equally likely to produce the desired effect. First, practical
                    experience, an excellent schoolmaster in such matters; and, secondly, both
                    breeders and trainers of this animal now look into books, not only reading them,
                    but reflecting upon what they read. Having been told, on indisputable authority,
                    that the highly rarefied air and arid soil of Arabia, produce muscular power and
                    firmly condensed bone in the horse, not to be found elsewhere, and that the
                    antelope, the fleetest animal in the world, is fleeter there than in, any, other
                    part of the globe, they have naturally been led to the conclusion, that the
                    opposite agents of humid atmosphere and succulent food have a directly opposite
                    effect; that by increasing flesh and humours, they tend in proportion to
                    diminish muscular firmness, solidity of bone, and, consequently, elasticity of
                    action, the main-spring of both speed and endurance; in short, to alter, if not
                    to destroy, all those points which are so peculiarly characteristic of the
                    animal in which they themselves are interested. They have at length found out,
                    that the race-horse should have not an ounce of unnecessary bulk in his frame;
                    on the contrary, that he should have as much power as can possibly be produced
                    in a given space; and that all this can only be effected here by something
                    approaching to the means by which it is effected elsewhere. A knowledge of these
                    facts, then, has produced a substitute for the natural advantages of the horse
                    of the Desert, in warm sheds, very small and dry paddocks, aŋd hard, dry food,
                    for our racing colts, instead of large paddocks, plentifully clothed with grass,
                    often of the coarsest description, imperfectly formed sheds, and not more than
                    half the corn eaten by them at present. As we have already observed, a
                    racing-colt may now be said to be in training, if not from the day on which he
                    is foaled, from that on which he is weaned; for his condition, at least the
                    foundation of it, is from that period in progress. Again, the early period of
                    his going into work, compared with what it formerly was, but now become so
                    general, has not been without its effect. It has called forth additional
                    exercise of the trainer’s professional skill; for it may easily be imagined,
                    that, bringing very yonng horses to the post, in the perfect state of condition,
                    and full development of muscular power, in which we now-a-days see them at every
                    race-meeting in 0∏r island, is a very difficult task, and that it is a still
                    more difficult one to preserve them in that state, even for a few days. Both
                    constitution and temper being to be consulted, tlie very refinement of the art
                    is called for; in faet, the trainer must act upon principle, and very cautiously
                    too, in his efforts ζo forestal nature. Inasmuch, however, as .muscular action
                    produces muscular strength, the racer of the present day, reared as he is
                    reared, and consequently in a more condensed form, does not, with few
                    exceptions, require .the very severe vŗork which it was formerly necessary to
                    give him, to increase his muscular powers, as well as to rid him of the bulk of
                    flesh and humours he acquired in his colthood, under the old system of rearing
                    him. A sight of our two-year olds at the starting-post, is the best
                    demonstration of what is here stated. They exhibit a development of muscle in
                    their forced and early ιnaturity almost equal to that of the adult horse, and
                    carry eight stones and upwards, at a racing pace; a weight unheard of upon so
                    young an. animal in former times. How far, however, this forced maturity and its
                    consequences, namely, severe work, and the excitement of high keep, at so tender
                    an age, are favourable to him or to his produce in after life, is another
                    question; but the use of a system should never be estimated by the abuse of it.
                    If our race-horses are not, and we believe they are not, so stout in their
                    running as formerly, that is to say, twenty years back, the cause may fairly be
                    traced to the great value of produce stakes and others, which bring them to the
                    post at so early an age; so much so, that, in the language of the Turf, a
                    four-year-old colt of the present day is called <hi rend="italic">“the old
                    horse.”</hi></p>
                <p>But a still more material alteration for the better has taken place within the
                    last few years in the stable management and condition of the British hunter,
                    arising principally from a different treatment of him in the non-hunting months.
                    It had, from time immemorial, been the usual remark of the sportsman, on his
                    hunters being turned out of their stable in the spring, for the <hi
                    rend="italic">supposed</hi> necessary advantage of the “summer’s run at grass,”
                    that it was to be lamented that the hunting season was concluded, as the
                    condition of his stud was so perfect. The fact was, that until then, or nearly
                    till then, they had not been in condition at all; and, how strange soever it may
                    appear to any one reflecting upon, the subject, by the act of turning them to
                    grass for this “summer’s run,” he was about to undo all that his groom and
                    himself had been doing during the nine preceding months, namely, to destroy the
                    perfect state of condition which he was at that time lamenting over. Still more
                    strange, however, is the fact, that although the evils of this out-of-door
                    system for three months in the year, to an animal who lived the other nine in
                    warm stables and well clothed, w ere hinted at by Mr Beckford, in his celebrated
                    <hi rend="italic">Letters upon ∖Hunting,</hi> and abandoned by a few of our
                    first-rate sportsmen of, and subsequent to, his dav, and particularly about the
                    commencement of the present century, by the example of the Earl of Sefton, when
                    be was owner of the Quorndon hounds, in Leicestershire, still the ruinous system
                    of the three, and generally four months’ run at grass (viz. from 1st of May to
                    the 12th or 20th of August) continued to be practised, until these evils were
                    exposed in all their appalling deformity, and the advantages of an opposite
                    system made manifest, in a series of letters in the <hi rend="italic">Old
                    Spprting Magazine,</hi> under the signature of“Nimrod,” which have since been
                    published in a separate form, and very widely circulated. We may also add,· that
                    the effect of this exposure has been nearly a general abandonment of the grazing
                    system in the studs of all men who mean to ride near hounds.</p>
                <p>Previously to our enumerating the real Advantages of the modern system of
                    “summering the hunter,” we will state the imaginary ones of the old one, and
                    which, as may be supposed, arc still held to be such, by those who reluctantly
                    acquiesce in any kind of reform. First, the purging by spring grass is insisted
                    upon. Secondly, a relaxation of the muscles, and what is called a letting down
                    of the whole system to its natural state. Thirdly, the benefit the feet receive
                    from the dews of the evening, and coming in contact with the cool earth.
                    Fourthly, the saving of expenses. Fifthly, a kind . feeling towards the animal,
                    who, they say, is entitled to his liberty for a certain period of the year, also
                    to the free enjoyment of his natural state. And, lastly, the absoluto necessity
                    of rest to the limbs, after the labours of the preceding season. We wdll now
                    make our own comment on eaçh of these presumed faets.</p>
                <p>And, first, w e admit there is a laxative, and therefore a cooling, property in
                    early spring grass, but as a purgative it js insufficient, which is admitted by
                    the fact of its having been, generally considered necessary to give two dozes of
                    physic to hunters previously to their being turned abroad for the summer (thus
                    administering the antidote, as it w ere, before the poison), and to physic them
                    immediately when taken up. Here, then, is at once an answer to the first
                    objection to the improved system of in-door treatment in the summer; even
                    supposing that, spring grass could not be given to a horse in a loose box,
                    whereas it is evident that, it can.</p>
                <p>Secondly, the entire letting down of the system, by a <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193646882" xml:id="kp-eb0711-6882-0599"/>sudden change of food from
                    that which is highly invigorating to that which is only succulent and relaxing,
                    is neither called for, nor can it be wholesome. It is never had recourse to with
                    the race-horse during his period of inactivity, and why should it be with the
                    hunter? We would ask the owner of a horse so treated, how he thinks it would
                    agree with his own constitution and his <hi rend="italic">digestion,</hi> to be
                    suddenly taken from beef and port-wine to a purely vegetable diet; and the
                    analogy holds good.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>In
                    No. 59, vol. v. p. 645, of the <hi rend="italic">Veterinarian,</hi> we find the
                    Editor coinciding with Nimrod on this point, in his second review of his Letters
                    on Condition. <hi rend="superscript"> a</hi> These pithy and valuable extracts,”
                    says he, “at the same time that they serve to expose our author’s views in
                    regard to summering the hunter, demonstrate a sagacity and experience on the
                    subject, no less worthy of the admiration of the professional man, than of the
                    sportsman himself. The leading consideration in summering the hunter is to
                    maintain his condition, or rather, we should say, to guard against his losing
                    that which we know, both by education as medical men, and experience as
                    sportsmen, once lost, will require much time and pains to be re-acquired. Change
                    of food is necessarily productive, in the animal constitution, of alteration of
                    structure; though parts cannot be said to change their nature under their
                    influence, yet they do become greatly altered both in texture and in
                    tone.”</p></note></p>
                <p>Thirdly, a great mistake has prevailed on this point, the preservation of the
                    feet. A certain degree of moisture is beneficial to the foot of the horse, a
                    continued exposure to wet most injurious to it, as the certain cause of
                    thrushes, and in time total destruction of the frogs. Thus, history informs us
                    that the horses in Hannibal’s army were rendered unserviceable by travelling
                    many days in succession in very wet ground. But we have better authority here
                    than that of Livy, because it applies to horses which wore shoes, whereas
                    Hannibal’s wore none. Mr Goodwin senior, late veterinary surgeon to his Majesty
                    George IV., in his work on the Diseases of the Feet (p. 209, 1st edit.), has the
                    following passage, in allusion to the evils of having the feet of horses
                    saturated, as they must be during a summer, with wet at one time, and then
                    suddenly exposed to a hot sun and a drying wind at another. “I have invariably
                    observed,” says Mr Goodwin, “where horses are turned out to grass during the dry
                    and hot summer months, that on bringing them up to be put into stable condition,
                    their feet are in a much worse state than they were when they went out, dried
                    up, and so hard and brittle, that, on the application of a tool to bring them
                    into a form to receive a shoe, the horn breaks like a piece of glass, and all
                    the naturally tough and elastic property is lost, so that it requires some
                    months to remove the bad effects. If it is necessary that a horse should be put
                    out of work during the hot and dry weather, I prefer a large box or shed, and
                    soiling with green food; by which means two objects are gained, viz. all the <hi
                    rend="italic">injurious</hi> effects of a drying wind or a meridian sun on the
                    hoof are avoided, which create such an excessive evaporation of the natural
                    moisture absorbed into the horn from within, that it not only becomes dry, hard,
                    and brittle, but the whole horny box tightens on the sensible parts, and
                    frequently produces great mischief. But in a loose place, moisture may be
                    applied in any desirable way.” In addition to the above, Mr Goodwin says,
                    “Horses at grass are much inclined to thrushes ;” which renders it unnecessary
                    for us to say more on this subject at present, although we shall by-and-bye
                    offer the result of our own experience in the treatment of horses’ feet in the
                    summer.</p>
                <p>Fourthly, a saving in expense. This is an objection too trifling to be admitted
                    in opposition to any real advantages. It was calculated by Nimrod,<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Two tons five hundred-weights
                    of hay, at L.4 per ton, L.9 0 0</p><p>Śeventy-one bushels of oats, at 4s. 6d.

                    allowing only four shillings per week to have been the charge for each horse,
                    supposing him to have been summered at grass, that the extra expense of his six
                    hunters summered after his system, which we shall further explain, amounted to
                    only L∙13, 18s. The mere chance in favour of exemption from accidents to which
                    horses abroad are liable, is worth more than this inconsiderable sum to the man
                    who keeps six hunters in his stable; but twice its amount would be realized in
                    the sale of any of the six, if offered at the hammer in November, beyond the sum
                    he would have produced had he been summered solely in the fields.</p>
                <p>Fifthly, we would go any length in advocating the extreme of kind treatment to so
                    noble an animal as the horse; but experience has taught us, that neither the
                    open field, nor the shade, is a bed of roses, in the summer months, to the
                    well-bred, and naturally thin-skinned hunter; for the oestrum, or blood-sucker,
                    pursues him in each; and the desperate attempts he often makes to avoid them,
                    shews the horror he has of their attacks. But, unluckily for the advocates of
                    this system, one of the greatest evils of the out-of-door system here stares us
                    in the face. If the horse cannot get away from this host of tormentors, his only
                    remedy against them is, galloping from one end of Fis pasture to the other, or
                    else stamping with his feet against the hard ground, and often against the roots
                    of trees, to scare them from one part of his body, only to settle upon another.
                    The injury to both feet and legs from a daily succession of these operations,
                    may be left to the imagination of the reader; but against the charge of cruelty,
                    we quote the following remark from <hi rend="italic">Nimrod’s Letters</hi> (p.
                    268, first edition): “In the very hot weather,” (he is speaking of the summer of
                    1825, which was remarkable for the intenseness of its heat), “I made a few
                    observations, which are not irrelevant to my present purpose, particularly as to
                    the charge of cruelty in keeping hunters in the house, in the summer. On the
                    29th of July, one of the hottest days, the thermometer was one degree higher, at
                    two o’clock at noon, in my two four-stall stables, in each of which three horses
                    had stood for sixteen days and nights, than it was in the entrance-hall of my
                    house, which is twenty-three feet high, and contains three large windows and six
                    doors, and the aspect due east. Now, will any one tell me, that the most tender
                    animal could be injured by breathing such an atmosphere as this? But all is not
                    yet told. I removed the thermometer on the same day, and at the same hour, into
                    the shade, and there it was <hi rend="italic">four degrees higher than in my two
                    four-stall stables.</hi> Here, then, the objection to horses standing ‘ sweating
                    in the stables in the summer time,’ returns to its real insignificance.”</p>
                <p>Lastly, upon the subject of rest, and the means of pró-curing the advantages of
                    it to the hunter by a summer’s run in the fields, we cannot do better than quote
                    from the same author, “When discussing the subject,” says he, (p. 262), “of
                    summering hunters with a friend, who is an advocate for the grazing system, he
                    made use of the following expression: ‘ I dare say it may be all very well to
                    keep them in the house in the summer, but then they have not the benefit of <hi
                    rend="italic">the rest</hi> which they get when at grass.’ I could not help
                    smiling at this strange perversion of facts; and ventured to ask him, Whether,
                    if he were examined in natural philosophy, and asked, <hi rend="italic"
                    >what</hi><hi rend="italic">is rest,</hi> he would answer, <hi rend="italic"
                    >motion</hi><hi rend="italic">?</hi> and that would not be a whit less <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193646895" xml:id="kp-eb0711-6895-0600"/>absurd. If rest be
                    desirable, as we know it is, for a hunter’s legs, after the labours of a winter,
                    surely he must obtain it more effectually in a small confined place, than when
                    suffered to run over a large tract of land, and to stamp the ground with his
                    feet for so many hours each day.” Neither does the labour to the legs end here.
                    All persons who have ridden horses, whose growth has been forced in their
                    bodies, as that of most hunters has been, must have perceived that, when letting
                    them drink in shallow water, their fore-legs totter under them, in the attempt
                    to reach the water with their mouth. Such is the case with the hunter, at least
                    with the properly formed one, when in the act of grazing (for the horse prefers
                    a short bite); and the tre-mour in his legs shews the stress that is laid upon
                    them, to enable him to reach his food. In fact, many horses (and we could name
                    some well known hunters) cannot reach the ground at all with their mouths,
                    unless it be by the painful position of placing one fore-foot close to their
                    mouth, and the other even with the hinder legs; and consequently their owners
                    have not been able to turn them out, had they been inclined to do so.</p>
                <p>It is now our turn to be heard on this important subject to all owners of
                    hunters; and we proceed to state, that the principal objection to summering a
                    horse abroad, consists in the danger we expose him to by the violent change from
                    a stable at the temperature of 63° (the common one of hunting stables), and the
                    addition of warm clothing, to a bed upon the cold ground on a wet night; or,
                    which often happens in the month of May, to the influence of sharp frost; all
                    this, also, when the animal has scarcely any coat on his back to provide against
                    the effects of bad weather; and with a skin highly porous, from long continued
                    friction in the stable. As well might we expect to find animals and plants that
                    can sustain the heat of the torrid, and the cold of the frigid zone, as horses
                    to bear those extremes with impunity! On the contrary, it is the confirmed
                    opinion of most veterinary surgeons, that more hunters have been ruined by
                    becoming roarers, broken-winded, or blind, from this cause, than from any other
                    to which they are subjected; and they are backed in their opinion by reason. For
                    it is not necessary that the ncwly-turned-out hunter should be exposed to either
                    a wet or a frosty night, to produce disordered functions; the common exhalations
                    from the ground in the evening, are sufficient to produce them, by a sudden
                    constriction of the pores, opened as they have been by the effect of a hot sun
                    during the day. “Heat and cold, moisture and dryness,” says Mr Percival,
                    veterinary surgeon to the First Life Guards, and author of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Anatomy of the Horse,</hi> in his last work on the Horse (p. 64), when treating
                    on the theory of inflammation, “all in their turn become excitants of
                    inflammation; their mischievous <hi rend="subscript"> Ļ</hi> agency residing
                    more in the vicissitudes from one state to its opposite, than in any
                    obnoxiousness in our climate, from their excess or continuance. They may operate
                    either directly as excitants, or indirectly, simply as predisposing causes.” Few
                    veterinarians, indeed, as Mr Percival expresses himself, now-a-days, feel
                    inclined to deny the uncongeniality of cold and wet, to the constitutions of
                    horses, or to maintain, that they do not very often, in such situations,
                    contract the foundations for disease, which, at some future time, is apt to
                    break out, and prove fatal to them. Nor are the remarks of this scientific
                    practitioner and most perspicuous writer, less to our purpose, when speaking of
                    the horse that is turned out of his stable in the winter. “1 akc a horse,” says
                    he, in his chapter on ‘ Hide-bound,’ (p. 296), “fat and sleek in condition, out
                    of a warm stable, where he has been well clothed and fed, turn him, during the
                    cold and wet of winter into <hi rend="italic">a</hi> straw-yard, and go and look
                    at him three months afterwards, and you will hardly recognise your own horse.
                    You will find him with a long, shaggy, staring coat; a belly double the size it
                    was when in condition; and a skin sticking close and fast to his ribs, which may
                    now be readily counted with the hand, if not with the eye.” But here the analogy
                    between the horse turned out to grass in the summer, and the horse sent to a
                    straw-yard in the winter, ceases. The latter loses flesh, and becomes
                    hide-bound, both of which will find a remedy in a return to more generous food
                    in the stable, with the assistance, of alterative medicine; and he will speedily
                    resume his condition. But it will not be so with the grass-fed hunter. He has
                    accumulated a load of soft, unhealthy flesh, which must be got rid of at the
                    expense of his legs and feet; or, in the language of grooms, “it must be
                    exchanged for better flesh, the produce of hay and corn.” By feeding <hi
                    rend="italic">ad libitum,</hi> however, he has so plethorized his system, and
                    trespassed upon his digestive organs, that this is become not merely a work of
                    labour and time, but one of no small risk to the general soundness of his
                    constitution. Nor is even this the extent of the mischief. Under the most
                    favourable circumstances, it is not in the power of a groom, how good soever he
                    may be, to bring the grass-fed hunter into the field, fit to be ridden, with
                    hounds, until the lχunting season is half expired. For proof of this assertion,
                    we need only go to the race-horse, who cannot be made fit to run under, at
                    least, six months’ preparation, although he has not been at grass since he was
                    six months old. Nature will not be put out of her course by violence; and horses
                    can only be got into good condition by degrees, by long continued slow work at
                    first, increasing in pace as their condition increases; and it has been the
                    attempt to get the grass-fed hunter into something approaching to condition, by
                    hurrying him in his work, under a load of flesh, and with his muscles in a
                    relaxed state, that has ruined thousands of good horses, by the injury done to
                    their legs especially; and will ruin thousands more, if persevered in. The
                    change of food, again, has been the cause of more broken-winded horses than any
                    thing else that can be named. “It must dispose,” says Mr Percival, “from its
                    being the chief cause of plethora, to general diathesis of the system; and so
                    far it contributes to tfie production of pneumonia, or any other inflammatory
                    affection.” To this we may add blindness, the natural consequence of the
                    dependent posture of the head when feeding, in an animal in the plethoric state
                    that a previously highly-fed hunter must fall into, after being some weeks at
                    grass; and likewise of constant irritation from flies and sun. Neither should
                    the following remark of Mr Percival’s be forgotten by gentlemen who turn out
                    their hunters during a wet summer. “Cold,” says he, “abstractedly from wet, even
                    although it be alternated with heat, is not found to be near so prejudicial as
                    when moisture is present too; hence we are in the habit of viewing frosty
                    weather as a season of health among horses; and hence it is, that the spring and
                    autumnal months are the most unhealthy, the weather being then moist and
                    variable, and the wind generally in a cold quarter.” Again, “Two undomesticated
                    horses,” says he, “out of three, under five years old, that arc taken from cold
                    situations, and kept in warm stables, will receive catarrh. But even
                    domesticated horses that are advanced in years, and that have been accustomed to
                    such changes, do not always escape, unless some precautionary measures be taken;
                    for hunters taken up from grass in August, unless due attention be paid to the
                    temperature of the stable, are often the subjects of catarrhal attacks.”</p>
                <p>Perhaps the summer of 1835 may be produced in proof of the danger of subjecting
                    stabled horses to atmospherical changes. In the first week of June, 78, 80, 82,
                    and 84 de grees of heat were marked by the thermometer. On the 13th, the maximum
                    of heat was 15 degrees less than that of the preceding day; and on the 23d, the
                    thermometer fell to 47 degrees, succeeded by four days’ rain, with wind veering
                    to south-east, back to west, then to north and northeast, at times furiously
                    high!</p>
                <p>We must be allowed two more remarks on the evils of <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193646908" xml:id="kp-eb0711-6908-0601"/>the out-of-door system.
                    Amongst the physical changes which the body is capable of receiving, none is so
                    visibly effected as in the diminished, or increased, size of the belly; and the
                    latter alternation of form is speedily effected by a horse eating grass, and
                    nothing but grass. When a man goes into training for a match against time, or a
                    prize-fight, the first act of his trainer is, to reduce the size of his belly;
                    for, until that is done, his respiration is not free enough to enable him to
                    make such bodily exertions as are essential to augment his natural vigour, and
                    put him into the best possible condition; and this exactly applies to the
                    grass-fed hunter taken up in August. He has exchanged an active untiring frame,
                    for a bloated and breathless carcass; and nothing can be done with him until, by
                    purging and <hi rend="italic">severe work, when he is not in a fit state to
                    endure it with impunity,</hi> the nature of his frame is altered from weakness
                    to vigorous health. But this must be the work of time, for, although Nature will
                    admit of improvement, she will not allow herself to be hurried by the
                    unreasonable innovations of man.</p>
                <p>Our next remarks relate to bodily infirmities and local diseases, to which the
                    horse, by the severity of his labours, is always more or less subject. Several
                    of these, such as splents, spavins, curbs, and ring-bones, are easily checked,
                    if discovered in their incipient state; but when, by being undiscovered for only
                    a short time, a certain progress is made in them, the cure is far from certain,
                    at all events, more difficult. Now, under the old system of the summer’s run
                    abroad, this was most frequently the case. Horses, when taken up, were found to
                    have thrown out those excrescences unperceived, which, as soon as they began to
                    work, caused lameness and disappointment; whereas, under the improved system of
                    summering the hunter, they could not have escaped the constant inspection of the
                    groom, and an immediate check would have been given to them. The short-cough,
                    vulgarly and stupidly called a “grass cough,” also too often swelled the
                    catalogue of disasters; and, in six cases out of ten, ended in broken wind or
                    roaring. But it may not here be amiss to address ourselves to owners of hunters,
                    who may adopt either one system or the other of treating them in the summer
                    months; we mean, as regards their legs, the treatment of which now forms a
                    conspicuous feature in the science of the stable, particularly the racing
                    stable. Many valuable animals are ruined in consequence of their owners and
                    their grooms not knowing, perhaps not wishing to know, when their legs are going
                    amiss, and consequently stopping them in their work, before the evil gets
                    a-head. It is irksome, no doubt, to give up the use of a hunter, especially if a
                    favourite one, and in blooming condition; but it is only by such prudent
                    conduct, that we can expect a lengthened enjoyment of his services. It is a
                    lamentable fact that, generally speaking, good-constitution-ed horses would wear
                    out two sets of legs and feet, which shews the urgent necessity of taking care
                    of them.</p>
                <p>* We now take our leave of the old, and, we may add, ruinous system of treating
                    hunters in the summer, and proceed to state how, in our opinion (the result of
                    much experience) they ought to be treated in the non-hunting months; as also to
                    offer a few directions for the management of them when in work. To begin, we are
                    far from averse to resting the hunter in the summer, although we cannot shut our
                    eyes to the fact of horses working hard for a great many years in succession,
                    without experiencing what is here meant by “<hi rend="italic">rest”</hi>
                    (namely, not having a saddle on their backs for three or four months), and
                    remaining sound and healthy to the end of a long life. Our great object is, to
                    give the hunter fair play, by preserving, instead of destroying, his condition
                    at the same time that we rest him; and in this we think, that, by preventing
                    exhaustion in his work when he returns to it, we offer him much more than an
                    equivalent for the fancied enjoyment of his “snuffing the air in his native
                    liberty,” and “making his bed on the cool ground,” so stoutly insisted upon by
                    many of the old school, who will not march with the times, and who cannot divest
                    themselves of prejudices, how dear soever they may cost them.</p>
                <p>The period of “turning <hi rend="italic">up,”</hi> not <hi rend="italic"
                    >“</hi><hi rend="italic">out,”</hi> hunters towards the close of the season
                    should depend on circumstances. Those whose legs may be doubtful, should be the
                    first thrown out of work; and after them old ones, who, how well soever they may
                    go over a country when it is soft, are in danger of breaking down when it
                    becomes hard, as it always does in March, particularly in ploughed
                    countries.</p>
                <p>The first act of a groom, when his horses have done their work for the season, is
                    to give them two doses of mild physic, which, by their effect on their legs,
                    will greatly assist him in discovering the amount, if any, of the injury that
                    may have been done to them. Should anything serious exhibit itself, we recommend
                    him (unless he be a first-rate professor of his art) to avail himself of the
                    advice of a veterinary surgeon, as to the steps proper to be taken; and the
                    sooner those steps are taken, the better wall it be for his horses. The
                    barbarous, the senseless, practice of blistering, generally the two fore-legs,
                    and often the hinder ones also, previously to turning out, under the old system,
                    is now, we are glad to say, abandoned, not only on account of its inutility,
                    but, by the spread of veterinary science, sportsmen have found out that the
                    application of blisters to healthy legs is injurious. The merely irritating the
                    surface of the skin cannot be productive of advantage; on the contrary, it often
                    rouses the sleeping lion, which it is after wards difficult to pacify. As
                    counteractors of internal inflammation, or as counter-irritants, as they are
                    called, blisters are highly useful; likewise to all bony excrescences, such as
                    splents, spavins, or ring-bones, when in an incipient state; but, in order to
                    render them efficacious, they should be repeated till healthy pus is obtained.
                    If judiciously applied in strains, they are also not unserviceable, as they help
                    to unload the vessels near the affected part. Supposing, then, no serious
                    mischief has been done to the legs of a hunter during the season, we thus
                    proceed in our course of treatment of him :—</p>
                <p>Previously to stripping him of his clothes, he should go through his second dose
                    of physic, and be treated exactly as if he were in work for at least a fortnight
                    afterwards, with the exception of his having only walking exercise, a diminished
                    allowance of corn, and the wisp, without the brush, applied to his body. We now
                    arrive at a point on which there is some difference of opinion, at all events,
                    one which must be left to the option of the owner; namely, whether, as is the
                    practice in the stables of some of oπr first-rate sportsmen, the hunter is to be
                    kept in gentle work throughout the summer, or to be thrown entirely aside fof a
                    certain number of weeks, varying from nine to twelve? We will, however, state
                    the best method of proceeding under each of these systems.</p>
                <p>The horse kept in work (we should rather have said exercise) during the summer,
                    should be exercised very early in the morning on soft, but not wet ground (a low
                    meadow, or rather a marshy common, for example), that his feet may have the
                    advantage of moisture, and also that he may not be tormented by flies, or
                    exposed to a hot sun. Two hours will be sufficient, the pace to be varied
                    alternately from the walk to the jog-trot. It is desirable that a horse thus
                    treated should not be tied up in a stall, but have the enjoyment of a large
                    loose-house. Of course, attention should be paid to his feet, removing his shoes
                    every third or fourth week; and they should be stopped with wet tow every second
                    night. To those who object to this in-door treatment of the hunter on the score
                    of danger to his feet, we can only say, from our own experience, that their
                    fears are groundless; and we also refer them to the first cavalry <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193646921" xml:id="kp-eb0711-6921-0602"/>barrack they pass by, or even
                    to the stables of our innkeepers on the road, in which they will find feet in
                    the highest state of preservation, that have been subject to indoor treatment
                    for many years. We prefer damp tow to any other sort of stopping for horses’
                    feet, because, exclusive of the moisture, it affords a uniform pressure to the
                    frog and outer sole of the foot, which is favourable to their healthy state.
                    Indeed, to some of the finely-formed, open feet which we see on first-rate
                    hunters, the soles of which are apt to be thin, this pressure is most
                    advantageous in preventing a disposition in them to become flat or convex,
                    instead of moderately concave; and for this purpose was the “horsepad,” or
                    “elastic stopping,” invented by Mr Cherry, veterinary surgeon of London, which
                    may be preferable to the tow, but not always at hand. When the latter is used,
                    it should be forced into the foot with all the strength of a man’s fingers or
                    thumb.</p>
                <p>The food of hunters thus summered should be regulated by circumstances. Good
                    flesh, we know, is strength; but that which is generated in comparative idleness
                    only con-tribùtes to weakness. Our object, then, should be to prevent a horse,
                    treated in the ííianner we now allude to, from throwing up much flesh, and we
                    must therefore feed accordingly, and also study constitution. At all events,
                    three small feeds of oats (we do not feel ourselves justified in recommending
                    beans, although we know some sportsmen give them; except in very peculiar cases,
                    such as extreme delicacy of constitution, a disposition to scour, or throw off
                    food) per day are sufficient for any horse, with the addition of a large,
                    sloppy, bran mash twice a-week. As to green food, we recommend that with
                    caution. We approve of its being given occasionally for three or four days in
                    succession, merely as soiling, to attenuate the blood, not to produce flesh; and
                    this repeated now and then at intervals, whilst the green meat (be it what it
                    may) is young, but by no means afterwards. Many grooms mix hay with green food,
                    which, after the first two or three times of giving it, we think a judicious
                    plan. But, be it observed, for reasons we have already given, we object to a
                    hunter acquiring a load of flesh in the summer, the produce of succulent food. A
                    moderate use of alteratives is beneficial throughout the summer to horses which
                    live well, but do not work, as, by their rpild and gradual impression, a healthy
                    action of the bowels is kept up, as well as insensible perspiration
                    increased.</p>
                <p>The horse <hi rend="italic">not kept in work</hi> should be thus treated in the
                    summer: He should run loose in the bay of a barn, or any large covered place
                    where he gets exercise, and breathes fresh air, without exposure to the sun. His
                    physic, food, &amp;c. should be as before directed; but as he is now unshod, and
                    consequently cannot have his hoofs filled with any thing which can Impart
                    moisture to them, he should be made to stand two hours every day, under cover,
                    in wetted clay. Unless after firing, or severe blistering, when the sedative
                    powers of cold air are efficacious in checking local inflammation, we prefer the
                    hunter being housed throughout the night, to his lying out even in a paddock, as
                    he is less liable to disease and accidents; but we admit that the danger of
                    exposure to night air is greatly diminished by his having been kept cool
                    throughout the day, by which he is less susceptible of atmospheric influence, or
                    the alternation from warmth to cold, than if his arterial system had been acted
                    upon by exposure to a mid-day sun. The sticklers, then, for the “dews of
                    heaven,” and the “bed upon the cool earth,” may here indulge their
                    predilections; but, for our own part, we give the preference to the house at
                    night with horses free from disease.</p>
                <p>The state of the horses, summered as we have now described, will in great measure
                    resemble each other, although, as may be supposed, the one which has been kept
                    on in his exercise will be most forward in condition. Neither of them, however,
                    will have lost much of their proper form; but a distinction must be made in our
                    proceedings with them, when preparing them for the forthcoming season. “Suffer a
                    horse to be idle,” says Mr Perceval <hi rend="italic">(Hippopathology,</hi> p.
                    14), “to do little or no work, and feed him well during the time, and the
                    redundant nourishment floating in his blood will be laid up in the form of fat;
                    put the same animal to work, and that blood, which otherwise would have been
                    turned into fat, will now be transformed into materials of strength.” Here,
                    then, it is evident that the horse which has been kept in exercise will require
                    somewhat of a different preparation to the one which has remained unshod, and
                    consequently idle. The first will require very little alteration in his
                    proceedings until nearly the approach of the hunting season, as he will soon be
                    prepared for quick work; but it will be by long-continued slow work, increasing
                    in pace as his condition increases, that the second will be quite himself again,
                    from the relaxed state of his muscles, somewhat redundant flesh, as well as his
                    distended belly. In either case, however, there will be no occasion for all that
                    physicking, galloping, and sweating, to get rid of bad, superfluous flesh, that
                    the grass-fed hunter has been subjected to; for if the groom has done his duty
                    by them, neither of these horses will have accumulated much more flesh than we
                    like to see on hunters when they first begin to work, and when that flesh is
                    good. We would have our second horse, the unshod one, taken into his stable
                    early in August; and during the latter end of that month and the next, in
                    addition to his daily exercise, he should, about three times in a fortnight,
                    have a gentle sweat in clothes, which is best effected in a trot, in a large
                    fallow field that has been lately harrowed down, and which is firm, not soft, to
                    the tread.</p>
                <p>But we fancy we hear the question asked, Is it not necessary to give physic to
                    all hunters when the summer is past, and previously to their taking the field
                    again in the winter? We answer, <hi rend="italic">No.</hi> The principal end of
                    physicking hunters is to allay excitement, occasioned by severe work and high
                    keep; and the next, for the benefit of their legs. Thus, for example, as the
                    first-named horse (the one that has been in gentle work throughout the summer),
                    will not sweat so easily as the unshod one, a light dose or two of physic may be
                    serviceable to him during his first preparation for the field, say in August or
                    September, as the means of saving his legs, should he be a
                    strong-consti-tutioned horse, and have thrown up too much flesh. But there is no
                    absolute necessity for physic at this period to horses that have been properly
                    treated throughout the summer, and not suffered to get foul or fat; and it will
                    be given with more advantage to them after they have been some time at work, or
                    nearer to the commencement of the hunting season, which, after the manner of the
                    racing stable, may be termed a second preparation. We think, however, we cannot
                    do better here than to quote the following passage on this subject from the
                    April Numbeŗ, 1835, of the <hi rend="italic">New Sporting Magazine</hi> (vol.
                    viii. p. 353), as the ideas exactly correspond with our own.</p>
                <p>“To horses summered in the house, physic is now only administered when it is
                    wanted, as is the case with the race-horse; and the groom or his master ought to
                    be able to say <hi rend="italic">when.</hi> There are many directing symptoms
                    with horses in work, which cannot escape an observant eye; and we do not, as
                    formerly, wait for the swollen leg or the running sore. The barbarous practice,
                    also, of three doses in succession (as was the practice with the grass-fed
                    hunter on being stabled), <hi rend="superscript"> ζ</hi> the first to stir up
                    the humours, and the last to carry them off,’ with two strong urine balls to
                    wind up, by way of a remedy for consequent debility, is also happily exploded.
                    The strength of the dose is likewise greatly diminished, and consequently all
                    danger is avoided. We take upon ourselves to say, there is no more risk
                    attending administering physic to a horse, than there is in giving liim a
                    pailful of cold water, perhaps not so much; <pb break="no" facs="nls:193646934"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0711-6934-0603"/>that is, provided the drugs are good, and well put
                    together. We, hθλvever, strongly recommend all sportsmen and others to obtain
                    physic from the profession, as veterinarians be-stowmuch attention on the making
                    of itup, and obtaining the best aloes, in which there is much difference. The
                    sooner it passes off the better; and this will be much expedited by three loose
                    bran mashes on the day preceding the dose, and exercise previously to its
                    working. Recollect there is no virtue in this case in the aloes, beyond doing
                    its duty in clearing and cleansing the bowels. Calomel, when administered to the
                    horse, should not be hurried, as it is intended to act upon the system, and
                    should therefore be given twelve hours previous to giving the purge. Horses
                    whose bowels are difficult to be moved, should be kept short of hay a day or two
                    before they are physicked, with an additional allowance of bran mashes, and
                    encouraged to drink before they experience nausea.”</p>
                <p>It may, perhaps, be well to state the “directing symptoms” for administering
                    physic to the hunter, which are thus detailed by Nimrod. <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Condition of Hunters,</hi> p. 173.) “Among the distinguishing symptoms of
                    foulness in a hunter, are these :—He appears unwell, without any specific
                    disease: his mouth is hot, his eyes look dull, and sometimes yellow: his coat
                    loses some of its usual gloss, and stares between the hip-bones, and on the poll
                    of the neck: his appetite frequently remains good, but he is more than usually
                    anxious for water: his heels are scurfy, and sometimes crack: he stales often,
                    but a little at a time: his urine is highly-coloured, and his excrements hard,
                    and often covered with a slimy fluid: he is dull when at exercise, and
                    frequently coughs without any appearance of having taken cold: he loses flesh,
                    and looks dry in his skin: his legs and ears are often cold, the latter
                    frequently wet after exercise, and sometimes deprived of part of their natural
                    covering: his crest falls; the whole tone of his system appears relaxed; and,
                    without his groom exactly knowing why, he is not the horse he was a week ago.”
                    To this we have nothing to add, unless it be to congratulate owners of horses on
                    the terrors of physicking them having vanished with the present improved method
                    of administering the doses; and on the fact, that only a few days’ cessation
                    from labour is now required to afford them this relief. We should say, that a
                    hunter is never more fit to go through a sharp run, than on the tenth day after
                    his physic has “set.”</p>
                <p>But we do not consider that we can close this part of our subject, without a few
                    words on the treatment of the grass-fed hunter, as there are still some who yet
                    abandon him to shift for himself in the summer, and are content to see him
                    return to his stall in August, the very reverse of what he was when he left it
                    in May. Nor is this the worst of it. He cannot be reinstated in the condition in
                    which he was when he went out in May, until hunting is three parts over the
                    following season. However, we will lay down what we consider the most likely
                    plan to pursue, to fit him for the work he is intended for:—</p>
                <p>From the redundancy of blood and humours, and distension of bowels beyond their
                    proper size, which the grass-fed hunter acquires, all violent exertion must be
                    avoided, until such obstructions are removed, which must be the work of time. It
                    is in vain to attempt to hurry a horse in this state into condition, but the
                    first step taken should be to have him clipped, for reasons which we shall
                    presently give. Long-continued slow exercise is the chief agent in hardening his
                    muscles, and strengthening his organs of respiration; but all galloping when in
                    the state in which he will be for the first two months, to get oft' his flesh,
                    is very highly to be reprobated, as his legs will surely suffer by it, if
                    nothing else does. Two light doses of physic maybe useful to him, if he have had
                    none given him at grass; and care should be taken not to use the brush to his
                    coat till the ∙nonth of November be passed, in case he should not be clipped.
                    Again, veterinary science has informed us, that danger always accrues to horses
                    in the vicissitudes of heat and cold, from one state to its opposite; but more
                    from the latter to the former, as an excitant to general inflammation. Horses
                    taken from grass, then, should be put into very cool stables, and the fewer in
                    one stable the better, for at least the first month. Windows should be left open
                    day and night, merely taking the precaution of coarse matting, or any thing else
                    that will stop the entrance of flies; and nothing does that better than matting,
                    frequently saturated with water. Having been clipped, and kept out several hours
                    in the day in slow work (which, by the way, grooms are too often shy of),
                    increasing his pace gradually as his condition progresses, the grass-fed hunter
                    may be brought fit to look at by the first week in November; but he will be at
                    least by a stone a worse horse than he was when he was turned out. We are no
                    friends to quacking in either man or beast; but, knowing that mischief to horses
                    so frequently arises from a long respite from work in the winter, unless some
                    preventive measures are had recourse to, we recommend the repetition of a light
                    dose or two of physic to the grass-fed hunter during frost, or even during open
                    weather, about Christmas.</p>
                <p>Having recommended the fashionable operation of clipping to the grass-fed hunter,
                    we will give our reasons for having done so. Nine horses out of ten, treated as
                    he has been treated in the summer, break out into a cold sweat, after work,
                    during the first part of the season, the natural consequence of debility; and
                    the dew on their coat has all the chilling influence of a wet blanket on their
                    body. The removal of the coat by the scissars, then, although it is no remedy
                    for the former, prevents the ill effects of the latter; which, by producing cold
                    on the surface of the body, occasions a determination of blood to the lungs, or
                    other important viscus, and is a great enemy to condition. Although we deny the
                    necessity of clipping a horse that has been <hi rend="italic">properly</hi>
                    summered (for, admitting that he may have a long coat, he will not in that case
                    break out after work), we allow it the merit of expediting condition, by giving
                    increase of bulk, and promoting the vigorousness of the horses’ renovating
                    powers; and, therefore, in this case useful. Looking at it, however, in another
                    light, we find many objections to it; amongst the greatest of which is the
                    deprivation of the protection of the coat or hair, to an animal so much in want
                    of it as the hunter is, and therefore an outrage on nature. In fact, it is, to a
                    certain degree, a substitute for good grooming, and as such will continue to be
                    in favour with many grooms, as also with such of their masters as submit to be
                    dictated to by them, or who may pay too much regard to appearances.</p>
                <p>Having alluded to grooms, a remark or two may not be ill placed. Such of them as
                    have the care of large studs cannot be expected to work, but to overlook those
                    who are under them; and their responsibility is considerable. There is much in
                    the choice of helpers; for none but persons who have narrowly watched it, are
                    aware of the effects of a good dressing to a hunter, not merely in having his
                    skin cleared from impurity, and in improving its elasticity, as well as the tone
                    and colour of the hair, which may be termed the complexion of a horse, but it
                    greatly promotes general health by its effect on the circulation of the blood,
                    as well as all other secretions, and in bad weather is a substitute for
                    exercise.</p>
                <p>Good stables are indispensable to the well-doing of hunters, equally so with a
                    comfortable house and a warm bed to those who ride them. Even the veterinary
                    professors have at length acknowledged the benefit of the genial warmth of a
                    stable to horses at work, although, in common with ourselves, they insist on the
                    necessity of well ventilated stables. No doubt it is injurious to any animal to
                    breathe an under-oxygenated air, and the effluvia arising from animal excretions
                    are injurious to eyes and lungs. A hunter should live in a temperature of about
                    G3° of Fahrenheit in <pb break="no" facs="nls:193646947"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0711-6947-0604"/>the winter, and as much below that point as it can
                    be made in the summer, by means of exclusion of the sun, open doors, &amp;c. But
                    it is essential that a stable in the winter should not only be warm, but dry;
                    and if not dry, the ground under and around it should be drained. A delicate
                    horse never arrives at perfection of condition in a damp stable, and it operates
                    powerfully against all others, often being the cause of fever in the feet.
                    Stalls should not be more than six feet wide, nor raised towards the manger; but
                    there should be a slight inclination in the flagging towards the centre of them,
                    to enable the urine to find its way to a drain, which there always ought to be,
                    as it contributes much to cleanliness, and consequently to health. <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ei</hi> Loose places,” or “boxes,” as they are termed, are
                    most desirable for all horses after severe work, and a celebrated veterinary
                    surgeon (Mr Turner of Regent Street, London, to whom the public is so much
                    indebted for his illustration of the navicular disease in the foot) has given it
                    as his opinion, that if all horses were suffered to lie loose after work, there
                    would not be half the cases of lameness in the feet that now occur. Desirable as
                    such treatment may be, it is universally impracticable, on account of the space
                    which large Studs would occupy; but every sportsman should have boxes about his
                    premises, and his hunters should be invariably put into them for two or three
                    days after work. To their general use there is one objection, although not a
                    serious one. Horses always lying loose are apt to refuse to lie down in stalls,
                    when removed to premises where boxes cannot be had, but they become reconciled
                    to them after a few days. It is, however, the opinion of a celebrated sportsman,
                    that if a hunter should have stood his work ten seasons being always tied up, he
                    would have stood it twelve if he had lain loose.</p>
                <p>We quote the following extract from <hi rend="italic">Nimrod on Condition of
                    Hunters,</hi> on the subject of warm stables. After proving, by the fact of the
                    horse degenerating in all cold countries, that warmth is congenial to his
                    existence, he thus proceeds :—“They who attend to such matters will find, that
                    the constitution and habit of a horse undergo a change when kept in a warm
                    stable, favourable, no doubt, to the work he has to perform as a hunter in the
                    stable of a hard-riding man. He is not that gross animal which he might
                    otherwise be, if a hard feeder, and kept in a state more nearly approaching to a
                    state of nature. This we may attribute to the increase of insensible
                    perspiration occasioned by increased circulation, whereby the grosser particles
                    of the body fly off and are got rid of. In this state he would bear some
                    comparison with a well-fed English farmer, when put to perform feats of activity
                    with a man of more refined habits of life, where nineteen times out of twenty he
                    would be defeated.” Again: “As there is an analogy between a man and a horse in
                    work, let us carry it a little further, and ask, Whether, after a hard day’s
                    exercise in the winter, a man would recover sooner if he passed his evening in a
                    warm room, or if he passed it in a bivouac, or in a room that was cold and damp
                    ?” He concludes by giving it as his opinion, that if it be possible to get a
                    horse to look well in a cold stable, it is not in the power of a groom to put
                    him into the height of condition in a damp one; and in this we heartily
                    concur.</p>
                <p>We s∖ bjoin Nimrod’s plan of stabling for six hunters. “I would have,” says he,
                    “two four-stalled stables, in which I would keep only six horses, that is, three
                    in each; and I would have a box at the end of each. If possible, I would have a
                    southern aspect, with windows opening from the top or downward, or else on a
                    pivot in the centre, and placed so high in the wall, that, when open, the air
                    may be circulated through the stable, without affecting one horse more than
                    another, and the height of the interior should be only twelve feet in the clear.
                    I would have the stalls paved nearly flat, with only a trifling inclination to
                    the centre; in each of which there should be a small grating over the drain, and
                    the stalls should be no more than six feet wide. There should be at least twelve
                    feet behind the horses, and the exterior walls and doors should be very thick.
                    The wooden partition-walls of the boxes should be only nine feet high, with
                    wooden bolts to the doors; and each box should not exceed ten feet square. The
                    saddle-room, well fitted up with saddle-cupboards, boiler, &amp;c., should be in
                    the centre of the building; in the front of which there should be a passage,
                    under cover, for horses to stand in when their legs are washed. Of ventilation I
                    say nothing, that being a matter of course; but I would have the sides of the
                    stalls nine feet high at the head, with small iron racks, and pillar-reins for
                    each horse to be dressed in. I should be very particular about the stallposts,
                    for these are frequently the cause of severe injury. When I went to see the
                    King’s stables at the palace at Pimlico, I was astonished to see almost every
                    other horse in them, with capped hocks. On inspecting the stall-posts, I
                    perceived the cause. They were of fluted stone, and with angles, which proved
                    that Mr Nash (the architect) knows nothing about the inside of stables.
                    Stall-posts should be made of wood, quite smooth and circular; and they should
                    extend to the ceiling, or be at least ten feet high.”</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Paddocks</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> Some persons turn their
                    hunters into the fields in the summer, because they have no small paddocks, or
                    any outlets to their buildings, and are averse to their horses remaining all the
                    year round in the house. Nothing, however, is easier than making temporary
                    paddocks, or outlets that will restrain stallions, or any horse that may be put
                    into them, without the chance of their breaking out of them. Let a small space,
                    say thirty or forty yards, be hurdled around, and the hurdles lined with faggots
                    reared up from seven to eight feet high. The faggots will be all the better for
                    the exposure to the air during a summer; and as horses cannot see through a
                    fence of this sort, they will never attempt to break through it.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Food.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> The proper feeding of
                    hunters has much to do with their condition, and likewise with their remaining
                    sound. Food should be proportioned to work, and it should also be of the very
                    best quality. Hay that has been much heated in the stack is above all things to
                    be avoided, as, from its powerful diuretic properties, it debilitates, and
                    creates thirst; and mow-burnt or heated oats are equally productive of mischief.
                    Eight or ten pounds of hay per day are as much as any hunter should eat,, and
                    that which is produced on dry upland ground is best. Indeed, we are far from
                    thinking that rich meadow hay, finely scented as it is, and apparently so full
                    of nourishment, is fitted for any description of horse that is required to go
                    fast, and we are quite certain that thousands of horses are destroyed annually
                    by the' effects of hay and water. The latter cannot be too soft, and when not
                    so, it should be kept in the stable some days previous to use, and with a small
                    portion of bran in it. Mr Percival <hi rend="italic">{Hippopathology,</hi> p.
                    25.) mentions forty-nine horses being killed in one stud, in France, by a
                    disease produced by eating bad hay and oats.</p>
                <p>But nothing puts the groom’s knowledge of the art of feeding hunters more to the
                    test, than the management of such as are either naturally thick-winded, or
                    afflicted with chronic cough; and as in man, the digestive organs are oftener
                    than any other disordered, so the respiratory organs in the horse are the most
                    common seat of disease. It is, however, in the power of a groom, by great
                    attention to feeding, keeping the habit of body from becoming foul and
                    plethoric, and well regulated work, to make horses of this description tolerably
                    fit to go with hounds; whereas in bad hands, they would be nearly useless, at
                    all events dangerous to ride. Such horses are generally hearty feeders, and when
                    so, should have a setting muzzle, as used with racehorses, put on them on the
                    night before hunting, unless they have been out with hounds within three days.
                    Water also should be sparingly given to them on that day, and not <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193646960" xml:id="kp-eb0711-6960-0605"/>after three o’clock p. <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">μ.</hi> Frequent mild aperients, or alterative medicines, are
                    very efficacious here; for as, in the human subject, the lungs often become the
                    seat of disease as a second cause of indigestion, the state of the digestive
                    organs should be minutely attended to with horses of this description.</p>
                <p>A broken-winded horse is never seen in a stud of hunters; but Nimrod’s remark on
                    this subject is in accordance with what we have now written upon it. “Most
                    veterinary surgeons,” he says, “attribute this disease to the consequences of
                    high keep. Here, no doubt, they are in a great measure correct; but if good
                    grooming were not for the most part a match for the effect of high keep, what
                    would be the fate of our race-horses, which eat almost as much corn as they can
                    swallow from the first month of their existence? Amongst them a broken-winded
                    horse is a rarity.”</p>
                <p>Many nostrums are prescribed for thick-winded horses, amongst them, carrots in
                    the winter, and green meat in the summer. We approve of a fewcarrots in the
                    winter, but object to green meat, unless in small quantities. Is not flatulency
                    the distinctive feature of a disordered respiration? And what promotes that
                    equally with loading and distending the stomach with green food? The small
                    dimensions of a horse’s stomach, evidently shew what nature intended him for,
                    namely, <hi rend="italic">to go fast</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and the
                    pathologist would very soon convince us that, in proportion as that organ is
                    distended, will the respiratory organs be oppressed. Hence the indispensable
                    practice of not allowing hunters their usual allowance of food and water on the
                    morning of hunting; as also of putting the setting muzzle on the racer the night
                    before he runs. The food most proper for all horses, but particularly for such
                    as are not perfect in their wind, is that which contains most nourishment in the
                    smallest compass or space.</p>
                <p>But we must not overlook the treatment of the <hi rend="italic">sound</hi> hunter
                    before and after hunting; as we consider the lives of more than half of those
                    hunters which have been lost from the effects of severe chases, to have been
                    lost from want of knowledge of how they should have been treated, at either the
                    one or the other of these periods. &gt; Nimrod, in his letters on this subject,
                    doubts whether it be in the power of hounds to maintain a chase long enough to
                    cause the death of a horse, fairly ridden with them, provided that horse have
                    been properly treated in the summer, and is in what is called strong work, or
                    quite fit to go, on the day of the run. Without stopping to argue this point,
                    which is not capable of proof, we will proceed to shew in what state a hunter
                    ought to be taken into the field, to meet foxhounds, giving him fair play; and
                    the man who takes him there when not fit to go, must always be prepared for the
                    consequences.</p>
                <p>We consider a hunter, in proper condition, equal to at least three days’ hunting
                    in a fortnight, taking the average of sport, which will, of course, at some
                    certain periods, send him oftener into the field in one given time than in
                    another, as, after a severe day, he should have a week’s clear rest. But since
                    the second-horse fashion has been so general, it is impossible to speculate on
                    this point, as it so often happens that one of the two horses the sportsman
                    sends to cover, returns home without having done much. The chief point, however,
                    to be insisted upon is, that the hunter should have a good gallop, causing him
                    to sweat freely, on the day before he goes to hounds, and if for half-a-mile on
                    rising ground, it will be more favourable to his wind. His food on that day
                    should also be attended to, in reference to his constitutional peculiarities;
                    for, if not the best winded horse in the stud, or given to throw off his meat on
                    his road to cover, he should have no water after three o’clock the preceding
                    afternoon, with the exception of a few swallows, to make him relish his corn, on
                    the morning of hunting. Sending hunters out now with full bellies has no excuse;
                    whereas one was found for it, when they left their stables five hours sooner in
                    the morning than they do at present: and returned to them often five hours
                    later. We allude to past days in which there were few artificially made covers,
                    and when foxes were found by the “drag,” through long chains of woods, and
                    certainly ran over much more ground than modern foxes do, which, being generally
                    bred near game preserves, run shorter, and are not so stout as formerly.</p>

                    over-excitement that has checked it. It is after a severe day’s work that danger
                    to a hunter is to be apprehended, the consequence of over-excitement of the
                    vascular system, and he should be in this case narrowly watched. If merely
                    fatigued, such are the restorative powers of the animal, rest, in a large loose
                    box, with an hour’s exercise daily, in the open air, will soon bring him about;
                    but we should be on the alert against fever. Here, however, we generally have
                    notice,—some directing symptoms which cannot be mistaken, such as hurried
                    respiration, extreme thirst, restlessness in his stall, a considerable
                    relaxation of the muscles in the interstices of the hips, reddened eyelids, and
                    a quick pulse. But unfortunately for hard-riding sportsmen, it too often
                    happens, that such is the rapidity with which what is termed accidental
                    inflammation takes place in the horse, that the most prompt measures will not
                    always arrest its progress, and the most common termination of it here is in the
                    feet. Not only does the animal suffer great pain, but should he not cast his
                    hoofs entirely (the fore-feet are most commonly affected), he becomes, what is
                    called, pumice-footed, and of no value afterwards as a hunter. Knowing this to
                    be the case, we are advocates for some prophylactic measures to be taken after a
                    very hard day; something repellant and sedative administered, which may not only
                    prevent an inflammatory attack, but, by cooling the system, and consequently
                    restoring the appetite, enable the horse to go sooner into the field again, than
                    if he had been entirely abandoned to his own restorative powers.</p>
                <p>But the most critical period with the over-ridden hunter is, when he first
                    appears to shew distress, which he often does on his road home, or even before
                    he quits the field; and here mistakes have been made, which have caused the
                    death of many a good animal. In the first place, his rider fancies it necessary
                    to drag him home, perhaps many miles on a cold winter’s evening, to “his own
                    comfortable stall,” than which, just at this time, a large and cold stable, and
                    the first he could be put into, would be far more beneficial to him. Again, he
                    says, “I’ll not do any thing to him till I get him home, when I will have him
                    bled ;” whereas, since all horses that die from exertion beyond the limits oı
                    vital power, die from suffocation, it will then be, in all probability, too
                    late, as <hi rend="italic">instant</hi> relief is wanted. A stimulating cordial
                    is likewise at this time good (a pint of sherry as good as any other), but both
                    are bad if inflammation has commenced; also keeping up a strong determination of
                    blood to the surface by friction of the body, head, and legs, with warm clothing
                    afterwards on the body and head; a well littered down stall, with plenty of
                    fresh air. A gallon of blood should be at first drawn; and if the increased
                    action of the heart and arteries continues, the horse should be well blistered
                    behind the elbows, and lose another gallon of blood. Blood-letting from the
                    foot-veins, is also highly to be recommended in cases of extreme exhaustion,
                    aftςr a hard day with hounds. It is a very simple operation, and can never do
                    harm; but we advise it to be performed by a veterinary surgeon.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:193646973" xml:id="kp-eb0711-6973-0606"/>
                <p>They who have never before experienced it, may be alarmed by an inward noise in a
                    distressed horse, which may be mistaken for a beating of the heart, whereas it
                    proceeds from a convulsive motion of the abdominal muscles, or muscles of the
                    belly. It is, however, a symptom of deep distress, and is only relieved by
                    relief given to the lungs, by bleeding and other preventive means.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Treatment of Horses' Legs.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> We have
                    already said, that the management of horses’ legs forms part of the science of
                    the stable, and a most important part too. It is no where so well understood as
                    in racing stables; but from the violent nature of his work, the hunter is
                    equally indebted to it. The barbarous practice of blistering all four legs
                    previously to turning out, is now happily exploded; but as in less violent
                    exertion than following hounds, a certain insecurity from accidents is
                    inseparable from the delicacy of all animal structure, the legs of hunters will
                    occasionally fall amiss. It being useless, however, without stating the extent
                    of the injury, to talk of prescribing remedies, we have only to state, that a
                    very efficient one has been found for the torturing one of firing, in many cases
                    where the actual cautery was considered as the only one. For example, for
                    ligamentary enlargements, cases of enlarged joints, tendons shewing symptoms of
                    giving way, or any other appearance in the limbs, of a departure from their
                    primitive tone and vigour. This consists in the application, during the
                    non-hunting months, or any other period of rest, of the mercurial charge, in
                    either of the following forms. It is made up by Mr Field, veterinary surgeon of
                    London, and no doubt by others in the profession, in a strong adhesive form; or,
                    at a distance from the metropolis, it may be applied, as recommended by Mr Kueny
                    of Nottingham, who is constantly in attendance upon the studs at Melton Moubray,
                    in Leicestershire. It consists of the common mercurial <hi rend="italic"
                    >plaster</hi> (not <hi rend="italic">ointment)</hi> of the shops, made up
                    according to the London Pharmacopoeia; and in the proportion of half-a-pound to
                    a leg, applied in a warm and consequently liquefied state, and when covered by
                    deer’s hair, bound to the limb by means of a linen roller. At the end of a
                    fortnight, the stitches of the bandage being decayed, the charge will slough
                    off, when another, if necessary, is put on. It is to the highly absorbent
                    property of mercury that the benefit here derived is to be ascribed; and it is
                    no small recommendation to it, that, in addition to the general restoration of
                    the limb, the painful operation of the actual cautery, as also the blemish
                    occasioned by it, are avoided.</p>
                <p>It is, however, a well known faet, that hunters will work and stand sound, for
                    many successive seasons, with legs apparently much out of form. Enlargements
                    take place in the sheath of tendons after strains; also from blows, where the
                    parts become lined by a thick coat of lymph; and sometimes the body of the bone
                    itself is found thickened, from a deposition of bony lamina over the original
                    bone. When all this has been in progress, we question the propriety of any
                    active measures, unless, as is generally the case, a feeling of soreness is
                    expressed after work, by a shifting, or favouring of the limb, or limbs, in the
                    stall; or by a “feeling” manner of going on first quitting the stable. When legs
                    are really callous, little impression can be made upon them, unless by active
                    measures; but physic, rest, and good grooming, are the best preservatives of
                    these most essential members of the horse’s frame; with the friendly auxiliaries
                    of hot-water, flannel bandages, and loose boxes, after severe work, and good
                    shoeing at all times.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">The Foot.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> Owners of valuable
                    horses may congratulate themselves on the assurance that, by the aid and
                    extended influence of veterinary science, they have no longer to apprehend
                    injury to the feet from the mere application of shoes. On the contrary, they may
                    rest satisfied that, provided no internal disease attack them, from
                    over-excitement by work (and that often is created on ground where shoes would
                    be unnecessary, such as crossing a very deep country), they will be not only as
                    sound and healthy, but <hi rend="italic">in better form,</hi> from having been
                    properly shod, than if they had not been shod at all. Some hoofs, however,
                    having a greater disposition to secrete horn than others, and thus called strong
                    feet, should never remain more than three weeks without being subject to the
                    drawing knife of the blacksmith (the ruinous butteris is now put aside), and the
                    shoes properly replaced. Neither should stopping with damp tow be omitted; as
                    moisture, <hi rend="italic">not wet,</hi> is beneficial to the health of the
                    foot. Here then, again, are at once apparent the evils of the out-of-door
                    summering of hunters. The foot of a horse so exposed, is at one time saturated
                    with wet, and at another exposed to a drying wind and a burning sun, the
                    contractile powers of which upon horn, are too well known to require comment. Do
                    what we may, however, horses that are required to “go the pace,” will always be
                    more or less subject to diseased feet, quite unconnected with shoeing; and
                    against such diseases there are hut two precautions on which much reliance can
                    be placed: First, let hunters be well prepared for their work, and properly
                    treated after it; and, secondly, let them have sufficient obliquity of
                    pastern-joint (in our opinion one of the most important points in the whole
                    structure of the horse), to break the force of concussion; which, together with
                    over-excitement of the vascular system, is the parent of that irremediable
                    disease of the navicular bone, formerly called “founder;” and by the wiseacres
                    of old times, “chest-founder,” because the muscles in that part wasted, from the
                    inability of the suffering animal to exert them. The posture of a horse in his
                    stall, when afflicted with this complaint, or fever in the feet, is too
                    characteristic to be mistaken.</p>
                <p>We have only one more remark on shoeing. In following hounds across deep
                    countries, hunters are apt to strike a hinder foot against a fore foot, and
                    inflict a severe wound. There have, indeed, been many instances of the total
                    separation of the back sinew by this, often unavoidable act, particularly in
                    leaping brooks. It was formerly very generally believed, that the blow -was
                    inflicted with the <hi rend="italic">toe</hi> of the hinder shoe, to obviate
                    which, shoeing smiths were ordered, by hunting grooms, to let part of the hoof
                    protrude over the front of the shoe, but still the evil continued. It was,
                    however, asserted, in the letters of Nimrod, that it was by the <hi
                    rend="italic">inside edge, or the rim of the hinder shoe,</hi> and not by the
                    toe, that the act of over-reaching was performed. This was at first doubted, but
                    experience has confirmed the assertion; and we have reason to believe, there has
                    not been an instance of serious mischief by <hi rend="italic">cutting,</hi> from
                    an over-reach, since the inside edge, or rim, has been rounded off, or bevelled.
                    Indeed, a moment’s reflection would dispel all doubts on the subject; for the
                    obtuse form of the toe of a horse-shoe could not inflict the severe wounds we
                    have seen inflicted (often cutting off part of the fore-heeD; whereas the inside
                    rim of a worn shoe is nearly as sharp as an ordinary knife. Besides, the act is
                    performed <hi rend="italic">after</hi> the hinder-foot has overstepped the
                    fore-foot, and therefore cannot be performed by the toe, but in the act of
                    drawing the hinder foot back, after it has overstridden its bounds. Bruises,
                    from over-reaches, still occur, which, though sometimes serious, are
                    comparatively, with cutting, harmless, as fomentation, and a few days’ rest,
                    will effect a cure.</p>
                <p>The action of the hinder leg reminds us of one useful hint to grooms travelling
                    hunters on the road. If we follow a well-formed horse, with the free use of his
                    limbs, on a road upon which his footsteps are imprinted, we shall find the
                    hinder foot oversteps the fore-foot in the <hi rend="italic">walk,</hi> but
                    falls behind it in the slow <hi rend="italic">trot.</hi> Exclusive of relief to
                    the muscles by change of action then, it is safer to vary the pace from a walk
                    to a slow trot on a journey, as causing less fatigue to the hock-joint, by which
                    curbs and spavins are frequently thrown out. Add to this, the slow trot is the
                    safest pace a horse goes, because his step is shortest.</p>
