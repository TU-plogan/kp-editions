                <p><label type="entry">HEBER</label>, the son of Salah, and father of Peleg, from
                    whom the Hebrews derived their name, according to Josephus, Eusebius, Jerome,
                    Bede, and most of the interpreters of the sacred writings; but Huet, bishop of
                    Avranches, in his Evangelical Demonstration, has attempted to prove that the
                    Hebrews took their name from the word <hi rend="italic">heber,</hi> which
                    signifies <hi rend="italic">beyond,</hi> because they came from beyond the
                    Euphrates. Heber is supposed to have been born 2281 B. c. and to have lived 464
                    years.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Heber,</hi><hi rend="italic">Reginald,</hi> a poet, and
                    dignitary of the church of England, was born at Malpas, in the county of
                    Chester, on the 21st of April 1783. His youth was distinguished by a precocity
                    of talent, docility of temper, a love of reading, and a veneration for religion.
                    After acquiring the elementary parts of education atNeasdon, in the
                    neighbourhood of London, he was entered of Brazen-nose College, Oxford, in the
                    year 1800. In his first year he gained the university prize for Latin verse by
                    his <hi rend="italic">Carmen Seculare,</hi> a poem on the commencement of the
                    new century; and in 1803 he wrote his poem of <hi rend="italic">Palestine,</hi>
                    which was crowned with the same success, and received with remarkable applause.
                    His academical career was brilliant from its commencement to its close. After
                    taking his degree, and gaining the university’s bachelors’ prize for the best
                    English prose essay, he in 1805 set out on a continental tour, of which he kept
                    a regular journal, which was afterwards published. Mr Heber returned to England
                    in the following year, and in 1807 took orders, and was instituted by his
                    brother to the family living of Hodnet in Shropshire, soon after which he
                    returned to Oxford to take his degree as master of arts. In 1809 he married and
                    settled in his rectory, and there discharged the duties which a large parish
                    devolved upon him with exemplary assiduity. Soon after his marriage he published
                    a series of hymns “appropriate to the Sundays and principal holidays of the
                    year,” the greater number of which were composed for music already used in the
                    church. In 1812, he commenced a <hi rend="italic">Dictionary of the Bible,</hi>
                    and published a volume of poems, which contained, besides those previously
                    published, translations from Pindar, and a few other pieces. In the same year he
                    commenced a poem entitled <hi rend="italic">Mori d’Arthur,</hi> which was never
                    completed. The fragment was published after his death by his widow, in the
                    volumes which contain his biography. In 1817 he was appointed . to the
                    prebendary of St Asaph, and in 1822 he obtained the preachership of Lincoln’s
                    Inn. During the same year the bishopric of Calcutta became vacant by the death
                    of Dr Middleton, and the offer of it having been made to Mr Heber, he accepted
                    of it after much hesitation. About this period he published a life of Jeremy
                    Taylor, with a review of his writings. In 1823 he took his degree of doctor of
                    divinity, and embarked for India, where he arrived in safety. Bishop Heber was
                    peculiarly well qualified to fill the high and responsible situation which he
                    had attained, with honour to himself and advantage to the church, as well by his
                    amiable and conciliatory temper, as by his talents, and zeal in the cause of
                    Christianity. Soon after his arrival in India, he was appointed one of the
                    vice-presidents of the Asiatic Society in Calcutta. He also assumed the office
                    of president of the Diocesan Committee of the Christian Knowledge Society,
                    established in Calcutta. The native schools and the various branches of the
                    society’s labours in that city, in common with other institutions of the same
                    description, engrossed much of his time and attention. On Ascension-day in the
                    year 1824, Bishop Heber held his first visitation in the cathedral of Calcutta;
                    and subsequently, he made progresses through his diocese, which was very
                    extensive, consecrating churches, and facilitating the adoption of measures for
                    the extension of Christian knowledge amongst the Hindus. In one of his journeys
                    to the southern provinces, he was cut off by an apoplectic fit, with which he
                    was seized whilst bathing, at Trichinopoly, on the 3d of April 1826. After the
                    death of this eminent prelate, there was published a Narrative <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193641682" xml:id="kp-eb0711-1682-0199"/>of a Journey through the
                    Upper Provinces of India, from Calcutta to Bombay, in 2 vols. 4to, and
                    afterwards in 3 vols. 8vo. A biography of this good prelate, with numerous
                    letters, and a History of the Cossacks, has been published by his widow, in 2
                    vols. 4to. Besides the works of Bishop Heber already mentioned, he was the
                    author of several dramatic poems, and a considerable contributor to the
                    Quarterly Review. As a poet he is elegant and pleasing, without being either
                    very vigorous or original. His poem of <hi rend="italic">Palestine</hi> is
                    perhaps the best which has ever been written upon the subject; and many of his
                    hymns, whilst they possess all the simplicity and true Christian feeling which
                    should characterise such compositions, have more elevation and poetic fervour
                    than is usually met with in writings of this kind. His prose works are written
                    in an easy, flowing style, and are characterised by acuteness and sound
                    judgment. His Indian Narrative is graphic and pleasing in the highest degree. As
                    a minister of the gospel, Bishop Heber combined rational piety with zealous
                    industry in the discharge of his duties, and he was beloved and venerated in the
                    highest degree by those over whom he presided as a spiritual guide and
                    instructor.</p>
