                <p><label type="entry">HEREFORDSHIRE</label>, an inland English county, bounded on
                    the north by Shropshire, on the east by Worcestershire, on the south by
                    Gloucestershire and Monmouthshire, and on the west by the Welsh counties of
                    Brecknock and Radnor. Its greatest length is thirty-eight, and its greatest
                    breadth thirty-five miles. It is nearly of a circular form; but the dividing
                    lines are broken by many indentations. Its circumference is 120 miles, and its
                    square area 1221 miles, or 781,440 statute acres.</p>
                <p>It is divided into eleven hundreds, containing one city, seven towns, and 221
                    parishes. The population amounted in 1801 to 89,191, in 1811 to 94,073, in 1821
                    to 103,243, and in 1831 to 110,300. By the comparative tables of mortality, it
                    appears that the ratio of deaths to the whole population has been thus: From
                    1801 to 1811 one in fifty-seven, from 1811 to 1821 one in fifty-eight, and from
                    1821 to 1831 one in fifty-eight. Few manufactures exist in the county; about
                    forty persons are employed in making hats at Leominster, and a few cloths and
                    stockings are made in other parts. The occupations stand thus: Agriculturists
                    employing labourers, 2505; agriculturists employing no labourers, 1679;
                    labourers in agriculture, 12,213; employed in manufacture, 63; retail traders or
                    handicraft, 7576: capitalists, bankers, &amp;c. 911; labourers not agricultural,
                    2410; other males twenty years of age, 1521; male servants, 725; female
                    servants, 5512.</p>
                <p>The face of the country is very beautiful, when viewed from the western descent
                    of the Malvern Hills. The whole country is rather thickly enclosed with high
                    hedges; the divisions of the fields are generally small; and the abundance, both
                    of forest and fruit trees, with which its surface is covered, gives it the
                    appearance of an extensive wood. The roads are all narrow and bad, and even the
                    turnpike ones are scarcely an exception.</p>
                <p>In the eastern side of the county, a part of the Malven Hills is rather barren,
                    as are the Hatterel or Black Mountains, which divide it from Wales on the west.
                    With the exception of these two portions, the whole of the land is highly
                    fertile, and the fields are clothed with perpetua' verdure. The soil is
                    generally a mixture of marl and clay but contains calcareous earth in various
                    proportions it different parts. Towards the western part, the soil is tenacious,
                    and retentive of water; the eastern side is principally a stiff clay, in some
                    places of a red colour. In tht’ south, some of the soil is a light sandy loam.
                    The subsoi is almost universally limestone; in some parts a species o: marble,
                    beautifully variegated with red and white veins and capable of receiving a high
                    polish. Where the soi does not rest on limestone, as near the city of Hereford
                    it is sometimes a siliceous gravel, and occasionally fuller’s earth and yellow
                    ochres are found. The climate is rather more inclined to rain than the more
                    eastern parts of England, and at times is much subject to damp fogs, which
                    moisten the earth, and may be one cause of its great verdure.</p>
                <p>The cultivation of grain is generally in a state behind <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193642644" xml:id="kp-eb0711-2644-0273"/>most of the English counties,
                    and the crops bear no proportion to the excellence of the soil. Wheat is
                    generally sowed on a clover ley, with a dressing of lime, and then yields, on an
                    average, twenty bushels to the acre. After this wheat is harvested, a winter and
                    spring ploughing are followed by peas, which do not average more than fourteen
                    bushels to the acre. The peas are fojlowed by wheat again, when the produce is
                    not usually more than fourteen bushels. In the succeeding spring it is sowed
                    with barley and clover, neither of which crops yields a good increase. Oats are
                    only sowed partially in the room of barley. Turnips are carelessly cultivated,
                    and artificial grasses sowed to a very limited extent, though somewhat increased
                    of late years. On the borders of some of the rivers there are most valuable
                    meadows of natural grass, which are the most productive of any lands in the
                    county.</p>
                <p>One cause of the neglect manifested in the cultivation of corn may be the
                    attention paid to the growth of hops and fruit. The cultivation of hops is
                    considerable, and increasing on the borders of Worcestershire, and much more of
                    the manure is applied to them than to the corn. The soils selected for hop
                    gardens are those where a dry loam predominates, with but a small proportion of
                    clay; and old pastures are deemed more fit for them than the land that has been
                    recently under the plough. The time of planting them is usually the month of
                    April. In July the gardens are hoed carefully, and the same operation is
                    repeated five or six weeks after; and in September the earth is formed into
                    hillocks around the roots of the young plants. The hops are picked from the
                    plants in October, are then gently dried in a kiln, and packed for sale. The
                    average produce of an acre of garden is about five hundredweight of hops. Each
                    acre requires 1000 poles, around which the plants entwine themselves. The cost
                    of poles, of manure, and of labour, makes the cultivation highly expensive, and
                    in some years it far exceeds the amount of the produce, but in others the
                    growers gain very large profits. The whole is a very speculative pursuit.</p>
                <p>The rearing of fruit-trees, to the growth of which the soil and climate seem
                    admirably adapted, engrosses the greatest share of the attention and skill of
                    the Herefordshire cultivators. Although almost every soil and situation in the
                    county is favourable to the growth of apples and pears, yet those spots are
                    preferred which are exposed to the south-east and sheltered to the westward; as
                    it is found that the winds from that quarter are ungenial to the fruit trees.
                    Orchards, though planted in Kent as early as the reign of Henry VIII., did not
                    extend to Herefordshire till they were introduced by Lord Scudamore and some
                    other gentlemen in the reign of Charles I. when the circumstance of their
                    adaptation to the soil being ascertained, they quickly spread over the whole
                    county. It is a fact, that many varieties of apples and pears, which a few years
                    ago were the most highly esteemed, have entirely disappeared; but new varieties
                    have by care and attention been produced, which equal in value, if not in fame,
                    the celebrated <hi rend="italic">redstreah</hi> and <hi rend="italic">slime</hi>
                    aj&gt;ple, and the <hi rend="italic">squash</hi> pear, the value of whose cider
                    and perry was thirty years ago most highly prized. Some of the proprietors of
                    orchards, who are most attentive to the selection of the fruit, and most skilful
                    in the management of the juice when expressed, have produced such exquisitely
                    flavoured cider and perry as to obtain for them a preference over any wines made
                    from the grape. The prices at which the best of these liquors are sold by the
                    growers far exceed those which are obtained for the best wines of any vineyards
                    either in France or Germany. They are sometimes sold as high as L.20 the
                    hogshead direct from the press. Some of the orchards are from thirty to forty
                    acres in extent, and the trees being at considerable distance from each other,
                    the intervals are kept in tillage. The produce of the orchards is very
                    fluctuating, though less so in Herefordshire than in Somerset, Devon, or
                    Gloucester; yet the growers seldom expect more than one year in three to be
                    fully productive. In a good year an acre of orchard will produce from eighteen
                    to twenty-four hogsheads of cider or perry. The quantity of apples or pears
                    required to make a hogshead varies from twenty-four to thirty bushels. The
                    greater part of the best descriptions of both liquors is purchased by merchants
                    from Bristol, who find bottles, and export it to the East and West Indies, and
                    to America.</p>
                <p>Herefordshire has long been celebrated for one of the best races of cows. They
                    are of the middle-horned kind, have a large and athletic frame, and, from the
                    silky nature of their coats, have an unusually sleek appearance. The most
                    prevailing colour is a reddish brown, and their faces are white and bald. The
                    heifers fatten quickly at an early age, and the calves are highly esteemed. The
                    rearing of oxen for the plough is a common pursuit, and the greater part of the
                    animal labour of the county is performed by them. After being worked five or six
                    years, they are usually sold to, graziers from Buckinghamshire, and fattened in
                    the Vale of Aylesbury for the consumption of the metropolis, where their flesh
                    is highly prized.</p>
                <p>The fame of the Herefordshire sheep equals that of its cows. They are best known
                    by the name of the Rylands, a district in the southern part of the county, in
                    which the superior varieties of them are fed. They are small, whitefaced, and
                    without horns. In symmetry of shape, and in the exquisite flavour of the meat,
                    they surpass most other kinds; and, in addition, their wool is by far the finest
                    produced from any of the native English races. The quantity of wool from them
                    does not average more than two pounds each, but it is usually sold for three
                    times the price of coarse wool. Many experiments have been made to improve this
                    breed by crossing them with the Merinos; but it has been found that the flesh
                    has deteriorated as much as the wool has improved by the mixture. The practice
                    of keeping the sheep in houses in cold weather is general, and perhaps the wool
                    may be in some degree indebted to that management for a portion of its fineness
                    of fibre.</p>
                <p>The excellence of the wool has not induced many manufactures, for most of it is
                    sold to the clothiers of Gloucestershire and Somersetshire. Attempts have been
                    made to establish manufactories of woollen goods in the city of Hereford, but
                    they proved abortive. At Kington some few woollens are made, and likewise at
                    Leominster, but to no great extent. The river Wye is navigable to Hereford, but
                    either floods or droughts so often suspend the navigation, that the trade
                    carried on by it is very inconsiderable.</p>
                <p>The principal river, the Wye, is celebrated for its picturesque beauties,
                    especially in the vicinity of Ross, and till it enters Monmouthshire. The other
                    streams, the Lugg, receiving the waters of the Arrow and the Frome, the Munnow
                    receiving those of the Dore, and the Led-don, are but inconsiderable, though
                    they tend to fertilize the lands through which they flow.</p>
                <p>Few counties are more rich in antiquities than Herefordshire, especially in the
                    remains of those feudal castles, which were probably erected when it was the
                    frontier towards the hostile Welsh. The most remarkable of these are Goodrich
                    Castle, Dore Abbey, Wigmore Abbey, Vineyard Camp, and Bransil Castle.</p>
                <p>The largest towns, and their population, are, Hereford, 10,280; Leominster, 5249;
                    Ledbury, 3909; Ross, 3078; and Kington, 3111.</p>
                <p>By the law of 1832 this county returns three members to parliament; and the
                    polling places are Hereford, Leominster, Bromyard, Ledbury, Ross, and Kington.
                    The <pb break="no" facs="nls:193642657" xml:id="kp-eb0711-2657-0274"/>borough of
                    Weobly was disfranchised by the same law, and Hereford and Leominster return
                    each two members.</p>
                <p>The towns in Herefordshire are generally worse built than in any other English
                    county, and more nearly approach to those of their adjoining Welsh neighbours.
                    In the villages the buildings are still worse. The construction of most of the
                    farm-houses and of the barns is rude and slight; they are usually built of
                    stone, only cemented with mud or clay, about two feet high; and upon these
                    imperfect walls the superstructure is raised, composed of timber frame-work,
                    with laths intertwined, and plastered with mud or clay. They are usually covered
                    with thick flag-stones, which increase the weight, and soon reduce them to a
                    most ruinous state.</p>
