                <p><label type="entry">HEBRIDES</label>, the general name of some islands lying to
                    the north-west of Scotland, of which kingdom they constitute a part. They are
                    situated between the 55th and 59th degrees of latitude. The names of the largest
                    are <hi rend="italic">Lewis, Skye, Mull, Ilay,</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Arran.</hi> Of these islands, generally, Mr Pennant gives the following
                    history.</p>
                <p>“All the accounts left us by the Greek and Roman writers are enveloped with
                    obscurity; at all times brief even in their descriptions of places they had
                    easiest access to, and might have described with the most satisfactory
                    precision; but in remote places, their relations furnish little more than hints,
                    the food for conjecture to the visionary antiquary.</p>
                <p>“That Pytheas, a traveller mentioned by Strabo, had visited Great Britain, I
                    wouſd wish to make only <hi rend="italic">apocryphal.</hi> He asserts that he
                    visited the remoter parts; and that he had also seen Thule, the land of romance
                    amongst the ancients; which all might pretend to have seen; but every voyager,
                    to swell his fame, made the island he saw last the Ultima Thule of his travels.
                    If Pytheas had reached these parts, he might have observed, floating in the
                    seas, multitudes of gelatinous animals, the <hi rend="italic">medusae of</hi>
                    Linnaeus, and out of these have formed his fable. He made his Thule a <hi
                    rend="italic">composition of neither earth, sea, nor air</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >;</hi><hi rend="italic">but like a composition of them all</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">;</hi> then, catching his simile from what floated before him,
                    compares it to the <hi rend="italic">lungs</hi> of the sea, the Aristotelian
                    idea of these bodies, and from him adopted by naturalists, successors to that
                    great philosopher. Strabo very justly explodes these absurd tales; yet allows
                    him merit in describing the climate of the places he had seen. As a farther
                    proof of his having visited the Hebrides, he mentions their unfriendly sky, that
                    prohibits the growth of the finer fruits; and that the natives are obliged to
                    carry their corn under shelter to beat the grain out, lest it should be spoiled
                    by the effect of sun and violence of the rains. This is the probable part of his
                    narrative; but when the time that the great geographer wrote is considered, at a
                    period that these islands had been neglected for a very long space by the
                    Romans, and when the difficulties of getting among a fierce and unfriendly
                    nation must be almost insuperable, doubts innumerable respecting the veracity of
                    this relater must arise. All that can be admitted in favour of him is, that he
                    was a great traveller; and that he might have either visited Britain from some
                    of the nations commercing with our isle, or received from them accounts, which
                    he afterwards dressed out, mixed with the ornaments of íable. A traffic must
                    have been carried on with the very northern inhabitants of our islands in the
                    time of Pytheas; for one of the articles of commerce mentioned by Strabo, the
                    ivory bits, were made either of the teeth of the walrus, or of a species of
                    whale, native of the northern seas.</p>
                <p>“The geographer Mela, who flourished in the reign of Claudius, is the next who
                    takes notice of our lesser islands. He mentions the Orcades as consisting of 30,
                    the Aemodae <pb break="no" facs="nls:193641721" xml:id="kp-eb0711-1721-0202"/>of
                    seven. The Romans had then made a conquest of the former, and might have seen
                    the latter: but, from the words of the historian, it is probable that the
                    Shetland Islands were those intended; for he informs us that the ‘ Aemodae were
                    carried out over against Germany.’ The site of the Hebrides will not admit this
                    description, which agrees very well with the others; for the ancients extended
                    their Germany, and its imaginary islands, to the extreme north.</p>
                <p>“Pliny the Elder is the next that mentions these remote places. He lived later
                    than the preceding writers, and of course his information is fuller. By means of
                    intervening discoveries, he has added ten more to the number of the Orcades; is
                    the first writer that mentions the Hoebudes, the islands in question; and joins
                    in the same line Aemodae, or, as it is in the best editions more properly
                    written, the <hi rend="italic">Acmodae,</hi> or extreme point of the Roman
                    expeditions to the north, as the Shetland Isles in the highest probability were.
                    Pliny and Mela agree in the number of the Aemodae or Acmodae; the former makes
                    that of the Hoebudes 30; an account extremely near the truth, deducting the
                    little isles, or rather rocks, that surround most of the greater, and many of
                    them so indistinct as scarcely to be remarked, except on an actual survey.</p>
                <p>“Solinus succeeds Pliny. If he, as is supposed, was contemporary with Agricoa, he
                    has made very ill use of the light he might have received from the expeditions
                    of that great general; his officers might have furnished the historian with
                    better materials than those he has communicated. He has reduced the number of
                    the Hoebudes to five. He tells us that <hi rend="superscript"> t</hi> the
                    inhabitants were unacquainted with corn; that they lived only on fish and milk;
                    that they had one king, as the islands were only separated from each other by
                    narrow straits; that their prince was bound by certain rules of government to do
                    justice, and was prevented by poverty from deviating from the true course, being
                    supported by the public, and allowed nothing That he could call his own, not
                    even a wife; but then he was allowed free choice, by turns one out of every
                    district, of any female that caught his affection; which deprived him of all
                    ambition about a successor.’</p>
                <p>“By the number of these islands, and by the minute attention given by the
                    historian to the circumstance of their being separated from each other by very
                    narrow straits, I should imagine that which is now called the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Long Island,</hi> and includes Lewis, North Uist, Benbecula, South Uist, and
                    Barra, to have been the five Hoebudes of Solinus; for the other great islands,
                    such, as Sky, &amp;c. are too remote from each other to form the preceding very
                    characteristic description of that chain of islands. These might naturally fall
                    under the rule of one petty prince, almost the only probable part of Solinus’s
                    narrative.</p>
                <p>“After a long interval appears Ptolemy, the Egyptian geographer. He also
                    enumerates five Ebudae, and has given each a name; the western <hi rend="italic"
                    >Ebuda,</hi> the Eastern <hi rend="italic">Ricino,</hi><hi rend="italic">Malcos,
                    Epidiurn.</hi> Camden conjectures them to be the modern Sky, Lewis, Rathry or
                    Racline, Mull, and Hay; and I will not controvert his opinion.</p>
                <p>“The Roman historians give very little light into the geography of these parts.
                    Tacitus, from whom most might have been expected, is quite silent about the
                    names of places; notwithstanding he informs us, that a fleet by the command of
                    Agricoa performed the circumnavigation of Britain. All that he takes notice of
                    is the discovery and the conquest of the Orkneys: it should seem, that with the
                    biographers of an ambitious nation, nothing seemed worthy of notice but what
                    they could dignify with the glory of victory. ∙</p>
                <p>“It is very difficult to assign a reason for the change of name from <hi
                    rend="italic">Ebudae</hi> to <hi rend="italic">Hebrides</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >:</hi> the last is modern, and seems, as the annotator on Dr Macpherson
                    supposes, to have arisen from the error of a transcriber, who changed the <hi
                    rend="italic">u</hi> into <hi rend="italic">ri.</hi></p>
                <p>“From all that has been collected from the ancients, it appears that they were
                    acquainted with little more of the Hebrides than the bare names: it is probable
                    that the Romans, either from contempt of such barren spots, from the dangers of
                    the seas, the violence of the tides, and horrors of the narrow sounds, in the
                    inexperienced ages of navigation, never attempted their conquest, or saw more of
                    them than what they had in sight during the few circumnavigations of Great
                    Britain, which were expeditions more of ostentation than of utility.</p>
                <p>“The inhabitants had probably for some ages their own governors, one little king
                    to each island, or to each group, as necessity required. It is reasonable to
                    suppose that their government was as much divided as that of Great Britain,
                    which, it is well known, was under the direction of numbers of petty princes
                    before it was reduced under the power of the Romans.</p>
                <p>“No account is given in history of the time these islands were annexed to the
                    government of Scotland. If we may credit our Saxon historians, they appear to
                    have been early under the dominion of the Picts; for Bede and Adamnanus inform
                    us, that soon after the arrival of St Columba in their country, Brude, a Pictish
                    monarch, made the saint a present of the celebrated island of Iona. But neither
                    the holy men of this island, nor the natives of the rest of the Hebrides,
                    enjoyed a permanent repose after this event. The first invasion of the Danes
                    does not seem to be easily ascertained. It appears that they ravaged Ireland,
                    and the Isle of Rathry, as early as the year 735. In the following century their
                    expeditions became more frequent; Harold Harfager, or the <hi rend="italic"
                    >light-haired,</hi> pursued, in 875, several petty princes, whom he had expelled
                    out of Norway; who had taken refuge in the Hebrides, and molested his dominions
                    by perpetual descents from those islands. He seems to have made a rapid
                    conquest; he gained as many victories as he fought battles; he put to death the
                    chief of the pirates, and made an indiscriminate slaughter of their followers.
                    Soon after his return, the islanders repossessed their ancient seats; and, in
                    order to repress their insults, he sent Ketil the <hi rend="italic"
                    >flat-nosed</hi> with a fleet and some forces for that purpose. He soon reduced
                    them to terms, but made his vietories subservient to his own ambition; he made
                    alliances with the reguli he had subdued; he formed intermarriages, and
                    confirmed to them their old dominions. This effected, he sent back the fleet to
                    Harold; openly declared himself independent; made himself prince of the
                    Hebrides; and caused them to acknowledge him as such, by the payment of tribute
                    and the badges of vassalage. Ketil remained, during life, master of the islands;
                    and his subjects appear to have been a warlike set of freebooters, ready to Join
                    with any adventurers. Thus when Eric, son of Harold Harfager, after being driven
                    out of his own country, made an invasion of England, he put with his fleet into
                    the Hebrides, received a large reinforcement of people fired with the hopes of
                    prey, and then proceeded on his plan of rapine. After the death of Ketil, a
                    kingdom was in after times composed out of them, which, from the residence of
                    the little monarch in the Isle of Man, was styled that of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Man.</hi> The islands became tributary to that of Norway for a considerable
                    time, and princes were sent from thence to govern; but at length they again
                    shook off the yoke. Whether the little potentates ruled independent, or whether
                    they put themselves under the protection of the Scottish monarchs, does not
                    clearly appear; but it is reasonable to suppose the last, as Donald-bane is
                    accused of making the Hebrides the price of the assistance given him by the
                    Norwegians against his own subjects. Notwithstanding they might occasionally
                    seek the protection of Scotland, <pb break="no" facs="nls:193641734"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0711-1734-0203"/>yet they never were without princes of their own:
                    policy alone directed them to the former. From the chronicles of the kings of
                    Man we learn that they had a succession of princes.</p>
                <p>“In 1089 is an evident proof of the independency of the islanders on Norway; for,
                    on the death of Lagnan, one of their monarchs, they sent a deputation to
                    O’Brian, king of Ireland, to request a regent of royal blood to govern them
                    during the minority of their young prince. They probably might in turn
                    compliment in some other respects their Scottish neighbours; the islanders must
                    have given them some pretence to sovereignty; for,</p>
                <p>“In 1093, Donald-bane, king of Scotland, calls in the assistance of Magnus the
                    Barefooted, king of Norway, and bribes him with the promise of all the islands.
                    Magnus accepts the terms; but at the same time boasts, that he does not come to
                    invade the territories of others, but only to resume the ancient rights of
                    Norway. His conquests are rapid and complete; for, besides the islands, by an
                    ingenious fraud he adds Cantyre to his dominions.</p>
                <p>“The Hebrides continued governed by a prince dependent on Norway, a species of
                    viceroy appointed by that court; and who paid, on assuming the dignity, ten
                    marks of gold, and never made any other pecuniary acknowledgment during life:
                    but if another viceroy was appointed, the same sum was exacted from him. These
                    viceroys were sometimes Norwegians, sometimes natives of the isles. In 1097 we
                    find that Magnus deputes a nobleman of the name of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Ingemund</hi><hi rend="italic">:</hi> in after times we learn that natives were
                    appointed to that high office. Thus were the Hebrides governed, from the
                    conquest by Magnus, till the year 1263, when Acho, or Haquin, king of Norway, by
                    an unfortunate invasion of Scotland, terminating in his defeat at Largs, so
                    weakened the powers of his kingdom, that his successor Magnus IV. was content to
                    make a cession of the islands to Alexander HI.: but not without stipulating for
                    the payment of a large sum, and a tribute of 100 merks for ever, which bore the
                    name of the <hi rend="italic">annual of Norway.</hi> Ample provision was also
                    made by Magnus in the same treaty, for the security of the rights and properties
                    of his Norwegian subjects who chose to continue in the isles, where many of
                    their posterity remain to this day.</p>
                <p>“Notwithstanding this revolution, Scotland seems to have received no real
                    acquisition of strength. The islands still remained governed by powerful
                    chieftains, the descendants of Somerled, thane of Heregaidel, or Argyle, who,
                    marrying the daughter of Olave, king of Man, left a divided dominion to his sons
                    Dugal and Reginald; from the first were descended the Macdougals of Lorn, from
                    the last the powerful clan of the Macdonalds. The lordship of Argyle, with Mull,
                    and the islands north of it, fell to the share of the first; Hay, Cantyre, and
                    the southern isles, were the portion of the last; a division that formed the
                    distinction of the Sudereys and Nordereys (as further noticed in the article <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Iona).</hi></p>
                <p>“These chieftains were the scourges of the kingdom; they are known in history but
                    as the devastations of a tempest; for their paths were marked with the most
                    barbarous desolation. Encouraged by their distance from the seat of royalty, and
                    the turbulence of the times, which gave their monarchs full employ, they
                    exercised a regal power, and often assumed the title; but are more generally
                    known in history by the style of the <hi rend="italic">Lords of the Isles,</hi>
                    or the Earls of Ross; and sometimes by that of the <hi rend="italic">Great
                    Macdonald.</hi></p>
                <p>“Historians are silent about their proceedings, from the retreat of the Danes, in
                    1263, till that of 1335, when John, lord of the isles, withdrew his allegiance.
                    In the beginning of the next century his successors were so independent,· that
                    Henry IV. entered into a formal alliance with the brothers Donald and John. This
                    encou raged them to commit fresh hostilities against their natural prince.
                    Donald, under pretence of a claim to the earldom of Ross, invaded and made a
                    conquest of that county; but, penetrating as far as the shire of Aberdeen, after
                    a fierce but undecisive battle with the royal party, thought proper to retire,
                    and in a little time to swear allegiance to his monarch James I. But he was
                    permitted to retain the county of Ross, and assume the title of earl. His
                    successor Alexander, at the head of 10,000 men, attacked and burnt Inverness; at
                    length, terrified with the preparations made against him, he fell at the royal
                    feet, and obtained pardon as to life, but was committed to strict
                    confinement.</p>
                <p>“His kinsman and deputy, Donald Balloch, resenting the imprisonment of his
                    chieftain, excited another rebellion, and destroyed the country with fire and
                    sword; but on his flight was taken and put to death by an Irish chieftain, with
                    whom he sought protection.”</p>
                <p>“These barbarous inroads were very frequent with a set of banditti, who had no
                    other motive in war but the infamous inducement of plunder.</p>
                <p>“In the reign of James II. in the year 1461, Donald, another petty tyrant, an
                    Earl of Ross, and Lord of the Isles, renewed the pretence of independency;
                    surprised the castle of Inverness; forced his way as far as Athol; and obliged
                    the carl and countess, with the principal inhabitants, to seek refuge in the
                    church of St Bridget, in hopes of finding security from his cruelty by the
                    sanctity of the place; but the barbarian and his followers set fire to the
                    church, put the ecclesiastics to the sword, and, with a great booty, carried the
                    earΓand countess prisoners to his castle of Claig, in the island of Hay. In a
                    second expedition, immediately following the first, he suffered the penalty of
                    his impiety: a tempest overtook him, and overwhelmed most of his associates; and
                    he, escaping to Inverness, perished by the hands of an Irish harper; his
                    surviving followers returned to Hay, conveyed the Earl and Countess of Athol to
                    the sanctuary they had violated, and expiated their crime by restoring the
                    plunder, and making large donations to the shrine of the offended saint.</p>
                <p>“John, successor to the late Earl of Ross, entered into alliance with Edward IV.
                    and sent ambassadors to the court of England, where Edward empowered the Bishop
                    of Durham and Earl of Winchester to conclude a treaty with him, another Donald
                    Balloch, and his son and heir John. They agreed to serve the king with all their
                    power, and to become his subjects: the earl was to have 100 marks sterling for
                    life in time of peace, and L.200 in time of war; and these island allies, in
                    case of the conquest of Scotland, were to have confirmed to them all the
                    possessions benorth of the Scottish sea; and in case of a truce with the
                    Scottish monarch, they were to be included in it. But about the year 1476,
                    Edward, from a change of politics, courted the alliance of James III. and dropt
                    his new allies. James, determined to subdue this rebellious race, sent against
                    them a powerful armyunder the Earl of Athol; and took leave of him with this
                    good wish, <hi rend="italic">Exirth, fortune, and fill the fetters</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">;</hi> as much as to say, “Go forth, be fortunate, and bring home
                    many captives ;” which the family of Athol has used ever since for its motto.
                    Ross was terrified into submission; obtained his pardon; but was deprived of his
                    earldom, which by act of parliament was then declared unalienably annexed to the
                    crown; at the same time the king restored to him Knapdale and Cantyre, which the
                    earl had resigned; and invested him anew with the lordship of the isles, to hold
                    them of the king by service and relief.</p>
                <p>“Thus the great power of the isles was broken: yet for a considerable time after,
                    the petty chieftains were continually breaking out into small rebellions, or
                    harassed each other in private wars; and tyranny seems but to <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193641747" xml:id="kp-eb0711-1747-0204"/>have been multiplied. James
                    V. found it necessary to make the voyage of the isles in person in 1536, seized
                    and brought away with him several of the most considerable leaders, and obliged
                    them to find security for their own good behaviour and that of their vassals.
                    The names of these chieftains were (according to Lindesay), <hi rend="italic"
                    >Mydyart, Mac-connel, Alac-loyd</hi> of the Lewis, <hi rend="italic">Mac-niel,
                    Mac-lane, Mac-intosh, John Mudyart, Mac-hay, Moe-kenzie,</hi> and many others;
                    but, by the names of some of the above, there seem to have been continental as
                    well as insular malecontents. He examined the titles of their holdings; and
                    finding several to have been usurped, reunited their lands to the crown. In the
                    same voyage he had the glory of causing a survey to be taken of the coasts of
                    Scotland, and of the islands, by his pilot Alexander Lindesay; which was
                    published in 1583, at Paris, by Nicholas de Nicholay, geographer to the French
                    monarch.</p>
                <p>“The troubles that succeeded the death of James occasioned a neglect of these
                    insulated parts of the Scottish dominions, and left them in a state of anarchy.
                    In 1614, the Mac-donalds made a formidable insurrection, oppugning the royal
                    grant of Cantyre to the Earl of Argyle and his relations. The petty chieftains
                    continued in a sort of rebellion; and the sword of the greater, as usual in weak
                    governments, was employed against them; the encouragement and protection given
                    by them to pirates employed the power of the Campbells during the reign of James
                    VI. and the beginning of that of Charles I.</p>
                <p>“But the turbulent spirit of the old times continued down till a comparatively
                    late period. The heads of clans were, by the divisions, and a false policy that
                    predominated in Scotland during the reign of William III. flattered with an
                    ideal importance: instead of being treated as bad subjects, they were courted as
                    desirable allies; instead of feeling the hand of power, money was allowed to
                    bribe them into the loyalty of the times. They would have accepted the
                    subsidies, notwithstanding they detested the prince that offered them. They were
                    taught to believe themselves of such consequence, that in these days turned to
                    their destruction. Two rebellions gave the legislature a late experience of the
                    folly of permitting the feudal system to exist in any part of its dominions. The
                    act of 1748, for abolishing heritable jurisdictions, at once deprived the
                    chieftains of all power of injuring the public by their commotions.”</p>
