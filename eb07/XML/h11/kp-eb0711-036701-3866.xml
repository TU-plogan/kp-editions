                <p><label type="entry">HILL, <hi rend="smallcaps">Aaron</hi></label>, a poet of
                    considerable eminence, the son of a gentleman of Malmesbury Abbey, in Wiltshire,
                    was born in 1685. His father’s imprudence having ruined his paternal
                    inheritance, he left Westminster School at fourteen years of age, and embarked
                    for Constantinople to visit Lord Paget, the English ambassador there, who was
                    his distant relation. Lord Paget received him with surprise and pleasure,
                    provided him a tutor, and sent him to travel, thus affording him an opportunity
                    of visiting Egypt, Palestine, and a great part of the East. About the year 1709
                    he published his first poem, entitled <hi rend="italic">Camillus,</hi> in honour
                    of the Earl of Peterborough, who had commanded in Spain; and being the same year
                    made master of Drury-lane Theatre, he wrote his first tragedy, called <hi
                    rend="italic">Elfred,</hi> or the Fair Inconstant. In 1710, he became master of
                    the opera-house in the Haymarket, and wrote an opera called Rinaldo, which met
                    with great success, being the first that Handel set to music after he came to
                    England. Unfortunately for Mr Hill, he was a projector as well as poet, and in
                    1715 obtained a patent for extracting oil from beech-nuts; an undertaking which
                    miscarried after engaging his attention for three years. He was also concerned
                    in the first attempt to settle the colony of Georgia, from which he never reaped
                    any advantage; and in 1728 he made a journey into the Highlands of Scotland, in
                    prosecution of a scheme of applying the woods there to ship-building; but in
                    this he also lost his labour. Mr Hill seems to have lived in perfect harmony
                    with all the writers of bis time, except Mr Pope, with whom he had a short paper
                    war, occasioned by that gentleman’s introducing him in the Dunciad as one of the
                    competitors for the prize offered by the goddess of Dulness. Mr Hill, amongst
                    many other pieces, also wrote one called <hi rend="italic">The Northern
                    Star,</hi> upon the actions of Peter the Great; and for this he was several
                    years afterwards complimented with a gold medal from the Empress Catharine,
                    agreeably to the czar’s desire before his death. His last production was <hi
                    rend="italic">Merope,</hi> which was brought upon the stage in Drury Lane by Mr
                    Garrick. He died on the 8th of February 1749, and after his decease four volumes
                    of his works in prose and verse were published in octavo, and his dramatic works
                    in two volumes.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Hill,</hi><hi rend="italic">Sir John,</hi> a voluminous
                    writer, and singular character, was born about the year 1716. He was originally
                    bred an apothecary; but his having married early, and without a fortune, made
                    him very soon look around for other resources than his profession supplied. In
                    the year 1746, he translated from the Greek a small tract by Theophrastus, on
                    Gems, which he published by subscription; and which, eing well executed,
                    procured him friends, reputation, and money. Encouraged by this, he engaged in
                    works of greater extent and importance. The first he undertook was a General
                    Natural History, in three vols. folio. He next engaged, in conjunction with
                    George Lewis Scott, in furbishing a Supplement to Chambers’s Dictionary. He at
                    the same time started the British Magazine; and whilst he was engaged in a great
                    number of works, some of which would seem to have claimed the continued
                    attention of a whole life, he carried on a daily essay, under the title of
                    Inspector. Amidst this hurry of business, Mr Hill was so laborious and ready in
                    all his undertakings, and was withal so exact an economist of his time, that for
                    many years he scarcely ever missed a public amusement, where, whilst he relaxed
                    from the severer pursuits of study, he gleaned up articles of information for
                    his periodical works. It would not be easy to trace Mr Hill through all his
                    various pursuits in life. He obtained his doctor’s degree from the university of
                    St Andrews. A quarrel he had with the Royal Society, for being refused admission
                    as a member, provoked him to ridicule that learned body, in a review of the
                    works of the Royal Society, 4to, 1751. This, together with his writing upon all
                    subjects without reserve, made him sink in the estimation of the public nearly
                    at the same rate at which he had ascended. He found, as usual, however,
                    resources in his own invention. He applied himself to the preparation of certain
                    simple medicines, as the essence of water-dock, tincture of valerian, balsam of
                    honey, and the like. The well-known simplicity of these medicines made the
                    public judge favourably of their effects, insomuch that they had a rapid sale,
                    and önce more enabled the doctor to figure in that style of life which was so
                    congenial to his inclination. He obtained the patronage of the Earl of Bute,
                    through whose interest he acquired the management of the royal gardens at Kew;
                    and, to wind up the whole of an extraordinary life, having a little before his
                    death seized an opportunity to introduce himself to the knowledge of the king of
                    Sweden, that monarch invested him with the order of knighthood, which he had not
                    the happiness of enjoying above two years. He died near the close of the year
                    1775.</p>
