                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra

                <p><label type="entry">HAZLITT, <hi rend="smallcaps">William</hi></label>, a very
                    distinguished writer on miscellaneous subjects, was a native of Shropshire, and
                    the son of an Unitarian clergyman. The date of his birth has not been
                    ascertained; but he received his education at the College at Hackney, belonging
                    to the religious persuasion with which his father was connected. After finishing
                    his academical studies, Mr Hazlitt commenced life as a painter, and by this
                    means gained such a knowledge of the principles of art as qualified him for
                    criticising works of that description, in which he greatly excelled. That he
                    would ever have become eminent as an artist is doubtful; for his love for the
                    fine arts was throughout his life intense; and if he had felt himself capable of
                    producing a work which might have raised him to fame, it seems highly probable
                    that he would have persevered. However, some of his copies from pictures in the
                    Louvre, by Titian and Raffaelle, have been spoken of as spirited and beautiful.
                    Mr Hazlitt was induced, from some cause or other, to quit the pencil for the
                    pen. His first acknowledged literary production was an essay on the “Principles
                    of Human Action;” a work in which he displayed considerable originality and
                    acuteness. In 1808 he published, in two vols. 8vo, “The Eloquence of the British
                    Senate,” being a selection of the best speeches of the most distinguished
                    parliamentary orators from the beginning of the reign of Charles I. to the
                    present time, with notes, biographical, critical, and explanatory. Shortly after
                    this work appeared, Mr Hazlitt obtained an introduction to Mr Perry, then editor
                    of the Morning Chronicle newspaper, by whom he was engaged to report
                    parliamentary speeches, and furnish original articles. To this newspaper he
                    contributed a series of able theatrical and dramatic criticisms. As a political
                    writer he is said to have showed himself somewhat intemperate, and his
                    compositions required to be carefully weeded of strong expressions. In the art
                    of reporting he is said to have displayed but little skill; indeed, a man of his
                    peculiar temperament was not likely to submit to the drudgery which that
                    occupation requires before excellence can be attained. Accordingly, a separation
                    took place between him and Mr Perry; and, besides being engaged upon another
                    morning paper, he was employed by the booksellers in contributing to various
                    periodical publications.</p>
                <p>In 1810 appeared a work of his entitled a “New and Improved English Grammar, for
                    the use of Schools,” in which the discoveries of Mr Horne Tooke, and other
                    modern writers, on the formation of language, are incorporated. This work was
                    printed in 12mo, with another upon the same subject; and an abridgment of it
                    appeared in 1812. In 1817 appeared “The Round Table,” a collection of Essays on
                    Literature, Men, and Manners. These papers had already been published in a
                    periodical work, in a series of weekly essays. During the same year, his
                    “Characters of Shakspeare’s Plays” appeared in one volume 8vo; and in 1518 he
                    published a “View of the English Stage,” containing a series of dramatic
                    criticisms. Mr Hazlitt was in 1818 engaged to deliver, at the Surrey
                    Institution, lectures upon English poetry, which he after? wards published in
                    one vol. 8vo. He subsequently gave to the world, at different intervals, “Table
                    Talk;” the “Spirit of the Age,” being criticisms upon the talents and character
                    of the most conspicuous men of the day; and “The Plain Speaker,” being a
                    collection of articles of his which had previously appeared in different
                    periodical works. He also published “Political Essays and Sketches of Public
                    Characters ;” an “Account of British Galleries of Art;” a “Letter to William
                    Gifford, Esq. ;” “Wine and Walnuts, or after-dinner chit-chat,” two vols. 8vo;
                    the “Literature of the Elizabethan Age ;” the “Modern Pygmalion ;” and the “Life
                    of Napoleon,” in four volumes. This last is his largest and most elaborate
                    production; and although strongly tinged with party feeling, and partaking more
                    of a series of reflections upon events than a minute detail of them, it is a
                    work of much power, and evinces no ordinary degree of philosophical penetration.
                    His last works were, “Notes of a Journey through France and Italy,” and
                    “Conversations of James Northcote, Esq.,” the latter of which appeared at the
                    moment of his death, which took place at London, on the 18th of September 1830.
                    He was twice married, and left an only son. Amongst the periodical works to
                    which Mr Hazlitt lent the assistance of his pen, was the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Edinburgh Review,</hi> to which he contributed various articles, some of them
                    possessing extraordinary merit. The article on the “Fine Arts” in this work was
                    also written by him.</p>
                <p>The writings of Mr Hazlitt display much originality and genius, united with great
                    critical acuteness and brilliancy of fancy. In the fine arts, the drama, and
                    dramatic literature, he was considered as one of the ablest critics of the day.
                    But he was rather acute than profound; and he displayed an excessive fondness
                    for paradox, united with a somewhat prejudiced adherence to his own opinions. He
                    was impatient of mental drudgery; and in his haste to reach conclusions, he
                    often dispensed with the labour of previous investigation. Hence the theories
                    which he proposes are seldom brought out with that elaboration and logical
                    precision which carries conviction. There is also a want of sequence or
                    continuity in his style; and he rarely produces a strong or lasting impression
                    upon the mind of the reader. He gives, in abrupt and striking sentences, the
                    results of his thoughts; but he does not, by means of proof, convincingly
                    develope his critical doctrines. In reasoning to establish any given point, his
                    arguments do not naturally grow out of each other; and his sentences, though
                    brilliant, and, when taken separately, pregnant with meaning, are only connected
                    together by a very obscure chain of relation. There seems to have been a want of
                    proportion, of balance, and of harmony in his powers. His mind was essentially
                    imaginative, and, aspiring after ideal beauty and goodness, he frequently fell
                    into extravagance and mysticism. His imagination was powerful, and he possessed
                    a rich store of ideas, which were profusely scattered over every page he wrote,
                    without much regard to either order or propriety. He is said to have read but
                    little; but this can only apply to him in the latter years of his life. That he
                    had read attentively the standard English authors, is evident from his writings;
                    <pb break="no" facs="nls:193641422" xml:id="kp-eb0711-1422-0179"/>and that they
                    had made a strong impression upon his mind; is evinced by the frequency with
                    which he quotes them, sometimes to the detriment of his style, which, in
                    consequence, assumes an appearance of patchwork. In politics, Mr Hazlitt warmly
                    espoused liberal principles; and the ardour with which he wrote in their defence
                    exposed him to much contumely and ridicule. His prejudices were strong; and he
                    displayed considerable caustic bitterness of style, when personally attacked. He
                    was, we believe, himself rarely the aggressor; and although wayward and
                    self-willed, his temper is represented as being placable and mild. An able
                    writer thus speaks of him: “His mind resembles the ‘ rich stronde’ which Spencer
                    has so nobly described, and to which he has himself likened the age of
                    Elizabeth, where treasures of every description lie, without order, in
                    inexhaustible profusion. Noble masses of exquisite marble are there, which might
                    be fashioned to support a glorious temple; and gems of peerless lustre, which
                    would adorn the holiest shrine. He has no lack of the deepest feelings, the
                    profoundest sentiments of humanity, or the loftiest aspirations after ideal
                    good. But there are no great leading principles of taste to give singleness to
                    his aims, nor any central points in his mind, around which his feelings may
                    revolve, and his imaginations cluster. There is no sufficient distinction
                    between his intellectual and his imaginative faculties. He confounds the truths
                    of imagination with those of fact, the processes of argument with those of
                    feeling, the immunities of intellect with those of virtue. Hence the seeming
                    inconsistency of many of his doctrines.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">Edinburgh Review,</hi> No. Ixviü. p.
                    440.</p></note> But with all these drawbacks and imperfections, Mr Hazlitt was a
                    powerful and an eloquent writer; and whether his opinions are just or profound,
                    no one can deny that they are strikingly expressed. His article upon the Fine
                    Arts, in this work, is one of the ablest and most striking that the subject ever
                    called forth, and would alone entitle him to high distinction amongst the
                    writers of his time. His lectures on the dramatic literature of the age of
                    Elizabeth form his best work of literary criticism. His admiration for the
                    writers of that period was intense, and he descants upon their beauties with the
                    most eloquent and joyous enthusiasm. But his Life of Napoleon, with all its
                    manifold imperfections, is perhaps his greatest work, and will probably remain
                    the most enduring record of the strength and versatility of his genius. <hi
