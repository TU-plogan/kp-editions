                    illustrious English physician, the discoverer of the circulation of the blood,
                    was born in Kent on the 2d of April 1569. After six years of study in Caius
                    College, Cambridge, he travelled through France, Germany, and Italy, and was
                    created a doctor of physic in the University of Padua, where he studied for some
                    time. After his return to London, he was incorporated doctor of physic in
                    Cambridge, afterwards admitted into the College of Physicians in London, and,

                    xml:id="kp-eb0711-1149-0158"/>appointed lecturer of anatomy and surgery in that
                    college. In these lectures he disclosed his discovery relative to the
                    circulation of the blood, which, after a variety of experiments, he communicated
                    to the world in his <hi rend="italic">Exercitatio Anatomica</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">de</hi><hi rend="italic">Motu Cordis et Sanguinis.</hi> He was
                    physician to James I. and to Charles I., and adhered to the royal cause in the
                    reign of the latter. His works have immortalised his memory. In 1651 he
                    published his <hi rend="italic">Exercitationes</hi><hi rend="italic">de</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Generatione Animalium.</hi> In 1654 he was chosen president of the
                    College of Physicians in his absence; but his age and weakness were so great,
                    that he found himself unable to discharge the duty of the office, and therefore
                    desired the college^ to choose Dr Pringle. As he had no children, he settled his
                    paternal estate upon the college. He had three years previously built a
                    combination-room, a library, and a museum; and in 1656 he brought the deeds of
                    his estate, and presented them to the college. He was also present at the first
                    festival, instituted by himself, and to be continued annually, together with a
                    commemoration speech in Latin, to be spoken on the 18th of October, in honour of
                    the benefactors to the college. He appointed a handsome stipend for the orator,
                    and also for the keeper of the library and museum, which are still called by his
                    name. This great physician, who died in 1657, had the happiness, in his
                    lifetime, to find the clamours of ignorance, envy, and prejudice, against his
                    doctrine, totally silenced, and to see it universally established. Dr Harvey was
                    not only a great, but a truly excellent man; his modesty, candour, and piety,
                    were equal to his knowledge; and the farther he penetrated into the wonders of
                    nature, the more he felt disposed to venerate its great author.</p>
