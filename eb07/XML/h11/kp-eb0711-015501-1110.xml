                <p><label type="entry">HARRISON, <hi rend="smallcaps">William</hi></label>, a writer
                    much esteemed and patronised by the literati of his time, was fellow of New
                    College, Oxford. Whilst employed as tutor to the Duke of Queensberry’s son, he
                    fortunately attracted the favour of Dr Swift, at whose solicitation Mr St John,
                    afterwards Lord Bolingbroke, obtained for him the employment of secretary to
                    Lord Raby, ambassador at the Hague, and afterwards Earl of Strafford. A letter
                    written by him whilst at Utrecht, dated 16th December 1712, is printed in the
                    dean’s works. Mr Harrison, who did not long enjoy his rising fortune, was
                    dispatched to London with the Barrier Treaty, and died on the 14th of February
                    1713. Mr Tickel has mentioned him with respect in his <hi rend="italic">Prospect
                    of Peace</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and Dr Young, in the close of an epistle
                    to Lord Lansdowne, pathetically bewails his death. Dr Birch, who has given a
                    curious note on Harrison’s letter to Swift, has confounded him with Thomas
                    Harrison of Queen’s College. In Nichols’ <hi rend="italic">Select</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Collection</hi> are some pleasing specimens of his poetry, which,
                    with Woodstock-Park, in Dodsley’s Collection, and an Ode to the Duke of
                    Marlborough, in Duncombe’s Horace, form all of his poetical writings that are
                    known. Harrison figured both as an humorist and a politician in the fifth volume
                    of the Tati er, of which, under the patronage of Bolingbroke, Henley, and Swift,
                    he was professedly the editor.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Harrison,</hi><hi rend="italic">John,</hi> an ingenious
                    mechanic, the inventor of the time-keeper or chronometer for ascertaining the
                    longitude at sea, and also of the compound, or, as it is commonly called, the
                    gridiron-pendulum, was born at Foulby, in the parish of Wragby, near Pontefract
                    in Yorkshire, in 1693. The vigour of his natural abilities amply compensated the
                    deficiencies of his education, as appears from the astonishing progress he made
                    in that branch of mechanics to which he devoted himself. His father was a
                    carpenter, in which profession the son assisted; but occasionally, according to
                    the miscellaneous practice of country artists, he also surveyed land, and
                    repaired clocks and watches. From his earliest childhood he was attached to any
                    machinery moving by wheels, as appeared whilst he lay sick of the small-pox
                    about the sixth year of his age, when he had a watch placed open upon his pillow
                    to amuse himself by contemplating the movement. In 1700, he removed with his
                    father to Barrow, in Lincolnshire, where, though his opportunities of acquiring
                    knowledge were but scanty, he eagerly improved every incident from which he
                    could collect information, frequently employing the greater part of his nights
                    in writing or drawing. He always acknowledged his obligations to a clergyman who
                    came every Sunday to officiate in the neighbourhood, and who lent him a
                    manuscript copy of Professor Saunderson’s Lectures, which he carefully
                    transcribed, with all the diagrams. His native genius enabled him to surmount
                    every disadvantage; and in the year 1726, he constructed two clocks, mostly of
                    wood, in which he applied the escapement and compound pendulum of his own
                    invention. These clocks surpassed every thing that had yet been made, scarcely
                    erring a second in a month. In 1728 he went to London with the drawings of a
                    machine for determining the longitude at sea, in expectation of being employed
                    to execute one by the board of longitude. Upon application to Dr Halley, he was
                    referred to Mr George Graham, who, discovering that he had uncommon merit,
                    advised him to construct his machine before he applied to the board of
                    longitude. He returned home to perform this task; and in 1735 he proceeded to
                    London with his first machine, and was sent to Lisbon the next year to make
                    trial of its properties. In this short voyage he corrected the dead reckoning
                    about a degree and a half. About the year 1739 he completed his second machine,
                    which was of a construction much more simple than the first, and answered much
                    better; and this, though not sent to sea, recommended Mr Harrison in a still
                    stronger manner to the patronage of his friends and the public. His third
                    machine, which he produced in 1749, was still less complicated than the second,
                    and superior in accuracy, as erring only three or four seconds in a week. This
                    he conceived to be the <hi rend="italic">ne</hi><hi rend="italic">plus
                    ultra</hi> of his attempts; but in an endeavour to improve pocket watches, he
                    found the principles he applied to surpass his expectations; and this encouraged
                    him to make his fourth time-keeper, which is in the form of a pocket watch,
                    about six inches diameter. With this time-keeper his son made two voyages, the
                    one to Jamaica, and the other to Barbadoes, in both of which it corrected the
                    longitude within the nearest limits required by the act of the 12th of Queen
                    Anne; and the inventor therefore, at different times, though not without
                    infinite trouble, received the proposed reward of L.20,000. These four machines
                    were given up to the board of longitude. The three former were not of any use,
                    as all the advantages gained by making them were comprehended in the last; they
                    were, however, worthy of being carefully preserved as mechanical curiosities, in
                    which might be traced the gradations of ingenuity executed with the most
                    delicate workmanship; but they now lie totally neglected in the royal
                    observatory at Greenwich. The fourth machine, emphatically distinguished by the
                    name of <hi rend="italic">the timekeeper,</hi> was copied by Kendal; and the
                    duplicate, during a three years’ circumnavigation of the globe in the southern
                    hemisphere by Captain Cook, answered as well as the original. The latter part of
                    Mr Harrison’s life was employed in making a fifth improved time-keeper, on the
                    same principles with the preceding one, which, at the end of a ten weeks’ trial,
                    in 1772, at the king’s private observatory at Richmond, erred only four seconds
                    and a half. Within a few years of his death, his constitution visibly declined;
                    he had frequent fits of the gout, a disorder which had never attacked him before
                    his seventy-seventh year; and he died at his house in Red-Lion Square, in 1776,
                    aged eighty-three. The recluse manner of his life, in the unremitting pursuit of
                    his favourite object, was by no means calculated to qualify him to shine as a
                    man of the world; and the many discouragements he met with in soliciting the
                    legal reward of his labours, still less disposed him to <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193641123" xml:id="kp-eb0711-1123-0156"/>accommodate himself to the
                    humours of mankind. In conversing on his profession, he was clear, distinct, and
                    modest; but, like many other mere mechanics, he found much difficulty in
                    delivering his meaning in writing, and adhered to a peculiar, uncouth
                    phraseology. This was but too evident in his <hi rend="italic">Description
                    concerning such Mechanism as will afford a nice or true Mensuration of
                    Time,</hi> 1775, 8vo; the defects of which may be accounted for from his small
                    acquaintance with letters, from his advanced age, and concomitant mental
                    infirmities, amongst which may be reckoned his obstinate refusal to accept of
                    any assistance whatever in this publication. This small work includes also an
                    account of his new musical scale, or mechanical division of the octave,
                    according to the proportion of the radius and diameter of a circle respectively
                    to the circumference. He had in his youth been the leader of a distinguished
                    band of church-singers; he had a very delicate ear for music; and his
                    experiments on sound, with a curious monochord of his own improvement, are said
                    to have been not less accurate than those which he was engaged in for the
                    mensuration of time.</p>
