                    Cumberland,in Allerdale ward, above Derwent, 311 miles from London, and three
                    from Workington. It has a considerable trade in lime and coal with Ireland, and
                    some ship-building and iron works. The population amounted in 1801 to 1357, in
                    1811 to 1621, in 1821 to 1845, and in 1831 to 1758.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Harrington,</hi><hi rend="italic">Sir John,</hi> an English
                    poet, was born at Kelston, near Bath, in 1561, instructed in classical learning
                    at Eton School, and thence removed to Cambridge, where he took his degree in
                    arts. At the age of thirty, he published a translation of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Orlando Euriosο,</hi> which, though executed without spirit or even accuracy,
                    enriched our poetry with new stores of imagery or romance. Harrington was
                    knighted in the field by Essex, to the great displeasure of the queen, who
                    wished all such honours to emanate from herself; and in the reign of King James
                    he was created a knight of the bath. Being a courtier, he presented to Prince
                    Henry a manuscript, directed chiefly against the married bishops. This
                    production was intended for the private use of the prince; but being afterwards
                    published, it raised a great clamour against the author, who had otherwise
                    incurred suspicion, if not odium, by supporting Raleigh in his suit for the
                    manor of Banwell, belonging to the bishopric of Bath and Wells, on the
                    presumption that the right reverend incumbent had incurred a <hi rend="italic"
                    >proemunire</hi> by marrying a second wife. Sir John died in 1612. His epigrams,
                    which were the most popular of his works, though possessing little poetical
                    merit, appeared first in 1618, and afterwards in 1625. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >Nugae Antigua?,</hi> a miscellaneous collection of his works, was published in
                    1792, and again iň 1804, with illustrative notes, and a memoir of the author.

                    rend="italic">James,</hi> an eminent English writer, was born in January 1611,
                    at Upton in Northamptonshire. After being educated at Oxford, he travelled into
                    Holland, France, Denmark, and Germany, and learned the languages of these
                    countries. Upon his return to England, he was admitted one of the privy chamber
                    extraordinary to King Charles I. He served the king with great fidelity, and
                    made use of his interest with his friends in parliament to procure matters to be
                    accommodated with all parties. The king loved his company, except when the
                    conversation happened to turn upon commonwealths. He found means to see the king
                    at St James’s; and attended him on the scaffold, where, or a little before, he
                    received a token of his majesty’s affection. After the death of King Charles,
                    <pb break="no" facs="nls:193641097" xml:id="kp-eb0711-1097-0154"/>he wrote his
                    <hi rend="italic">Oceana·,</hi> a kind of political romance, in imi∙ <hi
                    rend="superscript"> i</hi> tation of Plato’s Commonwealth, which h <hi
                    rend="subscript"> l</hi> e dedicated to Cromwell. It is said, that when the
                    latter perused it he declared, that “the gentleman had wrote very well but must
                    not think to cheat him out of his power ant authority; for that what he had won
                    by the sword he would not suffer himself to be scribbled out of.” This work was
                    attacked by several writers, against whom he defended it. Besides his writings
                    to promote republican principles, he instituted a nightly meeting of several
                    ingenious men in the New Palace-Yard, Westminster. This club was called the <hi
                    rend="italic">Pota,</hi> and continued till the secluded members of parliament
                    were restored by General Monk. In 1661, he was committed to the Tower for
                    treasonable designs and practices; and Chancellor Hyde, in a conference with the
                    Lords and Commons, charged him with being concerned in a plot. But a committee
                    of Lords and Commons could make nothing of the alleged plot. He was conveyed to
                    St Nicholas’s Island, and thence to Plymouth, where his imagination became
                    disordered. Having obtained his liberty through the Earl of Bath, he was carried
                    to London, and died in 1677. Besides the above works, he published several
                    others, which were first collected by Toland in 1700, one vol. folio; but a more
                    complete edition was published in 1737, by the Reverend Dr Birch.</p>
