                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra
                    space around the <gi>pb</gi> tag. Where a word is hyphenated at a <gi>pb</gi>,

                    an illustrious classical scholar and archaeologist, was born on the 25th of
                    September 1729, in a suburb of the city of Chemnitz, in Saxony, where his
                    father, having been compelled by some religious persecutions to abandon his
                    native country of Silesia, had settled, supporting his family in great poverty
                    by exercising the trade of a weaver. It was only by the liberality of his
                    godfathers that Heyne was enabled to obtain his primary instruction in the
                    elementary school of Chemnitz, and afterwards to prosecute his classical studies
                    in the gymnasium of that city. In 1745 he entered the University of Leipsic.
                    There he was so scantily supported by those on whose assistance he relied, that
                    he was frequently in want even of the common necessaries of life, and was
                    sometimes indebted for food to the generosity of a maid-servant in the house
                    where he lodged. In this situation, without even the hope of future distinction,
                    he continued to struggle against every difficulty and disappointment in the
                    acquisition of knowledge. For six months he is said to have allowed only two
                    nights in the week to sleep, and was at the same time forced to endure the
                    reproaches which his godfather thought himself entitled to inflict on him for
                    negligence in the prosecution of his studies. His distress had almost amounted
                    to despair, when he procured the situation of preceptor in the family of a
                    French merchant resident in Leipsic. He was thus enabled to continue his
                    studies, though with much interruption; the emoluments of his appointment being
                    sufficient to support him in what was at least comparative comfort. Under
                    Ernesti, he was initiated into the criticism of the classical authors; from the
                    prelections of the celebrated Bach he acquired a competent knowledge of the
                    Roman jurisprudence; and through the instructions of Christius, who lectured on
                    archaeology, and with whom he was intimately acquainted, his attention was
                    strongly directed to the works of ancient art. Having finished his studies at
                    the university, he was exposed for many years to all the accumulated distresses
                    of poverty and neglect. The first situation he was able to procure was that of
                    copyist in the library of Count de Bruhl, with a salary of only an hundred
                    dollars, which he obtained in the year 1753. From the necessity of adding
                    something to this scanty pittance, he was forced to employ himself in the
                    drudgery of translation; and, besides some French novels, he <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193642878" xml:id="kp-eb0711-2878-0291"/>translated into German the
                    Greek romance of Chariton. He published his first edition of Tibullus in 1755,
                    and in 1756 his Epictetus. In 1756, his emoluments as copyist were doubled, and
                    the education of Prince Maurice de Bruhl was intrusted to him, but without any
                    additional salary. The invasion of Saxony by the Prussians deprived him of his
                    appointment, and even destroyed the library on which it depended. The period of
                    the seven years’ war was that in which he was chiefly exposed to the storms of
                    fortune; and his marriage with Theresa Weisse, a young woman of distinguished
                    genius, but equally poor with himself, increased his misery. Having been obliged
                    to retire into Lausatia, he lived for some years as steward in the family of the
                    Baron de Leoben. He was enabled, however, to return to Dresden in 1762, where he
                    was intrusted, by Lippert, with the care of writing the Latin text of the third
                    volume of his <hi rend="italic">Ωactyliotheca.</hi></p>
                <p>At length, in the commencement of the year 1763, his merit met with its reward,
                    and a new and illustrious career was opened to him. On the death of John Matthew
                    Gesner, in 1761, it became necessary for the curators of the university of
                    Göttingen to look around for a successor capable of sustaining the reputation
                    which the institution had acquired by the learning and talents of that
                    distinguished scholar. The appointment was offered to Ernesti, who, whilst he
                    declined leaving the university of Leipsic, proposed Ruhnkenius of Leyden or
                    Saxius of Utrecht for the situation. Ruhnken likewise refused the appointment,
                    but having been strongly impressed by the taste and learning displayed by the
                    editor of Tibullus and Epictetus, he advised Munckhausen, the Hanoverian
                    minister and principal curator of the university of Göttingen, to bestow the
                    professorship on Heyne, whose merit, though known to few, he ventured to promise
                    would do honour to the choice. The minister had the good sense to acquiesce in
                    the recommendation of this great scholar, and Heyne, after some delay, became
                    professor of eloquence in Göttingen. Though his appointments were at first few,
                    and his emoluments inconsiderable, these were gradually augmented in proportion
                    as his usefulness was approved, and ąs his growing celebrity rendered it an
                    object with the other governments of Germany to secure for their literary
                    institutions the services of so distinguished a scholar. He refused the most
                    advantageous and honourable overtures from Cassel, Berlin, and Dresden. In his
                    different capacities of professor, principal librarian, member of the Royal
                    Society, and chief editor of the Literary Gazette, and still more by his
                    publications, he mainly contributed to raise the university of Göttingen to the
                    distinguished rank it holds among the academies of Europe. After a long and
                    useful career, graced with all the distinctions which in Germany are conferred
                    on literary eminence, he died, full of years and honour, on the 14th of July
                    1814.</p>
                <p>In Greek literature he has given us editions of Homer’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Iliad,</hi> Pindar, Diodorus Siculus, Apollodorus, and Epictetus; and, in
                    Latin, editions of Virgil and Tibullus; all illustrated with copious
                    commentaries. His <hi rend="italic">Opuscula Academica,</hi> in five volumes,
                    contain a series of 116 academical dissertations, of which the most valuable are
                    those respecting the antiquities of Etruscan art and history, and the researches
                    regarding the colonies of Greece. He has left us also a great number of papers
                    on almost every subject of erudition, more especially on ancient mythology,
                    amongst the <hi rend="italic">Commentationes Societatis</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Regiae Gottingensis.</hi> His <hi rend="italic">Antiquarische Aufsatze,</hi> in
                    two volumes, comprise a valuable collection of essays on different subjects
                    connected with the history of ancient art. In the earlier part of his life he
                    translated, or rather wrote anew, a great part of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Universal History.</hi></p>
                <p>After this notice of the chief events of his life, and of his literary
                    productions, it may be proper to say somewhat in regard to the distinctive merit
                    which has raised Heyne to so eminent a place amongst the promoters of classical
                    literature. And here it is chiefly as an interpreter of the ancient poets, and
                    as an original investigator of the ancient mythology, that he must rest his
                    claims to the celebrity he has acquired. As a critic of the works of art, his
                    desert is great, but he has no pretentions to original or peculiar
                    discoveries.</p>
                <p>The example of the great philologists of Holland, and the more immediate
                    influence of Ernesti and Gesner on the taste and pursuits of their countrymen,
                    had, before the middle of the last century, awakened in Germany a new zeal for
                    the study of the ancient authors, and had advanced the criticism of classical
                    literature to a rapid and vigorous maturity. The great writers of antiquity
                    ought not, however, to be read with a regard limited merely to their language;
                    they more especially deserve a close and enthusiastic study, for the admirable
                    means which they afford of improving the understanding and of cultivating the
                    taste. From the year 1760, about which period the Germans had begun to devote
                    themselves, with an enthusiasm as zealous as it was tardy, to the cultivation of
                    their native language and literature, several intelligent philologers displayed
                    a more refined and philosophical method in their treatment of the different
                    branches of classical learning, and, without neglecting either the grammatical
                    investigation of the language, or the critical constitution of the text, no
                    longer regarded a Greek or Roman writer as a subject for the mere grammarian and
                    critic, but, considering the study of the ancients as a school for thought, for
                    feeling, and for taste, they initiated us into the great mystery of reading
                    every thing in the same spirit in which it had originally been written. They
                    demonstrated, both by doctrine and example, in what manner it was necessary for
                    us to enter into the thoughts of the writer, to pitch ourselves in unison with
                    his peculiar tone of conception and expression, whether erroneous or correct,
                    and in every instance accurately to investigate the circumstances by which the
                    mind of the poet or philosopher was affected, the motives by which he was
                    animated, and the influences which co-operated in giving the intensity and
                    character to his feelings. It was shown how generally the conception of the
                    reader was merely a veil thrown over the thought of the original. It was no
                    longer allowed to combine modern with ancient ideas, to convert the derivative
                    with the original thought, or to translate it by a new and factitious
                    signification. At the head of this school stands Heyne, both as its founder and
                    principal ornament; and, however some of his disciples may have exposed
                    themselves to ridicule in their application of the principles on which this
                    system of interpretation rests, yet it cannot be denied that nothing has
                    contributed so decisively to maintain and promote the study of classical
                    literature, as the combination which Heyne has effected of philosophy with
                    erudition, both in his commentaries on the ancient authors, and in those works
                    in which he has illustrated various points of antiquity, or discussed the habit
                    of thinking and spirit of the ancient world.</p>
                <p>The poverty of Germany in manuscripts has compelled her scholars to rest
                    satisfied in general with the critical apparatus which the philosophers of other
                    nations have collected. What they necessarily wanted in the originality of
                    subsidiary stores, they have, however, endeavoured to supply, by a sound and
                    rational employment of those already compiled; and the praise of useful
                    diligence cannot certainly, with justice, be denied to their labours in this
                    department. Originality, however, was possible in the higher criticism, which
                    does not rest on the collection of readings or the authority of manuscripts, and
                    in the mode of the illustration applied to the ancient writers: in <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193642891" xml:id="kp-eb0711-2891-0292"/> these respects
                    the later pbilologers of Germany have earned a glory peculiar to themselves, and
                    which must be remembered as long as learning and ingenuity are respected. How
                    cogently have they reasoned on the authenticity or spuriousness of particular
                    writings, and how skilfully have they applied the test to the interpolations of
                    later times; towhat new conclusions are we now brought in regard to Orpheus,
                    Homer, Anacreon, Longinus, &amp;c. by the critical investigations of Schneider,
                    Wolf, Fischer, Hermann, Weiske, and others; how differently has the controversy
                    in regard to the authenticity of certain orations of Cicero been recently
                    concluded by Wolf, compared with the result of Markland’s and Gesner’s
                    investigations. In this department Heyne does not, however, hold the same
                    pre-eminence which he has attained as an enlightened and popular interpreter;
                    for though his discussions in the higher criticism are both numerous and
                    valuable, he is as much surpassed in boldness and originality by Wolf, as he is
                    inferior to Hermann in the minuteness and ingenuity of his reasoning.</p>
                <p>There is, however, another department in which the labours of Heyne are more
                    original, and in which he merits all the honour to which a discoverer is
                    entitled. Until the middle of the eighteenth century, mythology was nothing else
                    than the nomenclature of divinities, a collection of the manifold and discordant
                    legends of their several relations, actions, and destinies, and the delineation
                    of their forms from the works of the poets and artists, illustrated, perhaps, by
                    a mystical and allegorical commentary. About this period some more profound
                    thinkers began to regard the mythical traditions in a higher view, as sources of
                    human history; but, from too confined an acquaintance with the circumstances and
                    condition of the ancient world, they took too high a standard for their
                    explanations, and, through a mystical and allegorical interpretation, thinking
                    they had discovered, under the veil of mythological narration, ideas of the
                    deepest wisdom, they confidently framed thereon hypotheses for the history of
                    mankind, for the arts, for philosophy, and the other sciences, which threatened
                    altogether to extinguish the glimmering light that was still afforded us for the
                    periods of remote antiquity.</p>
                <p>Heyne opened a less ambitious but more certain path. Following the observations
                    which travellers had collected in regard to new and uncivilized nations, he
                    applied these to the condition of the Greeks, who, as history informs us, from a
                    rude and sensual barbarism, gradually advanced to a state of civilization and
                    intellectual refinement. He thus arrived at the simple conclusion, that the
                    mythical tales of antiquity contain the first attempts at reasoning, the most
                    ancient history, philosophy, and theology embodied in a poor, unformed, and
                    consequently figurative language; and, therefore, that mythology is a system
                    comprehending partly the original form of representation through objects of
                    sense peculiar to a rude age, expressed in fables, ceremonies, and monuments,
                    transplanted into later times; partly a kind of poetical apparatus derived and
                    formed from this original mythology, and intended only by its authors for the
                    purposes of poetical effect. He hence justly concluded that it is impossible to
                    attain any real insight into the nature of mythical narration, unless the <hi
                    rend="italic">mythi</hi> of the most ancient poets are carefully distinguished
                    from the abusive applications made of them in the poetry of after times, and
                    unless mythology be kept separate from the philosophy conversant about
                    mythology. In conformity with these fundamental rules, Heyne has illustrated
                    Apollodorus; and in the same spirit he has conducted those researches into the
                    nature and tendency of the different mythi of Greece, which he has published in
                    the <hi rend="italic">Transactions of the Poyal Society of Gottingen.</hi> His
                    views have been almost universally admitted to be correct in principle, and his
                    applications to have been conducted with the most profound learning and almost
                    unequalled ingenuity. A great number of followers have pursued the path he
                    opened; and his theory has now attained the form and stability of a system,
                    through the labours of his disciples. Amongst these, the names of Martin Hermann
                    (not the philologer), of Voss, and of Manso, are especially to be distinguished.
                    The theologians of Germany have likewise applied the same theory to the
                    interpretation of the Sacred Books; and the researches of Eichhorn, Bauer,
                    Ilgen, Hartmann, Vater, De Wette, and a host of other philosophical divines,
                    into the pretended biblical mythi, have been pursued with a learning and
                    acuteness equalled only by the impious audacity of their conclusions, (v.
                    v.)</p>
