                    <hi rend="italic">sacred sculptures,</hi> or characters, and appears to have
                    been applied by the Greeks to that particular species of writing which they
                    found inscribed or engraven on the palaces, temples, sepulchres, and other
                    public monuments of Egypt.</p>
                <p>The epithet <hi rend="italic">sacred</hi> (hgoς), which enters into the
                    composition of this term, is, however, apt to mislead those who have not
                    attended particularly to the subject. The <hi rend="italic">hieroglyphics</hi>
                    were not so denominated as being <hi rend="italic">exclusively</hi> appropriated
                    or confined to compositions connected with religion; they, in fact, constituted
                    a real written language, applicable to history and common life, as well as to
                    subjects of a religious or mythological kind. This opinion, which the sagacity
                    of Warburton enabled him to form, long before the true nature of these
                    characters had been divined, is established as incontrovertible by the Greek
                    inscription on the stone of Rosetta, which speaks of the three divisions or
                    compartments of the pillar as containing different versions of the same decree,
                    one in the sacred characters, another in the enchorial or vulgar, and a third in
                    Greek, being a translation of the other two; and that there is no fraud or
                    deception in this description, is at once made evident by the coincidence of the
                    numerals at the end of the hieroglyphical text with the concluding words of the
                    Greek inscription.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>This
                    was first remarked by Mr Akerblad, who pointed out, at the close of the
                    hieroglyphical inscription, the three first numerals, indicated by I. 11. and
                    111. where the Greek has “the first and the second,” Kα&lt; <hi rend="italic"

                    being broken off.</p></note> Instead, therefore, of qualifying these characters
                    or sculptures as <hi rend="italic">sacred,</hi> the Greeks, had they been aware
                    of their real nature, or of <hi rend="italic">all</hi> purposes to which they
                    were applied, would have described them as <hi rend="italic">monumental,</hi>
                    and thus distinguished them from the other forms of writing in use amongst the
                    Egyptians, by the circumstance which appears to have almost invariably regulated
                    their application. They constituted the monumental writing of ancient Egypt; and
                    as such were distinguished from the intermediate form, called the <hi
                    rend="italic">hieratic,</hi> which is for the most part confined to the papyri,
                    and still more from the <hi rend="italic">enchorial</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >demotic,</hi> which appears to have been employed for the ordinary purposes of
                    life. In common language, where nice distinctions are seldom necessary, the term
                    <hi rend="italic">hieroglyphics</hi> is indifferently applied to all the three
                    forms of writing, monumental, hieratic, and enchorial; but, in a treatise like
                    this, where the object is to convey accurate information, we must be careful to
                    avoid such confusion, and at the same time to impress upon the mind of the
                    reader the necessity of keeping constantly in view the distinctions here traced,
                    which will afterwards be more fully unfolded and explained.</p>

                    respecting hieroglyphics, and of the attempts made, at different times, to

                <p>All antiquity is agreed in representing the country of the Pharaohs as the
                    birthplace of science, learning, and art, and as the theatre of the earliest
                    form of civilization of which any monument or even tradition has been preserved.
                    At a period when the soil of Greece and of Italy was covered with primeval
                    forests, affording shelter only to wild beasts, or to roving barbarians hardly
                    less savage, the valley of the Nile was occupied by a people far advanced in
                    civil and social improvement, and who had already constructed those Titanian
                    monuments which still command our wonder and admiration, after the lapse of more
                    than three thousand years, and the ravages of successive conquests. Nor has this
                    people been indebted for their high celebrity either to the barbaric splendour
                    of military achievements, or to any of the ordinary elements which constitute
                    material grandeur. On the contrary, the circumstances which have mainly
                    contributed to ensure them an incontestible superiority over most other nations
                    of the world are, the antiquity of their civilization, the wisdom of their
                    institutions and laws, the extent and variety of their knowledge, tire singular
                    character of their government and religion, and the everlasting monuments on
                    which they have engraved their history, and inscribed the names and titles of
                    their gods and their kings. Long before any other country had emerged out of
                    barbarism; when even antiquity, in the ordinary estimate, had not begun; Egypt
                    enjoyed the benefit of a regular government, and cultivated with equal ardour
                    and success those sciences and arts which the Greeks afterwards borrowed, but
                    did not in every instance improve.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                <p>As early as the days of Moses, who was himself instructed in the wisdom of the
                    Egyptians,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>“Erat autem
                    Moses eruditus in omni sapientia Aegyptiorum.” But Philo, in his life of the
                    Jewish lawgiver, enters into details respecting the education of Moses. “Cum
                    enim felicitate ingenii magistrorum, ex universa Aegypto convocatorum doctrinam
                    excederet, et simul multa ingeniose excogitaret; numeros quidem, et geometriam,
                    musicam rhythmicam, harmonicam, metricam, sive contemplativam accepit ab
                    Aegyptiis doctoribus; maxime vero <hi rend="italic">occultam philosophiam
                    descriptam,</hi> ut vocant, <hi rend="italic">literis hieroglyphicis,</hi> hoc
                    est, notis animalium quae ipsi venerantur pro numinibus.” Justin Martyr, in his
                    <hi rend="italic">Protreptico,</hi> denies that Moses studied geometry, but
                    affirms that the Jewish leader was initiated in the mysteries of hieroglyphics.
                    He states, “Mosen, omisso studio omnium mathematicarum, quae in Aegypto vulgares
                    erant, et viles, adjecisse animum <hi rend="italic">ad solas
                    hicroglyphicas</hi><hi rend="italic">disciplinas,</hi> quae tum apud eos <hi
                    rend="italic">sola in honore et pretio erant,</hi> et non quibuslibet, sed <hi

                    traderentur.</hi> Has cum didicisset Moses, nil tamen unquam secundum eas, aut
                    dixit, aut fecit; quod contrarium esset unius veri Dei cultui.” In this last
                    particular, however, Clemens Alexandrinus is at variance with Justin; for, in
                    the fifth book of his <hi rend="italic">Stromata,</hi> he says, “Moysen, <hi
                    rend="italic">juxta</hi><hi rend="italic">hanc ħiero∙ glyphicae</hi><hi

                    laws, institutions,, learning, and the arts had already attained an
                    extraordinary development, appear to have reached the maximum of improvement;
                    they had, in fact, completed their ascending mo vernent, and were fixed on that
                    elevated position which nations generally occupy, for a longer or shorter
                    period, before they begin to descend, and in which the genius of their civil,
                    religious, and social system was eminently calculated to maintain them, for
                    ages, stationary. All the notices incidentally given by the sacred historian,
                    corroborated by the evidence of contemporary <pb break="no" facs="nls:193642930"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0711-2930-0295"/>monuments, clearly indicate a people who had
                    already arrived at this grand limit, and who were in the full possession and
                    enjoyment of all the advantages derivable from the peculiar forms of religion
                    and government under which they lived. Even in that remote age, the civilization
                    of the Egyptians had passed into a proverb; nor is it by any means improbable
                    that the Jewish legislator, in framing a code of laws for the people whom he was
                    directed by his high mission to deliver from bondage, and form into a nation,
                    transfused into it somewhat of the practical or written wisdom which he had
                    learned in the country of his birth and education.</p>
                <p>From the era of Moses, by whom Egypt is connected with the earliest traditions,
                    no less than with the first historical monument of the human race, until that of
                    the Persian conquest, when its glory and independence perished together; that
                    is, during a long interval of about ten centuries; a few detached and scanty
                    notices, accidentally preserved and often negligently recorded, comprehend all
                    that can be gleaned from the ancient authors respecting either its internal
                    condition or its external relations. It appears, however, that, both before and
                    after the Persian invasion, the Greeks were in the habit of resorting to Egypt
                    to be initiated in the laws, customs, and institutions, as well as science and
                    learning, of the Egyptians; that, notwithstanding all they have alleged as to
                    the exclusion of strangers or foreigners, access was freely afforded them to
                    that knowledge of which the ministers of religion were the sole depositaries;
                    and that in proportion as the seminal principles of civilization began to take
                    root in the genial soil of Greece, they crowded back to obtain fresh supplies
                    from the great storehouse whence the first portion of the good seed had been
                    derived. Thales, Pythagoras, Plato, and many others, were all instructed in the
                    Egyptian school, where they learned the elements of that science which they
                    afterwards taught to their countrymen;<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    describing the palace of Osymandias, makes mention of a library; and Manetho,
                    cited by Jamblicus, states the number of books attributed to Hermes or Thoth, or
                    belonging to that celebrated personage, at thirty-six thousand five hundred and
                    twenty-five. ¢Zoëga, <hi rend="italic">De Orig.</hi><hi rend="italic">et Usu

                    Athens, the disciples of the hierogrammatists kindled the lamps which had been
                    trimmed and supplied in Egypt; and, what is less known though equally certain,
                    the rudiments of that art, the originals of those beautiful forms, which the
                    fine natural genius of the Greeks, improving on their models, carried to an
                    almost ideal perfection, may even now be discovered in the bas-reliefs which
                    cover the temples, palaces, and tombs scattered along the valley of the Nile.
                    The fanatical fire-worshippers of Iran, led by a ferocious conqueror, had, no
                    doubt, wreaked their utmost fury against the edifices consecrated to the worship
                    of the gods of Egypt. In their blind hatred of idolatry, they ravaged the
                    country which they had overrun, and deluged it in blood; but they were neither
                    able to destroy the monuments on which they had exhausted their iconoclastic
                    rage, nor to extirpate the learning which they could not appreciate. Hence, when
                    the fortunes of a second conquest had placed kings of Greek descent upon the
                    throne of the Pharaohs, Egypt, under their enlightened sway, recovered a portion
                    of its ancient splendour; the treasures of that renowned scat of early
                    civilization were placed within the reach of philosophic investigation; Greece
                    repaid a portion of the debt which she had long before contracted; science and
                    learning were cultivated with ardour and success in the new capital to which the
                    Macedonian conqueror had bequeathed his name; and when, at length, the star of
                    the Ptolemies set to rise no more, and Egypt was degraded into a province of the
                    Roman empire, the masters of the world came in their turn to dispose of all that
                    a third conquest had spared.</p>
                <p>To the Greeks, therefore, who had so long been connected with Egypt, and to the
                    Romans, by whom the Greeks were at length replaced, it was natural to look for
                    the most ample information respecting the institutions, manners, customs, arts,
                    antiquities, science, and literature of that interesting region. Nor, in regard
                    to some of these subjects, did the curious look altogether in vain. Herodotus
                    has devoted a considerable portion of his history to details connected with the
                    laws, usages, manners, and topography of Egypt, which he studied on the spot;
                    and much useful information may likewise be collected from the writings of
                    Diodorus Siculus, Strabo, and others, as well as from those of the later Roman
                    authors, in their incidental notices of that country. But there is one subject,
                    perhaps the most interesting of all, respecting which they have supplied little
                    or no intelligible information; we mean the literature of Egypt, including
                    therein the different methods of writing practised in that country from the
                    earliest times.</p>
                <p>In Egypt, the arts of sculpture and painting were at all times subordinate to,
                    and in reality branches of, the art of writing; whilst the monuments scattered
                    over its surface were almost all covered externally with sculptures, or
                    internally with paintings, obviously employed as a species of written language,
                    and intended to serve as records of past events, or of laws, usages, customs,
                    and rites, which had existed at the time when these memorials were originally
                    traced. Here was a circumstance apparently calculated to stimulate the most
                    sluggish curiosity, and to excite even indifference itself to inquire and
                    examine. For what subject of greater interest could possibly be presented to the
                    human mind, than the pictured records of the earliest civilization, which, with
                    a view to the perpetuity of their endurance, had been consigned to eternal
                    monuments? But, from whatever cause, whether from that absurd pride which led
                    the Greeks and Romans to disdain studying those forms of speech which they
                    considered as barbarous, or from the total want of philological talent, and an
                    incapacity for pursuing painful and laborious speculations, the classical
                    writers supply us with nothing beyond a few vague and imperfect notices, which
                    it is often equally difficult to understand or to reconcile; and, whilst they
                    tell us not only that Egypt was the parent of all arts and sciences, but that
                    the hieroglyphical inscriptions on its public monuments contained a summary of
                    the most important mysteries of nature and the most sublime inventions of man,
                    they at the same time pretend that the interpretation of these characters had
                    been so studiously concealed by the priests from the knowledge of the vulgar,
                    and had indeed been so imperfectly understood by themselves, that, in the days
                    of the later Roman emperors, it was wholly lost and forgotten. It is even
                    alleged, though the story seems to rest upon no authentic foundation, that a
                    reward was offered in vain, by one of the first Caesars, for an interpretation
                    of the inscription on an obelisk, then recently brought from Egypt to Rome.<note

                    from any thing which has been transmitted to us on this subject by the Greek or
                    the Roman writers. Their ignorance of the hieroglyphic system in its details is
                    either admitted or evident; and even Clement of Alexandria, who certainly
                    understood the different methods of writing practised in Egypt, has expressed
                    himself with so much technical conciseness, not to say obscurity, that, with all
                    the lights of recent discovery to guide us, it is by no means an easy task to
                    interpret his meaning.</p>
                <p>In the infancy of art and civilization, mankind appear to have employed mimetic
                    images, or portraits, to represent individual objects, and give notice of events
                    to those at a distance. Thus, the Mexicans denoted the arrival of the Spaniards
                    by a rude delineation of a ship, and of a man distinguished by the peculiarities
                    of the European dress. This is what may be called <hi rend="italic">picture
                    writings</hi> or the natural representation of objects or actions. But mere
                    mimetic images, which could convey no idea of time, nor indicate any abstract
                    quality or attribute, were totally insufficient for the purposes of
                    communicating information and recording events. Hence conventional signs,
                    sometimes kuriologi-caland sometimes tropical,<note anchored="true"

                    symbols both of things and thoughts, of objects in nature and ideas of the mind.
                    But much time must have elapsed before men learned to communicate with one
                    another by means of symbolical pictures or representations; and no length of
                    time-could possibly render such a method of communication easy. The painter or
                    sculptor, as it might be, would probably, begin improvement by lessening the
                    size and abridging the number of his signs; the language spoken to the ear
                    helping him to represent that which was to be addressed to the eye. But, in the
                    formation of language, man invariably proceeds from particulars to generals;
                    classifying individuals according to their species, and arranging qualities or
                    attributes under their proper categories. Thus, in inventing words for
                    expressing his ideas, he would also invent the means of limiting their number;
                    and, as oral preceded written language, the forms and figures of speech would
                    instruct the graphic artist how to express his sentiments and abridge his
                    symbols. The metaphors which he employed in speaking would naturally suggest the
                    images which he might use in writing. If, when he spoke, he called a strong man
                    a lion, when he wrote he might draw the figure of that animal as the symbol of
                    strength or force. But the inconvenience of representing the entire image would
                    be almost immediately felt; and therefore necessity would teach the use of
                    synecdoche, or putting a part for the whole, as when the Mexicans represented
                    the <hi rend="italic">rabbit</hi> by its <hi rend="italic">head,</hi> and the
                    <hi rend="italic">reed</hi> by its <hi rend="italic">flower.</hi> By another
                    natural transition, or rather advance, an action or event would be indicated by
                    some object necessary to its accomplishment, or the concomitant thereof, as when
                    the Egyptians expressed the existence of a <hi rend="italic">siege</hi> by
                    painting a <hi rend="italic">scaling-ladder.</hi><note anchored="true"

                    place in all languages, but more especially the tropes and figures which abound
                    in all dialects spoken by nations not yet refined by the highest civilization,
                    must have greatly facilitated both the invention and the comprehension of
                    hieroglyphics.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    9.</p></note> In the progress of improvement, then, we have two stages clearly
                    defined; first, <hi rend="italic">picture-writing,</hi> which consists in the
                    mere representation of events, or of objects in a state of action with one
                    another; and, secondly, <hi rend="italic">hieroglyphics,</hi> or symbolical
                    writing, which is sometimes kuriological, and sometimes tropical.</p>
                <p>Nor is all this matter of hypothetical speculation. Humboldt, in treating of the
                    graphic system of the Mexicans, which he has commented on with great learning
                    and ingenuity, shows that both the stages above described in some measure
                    co-existed amongst, them, and were occasionally combined, though never
                    confounded. They had picture-writing, in its simple and primitive form; and they
                    had likewise a species of hieroglyphical representation, far inferior indeed to
                    that which is found in the Egyptian inscriptions, but still to a certain extent
                    constructed upon the same, or at least similar principles. It appears that the
                    use of hieroglyphical paintings was common amongst the Toltecks, the Aztecks,
                    and other tribes inhabiting the elevated plain of Anahuac, which extends
                    northward from Mexico and is nearly the same with the territory known by the
                    name of New Spain. But no trace of alphabetical characters was anywhere to be
                    found. The analysis of sounds, which leads to the most admirable, we might say
                    the most miraculous, of all inventions, an alphabet, had not been attained by
                    any native of the American continent; and it is even probable, as Humboldt
                    conjectures, that the progressive perfection of symbolical writing, and the
                    facility with which objects were delineated, prevented the introduction of
                    letters. They have at least done so, for a much longer time, with the Chinese,
                    who have contented themselves with fourscore thousand characters, composed of
                    two hundred and fourteen keys, or radical hieroglyphics. The same learned
                    traveller proceeds to inform us, that the Azteck people had real hieroglyphical
                    characters for water, earth, air, wind, day, night, speech, motion; that they
                    had the same for numbers, and for the days and months of the solar year; that
                    these signs, added to the painting of an event, marked the time and other
                    circumstances of the action; that amongst the Mexicans there were found vestiges
                    of the hieroglyphics called <hi rend="italic">phonetic,</hi> which indicate not
                    relations with things, but with the spoken language; and that, upon the whole,
                    the Mexican paintings bear a great resemblance, not so much to the
                    hieroglyphical writings of the Egyptians, as to the rolls of papyrus found in
                    the swathings of the mummies, which, according to him, are all paintings of a
                    mixed kind, uniting symbolical characters with the representation of an
                    action.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Humboldt, <hi

                    English translation. “When we examine the history of those nations to which the
                    use of letters is unknown,” says this celebrated traveller, “we find, in both
                    hemispheres, that men have attempted to paint the objects which struck their
                    imagination; to represent things that were complex, <hi rend="italic">by putting
                    a part for the whole</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and thus to compose such
                    pictures as would serve to perpetuate the memory of remarkable events. The
                    Delaware Indian, in scouring the forests, carves some lines on the bark of a
                    tree, to mark the number of the enemy he has killed. Even conventional signs are
                    introduced; and a single stroke marks whether the scalp has been cut from the
                    head of a man or a woman. Such representations, however, are not to be
                    confounded with hieroglyphics, which are essentially different from the mere
                    representation of an event, or of objects in a state of action with one
                    another.” He adds, “The first missionaries who visited America compared the
                    Azteck paintings with the hieroglyphical writing of the Egyptians. Kircher,
                    Warburton, and other learned men, have contested the propriety of this
                    comparison, not having been careful to distinguish the paintings of a mixed
                    kind, <hi rend="italic">in which real hieroglyphics, sometimes kuriological,
                    sometimes tropical, are added to the natural representation of an
                    action."</hi></p></note> In a word, the Mexicans, at the time when their country
                    was overrun by the Spaniards, appear to have made considerable progress in that
                    method of writing which had attained to so high a degree <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193642956" xml:id="kp-eb0711-2956-0297"/>of perfection amongst the
                    Egyptians; they had passed through the first stage in the career of improvement,
                    and were already entering upon the second, when the hieroglyphic, which is at
                    first employed to modify, comes ultimately to supersede picture-writing.</p>
                <p>But although hieroglyphics were a great and manifest improvement on mimetic
                    images or picture-writing, still this method of communication was found
                    essentially defective; its symbols were constantly liable to be misunderstood,
                    the art of painting or engraving them could only be practised by a few, and
                    there were some things which could not in this way be expressed at all. Sensible
                    of these inconveniences, and impelled by the natural disposition to abbreviate
                    and simplify, the Egyptians appear, at an early period of their history, to have
                    made some advances towards the introduction of a more compendious and
                    practicable method of expressing their thoughts, by reference partly to the
                    sounds, and partly to the syllabic combinations, of their living speech; in
                    other words, to have entered on that course of improvement which, if pursued,
                    would have ended in the formation of an alphabet. But, notwithstanding all that
                    has been said to the contrary, it is now pretty certain that they stopped short
                    at the threshold, and extended the use of phonetic symbols no further than
                    appeared necessary to remedy the more obvious defects of the hieroglyphic method
                    of writing.</p>
                <p>Accordingly, Herodotus, after mentioning that the Egyptians wrote from right to
                    left, contrary to the method in use amongst the Greeks,<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>This is the truth, but not the whole truth,

                    they employed <hi rend="italic">two</hi> kinds of characters; the one

                    which could lead us to infer that the sacred and popular characters had any
                    affinity, or that the latter were, through an intermediate form, derived from
                    the former. Diodorus Siculus repeats the statement of Herodotus almost in the
                    same words; adding, however, that the popular characters were taught to all, but
                    that the knowledge of the sacred characters was confined exclusively to the
                    priests.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>∆iττa∣v γaζ

                    undoubtedly concise enough; but it nevertheless embraces all the information
                    which these writers, both of whom had visited Egypt, have thought proper to
                    communicate upon this interesting subject. The statement of Herodotus and
                    Diodorus, however, is in perfect accordance with the inscription on the Rosetta
                    column, in regard to which it is impossible to suspect any error, seeing it
                    bears to have been engraved under the inspection of the priests themselves. That
                    celebrated monument, agreeing in this particular with the authors just named,
                    makes mention of only <hi rend="italic">two</hi> kinds of characters; the one
                    called <hi rend="italic">enchorial, ιγχωgia γξaμμaτa,</hi> or “characters of the
                    country,” evidently identical with the <hi rend="italic">demotic</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">popular</hi> characters of Herodotus and Diodorus; and the other
                    called <hi rend="italic">sacred, Ííga.</hi> Thus far, then, the Rosetta
                    inscription and the Greek historians are agreed. But as the latter gives us no
                    information respecting the peculiar nature of the sacred as contrasted with the
                    demotic or enchorial characters, nor conversely, we must turn to the next
                    ancient writer, who treats incidentally of the subject, and endeavour to
                    ascertain whether he has communicated any thing calculated to extend our
                    knowledge, or to supply what is wanting in the statement of his
                    predecessors.</p>
                <p>In a well-known passage of the <hi rend="italic">Stromata</hi> of Clemens
                    Alexandrinus, that learned father enumerates, with great conciseness, but with a
                    degree of precision to which modern discovery has given a high interest, the
                    different kinds of writing in use amongst the Egyptians, and states generally
                    the peculiarities by which these are distinguished. The passage in question,
                    which has been frequently quoted, and often misunderstood or mistranslated, will
                    be found not only to supply the defects in the statement of the Greek
                    historians, but also to receive a singular confirmation from the discoveries of
                    which it is the principal object of this article to give some account.</p>
                <p>“Those who are educated amongst the Egyptians,” says Clemens, “learn first of all
                    the method of Egyptian writing called <hi rend="smallcaps">epistolographic</hi>;
                    secondly, the <hi rend="smallcaps">hieratic,</hi> which the hierogrammatists
                    (sacred scribes) employ; and, lastly, the most complete method, the <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">hieroglyphic.</hi> The hieroglyphic [is of two kinds]; the one
                    <hi rend="italic">huriologic,</hi> (or denoting objects in a direct manner) by
                    means of the primary letters of the alphabet; the other <hi rend="italic"
                    >symbolical.</hi> Of the <hi rend="italic">symbolical</hi> [there are several
                    sorts]; one represents objects directly by <hi rend="italic">imitation;</hi>
                    another expresses them <hi rend="italic">tropically</hi> (that is, indirectly or
                    ffiguratively); whilst the third employs allegories, expressed by certain
                    aenigmas. Thus, according to the method of representing objects directly or
                    properly by <hi rend="italic">imitation,</hi> the Egyptians make a circle when
                    they wish to represent the sun, and trace a luniform figure (or crescent) to
                    denote the moon. According to the <hi rend="italic">tropical</hi> method, they
                    represent objects by means of certain, analogies, which they transfer into the
                    expression of those objects by various changes, transpositions, and
                    modifications, very frequently by complete transformations. Thus, when they wish
                    to transmit the praises of their kings under the form of religious legends, they
                    employ <hi rend="italic">anaglyphs</hi> (that is, transpositions or
                    transformations of the hieroglyphs). Of the third kind of symbolical writing,
                    which is <hi rend="italic">(Enigmatical,</hi> let this serve as an example: The
                    Egyptians assimilate the oblique course of the other [planetary] stars to the
                    bodies of serpents, but the sun they represent by the figure of a

                <p>In this passage, it is evident that Clement of Alexandria admits three principal
                    and distinct'methods or kinds of the Egyptian writing: first, the <hi

                    <hi rend="smallcaps">hieratic</hi>; and thirdly, the <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >hieroglyphic.</hi></p>
                <p>Of the first and second kinds he gives no detail or explanation whatever. The
                    third, or <hi rend="italic">hieroglyphic,</hi> which alone occupies his
                    attention, is divided into two sorts: one described as κυg∕oaoy∕%&gt;1 δ∕α <hi

                    expressions proper to designate objects according to the ordinary usage, and in
                    opposition to figurative terms, or periphrases. Thus Longinus, or the author,
                    whoever he was, of the Treatise on the Sublime, says, <hi rend="italic"

                    enters into details respecting the latter, which he subdivides into three
                    secondary species. The <pb break="no" facs="nls:193642969"

                    obscurely defined, and the example' is not much clearer than the definition. It
                    is difficult to discover what the author means by the <hi rend="italic"
                    >anaglyphs,</hi> which, he says, the Egyptians employed to hand down the praises
                    of their kings, and which, if they consisted of transpositions merely, might
                    •have been formed out of mimetic representations as well as out of tropical
                    symbols.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>“Je voudrais,”
                    says Μ. Letronne, “pouvoir définir ce que l’auteur entend par des <hi
                    rend="italic">αηαglyphes,</hi> qui servaient, comme on voit, pour l’expression
                    <hi rend="italic">tropique</hi> ou <hi rend="italic">figurée:</hi> dans la
                    rigeur, la première espèce, comme la seconde, devait se composer de <hi

                    rend="italic">d’anaglyphes</hi> lorsqu’elles étaient sculptées sur les monumens.
                    Pourquoi done Clément d’Alexandrie borne-t-il les anaglyphes à l’écriture
                    symbolique figurée? Il faut qu’il entende par-là one espèce particulière <hi
                    rend="italic">àe figures sculptées,</hi> servant toutefois comme <hi

                    rend="italic">Précis du Syst. Hiérogh.</hi> p. 381.) The reader will also find
                    some judicious observations on this subject, by Baron Silvestre de Sacy, in the
                    <hi rend="italic">Journal des Savans</hi> for March 1825, p. 251,
                    252.</p></note> From the classification, however, it appears that, by anaglyphs
                    he understands <hi rend="italic">sculptured figures</hi> employed as a species
                    of <hi rend="italic">writing.</hi> As to the third species, namely, the <hi
                    rend="italic">(Enigmatical,</hi> there is no room either for doubt or
                    difficulty.</p>
                <p>But instead of the <hi rend="italic">three</hi> kinds of Egyptian writing here
                    described, Herodotus and Diodorus Siculus mention only <hi rend="italic"
                    >two,</hi> namely, the <hi rend="italic">popular</hi> and the <hi rend="italic"
                    >sacred characters</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> a statement which is completely
                    confirmed by the Rosetta inscription, where <hi rend="italic">two</hi> kinds
                    only are spoken of, viz. the <hi rend="italic">enchorial,</hi> identical with
                    the <hi rend="italic">demotic,</hi> and those called <hi rend="italic"
                    >sacred.</hi> These authorities, however, may be satisfactorily reconciled. All
                    the difference between them consists in this, that Clement of Alexandria
                    mentions the <hi rend="italic">hieratic</hi> writing, in regard to which
                    Herodotus, Diodorus, and the Rosetta inscription are all perfectly silent. But
                    the reason of this is sufficiently evident. The historians and the inscription
                    include the <hi rend="italic">hieratic</hi> amongst the <hi rend="italic">sacred
                    characters,</hi> whilst Clement, having employed a more restricted term, found
                    it necessary to distinguish this intermediate form from the <hi rend="italic"
                    >hieroglyphic,</hi> of which, also, he alone makes mention. A few observations
                    will be sufficient to place this matter in the clearest light.</p>
                <p>It is agreed upon all hands that the <hi rend="italic">epistolographic</hi> of
                    Clemens Alexandrinus is identical with the <hi rend="italic">demotic</hi> of
                    Herodotus and Diodorus, and with the <hi rend="italic">enchorial</hi> of the
                    Rosetta inscription. But the <hi rend="italic">hieratic</hi> was certainly a
                    species of the <hi rend="italic">sacred characters,</hi> inasmuch as it was the
                    form employed by the <hi rend="italic">hierogrammatists,</hi> or sacred scribes;
                    and hence Clement has denominated it the <hi rend="italic">sacerdotal
                    writing,</hi> from its having been employed by the priests in manuscripts. The
                    <hi rend="italic">hieroglyphic,</hi> however, was, properly speaking, the <hi
                    rend="italic">monumental writing,</hi> as is indeed expressed by the term
                    (∕ig07λup∕κα), which literally signifies <hi rend="italic">sacred
                    characters</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">sculptured</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >engraved;</hi> whilst the <hi rend="italic">hieratic</hi> might be called the
                    <hi rend="italic">hieroglyphic writing,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">sacred
                    characters</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">written.</hi> This distinction explains and
                    reconciles every thing. Herodotus and Diodorus do not employ the word
                    figoχλu-p∕κα; the epithet they apply is <hi rend="italic">kğa, sacred,</hi>
                    which necessarily includes both kinds of <hi rend="italic">sacred writing,</hi>
                    the <hi rend="italic">hieratic</hi> as well as the other. But Clemens
                    Alexandrinus speaks of the <hi rend="italic">hieroglyphic,</hi> an expression
                    which is less generic, and cannot include the hieratic, a kind of writing which
                    was not employed on the <hi rend="italic">sculptured</hi> monuments
                    (χsχλuu≠wva)∙ The learned father, therefore, differs from the others merely in
                    this; that they have only employed generic expressions, whereas he has entered
                    into the detail of the species. Discrepancy there is absolutely none. For the
                    same reason, in the Rosetta monument, the monumental characters are designated
                    by the epithet ∕¾α, instead of ∕^oyaυp∕κα, which might have appeared the term
                    most proper to describe the kind of characters engraved on that stone. But the
                    distinction was unnecessary. For, as the <hi rend="italic">hieratic</hi> was
                    never employed in monumental inscriptions, and as the question here related to
                    the cutting or engraving of <hi rend="italic">sacred characters</hi> on the
                    pillar, these characters could be nothing but <hi rend="italic"
                    >hieroglyphics</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and consequently the generic
                    expression <hi rend="italic">'nξα, sacred,</hi> was, in this case, altogether as
                    precise as the specific expression ∕sgoyaυp∕xα would have been.</p>
                <p>Having made these observations with a view to remove ambiguity, and prevent the
                    reader from suspecting the existence of discrepancies, where, in reality, there
                    are none, we shall next exhibit a comparative scheme by means of which the
                    accordance of all the texts, and the different kinds of Egyptian writing
                    mentioned by the ancients, together with their respective relations and
                    dependencies, may be at once perceived and understood.</p>

                            radical sense, means a <hi rend="italic">constituent element</hi> of
                            things, and is consequently susceptible of very different meanings,
                            according to the words with which it is combined, or, when it is
                            employed absolutely, according to the nature of the subject under
                            consideration. This word, which Plato first uses in the philosophical
                            sense of <hi rend="italic">natural element,</hi> as earth, air, fire,
                            and water, is found in the Politeia, the Sophist, and in twenty places
                            of the Theaetetes, in its generic acceptation of <hi rend="italic"

                            character <hi rend="italic">(γράμμα)</hi> which represents it; the one
                            is the element of <hi rend="italic">spoken</hi> language, the other is
                            the element of <hi rend="italic">written</hi> language. Aristotle uses
                            this word in the same manner when, speaking of the different parts of
                            speech, he opposes <hi rend="italic">στoιχt</hi><hi rend="italic"

                            >compound</hi> sound. The word <hi rend="italic">στoιχuoν,</hi> then,
                            without losing any thing of its general signification of <hi
                            rend="italic">constituent element,</hi> became, when modified according
                            to the subject to which it was applied, the ^absolute expression, first,
                            of the <hi rend="italic">four elements,</hi> and, secondly, of the <hi

                            was applied to the <hi rend="italic">articulation</hi> itself, and the

                            it was represented. The Greek grammarians are unanimous on this point;
                            and the distinction is also very well stated by Dionysius of

                            >τιλιυταιαν.</hi> The Latin grammarians have made the same distinction
                            between <hi rend="italic">elementum</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                            >litera,</hi> which correspond exactly to <hi rend="italic"

                            Suetonius calls the letter D <hi rend="italic">quarta elementorum

                            <hi rend="italic">lìteroe.</hi> But in Greek, as in Latin, usage in a
                            great measure effaced these distinctions, and the two words were
                            indifferently employed, the one for the other, as perfectly synonymous,
                            each signifying properly and technically <hi rend="italic">letters of
                            the alphabet.</hi></p><p>This point being established, then, it remains
                            to be seen what effect the word <hi rend="italic">πζωτωv</hi> placed
                            before <hi rend="italic">στoιχuωv</hi> can add to the idea. And, at
                            first, considering the principles which Champoilion had unfolded in his
                            <hi rend="italic">Lettre à</hi><hi rend="italic">Μ. Dacier,</hi> we were
                            led to conclude that <hi rend="italic">π1ωτa tτωχιιa</hi> meant the
                            first or <hi rend="italic">initial letters of words</hi><hi
                            rend="italic">;</hi> a conclusion which we stated, along with the
                            grounds upon which it had been adopted, in the article <hi rend="italic"
                            >Hieroglyphics</hi> which appeared in the <hi rend="italic">Edinburgh
                            Review</hi> (vol. xlv. p. 9G, <hi rend="italic">ct seqq.).</hi> But
                            further examination, and more particularly the light which Μ. Letronne
                            has thrown o∏"the subject in the second edition of Champoilion’s <hi
                            rend="italic">Precis</hi><hi rend="italic">du Système

                            >seqq.),</hi> have induced us to abandon this idea as inadmissible, and
                            to adopt a different interpretation. If, in fact, the meaning of Clemens
                            Alexandrinus had been what we then conceived it to be, he would not have
                            said <hi rend="italic">⅛ιa τωv π1ωτωv στoι%tιωv,</hi> but <hi
                            rend="italic">ĩia rωv t×atroυ ivoμaros,</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                            >i×aστ∏s λιξsωs trζωτωv rτ&lt;nχ,uωv.</hi> “A moins de supposer que
                            l’auteur n’avait aucun sentiment de sa propre langue, ni l’ombre de sens
                            commun,” says Μ. Letronne, “il est impossible de donner one
                            signification aussi déterminée à l’expression <hi rend="italic"
                            >rτoιχua,</hi> qui, dans un sujet pareil, prise ainsi absolument,
                            signifie en général les <hi rend="italic">lettres de</hi><hi
                            rend="italic">l’alphabet,</hi> ou ne signifie rien de tout.” This, we
                            confess, appears to us to be quite decisive. The interpretation of first
                            <hi rend="italic">or initial elements of words,</hi> proposed in the <hi
                            rend="italic">Edinburgh Review,</hi> and the more general one of <hi
                            rend="italic">initial elements,</hi> suggested by Μ. de Goulianoff, and
                            afterwards made the foundation of the acrostic system of writing which
                            Μ. de Klaproth calls <hi rend="italic">Aerological Hieroglyphics,</hi>
                            were equally adopted, without perceiving, that if the term <hi
                            rend="italic">element</hi> be not taken in a clear and determinate
                            sense, or, in other words, be not construed with reference to a specific
                            subject, such an expression as that employed by Clemens can have no
                            meaning whatever. He who translates the words <hi rend="italic">initial
                            elements,</hi> must be prepared to show <hi rend="italic">what</hi>
                            initial elements are meant; and if he do not, or cannot, his version
                            must go for nothing. It is impossible to draw any conclusion from a
                            vague generality, which, like an identical proposition, fills the ear
                            and cheats the understanding. And, on the other hand, it is absurd, in
                            interpreting such terms, to attach to them a limitation which, besides
                            being gratuitous and unwarranted, is calculated to annihilate their
                            character as general expressions. We conclude, therefore, first, that
                            the interpretation of the <hi rend="italic">initial letters</hi> of
                            words is inadmissible; and, secondly, that the word <hi rend="italic"
                            >π^ωτa,</hi> conformably to its proper signification, indicates a
                            species of letters, or <hi rend="italic">primitive sounds,</hi>
                            considered in relation to others that are <hi rend="italic"
                            >secondary</hi> or derivative. And here we observe, that this can only
                            be understood in two ways: lsl, As a Greek addressing Greeks, Clement
                            might employ an idea which was familiar to them, that of the formation
                            of their own alphabet, which, according to the general tradition of
                            Greece, was at first composed only of the characters or signs ofs⅛teen
                            <hi rend="italic">sounds:</hi> Or, 2<hi rend="italic">dly,</hi> The word
                            <hi rend="italic">π^ωτα</hi> may be conceived as relating, not to the
                            primitive or Phoenician alphabet, said to have been imported into Greece
                            by Cadmus, but to <hi rend="italic">primitive sounds</hi> in general;
                            that is, to the most simple and elementary of all. In regard to the
                            former hypothesis, it may be said that it accords with the nature of the
                            Cadmean letters, which are more simple and elementary than the eight
                            others subsequently added, and which, consequently, may be considered
                            either as the <hi rend="italic">first</hi> in the order of time, or the
                            <hi rend="italic">primary</hi> and <hi rend="italic">elementary,</hi>
                            with reference to the <hi rend="italic">secondary</hi> and composite
                            characters. But the latter is, upon the whole, that to which we incline.
                            It is scarcely probable that Clemens Alexandrinus would attempt to
                            explain the phonetic system of the Egyptians by an example or
                            illustration drawn from the obscure traditionary history of the Greek
                            alphabet; whilst, on the other hand, it cannot be doubted that, amongst
                            all nations who have possessed <hi rend="italic">signs of sounds,</hi>
                            the number of these signs was at first limited to the <hi rend="italic"
                            >principal sounds,</hi> and that others were successively added, in
                            proportion as men found it necessary to decompose these primary sounds,
                            and to have certain <hi rend="italic">shades</hi> of them represented by
                            distinct characters. Lastly, the passage which has occupied so much of
                            our attention, is not the only one where express mention is made of an
                            Egyptian alphabet, “Hermias informs us,” says Plutarch, “that Hermes was
                            the inventor of letters in Egypt. Thus, <hi rend="italic">to represent
                            the first letter</hi> [of their alphabet], <hi rend="italic">the
                            Egyptians figured an ibis,</hi> a bird which belongs to Hermes.” ∙ It is
                            impossible to express more clearly the nature of a <hi rend="italic"
                            >phonetic hieroglyph,</hi> namely, a <hi rend="italic">sound</hi>

                <p>Accustomed to a method of writing in which signs were employed as the
                    representatives of <hi rend="italic">sounds</hi> only, the Greek and Roman
                    authors, who had either directly or indirectly acquired any notion or idea of
                    the graphic system of the Egyptians, and particularly of their monumental
                    writing, seem to have been chiefly struck with the <hi rend="italic"
                    >figurative</hi> and <hi rend="italic">symbolic</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >ideographic</hi> characters which are so largely intermixed therein; and these,
                    as being the most remote from the nature of those signs with which alone they
                    were conversant, appear to have almost exclusively engaged their attention.
                    Hence they nowhere expressly mention any other class or description of signs;
                    they nowhere explicitly and distinctly intimate, what they could scarcely have
                    been altogether ignorant of, that the Egyptians, along with the ideographic
                    symbols, employed certain images and characters as the representatives of simple
                    or elementary sounds. Even Clemens Alexandrinus, in the passage above quoted and
                    analysed, describes the phonetic hieroglyphics in the most concise manner
                    possible; so concise, indeed, that his statement (“kuriologic, by means of the
                    primary elements” of words), from being unaccompanied with any development or
                    explanation, remained perfectly unintelligible, until the ingenious
                    investigations of Young, Champollion, Letronne, and others, suggested the true
                    interpretation. To this circumstance, then, may perhaps be ascribed the
                    ineffectual efforts of the moderns to resolve or elucidate the hieroglyphical
                    inscriptions. Finding in the classical authors indications only of
                    picture-writing and of symbols employed tropically or figuratively, and never
                    once suspecting the existence of characters of a different kind, the learned men
                    of the sixteenth, seventeenth, and eighteenth centuries invariably proceeded
                    upon the supposition that the hieroglyphic writing was wholly ideographic, or,
                    in other words, composed of characters every one of which was either the natural
                    or arbitrary representative of a distinct idea.</p>
                <p>On this assumed principle, indeed, they were all agreed; and, to say the truth,
                    it seemed to receive confirmation from the fact that the hieroglyphical symbols
                    whose forms and values had been indicated by Diodorus Siculus, Horus Apollo,
                    Plutarch, Clemens Alexandrinus, Eusebius, and others, were all of them without
                    exception ideographic. The number of these symbols, compared with the immense
                    variety of characters observable on the monuments, was no doubt exceedingly
                    small; nor, from the known characters, was it possible to deduce any general <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193642995" xml:id="kp-eb0711-2995-0300"/> principle by the
                    assistance of which the unknown could be ascertained or interpreted. But
                    fanciful ingenuity soon supplied all defects; and the learned, rather than
                    confess their ignorance, drew largely on their imaginations. Setting out with
                    the preconceived notion that each hieroglyph stood as the representative of a
                    distinct idea, they thought only of discovering or imagining the esoteric
                    meaning which it was supposed to involve. It was never for a moment doubted that
                    the most profound mysteries of nature and of art lay hidden in these monumental
                    sculptures. The simplest characters, employed perhaps to represent phonetically
                    a proper name, were conceived to be types or symbols of ideas too lofty for
                    ordinary comprehension, and worthy of the eternal records to which their
                    preservation had been consigned. Thus, imagination usurping the place of reason,
                    and the wildest conjectures being substituted for facts, the learned who had
                    undertaken to interpret the Egyptian monuments soon became entangled in an
                    inextricable labyrinth of incongruous fancies, and, like the spirits of Milton
                    when puzzled by their metaphysical speculations, “found no end in wandering
                    mazes lost.” The farther they advanced the thicker became the darkness, and the
                    more inextricable the perplexity.</p>
                <p>Such appears generally to have been the method, if method indeed it may be
                    called, pursued by Pierius, and more especially by Kircher, who imitated and
                    improved on the example of conjectural interpretation given by his predecessor.
                    “The extensive learning of Pierius,” says Mr Roscoe, “is chiefly discoverable in
                    his great work on Hieroglyphics, in which he has undertaken to illustrate, from
                    Egyptian, Greek, and Roman symbols, almost every branch of science and of art.”
                    The work thus described is entitled <hi rend="italic">Hieroglyphica,</hi><hi

                    >Commentaries</hi> of which it consists, there is certainly displayed a great
                    deal of learning and ingenuity; but, unfortunately, the one is wholly
                    misapplied, and the other is of that anomalous description which constantly
                    resolves either into absurdity or extravagance. An idea of this singular
                    production, from which Kircher appears to have derived his peculiar inspiration,
                    may be formed from the summary contained in a brief address to the reader.
                    “Habes in hisce Commentariis non solum variarum historiarum, numismatum,
                    veterumque inscriptionum explicationem, verumetiam praeter Aegyptiaca et alia

                <p>Such is the account given of the <hi rend="italic">perjucundum beneficium</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">per</hi><hi rend="italic">Pierium oblatum;</hi> nor can it be
                    denied that his ohlation is devoid of entertainment, ĥowever small may be the
                    addition which it is calculated to make to our knowledge of things human and
                    divine. The author not unfrequently invents the symbol as well as the
                    explanation, and of course finds but little difficulty in making the one
                    correspond with the other. He also takes metaphorical language <hi rend="italic"
                    >ad</hi><hi rend="italic">pedem</hi><hi rend="italic">literae·,</hi> translates
                    it into a visible image or symbol, which he describes with infinite minuteness
                    of detail; and then proposes a resolution or explanation, from which he deduces
                    a long series of consequences, some of them ingeniously puerile or elaborately
                    ludicrous. Nor, in his interpretation of symbols actually employed in
                    liieroglyphical legends and inscriptions is he Jess imaginative or less
                    entertaining. If right in the first instance, as, for example, in regard to the
                    figure of the lion, he generally contrives to be absurd in the second; he
                    introduces combinations which were never before imagined, and stumbles upon
                    explanations which set sense and gravity equally at defiance. He tells us truly
                    that a lion is the natural symbol of strength or force; but nobody could
                    conjecture or divine from this that the representation of a lion devouring an
                    ape means, according to Pierius, a remedy for fever. “Ego sane disciplinas
                    Aegyptiorum in hujusmodi re secutus, compertum esse inquam, leonem febri
                    correptum, vel si ad furorem usque exaestuet, <hi rend="italic">unius

                    comparantem significare vellent, leonis simiam vescentis hieroglyphicum ponere
                    soliti sunt; <hi rend="italic">tanta enim indignatione simiam fert leo, ut
                    nullum animal avidius perdere desideret''</hi> (P. 8.) The Egyptians, according
                    to Clemens Alexandrinus, assimilated the course of the sun to the body of a
                    scaraboeus, upon the same principle that they compared the oblique course of the
                    planetary stars to the bodies of serpents. This statement is clear, and
                    distinct, and intelligible; but Pierius takes a different and much more curious
                    view of the matter, “Cur enim quis Aegyptios sacerdotes irrideat,” he asks,
                    “quod mundi speciem ipsosque motus per scaraboeum significare tradiderint, si
                    pilulas illas in quibus seminium ex sese primum habuerint, ac in vermiculos

                    example will serve as well as a thousand to give the reader an idea of the
                    “great work on Hieroglyphics” spoken of by Mr Roscoe; a work in which all sorts
                    of animals, and parts of animals, vegetables, implements, utensils, weapons, and
                    other objects, artificial as well as natural, are symbolised, sometimes
                    individually, sometimes in arbitrary or grotesque combinations, and in which,
                    from beginning to end, it is impossible to discover the slightest approach
                    towards a rational and sound method of inquiry.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>We repeat, however, that the book is amusing,
                    on account of the perverse ingenuity it displays, and the never-failing facility
                    with which the author at once manufactures and expounds his symbols. For
                    instance, a single crane, according to him, means <hi rend="italic"
                    >curtodia,</hi> but a plurality of these birds signifies <hi rend="italic"
                    >democratia,</hi> though on what analogy, real or imaginary, we are not
                    informed. From this interpretation, however, he deduces a very sensible
                    etymology: “Sane quidem apud nostros consensus unioque partium in candem
                    sententiam aut rem, Latino vocabulo formam ab ipsis gruibus videtur accepisse,

                <p>After an interval of about a century, Pierius was succeeded by Kircher, who,
                    instead of confining himself to the interpretation of detached symbols, boldly
                    attacked the Egyptian monuments themselves; and, by a strange intermixture of
                    cabbalistical science with the extravagant fancies of a refined system of
                    demonism, attempted to expound the inscriptions with which they are covered. His

                    mode in which he has accomplished the task undertaken by him. A further
                    exemplification of his system, in all its mystical extravagance, will be found
                    in the <hi rend="italic">Obelisci</hi><hi rend="italic">Aegyptiaci</hi><hi

                    volumes contain some tolerably faithful, though inelegant, representations of
                    the principal monuments of Egyptian art, which had been brought to Europe before
                    the time of the indefatigable Jesuit; and, as his system of interpretation
                    succeeded equally well whether he chanced to begin at the beginning, the middle,
                    or the end of an inscription, he has never, in any instance, failed to subjoin
                    an exposition of what he conceived or imagined to be the import of the
                    characters or legends represented.</p>
                <p>According to Kircher, the obelisks, the mummies, and the amulets, all contain
                    mysterious doctrines in religion or metaphysics; and these he proceeds to unfold
                    with as much confidence as if he had been the <hi rend="italic">mystagogus</hi>
                    of ancient Egypt, and had inherited all the esoteric learning for which the
                    priests of that country were so much celebrated. No difficulty or obscurity ever
                    for a moment impedes the progress of Kircher; his system enables him to
                    penetrate at a glance the most recondite mysteries. Thus, in the oval,

                    the learned Jesuit discovers the following luminous oracle: “The author of
                    fecundity, and of all vegetation, is Osiris, whose generative faculty is derived
                    from heaven in his kingdom by the holy Mophta.”<note anchored="true"

                    In regard to the Pamphilian obelisk, Kircher has been doubly unfortunate. <hi
                    rend="italic">It is not genuine.</hi> Of the obelisks still in existence there
                    are perhaps about thirty; larger and smaller, which may be considered as
                    genuine. Several others are decidedly spurious, having been chiefly sculptured
                    at Rome in imitation of the Egyptian style, but so negligently and unskilfully
                    as to exhibit a striking difference even in the character of the workmanship.
                    Such are the Pamphilian, in explanation of which Kircher published the folio
                    volume before us, consisting of near six hundred pages, and also the Barberinian
                    or Veranian obelisk. In both of these the symbols are put together in a manner
                    wholly arbitrary; and when an attempt is made to imitate the appearance of a
                    name, the characters are completely different at each repetition. Another very
                    celebrated monument, the Isiac table, which Kircher also undertook to explain
                    and illustrate, is equally incapable of supporting <hi rend="italic">a</hi>
                    minute investigation conducted on solid principles. For the inscriptions neither
                    bear any relation to the figures near which they are placed, nor form any.
                    connected sense of their own; and the whole is undoubtedly the work of a Roman
                    sculptor, imitating only the general style and the .separate delineations of the
                    Egyptian tablets, as indeed some of the most learned and acute of our
                    antiquaries had already asserted, notwithstanding the contrary opinion of
                    several foreigners of the highest reputation for their intimate acquaintance
                    with the works of Greek and Roman art. (Young on <hi rend="italic"

                    learned Jesuit had consulted his imagination alone in devising interpretations
                    so absurd and unintelligible; that all his labour and research were expended in
                    vain; and that, so far from contributing in any degree to elucidate the Egyptian
                    inscriptions, he was eminently successful in thickening the darkness in which
                    they were involved.</p>
                <p>But extravagant and nonsensical as all this may appear, and no doubt is, Kircher
                    was nevertheless the founder of a school. The recipient power of human credulity
                    has no limits when vanity or self-love is once conciliated; and, as it is at all
                    times much easier to imagine than to examine, investigate, or analyse, the
                    admirers and disciples of thelearn-ed Jesuit failed not, in some instances, to
                    improve upon the absurdities of their master. To men who had no light to guide
                    them, and no footing upon which to take their stand, his mystical jargon
                    appeared a sort of oracular language, which, though nothing could be made of it,
                    was believed to contain every thing. From the operation of the principle, <hi

                    >magnifico</hi> his day-dreams became a sort of transcendentalism in Egyptian
                    archaeology; and there were not a few who devoutly believed that Kircher had
                    found out every thing contained, or rather concealed, in the Egyptian
                    inscriptions, if it were only possible to discover his discoveries.<note

                    there issued from the archiepiscopal press of Genoa a new translation of the
                    hieroglyphics of the Pamphilian obelisk, a monument which (as we have already
                    shown) is decidedly <hi rend="italic">spurious,</hi> but which, according to the
                    Italian Oedipus of symbols, “preserves the remembrance of the triumph over the
                    ungodly, obtained by the worshippers of the thrice Holy Trinity, and of the
                    Eternal Word, under the sway of the sixth and seventh kings of Egypt, in the
                    sixth century after the Deluge that is, at a period when neither the “thrice
                    Holy Trinity,” nor the “Eternal Word,” had as yet been revealed to mankind. From
                    the same incomparable authority we learn, to the utter confusion of our
                    chronology, that one of these pious monarchs was no other than Sesac or Sheshak,
                    who, according to the Old Testament, pillaged Jerusalem, carrying off as lawful
                    spoil the treasures of the temple and of the house of David. Pierius and
                    Kircher, with all their fanciful extravagance, were men of real learning,
                    scholars in the best sense of the term; and though they failed to interpret the
                    hieroglyphics, they were careful not to outrage history and chronology, which,
                    in fact, it was one of their great objects to illustrate and confirm. But this
                    translator of an untranslateable monument seems either to have written his book
                    in a calenture of the brain, or to have published it as an experiment (clumsy
                    enough, in all conscience) upon the credulity of mankind.</p></note> But the

                    minds, failed to impose upon the strong sense and the powerful intellect of
                    Bishop Warburton. In his justly celebrated work, <hi rend="italic">The Divine
                    Legation of Moses demonstrated,</hi> that learned prelate discussed, with
                    consummate scholarship, the different ancient texts relating to the methods of
                    writing practised amongst the Egyptians; distinguished theoretically the several
                    sorts of characters employed by them; and deduced, from his inquiries, the
                    important observation, now completely verified, that the <hi rend="italic"
                    >sacred characters,</hi> or hieroglyphics, were not so denominated, as being
                    exclusively appropriated to <hi rend="italic">sacred subjects,</hi> but that, as
                    stated at the commencement of this treatise, they constituted a real written
                    language, applicable to the purposes of history and common life, as well as to
                    those of religion and mythology. He was no doubt so far mistaken in supposing
                    that each of the three kinds of characters constituted a distinct and
                    independent system of writing. But as he confined himself entirely to such
                    inferences as seemed logically deducible from the ancient authorities examined
                    and discussed by him, without attempting to verify or correct his conclusions by
                    a direct application to the Egyptian monuments, his misconception in this
                    particular was perhaps unavoidable, and ought in no degree to lessen our
                    admiration of that sagacity which led him to divine a truth which had never been
                    suspected by any one before him, and which the subsequent progress of discovery
                    completely demonstrated. If the profound remark of this learned prelate had been
                    duly appreciated, and prosecuted to its consequences, the <hi rend="italic"

                    probably have been, in part at least, resolved half a century earlier. But
                    succeeding writers, haunted by the spirit of Kircher, dreamed only of <hi

                    seemed, in fact, to be tacitly agreed that letters were unknown in the country
                    where they are commonly supposed to have been first invented; and though
                    hypotheses were multiplied, the study was not in consequence advanced. Like a
                    temple half buried in the sand drifted from the desert during a long series of
                    ages, Egyptian literature powerfully attracted the attention and excited the
                    interest of those who stopped to gaze on its mystic form and magnificent
                    proportions; but the entrance to the sacred edifice had not yet been discovered
                    and cleared out, consequently the interior remained wholly unknown. The
                    superstition of antiquarianism still hovered round it, and the mystery of ages,
                    in itself an object of strong interest to many, remained inviolate. But the day
                    of the shovel and the spade was nevertheless fast approaching.</p>
                <p>Amongst the first contributions to the study of hieroglyphics in this country,
                    may be mentioned two Essays by Mr Alexander Gordon, a draughtsman and antiquary
                    of considerable eminence; the one having for its object to explain the
                    hieroglyphical figures upon the coffin of an ancient mummy belonging to a
                    Captain Lethicullier, and the other, in like manner, to expound the
                    hieroglyphical figures upon an Egyptian mummy in the museum of Dr Mead. These
                    Essays are accompanied with twenty-five copperplates, in which, besides the
                    different views of the soroi or mummy cases, are delineated with tolerable
                    fidelity the <hi rend="italic">apices</hi> of several obelisks, some Egyptian
                    antiquities in the Ashmolean Museum, groups copied from monuments in other
                    collections, amulets, figures of Isis and Canopus, wooden images of the dead <hi
                    rend="italic">(craξfbuγμara νιχgων ξυλina),</hi> urns, and other ancient
                    remains; to which is added, a table of the characters found on the Egyptian
                    monuments then in Britain, and amounting to 248 in number. The plates, however,
                    were published before the text with which they are now accompanied; and, in
                    fact, the Essays are only designed to explain three out <hi rend="italic"
                    >of</hi> the twenty-five, namely, those in which are represented the figures on
                    the mummy-cases. Of the remainder an explanation is also promised, but it does
                    not appear that the author ever fulfilled his intention. Mr Gordon’s text is
                    principally descriptive and critical; and he displays equal learning and good
                    sense in his observations on the ancient authorities. But, like his
                    predecessors, he thinks of nothing but symbols, and, in no instance, makes even
                    the slightest approach towards the interpretation of a single character or group
                    which the ancient writers have not explained. The concluding paragraph of the
                    Essay on Lethicullier’s mummy will be sufficient to convey to our readers an
                    idea of the whole, as well as to confirm the truth of the observation, that our
                    author was as far from the right course as any of those who had preceded him.
                    “The whole, then, on this mummy,” says he, “seem chiefly to be so many <hi
                    rend="italic">physical symbols,</hi> representing the different powers or
                    properties of their chief deity Osiris or the Sun, as acting in and upon the
                    different parts of nature; and what is on the back of the mummy, a combined
                    figure of both Osiris and Isis, <hi rend="italic">symbolising universal

                    characteristical marks or rather trophies of their mutual inventions, namely, of
                    the use of grain and agriculture; the one instrument for reaping, the other for
                    threshing the corn; inventions for which, among many others, they were deified;
                    inventions to which the world owes the first bringing of mankind into society;
                    inventions from whence religion, arts, learning, and whatever else is valuable
                    among mankind, owe their origin.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    which is due to Μ. de Guignes, the celebrated French orientalist. The Abbé
                    Barthélemy having read to the Academy of Belles Lettres a memoir on the
                    Phoenician Letters, Μ. de Guignes, in examining it, happened to cast his eyes on
                    a dictionary in which the ancient Chinese characters were represented, and
                    observing a striking conformity between these and the letters in question, he at
                    once recollected the opinion expressed by Huet, the celebrated bishop of
                    Avranches, as to the common origin of the Chinese and Egyptians, and resolved to
                    investigate the subject, not as a curious speculation, but with a view to
                    determine the truth. The results of this investigation he communicated to the
                    Academy of Belles Lettres, on the 14th of November 1758, and published the year
                    following under the title of <hi rend="italic">Mémoire dans lequel</hi><hi

                    compare it with that of the Chinese, and to show that both nations had
                    originally the same hieroglyphs. With the assistance of the Chinese characters
                    he attempts to penetrate those of the Egyptians, to develope their composition,
                    and to establish their relation to or identity with the Chinese hieroglyphics;
                    he also explains several Egyptian characters; and, lastly, he compares the
                    language and the hieroglyphics of Egypt and of China with the languages and
                    methods of writing which obtained amongst the Hebrews, the Arabians, the
                    Syrians, and other nations of the East. We shall endeavour to state as briefly
                    as possible an outline of the investigation which we have thus generally

                <p>The hieroglyphical writing of the Egyptians and that of the Chinese are equally
                    composed of different figures representing men, parts of the human body,
                    animals, plants, vases, instruments, celestial bodies, and so on. But the
                    Chinese writing, though composed of the same elements with the Egyptian, is a
                    kind of cursive writing, in which all these figures are represented in the
                    merest outline, without distinguishing the parts which ought to be strongly
                    brought out from those which ought to be less so; that is, all the lines have
                    the same force. In this consists the chief difference between these two kinds of
                    writing; for if the Chinese were finished off like the Egyptian hieroglyphics,
                    their identity, says Μ. de Guignes, would at once be perceived. He further
                    observes, that the Chinese group and place beside one another several simple
                    characters, which form together a single compound character expressing a word or
                    an idea; and that the same singular proceeding is found to have obtained in the
                    Egyptian writing. From the relations which have only for their object the
                    exterior form of the characters, he then passes to the composition of these
                    characters, that is, to the different parts of which the group is formed; and
                    then proceeds to consider the question, whether those of the Egyptian
                    hieroglyphics of which Horus Apollo has preserved the signification, are
                    composed of the same ideas or the same elements with those of the Chinese. On
                    the result of the examination of this question depends the relation which our
                    author proposes to establish between China and Egypt.</p>
                <p>The Chinese possess two hundred and fourteen elementary characters, which the
                    grammarians have called <hi rend="italic">keys</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and
                    these keys are either employed alone, as characters serving to express an idea,
                    or variously combined one with another, in which case they are only considered
                    as parts of the same character or group. Each of these parts is the
                    representation of an idea which, united to two or three others, produces a word,
                    or another idea resulting from the combination of these simple elements; that
                    is, they form together a species of phrase which is “comme la definition d’une
                    idée plus composée.” For example, the Chinese character which expresses <hi
                    rend="italic">night</hi> is formed of three of these keys,—of one which
                    signifies <hi rend="italic">obscurity,</hi> of another which signifies the
                    action of <hi rend="italic">covering,</hi> and of a third which indicates <hi
                    rend="italic">man</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> so that the phrase <hi
                    rend="italic">obscurity covering men</hi> is the Chinese equivalent of the word
                    <hi rend="italic">night,</hi> to which it exactly corresponds. In like manner,
                    the character which signifies <hi rend="italic">music</hi> is composed of three
                    parts or keys, one representing <hi rend="italic">wood,</hi> another a <hi
                    rend="italic">thread</hi> or <hi rend="italic">cord of silk,</hi> and a third
                    <hi rend="italic">sound·,</hi> because the first instruments of music were made
                    of wood, or boards, upon which were extended silken cords. This phrase,
                    therefore, when rendered literally, signifies <hi rend="italic">sound produced
                    by threads or cords of silk extended on wood.</hi> Hence it may be concluded
                    that these two hundred and fourteen keys are the representatives of as many
                    simple and primitive ideas, which, by means of different combinations, were
                    employed to express new ideas, in proportion as accident or necessity led to
                    their formation. But, according to Μ. de Guignes, the same observations apply
                    equally to the Egyptian hieroglyphics, in which may be found simple characters
                    corresponding to the keys of the Chinese, and also groups or compound
                    characters. The number of the former is not considerable, being nearly the same
                    as that of the Chinese keys, and represented by the same figures, having the
                    same signification. If, then, with all these points of resemblance, the Egyptian
                    groups are composed of the same ideas or the same elements, it may be concluded
                    that these two nations had at one time the same system of writing and the same
                    words; and that the Chinese characters, especially when resolved into their
                    elements, may assist in enabling us to interpret those of the Egyptians.<note

                    recently transpired. Signor Rossellini, the associate of Μ. Champoilion in the
                    Egyptian expedition, and author of the learned work entitled <hi rend="italic"
                    >Monumenti</hi><hi rend="italic">delľ Egitto e della Nubia,</hi> already quoted,

                    rend="italic">Chinese.</hi> This curious relic was found by Rossellini himself
                    in a tomb, which, as far as could be ascertained, had not been opened since the
                    davs of the Pharaohs. <hi rend="italic">{Quarterly K¢- view,</hi> vol. liii. p.

                <p>But in order to avoid every kind of conjecture, Μ. de Guignes avails himself of
                    the information communicated by Horus Apollo, who has preserved the analysis and
                    interpretation of several Egyptian hieroglyphs, and proposes to show that the
                    Chinese characters, being composed of the same elements as those of the
                    Egyptians, have also the same signification. According to Horus Apollo, the Sun
                    and the Moon grouped together form an Egyptian character, signifying the <hi
                    rend="italic">succession of time,</hi> or the <hi rend="italic">first
                    principle.</hi> In Chinese, the same elements, the Sun and the Moon, have
                    exactly the same signification, and mean the <hi rend="italic">succession of
                    time, revolutions,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">principle of all things.</hi> In
                    Egypt, a horizontal line crossed by a perpendicular line expressed the number
                    <hi rend="italic">ten.</hi> It is not a little remarkable that the Chinese
                    employed the same character in the same sense. “Un caractère de cette espèce ne
                    tient point à ces idées générales qui tombent dans l’esprit de tous les hommes.”
                    In Egypt, the cynocephalus symbolically indicated sadness; in China, the same
                    figure, accompanied with the character for <hi rend="italic">voice,</hi>
                    signifies the same thing. To designate <hi rend="italic">education,</hi> and an
                    <hi rend="italic">ancient, origin,</hi> the Egyptians carved or painted a <hi
                    rend="italic">bundle of reeds.</hi> This symbol is founded on ideas so singular
                    that remote nations could scarcely imagine it, much less agree as to its
                    signification. Yet the Chinese employ a bundle of reeds in the same sense as the
                    Egyptians, and, by using characters of this kind, show that, originally, they
                    had communication with that people. Lastly, the Egyptians expressed <hi
                    rend="italic">science</hi> by the <hi rend="italic">dew which falls from
                    heaven.</hi> This metaphor exists in Chinese, and the character which signifies
                    <hi rend="italic">science,</hi> or a <hi rend="italic">learned man,</hi> is
                    composed of three elements or keys, one of which designates the <hi
                    rend="italic">rain</hi> or the <hi rend="italic">dew,</hi> the other <hi
                    rend="italic">heaven,</hi> and the third <hi rend="italic">man</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">;</hi> a phrase which can only signify the <hi rend="italic">man
                    on whom descends the dew of heaven.</hi> In Deuteronomy we have the entire
                    formula of this hieroglyph. <hi rend="italic">Concrescat ut pluvia doctrina mea,

                    Hebrews, who had lived long in Egypt, and also by the Arabians and Syrians, the
                    neighbours of the Egyptians, and whose language naturally exhibited traces of
                    their communication with that people.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Mr Needham, an Englishman who, in the year 1761, had visited
                    Turin, and examined the Egyptian antiquities in the cabinet of his majesty the
                    king of Sardinia, appears to have come to nearly the same conclusions with Μ. de
                    Guignes; though, as his claim was only put forward <hi rend="italic">three years
                    after</hi> the ingenious speculations of the Frenchman had been published, we
                    have no means of determining the question of priority, unless we hold the <hi
                    rend="italic">Lettre sur les Caractères Chinois</hi> as a decisive authority,
                    which we are by no means inclined to do. Having observed that the symbols, or
                    hieroglyphic characters, on the Isis of Turin, were similar to several Chinese
                    characters found in the Dictionary entitled <hi rend="italic"
                    >Tching-tsce-Tong,</hi> Mr Needham conjectured, l∙s∕, That the Chinese
                    characters might, in several respects, be identical with the hieroglyphics of
                    Egypt; and, 2<hi rend="italic">dly,</hi> That the sense of the hieroglyphics
                    might be discovered by comparing with them the appropriate signification of the
                    Chinese characters. “Les nouvelles observations de AÌr Needham,” says the author
                    of the <hi rend="italic">Lettre</hi> above referred to, “font espérer quelque
                    chose de plus heureux pour la gloire de nôtre siècle: il a comparé les
                    caractères Chinois avec les hiéroglyphes d’Egypte, il y a trouvé one
                    ressemblance, du moins une analogie, qui lui fait croire qu’on pourra enfin
                    savoir le secret des mystères de Memphis, et rompre la barrière de ténèbres qui
                    nous empêche de faire remonter nos connoissances jusqu’au temps les plus voisins
                    du Déluge·” The author adds, “Quelle conquête pour la républiques des lettres, «
                    <hi rend="italic">elle a jamais lieu''</hi> The conquest would, no doubt, have
                    been great, if it had ever been made; and we know no other obstacle to its
                    accomplishment except that the thing proposed is manifestly impossible. From all
                    that we have been able to learn on this subject, it appears that the road to
                    Memphis does not pass by Pekin.</p></note></p>
                <p>From these hieroglyphics, the import of which we learn from Horus Apollo, Μ. de
                    Guignes, after showing that the Chinese have characters composed of the same
                    elements, and bearing the same signification, concludes that those found on the
                    monuments, having exactly the same figure and the same elements as the Chinese,
                    must likewise have the same signification, and consequently that the
                    hieroglyphics of Egypt may be interpreted by means of dictionaries of the
                    ancient Chinese characters. Nor did he stop even here. Although these
                    hieroglyphics may be explained without knowing the sound or pronunciation which
                    the Egyptians assigned them, as happens in Chinese where the pronunciation of a
                    character has been lost or forgotten; yet he believed it possible to recover
                    even the sound of the hieroglyphics, that is, the spoken language of the
                    Egyptians. But into this part of the subject it would be foreign to our present
                    purpose to enter in detail. It may be sufficient to state, that De Guignes
                    considered all the elements of the Egyptian and Chinese hieroglyphics as so many
                    alphabetical letters, simple or syllabic, “faisant répondre à one scule lettre
                    les hiéroglyphes les plus simples, et à one ou à deux syllabes ceux qui sont
                    plus composés that the Chinese keys, though hieroglyphics, are at the same time
                    letters or syllables, the combination of which forms the most composite terms
                    that are found in all the oriental languages with the same signification; that
                    the fixation of these keys to a certain letter or syllable is invariable in all
                    circumstances; that the oriental letters are significative, and originated in
                    hieroglyphics, most probably the same with those of the Egyptians; that this
                    numerous alphabet, composed of about two hundred and fourteen figures, is
                    identical with that which the Egyptians called <hi rend="italic"
                    >hierogram-matic</hi> or <hi rend="italic">sacerdotal writing,</hi> into which a
                    greater or smaller number of <hi rend="italic">hieroglyphic characters</hi> were
                    inserted; and that the latter, whether <hi rend="italic">huriological</hi> or
                    <hi rend="italic">symbolical,</hi> were employed in their natural or
                    metaphorical sense, as the case might be, the symbolic hieroglyphics being less
                    a particular kind of writing than a symbolic style or figurative mode of
                    expression.</p>
                <p>Such is a rapid sketch of the highly ingenious and refined speculation of Μ. de
                    Guignes. It was successively attacked by Pauw and Deshauterayes;<note

                    neither of these writers seems to have perceived the real fallacy upon which the
                    whole of this beautiful fabric is reared. The assumed identity between the
                    Chinese elementary characters or keys, and the Egyptian hieroglyphics, is
                    entirely imaginary; as is also the principle of combination, upon the Chinese
                    system, extended to the latter. Nothing of this sort has as yet been discovered
                    on any Egyptian monument. Compound ideas are expressed in the monumental writing
                    by juxtaposition alone; nor is there the slightest evidence to show that the
                    Egyptians had characters representative of the syllabic elements of words, or
                    the constituent parts of ideas. It may be true, therefore, that a certain
                    conformity is discoverable between Egyptian and Chinese customs or doctrines,
                    and it may even be admitted that both nations had a common origin; but neither
                    of these points can ever be considered as established by reasoning based on an
                    erroneous assumption, nor can the identity of their language and history,
                    opposed as it is by so many circumstances, physical, political, civil, and
                    religious, be deduced from a few specious and plausible coincidences, such as
                    ingenuity may easily discover between any two nations of the earth, however
                    widely separated by time, place, and every distinctive characteristic or
                    peculiarity. In a word, to use the language of an able writer, “on ne doit
                    aujourd’hui regarder ce système que comme le rêve d’un homme d’esprit, qui est
                    séduit par one idée plus brillante que solide.”<note anchored="true"

                <p>“Among the works of modern authors who have employed themselves in the study of
                    hieroglyphics,” says Dr Young, “it is difficult to say whether those were the

                    Chevalier Palin, professed to contain explanations of every thing, or which,

                    confessed, after collecting all that was really on record, that the sum and

                <p>the different opinions which have been promulgated on this subject by Kircher,
                    Goguet, the members of the Academy of Inscriptions, Bruce, and many others,
                    including Jablonski, Mercatus, Bergaeus, and others; the fourth is devoted to
                    the consideration of the origin of these monuments, and, in particular, embraces
                    the author’s views, or rather collections, respecting the origin and use of
                    letters amongst the Egyptians; the fifth and last treats of the history of the
                    obelisks, and of their various epochs. As a digest of all the learning and
                    information on the subject which existed at the time of its publication, this
                    work is therefore of the highest importance; and its value is greatly enhanced
                    by the beautiful and accurate engravings with which it is accompanied. Zoega has
                    indeed left little to be gleaned in the field which he undertook to reap; he has
                    gathered into one great storehouse, for the use of those who may succeed him, a
                    vast body of knowledge which previously lay scattered over an immense surface,
                    or concealed in nooks and corners; and he has so arranged and methodized his
                    collection as to render its materials easily accessible to every inquirer. Nor
                    have the discoveries latterly made in Egyptian literature superseded or
                    antiquated the labours of this indefatigable scholar. On the contrary, these
                    have acquired additional importance from the circumstance that, whilst an
                    entirely new direction has been given to learned curiosity, the persons engaged
                    in prosecuting those discoveries have been spared the fatigue of much collateral
                    research, and been placed in a much more favourable position than they could
                    possibly have occupied, if no such work as this had been in their hands.</p>
                <p>But whilst Zoega studied practical utility, or at least sought to rend er
                    knowledge more generally available, others indulged only in speculation. But
                    this now took a direction somewhat different from that in which it had
                    previously flowed. The Abbé Pluche, for instance, in his account of the symbolic
                    writing of the ancient Egyptians, maintains stoutly that the whole of it
                    consists of emblems, expressive of doctrines connected with the science of
                    astronomy and the division of time in the calendar; and his followers (for he
                    had not a few in this country, as well as on the Continent), so far from being
                    startled with the incoherence of his views and the arbitrary violence of his
                    explanations, came to the conclusion that the innumerable inscriptions which
                    cover the Egyptian xnonumentsare all referribletoa single science, and in fact
                    to one and the same order of ideas. With inquirers of this class the only signs
                    in favour were the signs of the zodiac. In every legend, in every cartouche,
                    they discovered astronomical emblems expressive of astronomical truths.
                    According to their interpretations, indeed, the whole business of life, in
                    ancient Egypt, must have consisted in studying the heavens, and translating into
                    obscure or doubtful symbols the results of this continued celestial observation.
                    But the author of the work entitled <hi rend="italic">De l’Etude</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">des Hiéroglyphes,</hi> published at Paris in 1812, took a
                    different, though not more irrational, view of the subject. Believing it
                    possible, by the aid of ancient traditions, and a knowledge of the symbols and
                    emblems employed by different nations, to arrive at some general principle which
                    might serve as a key to the Egyptian inscriptions, he formed a collection of
                    what he calls <hi rend="italic">les symboles des peuples,</hi> or popular
                    symbols of Africa, Asia, and America; and having applied it to the
                    interpretation of the hieroglyphics of Egypt, he had the singular happiness to
                    discover, on the porticoof the great temple at Denderah, not a dedication to
                    Isis, but a translation of the hundredth psalm of David; one of the last
                    compositions, certainly, which we should have expected to find in such a place.
                    Nor is this the only discovery of the kind which we have to record. The
                    anonymous author of the <hi rend="italic">Essai sur les Hiéroglyphes
                    Egyptiens,</hi> not content with supposing that the hieroglyphics express
                    emblematically a series of ideas analogous to those which are found in the
                    Bible, maintains that they are neither more nor less than simple letters, and
                    that, considered as such, they express words in the Hebrew language. But, as the
                    number of distinct characters upon the monuments falls little short of a
                    thousand, he has not explained how the Egyptians happened to have so copious an
                    alphabet, exceeding the Chinese elementary characters or keys in the proportion
                    of three to one; how this alphabet applied to Hebrew, a language, all the words
                    of which consist of various combinations of twenty-two elementary sounds; and
                    how the Egyptians came to inscribe their monuments with a foreign language which
                    they never spoke, and most probably did not understand.</p>
                <p>Theorists discover no difficulties, or, if they do so, disregard and overleap
                    them. We have already seen thatKirch-er’s method of interpretation succeeded
                    equally well, whether he happened to begin at the beginning or at the end of an
                    inscription; and the same thing might no doubt be predicated of that method
                    which proceeds on the assumption that <hi rend="italic">all</hi> the
                    hieroglyphics are letters expressive of words in the Hebrew language. But the
                    sagacity of this class of interpreters has in some cases conducted them to very
                    opposite results. The Chevalier Palin, for instance, beginning by way of variety
                    in the middle of the inscriptions, discovered that Hebrew translations of many
                    of the Egyptian rolls of consecrated papyrus are to be found in the Bible under
                    the name of the Psalms of David. The author of the Essay above mentioned, and
                    the ingenious chevalier, therefore, though proceeding on nearly the same
                    principles, have arrived at very different results. According to the one, the
                    hieroglyphics are letters, and the language of the Egyptian inscriptions is
                    Hebrew; according to the other, the Psalms of David are, in part at least,
                    composed of translations from the consecrated rolls of papyrus inscribed with
                    pure Egyptian. The one makes the Egyptians borrow every thing from the Hebrews;
                    the other makes the Hebrew s borrow a great deal from the Egyptians. But,
                    whatever may be thought of the judgment of these antiquaries, their opinions are
                    not particularly discreditable to their talents and ingenuity. For, having once
                    allowed themselves to set out with the notion that it was possible to determine
                    the sense of the hieroglyphics by internal evidence, the imperfections of their
                    superstructures were the unavoidable consequences of the unsubstantial nature of
                    the foundations on which they were raised.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                <p>It is not a little mortifying to the pride of human skill and learning, that the
                    key which had long been sought for in vain was at length in some measure
                    discovered in consequence of the accidental disinterment of a single block of
                    stone, which for ages had lain under ground. It is well known that the French
                    expedition to Egypt was accompanied by a commission of the National Institute,
                    most liberally provided by the government of the day with the requisite means
                    for investigating all that related to science or to literature in that wonderful
                    country. In the proceedings of this body the general-in-chief, Napoleon, took
                    the greatest interest; he seemed to consider his glory as not less concerned in
                    the illustration than in the conquest of Egypt; and, amidst all the cares and
                    distractions of his situation, he was unremitting in his endeavours to promote
                    the objects for which the commission had been appointed. The labours of this
                    body were at length made public, with all the elegance which the arts of
                    printing and engraving could communicate; and the splendid work entitled <hi
                    rend="italic">Description</hi><hi rend="italic">de l’Egypte</hi> will be an
                    enduring monument of republican<pb break="no" facs="nls:193643073"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0711-3073-0306"/> liberality and imperial magnificence. But
                    although much was thus effected in elucidation of the history, antiquities,
                    religion, institutions, and arts of ancient Egypt, not a single ray of new light
                    was shed on the language and letters, the hieroglyphics and papyri, of that
                    singular country; and the principal benefit which the learned of Europe derived
                    from the publication of this national work consisted in the multiplication of
                    hieroglyphic texts, engraved, for the most part, with equal beauty and accuracy.
                    These, however, were unavailing for the advancement of Egyptian literature, as
                    long as the true method of interpreting them, either in whole or in part,
                    remained unknown; and it must have been felt by the French as not a little
                    humiliating to their vanity, that an <hi rend="italic">accident,</hi> which
                    occurred in the course of their military labours, and of which the fortune of
                    war afterwards denied them the benefit, should have conduced more towards the
                    elucidation of the monumental inscriptions of Egypt than all the labour,
                    research, and ingenuity which had for ages been expended on them. Whilst a
                    division of the French troops occupied the town of Rosetta, a party of workmen,
                    employed in digging for the foundations of Fort St Julian, discovered and
                    disinterred a huge block or pillar of black basalt, exhibiting the remains of
                    <hi rend="italic">three</hi> distinct inscriptions; but the French being soon
                    afterwards dislodged by the British, were prevented from removing this monument,
                    which consequently fell into the hands of the conquerors, and was subsequently
                    brought to England, amongst other trophies of the Egyptian campaign, and
                    deposited in the British Museum.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                <p>A cursory inspection of the Rosetta inscription was sufficient to establish the
                    truth of the opinion which had been expressed by Warburton, that the
                    hieroglyphics constituted a real written language. Of the three inscriptions
                    sculptured on its sides, a considerable part of the first was unfortunately
                    wanting; the beginning of the second and the end of the third were also
                    mutilated; but the last, written in Greek, concluded with the important
                    information that the decree inscribed on the monument, in honour of Ptolemy

                    secundi ordinis templo.”</p></note> But before any use could be made of the
                    Greek version, it was obviously necessary that it should be carefully examined,
                    and, as far as possible, restored. With this view the Society of Antiquaries
                    caused a correct copy of the triple inscription to be engraved and circulated,
                    and Person and Hcyne, the two best scholars of the age, employed themselves in
                    completing and illustrating the Greek text; a task, in the performance of which
                    the superior industry and vigilance of the German gave him a decided advantage
                    over the more active and irregular genius of the English Hellenist. But no data
                    had as yet been obtained, by means of which a comparison might be instituted
                    between the Greek which Heyne had restored, and the hieroglyphical or enchorial
                    texts, of which not a single character was known. There existed indeed a
                    traditional record of the true value of a particular character, denoting <hi
                    rend="italic">life,</hi> which had been handed down by the ecclesiastical
                    writers, and had been generally received as accurate by scholars and
                    antiquaries; but beyond this nothing whatever was known, whilst the explanations
                    given by Horus Apollo in his <hi rend="italic">The-τoglyphica,</hi> were
                    somewhat hastily set down as mere puerilities. In these circumstances, there
                    remained but one course to be adopted; namely, to adjust the inscriptions, so
                    that they might as nearly as possible coincide, and, from the situations of the
                    proper names in the Greek inscription, to endeavour attentively to ascertain
                    their corresponding positions in one or both of the other inscriptions. By this
                    means, if characters merely phonetic entered into the composition of the
                    hieroglyphic and enchorial texts, the true value of some of them would be
                    ascertained; but if these texts were found to consist chiefly of characters not
                    phonetic, it was at least probable that the proper names would be written
                    alphabetically, and that, even from the comparison of these, some important
                    inferences might be deduced. It was, therefore, a matter of indifference whether
                    the comparison was first made between the Greek and hieroglyphic, or between the
                    Greek and enchorial text; but as <hi rend="italic">a</hi> notion happened to
                    prevail that the enchorial was altogether phonetic, the first attempt was made
                    upon that part of the triple inscription.</p>
                <p>The Baron Silvestre de Sacy, justly celebrated for his eminent attainments both
                    as a scholar and as an antiquary, had the honour of taking the lead in this
                    investigation. Having examined the portions of the enchorial text corresponding,
                    by their relative situations, to two passages of the Greek inscription, in which
                    occur the proper names <hi rend="smallcaps">Alexander</hi> and <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Alexandria,</hi> he soon recognised two well-defined groups of
                    characters nearly resembling each other, and which, he conjectured, were the
                    enchorial representatives of these names. He also made out satisfactorily the
                    <hi rend="italic">locus</hi> or position of the proper name <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Ptolemy</hi>; but beyond this he found it impossible to advance a single step,
                    and ultimately abandoned the pursuit as hopeless. Μ. de Sacy, however, had not
                    laboured in vain. He had, in some degree, determined the positions of three
                    proper names; and, what was far more important, he had shown that the
                    investigation, which he gave up in despair, was not so impracticable as he had
                    imagined. Mr Akerblad,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>A
                    diplomatic gentleman then resident at Paris, but afterwards the Swedish chargé
                    d’affaires at Rome. Having resolved into its component parts the group
                    representing <hi rend="smallcaps">Alexander,</hi> and ascertained that other
                    groups signified <hi rend="smallcaps">Ptolemy,</hi><hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Arsinoe,</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">Berenice,</hi> and other proper names
                    occurring in the Greek part of the triple inscription, Mr Akerblad published the
                    alphabet which ho had collected from these names, containing about fifteen well
                    ascertained characters. He then applied himself to decipher the remainder of the
                    inscription, which, he hastily took it for granted, consisted of Coptic words
                    expressed in alphabetical characters; but in this attempt he was completely
                    unsuccessful. The greater part of the characters which he met with in the
                    inscription were not such as had occurred in the proper names; nor could he
                    obtain a series of Coptic words by assigning to the new characters any powers
                    that he could think of or imagine. He appears never to have suspected that the
                    words of the inscription could be any other than Coptic, or that these words
                    could be represented otherwise than phonetically. (See an excellent paper on the
                    <hi rend="italic">Enchorial Language of Egypt,</hi> in the third number of the
                    <hi rend="italic">Dublin University Review,</hi> p. 4.)</p></note> accordingly,
                    resumed the inquiry at the point where it had been abandoned by his predecessor,
                    and completely demonstrated the truth of what Μ. de Sacy had done little more
                    than conjecture, namely, that the enchorial text contained Greek proper names
                    written in Egyptian characters. Continuing his comparative readings, Mr Akerblad
                    subsequently attempted from them to construct an alphabet; but, excepting in as
                    far as regarded the proper names, whence he <pb break="no" facs="nls:193643086"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0711-3086-0307"/>deduced about fifteen characters, the attempt
                    proved a failure, partly because he had imbibed the notion that the whole
                    inscription was alphabetical, and partly, too, from expecting to find in the
                    Egyptian writing all the vowels which the same words contain in the Coptic texts
                    still extant; an error which a due consideration of the practice observed in the
                    Hebrew, Chaldaic, Arabic, and other written oriental languages might have
                    enabled him to avoid. Mr Akerblad contributed nothing towards the elucidation of
                    the first or hieroglyphic inscription on the Rosetta monument, if we except a
                    detached but acute observation respecting the three numerals at the end; and it
                    is even alleged that he was disposed to acquiesce in the correctness of Palin’s
                    interpretation, which proceeds upon the supposition that parts of the first
                    lines of the hieroglyphics still remain on the pillar.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>This supposition is contrary to the fact. As
                    already stated, the commencement of the hieroglyphic inscription is
                    wanting.</p></note> Be this as it may, however, to Μ. de Sacy and to Mr
                    Akerblad, particularly the latter, belongs the distinction of having made the
                    first advances in the right direction. The progress of discovery is for the most
                    part gradual, and it requires successive efforts to clear much ground in a
                    domain where there are no landmarks to guide the explorer, and where, in
                    puzzling his way through the wrecks of ages, his own natural sagacity is at
                    every instant liable to be bewildered by the fancies, errors, or exaggerations
                    of those who have preceded him. But if there be any truth in the observation,

                    merit due to these distinguished individuals will never cease to be fully
                    acknowledged by the historians of hieroglyphical discovery.</p>
                <p>Matters were in this state when Dr Young commenced his investigations. Little or
                    nothing had as yet been done to interpret the sacred characters, or
                    hieroglyphics; but the germ of all the succeeding discoveries may be said to
                    have been found, when the idea had once been suggested of fixing the positions
                    of the proper names, and considering the corresponding groups of figures as
                    representing their constituent sounds. Having been induced, as he informs us, to
                    offer to the conductors of a periodical publication an article containing an
                    abstract of the <hi rend="italic">Mithridates</hi> of Adelung, a work then
                    recently received from the Continent, his curiosity was forcibly excited by a
                    note, in which the editor, Professor Vater, asserted that the unknown language
                    of the Rosetta inscription, and of the bandages often found with the mummies,
                    was capable of being analysed into an alphabet consisting of little more than
                    thirty letters; but having retained merely a general impression of this bold and
                    striking assertion, he thought no more of these inscriptions until early in
                    1814, when they were recalled to his attention by the examination of some
                    fragments of papyrus which had been recently brought to England by Sir W. R.
                    Boughton, and on which, after a hasty inspection of Mr Akerblad’s pamphlet, he
                    communicated some anonymous remarks to the Society of Antiquaries. His interest
                    in the subject being thus awakened and stimulated, he, in the summer of the same
                    year, applied his mind first to the enchorial, and afterwards to the
                    hieroglyphic inscription; and, by a methodical comparison of the different parts
                    with each other, he was able, in the course of a few months, to send to the <hi
                    rend="italic">Archaeologia</hi> a “conjectural translation” of each of these
                    inscriptions, distinguishing the contents of the different lines with as much
                    precision as his materials then enabled him to attain. He was obliged, however,
                    to leave many important passages still subject to doubt; but he hoped to acquire
                    additional information before attempting to determine their signification; and
                    having fairly broken ground, he flattered himself that he would soon be in a
                    condition to advance with facility and rapidity. In the meanwhile, he
                    endeavoured to make himself familiar with the Memphitic and Thebaic versions of
                    the Scriptures. Aware, from the researches of Quatremère, that the remains of
                    the ancient Egyptian language are preserved in these versions, he hoped, with
                    the aid of this knowledge, to read the enchorial inscription, at least, into a
                    kindred dialect; and although he felt himself gradually compelled to abandon
                    this expectation, he soon afterwards published anew, in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Museum</hi><hi rend="italic">Criticum</hi> of Cambridge, his conjectural
                    translation, with considerable additions and corrections. Lastly, in the article
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">Egypt,</hi> printed in the fourth volume of the Supplement
                    to the former editions of the present work, he digested in a methodical form the
                    results of his researches, and, in particular, inserted a Vocabulary containing
                    upwards of two hundred names, words, or epithets, which he had succeeded in
                    deciphering in the hieroglyphical and enchorial texts, with some additions
                    derived from his readings' in the Egyptian manuscripts. This article, forming
                    altogether an astonishing effort both of scholarship and ingenuity, was
                    published in December 1819, and almost immediately attracted the attention of
                    the learned throughout the whole of Europe. With the exception of the slight
                    aids afforded by the researches of De Sacy and Akerblad, neither of whom had
                    been able to decipher a single character of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >hieroglyphical</hi> inscription, it had the merit of complete originality;<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>“Br Young,” says Mr Salt,

                    not only received with admiration by all who were capable of appreciating its
                    merits, but it produced a general rush to the study of hieroglyphical
                    literature, and mainly contributed towards those further discoveries, of which
                    it will be our business to render some account in a succeeding section of this
                    article.</p>
                <p>Although much has been done for the elucidation of the Egyptian texts, monumental
                    as well as enchorial, since Dr Young published this record of his
                    investigations; although some errors have been corrected, many additions made,
                    and the whole reduced into a systematic form; yet we should consider ourselves
                    as unjust to the memory of that most ingenious man, and as even guilty of
                    removing one of the great landmarks of learning, were we, in this new and
                    improved edition of the Encyclopaedia, either to withhold or to alter a
                    production which, in fact, constitutes an epoch in the annals of letters. For
                    this reason all that part of the article above mentioned which was devoted to
                    the subject of hieroglyphics, is republished entire in the third, fourth, and
                    fifth sections of this general treatise; accompanied only with a few explanatory
                    and corrective notes, intended to keep in view what has been effected by others,
                    and also to prepare the reader for the expositions which follow. We have only
                    further to add, upon this head, that the historical and critical view of the
                    progress of opinion and discovery on the subject of hieroglyphics, which we have
                    here brought down to the period at which the researches of Dr Young were given
                    to the world in a somewhat matured form, will be continued in the explanation of
                    the various systems which have since been promulgated by those who have
                    endeavoured either to extend or to overthrow the principles upon which Dr Young
                    conducted his investigations. But, in the meanwhile, we shall so far interrupt
                    the development of our general plan as, in the next section, to submit to our
                    readers an abstract of the facts and arguments by which the substantial identity
                    of the different dialects of Coptic with the language of ancient Egypt has, in
                    our opinion, been completely established, and an obstacle which might have
                    impeded the future progress of investigation thus cleared away.</p>

                <p>II. IDENTITY OF THE COPTIC DIALECTS WITH THE ANCIENT LANGUAGE OF EGYPT.</p>
                <p>Language is, after all, the most durable of human monuments. Conquerors may
                    overthrow empires and states, earthquakes may swallow up cities, time may
                    confound all things besides; but the winged words in which man gives utterance
                    to his feelings and thoughts often outlast all these ravages, and preserve the
                    memory of nations long after they have ceased to exist. That which seems the
                    most fragile, the most variable, the most evanescent of human attributes or
                    possessions, becomes in reality the most permanent, the most indestructible. If
                    no longer able to support an independent existence, it clings to and coalesees
                    with some more recent and robust dialect; if lost in one form, it is almost
                    certain to re-appear in another, exhibiting, amidst all changes and
                    disfigurations, incontestible traces of its origin. This law of decay and
                    reproduction, of fluctuation yet permanence, is so general, we might almost say
                    universal, that it is principally from analytical inquiries into the origin,
                    composition, and affinities of language, that we derive what knowledge we
                    possess of the early history and fortunes of nations. It is impossible,
                    therefore, to believe that the form of speech which long prevailed in ancient
                    Egypt can have utterly perished, or that remains of it may not still be
                    discovered in one or other of the dialects in which it appears to have merged.
                    The Persian, the Macedonian, the Roman, the Arabian, and the Ottoman conquests,
                    have successively discharged their fury upon that devoted country; and even
                    those monuments which seemed destined to receive the epitaph of Time itself, are
                    mouldering and crumbling into ruin; but, unlike the temples, palaces, and piles
                    stupendous, which once adorned the valley of the Nile, the language of the
                    Pharaohs, though greatly mutilated, has been arrested in its decline, and all of
                    it that remains has long since been placed beyond the reach of further
                    injury.</p>
                <p>If the ease, however, were different from what is here stated; if the language of
                    ancient Egypt had perished as completely as the dialects spoken before the
                    Flood; still it would not be impossible to obtain some knowledge of those
                    inscriptions which have so much occupied the attention of the learned both in
                    ancient and in modern times. With the aid of such monuments as those of Rosetta
                    and Philae, in which the hieroglyphical texts are rendered into a known
                    language, we should still be able, if not to read those texts into the language
                    which they originally represented, at least to determine inductively the values
                    of the principal characters, or groups of characters, of which they are
                    composed; and we should thus, to a certain extent, be provided with the means of
                    attempting empirical explanations of texts unaccompanied with versions.
                    Nevertheless it is undoubted that such an ancient language, even if it had
                    ceased to exist independently, and if its remains were only to be found mixed up
                    in another dialect, perhaps blended with heterogeneous elements, would, on being
                    separated from all extraneous forms, prove eminently serviceable in facilitating
                    inquiries, having it for their object to explain the monumental inscriptions and
                    other Egyptian texts. The value of such an auxiliary, indeed, can only be fully
                    appreciated by those who have devoted themselves to these laborious and
                    difficult investigations; but, from the explanations and details which are
                    contained in the sueceeding sections of this treatise, even the general reader
                    will be enabled to form a tolerably just idea of its importance. In the
                    meanwhile, that no branch of this subject may be left unex plained, we shall
                    endeavour to state, as briefly as possible, the grounds upon which we hold it to
                    be demonstratively certain that the Coptic and the ancient Egyptian are
                    substantially identical.</p>
                <p>There can be no doubt that the Egyptian language and characters subsisted under
                    the Ptolemies. If the Greek alone was in use at the court of these princes, and
                    in the city of Alexandria, the capital of their empire, it cannot be disputed
                    that in the more remote towns, and particularly in the Thebaid, the Egyptian
                    language continued to be understood and spoken as formerly. This fact, attested
                    by the Rosetta inscription, is confirmed by a passage of Plutarch, in which he
                    relates that Cleopatra, the favourite of Caesar and of Antony, replied, without
                    the intervention of an interpreter, to the Ethiopians, the Troglodytes, the
                    Hebrews, the Arabians, the Syrians, the Medes, and the Parthians, and that she
                    also understood the languages of many other nations; whilst the kings, her
                    predecessors, had scarcely given themselves the trouble to learn the Egyptian,
                    and some of them had even neglected the Macedonian,<note anchored="true"

                    language, of their conquerors, is what may easily be believed; but it is
                    altogether incredible that a civilized people like the Egyptians, strongly
                    attached to their own usages, and proverbially averse to those of strangers,
                    should have abandoned or corrupted their language, in which a great number of
                    works had been composed; more especially as the Greek princes who governed Egypt
                    after the death of Alexander do not appear to have, in any respect, interfered
                    with or opposed the prejudices or inclinations of their subjects in favour of
                    their vernacular idiom. If, during the lapse of a certain period, little is to
                    be found respecting either the existence or the condition of the Egyptian
                    language, it should be recollected that the history of Egypt during this period
                    is very little known, and that the greater part of the works which would have
                    thrown light on the reign of the Ptolemies have unfortunately perished.</p>
                <p>But it is nevertheless certain that, under the dominion of the Romans, the
                    Egyptian continued to be the language of the people. Origen, in his treatise
                    against Celsus, observes, that “if a Greek desired to teach any useful doctrine
                    to the Egyptians and Syrians, he would prefer learning the barbarous languages
                    of those nations, to being wholly unintelligible by addressing them in Greek.”
                    The same father, in another place, asks why the fables which the Greeks derive
                    from the subject of their gods, should be regarded as more worthy of credit than
                    those of the Egyptians which have sprung from a similar source, or what rational
                    ground there is for preferring Mnemosyne mother of the Muses, Themis mother of
                    the Hours, Eurynome mother of the Graces, and other Greek names, to those which
                    have been consecrated by the mythology of ancient Egypt. Nor are these the only
                    proofs that the Egyptian language still continued to be understood. The Emperor
                    Severus caused all the books which treated of the occult sciences to be removed
                    from the temples of Egypt, and placed in the tomb of Alexander, that no one
                    might in future either see the hody of that prince, or read what had been
                    written in those books. We learn from Capitolinus that the Roman soldiers raised
                    a tomb to Gordian, on which they engraved an inscription in Greek, Latin,
                    Persian, Hebrew, and Egyptian characters, in order that it might be read by all
                    the world. The Emperor Diocletian, irritated at the Egyptians on account of
                    their revolt, caused all the books on chemistry composed by their learned men in
                    ancient times to be searched out and eon-signed<pb break="no"

                    absurd apprehension that the people might acquire riches by means of this art,
                    and be again in a condition to rise against their oppressors. Lastly, from the
                    first ages of Christianity, the books of the Old and New Testament had been
                    translated into the Egyptian language.</p>
                <p>The greater part of the learned, Lelong, Renaudot, Wilkins, Münter, Woide, and
                    Georgi, are of opinion that this version existed in the second century; and
                    Woide even attempts to prove that the composition of the famous Sahidic
                    manuscript of Dr Askew, entitled TΠIΣTH 20ΦIA,<note anchored="true"

                    the same epoch. Picques thinks that the Coptic translation of the New Testament,
                    which we now possess, was executed in the fifth century, when those who desired
                    to be considered learned, or had connections with Alexandria, cultivated an
                    acquaintance with the Greek or Latin, although the greater number spoke nothing
                    but Egyptian. Paul the hermit, according to St Jerome, was equally conversant
                    with the Egyptian and the Greek tongues. St Antony knew only Egyptian, in which
                    language he addressed to different monasteries several letters, of which
                    Mingarelli has published two fragments written in the Sahidic dialect. The
                    author of the acts of St John and St Simeon, who suffered martyrdom under
                    Diocletian, informs us that he wrote his history with his own hand, and then
                    caused it to be translated into Egyptian by a copyist called Menas. Palladius
                    and Rufinus were equally skilled in Greek, Latin, and Egyptian literature; and
                    the former mentions that the abbot Apollo selected three men possessing the same
                    accomplishments <hi rend="italic">{lμnii%ους</hi><hi rend="italic"

                    Thmuis understood thoroughly, not only the Egyptian, but also the Greek. Jerome
                    informs us that, in the Egyptian, the word <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Psontom-phance</hi> signified <hi rend="italic">Saviour of the world,</hi> and

                    >Ham.</hi> Pachomius, in his infancy, was taught Egyptian by his parents, and
                    never knew any other language, as appears by the history <hi rend="italic"
                    >of</hi> his life. To those of the brethren who understood not Egyptian,
                    Theodorus acted as interpreter, and explained the discourses of Pachomius; he
                    also translated into Egyptian the letter addressed to him by St Athanasius. In
                    the Coptic acts of the martyrdom of St Apater, it is stated that the governor of
                    the Thebaid addressed a communication to that saint in the Egyptian language.
                    The Syriac author of the life of St Ephrem mentions that this saint, having
                    undertaken a journey to Egypt, went to visit St Bischoï, but as they understood
                    only each his mother tongue, it would have been impossible for them to converse
                    together, if God had not granted to Bischoï the gift of speaking Syriac, and to
                    St Eph-rem that of explaining himself in Egyptian. Dioscorus, patriarch of
                    Alexandria, in his eulogium on the bishop of Tkoou,with whom he travelled to the
                    council of Chalcedon, states expressly that the latter knew only Egyptian. “As I
                    understood not his conversation, the deacon Peter,” says he, “acted as our
                    interpreter.” He adds, “The deacon Theopistos said to me, What shall we do with
                    this mute, <hi rend="smallcaps">athrof,</hi> who has embarked with us? Are the
                    heretics Egyptians, that he should have been sent to dispute with them ?”
                    Lastly, the author of an Arabic note inserted in a Coptic manuscript, preserved
                    in the King’s Library at Paris, informs us that, before the invasion of the
                    Moslemins, it was the custom in Egypt, in the celebration of the offices, to
                    read in Greek the lessons of Scripture, and to explain them in Coptic; and it
                    appears from a fragment published by Georgi, that the inhabitants of Upper Egypt
                    recited in both languages litanies, and other parts of the liturgy.</p>
                <p>These authorities, and others which might be produced, leave no doubt whatever as
                    to the preservation of the Egyptian language down till the period referred to in
                    the last of them; it had in fact survived all casualties, and it co-existed with
                    the Greek, even in the service of religion, without being displaced or abrogated
                    by that polished idiom. But it is nevertheless true that the Coptic presents us
                    with a multitude of Greek words, and that the actual alphabet of the language is
                    almost entirely Greek, having retained only a small number of Egyptian
                    characters, which it appears to have borrowed from the enchorial or current
                    writing of ancient times. Are we then to conclude that this language is only a
                    corruption or oft-set of the Greek? It would be quite as reasonable to maintain,
                    with Kircher, that Greek is derived from the Egyptian, or to pretend that the
                    Persian language is only a dialect of the Arabic. Foreign terms introduced into
                    a language change not either its nature or its form, any more than the food
                    introduced into the body, though composed of the most diversified ingredients,
                    makes any change in the personality or identity of the individual who receives
                    it. Of this the English is a living and remarkable proof. The intermixture of
                    Greek words in the Egyptian language is attributable to several causes. In the
                    first place, a new form of government having been established in Egypt, first
                    under the Ptolemies, and then under the Romans, the Egyptians were under the
                    necessity of borrowing from the language the names of dignities, and all the
                    terms which had reference to the administration. Secondly, the Christian
                    religion having early penetrated into Egypt, introduced into that country a
                    multitude of ideas altogether new and strange to the inhabitants, and which,
                    consequently, could not be expressed by the words of their language; besides,
                    several terms had been consecrated by religion, and a reasonable apprehension
                    was entertained lest they should lose their true and proper signification by
                    being translated into another idiom. It was necessary, therefore, to have
                    recourse to the Greek, which was the language of the first preachers of the
                    Gospel, and in which indeed were contained all the fundamental books of the
                    Christian faith. Thirdly, some of those who translated Greek works into
                    Egyptian, found it no doubt convenient, when they either happened not to
                    understand a word, or could not readily find a Coptic equivalent, to leave it as
                    it stood in the original; whilst others, to display their knowledge of both
                    languages, employed indifferently Greek or Egyptian words. It must not, however,
                    be supposed that all the Coptic books which we possess contain an equal number
                    of Greek expressions: these are sometimes of more and sometimes of less frequent
                    occurrence: but, in general, it may be observed that comparatively few can be
                    cited, the equivalents of which were to be found in the Egyptian, a circumstance
                    which Μ. Quatremère had frequent occasion to verify.</p>
                <p>But a question here arises, namely, at what period the Egyptians renounced their
                    ancient mode of writing, whether phonetic or other, to adopt the Greek alphabet,
                    augmented by some letters borrowed from the enchorial characters. On this
                    subject the learned are much divided. Some, as Lacroze and Father Georgi, carry
                    the change as far back as the reign of Psammeticus; but this hypothesis is
                    refuted by the date of the inscription of Rosetta, namely, the reign of Ptolemy
                    Epiphanes, when the ancient methods of writing were still employed. Bonjour

                    thinks that the introduction of the Coptic alphabet was considerably anterior to

                    concludes that the Greek characters were not adopted in Egypt before the third
                    century; an opinion which is confirmed by the passage of Capitolinus already
                    referred to, where that author speaks of the inscription engraved upon the tomb
                    of the Emperor Gordian, “Graecis, et Latinis, et Persicis, et Judaïcis, et <hi

                    meant, because, even supposing that this kind of writing was known and
                    understood in Egypt at the period referred to, it must have been within the
                    reach of too small a number of persons to be employed in an inscription intended

                    that these remained in use amongst the people of Egypt at the time of Gordian’s
                    death, which, according to the calculation of Tillemont, took place in the year
                    244, or about the middle of the third century of the Christian era.</p>
                <p>The Egyptian language was divided into three dialects: the Coptic of Misr, which
                    is the same with the Sahidic; the Bahiric, so called from the province of
                    Bahirah; and the Bashmouric, which was at one time in use in the province of
                    Bashmour. But the only forms now in use are the Bahiric and the Sahidic, both of
                    which dialects are derived from one and the same radical language. The Bahiric,
                    also denominated the Memphitic, is easily distinguishable from the Sahidic, the
                    differences which exist between them being known; and the former was the
                    language of Lower Egypt, whilst the latter was that of the Thebaid or Saïd. But
                    of these two dialects, which is the more ancient? This is a question which it is
                    exceedingly difficult to resolve, as the historical monuments throw no light on
                    the subject, and we are consequently reduced to mere conjecture. Macrizy,
                    Renaudot, Lacroze, and Jablonski, regard the Sahidic dialect as the more
                    ancient; but Georgi has contended for the priority of the Memphitic, and his
                    opinion is also that of Valperga and of Münter. Mingarelli, however, has not
                    ventured to decide the question either one way or other; but it may not
                    unreasonably be supposed that the Thebaic or Sahidic dialect, in which are
                    written the most ancient monuments extant in the Coptic language, and of which
                    mention is made in the life of Pachomius, and perhaps also the Bashmouric,
                    existed primitively in the Egyptian language, at the same time with the
                    Memphitic. If, as Georgi has demonstrated, the Egyptian words, transmitted to us
                    by the ancient authors, appear to have been for the most part borrowed from the
                    last of these dialects, this circumstance ought to excite no surprise; for, as
                    neither the Greeks nor Latins had many occasions to penetrate into the Thebaid,
                    which was remote from the court and the centre of administration, the language
                    of that province must have been less known to them than the dialect of Lower
                    Egypt, which they were accustomed to hear spoken. Besides, the Thebaic dialect,
                    which is a less cultivated form than the Memphitic, was not perhaps in use at
                    this time, excepting in the villages, or in towns of the smallest class. But
                    that the Memphitic dialect was in reality richer than the Sahidic remains to be
                    proved; in fact, the latter, besides a sufficiently large number of words which
                    properly belonged to it, had the distinctive peculiarity of readily adopting,
                    with a slight change, all the Memphitic words. If the Thebaic manuscripts, then,
                    appear to exhibit a greater number of Greek expressions, this intermixture,
                    which is no doubt attributable to the caprice of the writers, and to the
                    operation of the other causes already specified as affecting the Coptic
                    generally, does not appear to have had much influence on the usage of the
                    language; otherwise they would not have taken the precaution, in the Sahidic
                    lexicos, of explaining the Greek words by native terms, a practice which, as far
                    as we have observed, has not been followed in any of the Memphitic
                    vocabularies.</p>
                <p>But it has been objected, that, if the Coptic language represents, or is
                    substantially the same with, the ancient Egyptian, we ought to discover in it
                    the roots or original forms of all the Egyptian words which have been
                    transmitted to us by the Greek or Latin authors; whereas it is not denied that
                    the etymologies proposed by the learned who have occupied themselves with such
                    researches are very far indeed from being all equally fortunate or
                    successful.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>“On peut

                    plausible and embarrassing, we have to observe that we admit the premises, but
                    dispute the validity of the conclusion deduced from them. Isí, The search for
                    etymologies is <hi rend="italic">of</hi> itself extremely hazardous and
                    conjectural. If Varro the most learned of the Romans, Servius the commentator of
                    the Aeneid, and the other Latin grammarians, were mistaken as to the origin of
                    many words in their own language; if, in the French language, there exists a
                    great number of terms, the etymology of which cannot now be discovered; and if
                    Menage, notwithstanding his vast erudition, has fallen into a multitude of
                    errors on this subject; can it be wondered that the same thing should occur in
                    the case of a foreign language which has been dead for centuries, and of which
                    but few monuments have been preserved? <hi rend="italic superscript"> t</hi><hi

                    ancient Egyptian with which we are acquainted have been transmitted to us by the
                    Greeks or the Romans, who, for the most part, were absolutely ignorant of that
                    language; consequently, part of the explanations which they have given was
                    probably conjectural, and, when they furnish no interpretation at all, the
                    difficulty is still greater. Before attempting to trace these words, we would
                    require to be certain as to the true readings; but how can such certainty be
                    attained in regard to terms collected by foreigners, disfigured by a vicious
                    pronunciation, and afterwards altered by the negligence of the copyists? It
                    appears, also, from the contradictory explanations which the ancients have left
                    of the names of Osiris and other divinities, that the Egyptians themselves had
                    no very definite ideas as to the origin of many words in their language; and
                    that their etymology, every authentic trace of which has now disappeared, was
                    sometimes abundantly arbitrary. <hi rend="italic">2&gt;dly,</hi> It is possible

                    priests, whilst the terms were employed in a sense different from that which was

                    >5thly,</hi> We have already seen that the language of Egypt was divided into
                    three dialects; the Memphitic or Bahiric, the Thebaic or Sahidic, and the
                    Bashmouric. But, of these three dialects, the first is that of which we have the
                    most information, though our knowledge of it is very far from being complete.
                    The Sahidic we possess in a very imperfect state, whilst the monuments written
                    in that dialect, and known in Europe, are still but few in number. The
                    Bashmouric is so completely unknown, that Μ. Quatremère, with all his research,
                    succeeded in procuring only a single word of this dialect,<note anchored="true"

                <p>But a revolution equally rapid and complete suddenly changed the political
                    condition of Egypt. The Arabians, whom Mahommed had inspired at once with
                    fanaticism and the spirit of conquest, abandoned their arid deserts, destroyed
                    the monarchy of the Persians, and seized on the finest provinces of the Greek
                    empire. In the twentieth year of the hejira, Amru-ben-el-As, general of Omar,
                    one of the successors of the Prophet, entered Egypt at the head of a body of
                    Moslemins; and as that country was then distracted by the religious dissensions
                    of the orthodox Greeks (Melkites), who adhered to the council of Chalcedon, and
                    of the native Egyptians (Jacobites), who were its implacable enemies, he found
                    little difficulty in uniting it to the empire of the Arabians. Amru, equally
                    politic and brave, whilst he waged an exterminating war against the Greeks,
                    endeavoured by every means to conciliate the good-will of the Egyptian
                    Jacobites; and, with this view, having recalled their patriarch Benjamin, who,
                    under the reign of Heraclius, had been driven from his see, and forced to take
                    refuge in the Thebaid, he authorized that prelate to resume the exercise of his
                    functions. About the same time, the Christians of Egypt began to be denominated
                    <hi rend="italic">Copts</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> a name supposed by some to
                    have been derived from that of an ancient king called <hi rend="italic"
                    >Kobt,</hi> and by others to have originated from the Greek city of Coptos,
                    whilst a third class contend that the Christians of Egypt were called Korro∕by
                    the Greeks, in consequence of their adhering to the rite of circumcision, and a
                    fourth, that the word <hi rend="italic">Copt</hi> is only a corruption of the
                    word <hi rend="italic">'Αιγύπτιος.</hi> (See the article <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Egypt,</hi><hi rend="italic">sub initio.}</hi></p>
                <p>But be this as it may, whilst it continued to be for the interest of the
                    conquerors to pursue a conciliating line of policy towards the native
                    population, or, in other words, to strengthen themselves by fomenting divisions
                    and animosities in regard to disputed points in religion, the Egyptian language
                    flourished, at least no obstacle was opposed to its cultivation. In a short
                    time, however, the Copts as well as the Greeks began to be oppressed by their
                    cruel and avaricious conquerors; the tyranny, which at first was only partial,
                    became general; and the native population, being reduced to abject poverty, soon
                    fell into a state of profound ignorance. Forced to learn the language of their
                    masters, they neglected their ancient tongue, which daily became less useful;
                    those of them who held the situations of <hi rend="italic">moubascher,</hi> that
                    is, of secretaries or intendants under the princes and grandees, had no other
                    interest but to speak and write Arabic with purity; and thus the knowledge of
                    Coptic bee <hi rend="superscript"> r</hi> an to decline, and was at length
                    altogether lost in Egypt. But at what precise epoch the ancient language ceased
                    to be spoken and ' understood, is a question which, considering the silence of
                    the historical monuments, it is by no means easy to resolve. It appears,
                    however, from a passage in the preface to the History of the Patriarchs of
                    Alexandria by Severus, bishop of Ashmounein, that in the tenth century of our
                    era the Coptic was no longer spoken in Egypt; but it is nevertheless certain
                    that, long after this period, persons of consideration who desired to
                    distinguish themselves by their acquirements studied Coptic, and that this
                    language was as generally understood in Egypt as the Latin language is at
                    present in Europe. There are still extant Coptic works composed long
                    subsequently to the epoch fixed by Renaudotas that when the ancient language
                    fell into total desuetude amongst the Egyptian Christians, namely, the century
                    after the Mahommedan invasion; and, as Macrizy mentions the Coptic in several
                    parts of his Description of Egypt, it would appear that, at the period when he
                    wrote, that is, about the commencement of the fifteenth century, the language
                    was not entirely lost. But for further details on this subject we must refer the
                    reader to the learned and satisfactory work of Μ. Quatremère.</p>
                <p>Having thus traced a rapid outline of the history of the Egyptian or Coptic under
                    the Ptolemies, the Romans, and the Arabians, marking its different epochs, and
                    indicating generally the changes it experienced, we shall now proceed to give a
                    short account of the efforts which the learned of Europe have at different times
                    made, sometimes with greater, sometimes with less success, to rescue that
                    ancient idiom from oblivion, and, if we may so express ourselves, to impart to
                    it a new existence.</p>
                <p>Scaliger is commonly considered as the first who contemplated such an
                    undertaking; but, if he really meditated the design which is attributed to him,
                    it seems pretty certain that he was not in a condition to carry it into effect;
                    for, as he makes a great parade of his acquaintance with Arabic, it may be
                    presumed that he would not have been silent on the subject of Egyptian, if he
                    had really known any thing of that language; and it is not a little remarkable,
                    that in announcing his project of publishing a polyglot psalter in six
                    languages, which he enumerates, he says not a word of Egyptian, nor is that
                    language included in the number. Leonard Abela, who died at Rome in 1605, having
                    been created bishop of Sidon, and sent to the East as apostolic nuncio by
                    Gregory XIII., visited Syria, Mesopotamia, and Egypt, and during his travels
                    made himself well acquainted with the oriental languages, including Egyptian;
                    but whether he brought home any Coptic manuscripts, or imported only the
                    knowledge he had acquired, has not been ascertained. John Baptist Remondi
                    intended to publish the Bible in ten languages, namely, in Latin, Greek, Hebrew,
                    Chaldaic, Arabic, Egyptian, Ethiopian, Armenian, Syriac, and Persian; and,
                    besides the texts, and the different Latin versions, this collection was to
                    contain grammars and lexicos of all these languages. But unfortunately his
                    enterprise proved abortive, and the Egyptian remained completely unknown until
                    the enlightened exertions of Peiresc procured for the learned of Europe the
                    means of studying that language.</p>
                <p>This illustrious man, to whom letters are under lasting obligations, spared
                    neither pains nor expense to procure Coptic manuscripts. Of these he obtained
                    several from Egypt, comprehending the gospels, epistles, and psalms, <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193643151" xml:id="kp-eb0711-3151-0312"/> the Coptic
                    ritual, and the liturgies of St Basil, St Gregory, and St Cyril; and he also
                    expected the prophets in Coptic, as well as a psalter in seven languages, viz.
                    Hebrew, Syriac, Greek, Coptic, Ethiopian, Persian, and Armenian, together with
                    other curious manuscripts; but all of them were seized and carried off by
                    pirates. Afflicted but not discouraged, Peiresc, having learned that the pirates
                    had sailed for Tripoli, wrote to the pasha of that town, received a favourable
                    answer, and not long afterwards was presented with a package wrapt up with great
                    care, and said to have been transmitted from Tripoli. Peiresc, rejoiced at
                    recovering the lost treasure, liberally rewarded the unknown persons by whom, as
                    he supposed, it had been brought back to him. He was very disagreeably
                    surprised, however, on opening the package, to find that it contained nothing
                    but the Arabic dictionary of Raphelengius. But his zeal to promote the study of
                    Coptic was in no degree cooled by the fraud thus practised on him; and having
                    with a view to this engaged Samuel Petit and Salmasius to cultivate that new
                    branch of literature, he communicated to them all the manuscripts which he had
                    in his possession. Petit, however, appears to have made but little progress in
                    this study; but Salmasius applied to it with great vigour, and had the merit not
                    only of entering a new path without any guide, but also of inducing the learned
                    to follow his example. In his different works may be seen the use which he made
                    of the Coptic in explaining a number of Egyptian words; and his letter to Golius
                    is particularly deserving of attention.</p>
                <p>About this time Pietro della Valle returned from his travels in the East,
                    bringing with him several Coptic manuscripts, and amongst others an extensive
                    Copto-Arabic lexico, accompanied with grammars. These he placed in the hands of
                    Thomas Obicini, who had long resided in the Levant, for the purpose of being
                    translated into Latin. The work was successfully commenced; and the congregation
                    of the Propaganda had already caused to be cut the Coptic characters, which
                    served to print the <hi rend="italic">Alphabetum</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Coptum</hi><hi rend="italic">seu</hi><hi rend="italic">Aegyptiacum,</hi> a work
                    which appeared in 1629. But the affairs of Obicini having fallen into confusion,
                    the undertaking languished, and was at length totally interrupted by the death
                    of the translator, amongst whose papers scarcely any thing was found relative to
                    the work. Peiresc, however, having heard of the manuscript, and being extremely
                    desirous for its publication, pressed Pietro della Valle to lend it him for the
                    purpose of having it translated by Salmasius. The Italian, it seems, refused,
                    but consented to communicate it to Kircher, who was then at Rome, and had
                    acquired a great reputation; or, at all events, he preferred that the
                    translation should be executed under his own eye. Salmasius was in despair on
                    finding that the credit of such a work was to be reaped by another; and in a
                    letter on the subject which he addressed to Pciresc he evinces a bitter feeling
                    of disappointment.</p>
                <p>Kircher, with the assistance of the manuscripts of Pietro della Valle, and those
                    of the library of the Vatican, published, first, his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Prodromus</hi><hi rend="italic">Aegyptiavus,</hi> Rome, 1636, and then his <hi
                    rend="italic">Lingua Aegyptiaca</hi><hi rend="italic">Restituta,</hi> Rome,
                    1644. The first of these works contains several preliminary dissertations, some
                    of them perfectly foreign to its object, with an essay on Coptic grammar; the
                    second, which, with all its errors, is an useful and meritorious work, contains
                    a grammar and a Copto-Arabic vocabulary. The numerous faults committed by
                    Kircher would deserve indulgence, and due allowance would be made for the
                    difficulties incident to the task undertaken by him, were it not for his
                    unpardonable arrogance, and the bad faith with which he has inserted in his work
                    words which are not to be found in the original; as, for instance, MENDJÊS <hi
                    rend="italic">hircus,</hi> which Jablonski suspected to be supposititious, and
                    which Quatremère was unable to discover in the manuscript of Pietro della Valle.
                    Hence, the enthusiasm which Kircher’s work at first excited soon cooled, and the
                    author incurred severe censure for his extravagance and dishonesty. Bochart and
                    Ludolf refuted his assertion that the Greek is derived from the Egyptian;
                    Wagenseil analysed his explanation of an inscription engraved on Mount Sinai,
                    and proved its falsehood; Picques alleged that, besides his mother tongue,
                    Kircher knew only a little Latin, and almost no Greek; and Renaudot, who has
                    entered into extensive details respecting the works of the Jesuit, pronounces
                    upon them a severe judgment, which is confirmed by Wilkins, Blumberg, Lacroze,
                    Jablonski, Barthélemy, Tromler, and Schmidt. So great, indeed, was the distrust
                    excited by the exposure of his malpractices, that, at one time, his <hi
                    rend="italic">Lingua Aegyptiaca</hi><hi rend="italic">Restituta</hi> was
                    believed to be a literary fraud; but this opinion is entirely inadmissible, now
                    that the original manuscript has been recovered.<note anchored="true"

                <p>Amongst the manuscripts of Samuel Petit, deposited in the King’s Library at
                    Paris, Μ. Quatremère found a Coptic alphabet, with observations written in
                    Latin, and aΓso two French letters addressed to Petit from Tours, the author of
                    which appears to have been profoundly conversant with the oriental languages. It
                    is now known that these letters are the production of Gilles de Loche, a
                    capuchin, who, according to Gassendi, returned from his travels in Egypt about
                    the year 1633. Gessner, in his <hi rend="italic">Mithridates,</hi> collected the
                    Egyptian words which the ancients have transmitted to us; Bochart published a
                    greater number; and Ménage, in illustrating the three dialects, collected and
                    explained all the foreign words, Egyptian, Lybian, Persian, Macedonian, and
                    others contained in the Greek and Latin authors. Tromler mentions a confession
                    of faith in Latin and Coptic, printed at Rome in the year 1668; and Lelong

                    given some details respecting the Egyptian language. Theodore Petraeus, who had
                    resided long in Egypt, studied Coptic, collected manuscripts in that language,
                    and on his return published the first psalm in Coptic, with an Arabic
                    translation and a Latin version. He also translated into Latin, from the Coptic
                    text, the epistle of St Paul to the Ephesians. Huntington, during his stay in
                    Syria and Egypt, employed himself in collecting oriental manuscripts,
                    particularly in Coptic, and his rich collection was afterwards deposited in the
                    Bodleian Library at Oxford. Marshal, celebrated for his labours on the
                    Anglo-Saxon, was also profoundly acquainted with the oriental languages, and
                    particularly with Coptic. Not satisfied with having collated the Coptic version
                    of the gospels with the Greek text, and collected the various readings, he
                    undertook to publish the New Testament in the same language; but after every
                    thing had been prepared, this useful enterprise<pb break="no"

                    premature death of the editor, who only lived to print a single sheet,
                    containing the first three chapters of St Mathew’s gospel, accompanied with a
                    Latin version, and notes.</p>
                <p>The study of Coptic was much encouraged at Oxford by the liberal patronage of the
                    bishop, Dr Fell, who had caused Coptic types to be cast at his own expense for
                    the intended work of Marshal, and who afterwards assisted Thomas Edward in his
                    researches. Edward Bernard, having studied Coptic, left in manuscript an
                    Egyptian lexico, in which he explains many points concerning Egyptian
                    antiquities. In 1686, Witsen, burgomaster of Amsterdam, presented to the
                    university of Oxford the Ethiopian and Coptic punches, which he had sent to
                    Edward Bernard. Bonjour, an Augustin friar of Toulouse, published <hi

                    rend="italic">Aegyptiaca Diblio-thecũe Vaticanae,</hi> Rome, 1699, in 4to; a
                    work which is highly commended by Lacroze, and which displays a profound
                    acquaintance with the Coptic language. This learned friar died in China in 1714,
                    leaving several manuscript works, the most important of which is a History of
                    the Dynasties of Egypt, cited by Cuper and by Georgi. Coptic literature owes
                    much to Pope Clement XI., who, in the early part of the eighteenth century, sent
                    three missions to Egypt in quest of manuscripts, and enriched the library of the
                    Vatican with that beautiful and precious collection, which the treaty of
                    Tolentino transferred to Paris, but which was afterwards restored on the
                    downfall of Napoleon. Nor were the learned of Germany neglectful of the study of
                    Coptic. Pfeiffer applied himself to the cultivation of that language, in which
                    he wrote some indifferent verses. Andrew Muller studied Coptic, and applied it
                    to the explanation of some words in the Bible. Acoluthus, a minister of the
                    gospel at Breslau in Silesia, also devoted himself to this pursuit, and
                    published a work entitled <hi rend="italic">Lingua Aegyptiaca</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Restituta,</hi> in which he pretended that the ancient Egyptian
                    had nothing in common with the Coptic, but might be detected in the modern
                    Armenian. Acoluthus was a man of learning; but with all his erudition he was
                    unable to give any colour of probability to this chimerical hypothesis. In the
                    year 1716, Blumberg published a short Coptic grammar entitled <hi rend="italic"
                    >Fundamenta</hi><hi rend="italic">Linguae Copticae,</hi> of which Lacroze has
                    pronounced a very favourable opinion. Blumberg also promised a Copto-Latin and
                    Latino-Coptic dictionary; but domestic misfortunes and a premature death
                    prevented him from carrying his design into execution.</p>
                <p>In France, Coptic literature was enriched by a great number of Coptic manuscripts
                    brought from Egypt by Vansleb, and deposited in the library of the king. Louis
                    Picques, doctor of the Sorbonne, who had distinguished himself as an
                    orientalist, also applied with ardour to the study of Coptic, and was the first
                    who recognised the variety of dialects. Besides the various readings of the
                    Coptic and Armenian versions of the New Testament, we are indebted to him for
                    ingenious etymologies of some Egyptian words, and amongst others of the famous
                    name of Joseph, which has exercised the sagacity of several modern writers. This
                    name, which the seventy-two write <hi rend="italic">Aw∂ομ&lt;ρavτ</hi><hi

                    we think, that both were formed from the Egyptian words <hi rend="italic"
                    >Píot-mephench,</hi> as Picques has most ingeniously supposed.</p></note> which
                    appears to be the only true etymology. He also made a great number of
                    corrections on the lexico of Kircher, and, in the few works which he published,
                    displayed an erudition which justifies the commendations bestowed on them by his
                    contemporaries. But all the orientalists who had yet appeared were eclipsed by
                    the Abbé</p>
                <p>Renaudot, whose name will ever be dear to the lovers of eastern literature. In
                    1716, he published his Collection of the Oriental Liturgies, three of which
                    (those of St Basil, St Gregory, and St CyriD were translated from the Coptic;
                    but the want of the characters prevented him from printing the original texts.
                    To this translation are subjoined commentaries full of erudition, and several
                    dissertations, particularly one entitled <hi rend="italic">De Copticarum</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Alexandrinorum</hi><hi rend="italic">Liturgiis,</hi> and another,
                    <hi rend="italic">De Lingua Coptica.</hi> Scarcely had this work appeared, when
                    it was attacked with the greatest asperity by Lacroze, under the pretext of
                    avenging the memory of Ludolf, who had been severely handled both in the History
                    of the Patriarchs of Alexandria, and also in the Collection of Liturgies.
                    Lacroze was no doubt a formidable adversary, and he certainly detected some
                    faults in the Collection of the learned Abbé, such as <hi rend="italic">Bibite
                    vos omnes omnes</hi> for <hi rend="italic">Dibite</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >omnes,</hi> which he denounces as an important falsification. But these errors
                    were not of sufficient magnitude to justify the fierce ebullition of literary
                    wrath displayed by Lacroze upon this occasion; and it is not a little amusing to
                    find that, whilst exaggerating the oversights of his opponent, he is himself
                    betrayed into some very serious inaccuracies. “En effet,” says Μ. Quatremère,
                    “si l’Abbe Renaudot n’avoit pas dans le Copte des connoissances très étendues,
                    il est certain qu’il possédoit parfaitement l’Arabe et le Syriaque.” This
                    Lacroze is himself forced to admit.</p>
                <p>As yet, however, the progress of the Egyptian language had been but slow and
                    imperfect. All the Coptic monuments were still in manuscript, and the learned
                    had no guide except the lexico of Kircher, which, besides the errors with which
                    it teems, and the omission of a great number of words, has the serious
                    inconvenience of not being arranged in alphabetical order. But these obstacles
                    were now about to be removed; and the first who contributed to facilitate the
                    acquisition of Coptic was David Wilkius, a Prussian by birth, who, during his
                    residence in England, changed his name into that of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Wilkins,</hi> by which alone he is known. Wilkins applied with ardour to the
                    study of Coptic, and after having examined every work connected with that
                    language in the Bodleian Library, he travelled through France and Italy,
                    occupying himself in copying or collating all the manuscripts he could find. In
                    1715, he published, in Chamberlayne’s collection, the Lord’s Prayer in Coptic,
                    with a grammatical analysis, and a dissertation <hi rend="italic">De Lingua
                    Coptica.</hi> In 1716, he published, at the expense of the university of Oxford,
                    the New Testament in Coptic, accompanied with a Latin translation. Lacroze, who
                    examined this work with great care, discovered a multitude of errors both in the
                    text and in the translation, and thence conceived a most unfavourable opinion of
                    the talents of Wilkins, whom he taxes with gross ignorance of Coptic, and even
                    places in this respect below Kircher. But this censure must appear somewhat too
                    severe, when we reflect on the difficulties Wilkins had to surmount in the study
                    of a dead language, which he had learned without a guide, and without having
                    either a grammar or a dictionary to assist him. He redeemed his character,
                    however, by his Coptic Pentateuch, which appeared in 1731, and in which,
                    according to Jablonski, he greatly surpassed any thing he had previously done.
                    Wilkins also proposed to publish a Coptic grammar and dictionary; but finding no
                    encouragement, the enterprise was at length abandoned. The manuscript of his
                    History of the Church of Alexandria was unfortunately lost immediately after his
                    death, and all the exertions of Woide to recover it proved fruitless.</p>
                <p>Lacroze, who about the same time occupied himself with <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193643177" xml:id="kp-eb0711-3177-0314"/>the study of Coptic, left far
                    behind him all those who had entered on the same career. He communicated his
                    acquisitions on this subject to the celebrated Paul-Ernest Jablonski, so well
                    known by his great erudition, and his labours connected with Egyptian
                    antiquities; and Jablonski having, during his travels, copied, in whole or in
                    part, several Coptic manuscripts, at Paris, at Leyden, and at Oxford,
                    communicated these copies to Lacroze, who, with their assistance, and that
                    furnished by the manuscripts of the library of Berlin, composed a very exact
                    dictionary of the Coptic language. This work was that of all his manuscripts
                    upon which the author set the greatest value; but not having the means of
                    publishing it, he contented himself with printing the preface, which appeared in
                    the <hi rend="italic">Bibliotheca HistoricoPhilologica</hi><hi rend="italic"

                    Lacroze annexed a list of words in the Sahidic dialect, in regard to which
                    Picques and Renaudot had but confused notions, whilst all the other men learned
                    in Coptic, including Wilkins, were absolutely ignorant of its' existence. The
                    reputation of Lacroze’s lexico having spread throughout Europe, Wilkins, who had
                    also composed a Coptic dictionary, proposed to Lacroze to cast both works into
                    one, and to print it under their joint names, either at London or at Berlin; but
                    the latter, who knew the merit of his own work, and felt no desire whatever to
                    amalgamate it with that of Wilkins, decliued the proposal. After the death of
                    Lacroze, his Coptic dictionary passed with his other manuscripts into the hands
                    of Jordan, his biographer; and, when the latter died, his brother sold the
                    Coptic and Armenian dictionaries to the university of Leyden. In the Royal
                    Library at Paris there is a copy of the Coptic dictionary in the handwriting of
                    Lacroze.</p>
                <p>Jablonski, in his <hi rend="italic">Pantheon</hi><hi rend="italic">Mythicum,</hi>
                    and in his dissertations on the god Rempha, the land of Goshen, Memnon, and
                    other kindred subjects, made frequent use and showed a profound knowledge of
                    Coptic. He had also laboured for many years on an Egyptian glossary, in which he
                    collected, arranged in alphabetical order, and, with the assistance of the
                    Coptic, explained, all the Egyptian words which are found dispersed in the Greek
                    and Latin authors, and even in the Hebrew text of the Bible. He had also written
                    a multitude of notes and corrections on the New Testament and Coptic Pentateuch
                    of Wilkins. At his death these annotations, as well as the copies he had made of
                    Memphitic and Sahidic manuscripts, were sold by his son to Dr Radcliff of
                    Oxford; whilst another part of his papers, containing the glossary already
                    mentioned, with a number of dissertations, discourses, and other productions,
                    some of them still inedited, were sent to Leyden to the learned Ruhnkenius.
                    Sensible of the value of these papers, Ruhnkenius placed them in the hands of
                    Henry Albert Schultens, who readily undertook to arrange them for publication;
                    Schultens, however, died soon afterwards; and, at the solicitation of
                    Ruhnkenius, Tewater, professor of theology in the university of Leyden,
                    consented to take charge of the publication, which accordingly appeared at
                    Leyden in 1804, under the title of <hi rend="italic">Jablonshii</hi><hi

                <p>Amongst those who cultivated some acquaintance with Coptic may be mentioned
                    Bayer, who studied it in the works of Lacroze; Richard Cumberland, bishop of
                    Peterborough, who, having received a copy of Wilkins’ Coptic New Testament,
                    commenced the study of the language in his eighty-fourth year; George Whiston,
                    who copied and translated into Latin the Pentateuch, and also composed a Coptic
                    lexico; Wasse and Gagnier, the latter of whom copied for Lacroze the Acts of the
                    Apostles in the Sahidic dialect, from a manuscript in the Bodleian Library;
                    Henselius, who gave some details on the Coptic in his <hi rend="italic">Synopsis

                    Kocher of Berne, the author of a very learned dissertation <hi rend="italic"

                    Reiske; and Schmidt of the same place, who devoted himself exclusively to
                    Egyptian studies, made frequent use of the Coptic to explain Egyptian words,
                    particularly in his able dissertation <hi rend="italic">Sur one Colonie
                    Egyptienne établie aux Indes,</hi> and even composed a Coptic dictionary.
                    Raphael Tuki, who was a Copt by birth, and bishop of Arsinoe, printed at Rome
                    the liturgie works of his nation, in Coptic and in Arabic. He published the
                    missal in 1736, the psalter in 1744, the diurnal in 1750, the first part of the
                    pontifical in 1761, the second in 1762, the ritual in 1763, and, lastly, the
                    office of the Virgin in 1764. Tnki also composed a Coptic grammar, which was
                    published at Rome in 1778, by the congregation of the Propaganda, but which,
                    like all the works of the orientals oil the subject of grammar, is defective in
                    method, and devoid of critical accuracy. Assemanni also published at Rome
                    various liturgie pieces in Coptic and Arabic, with a Latin version. Lastly,
                    Christopher Muller, in a work entitled <hi rend="italic">Satura
                    Observationum</hi><hi rend="italic">Philologicarum,</hi> Leyden, 1752, made some
                    use of the Coptic, which he had learned with the help of Lacroze’s dictionary,
                    communicated to him by Dithmar Hakman, minister at Wassenaer.</p>
                <p>Scholtz, preacher to the king of Prussia at Berlin, occupied himself with ardour
                    in the study of Coptic. In 1748, he obtained permission from the university of
                    Leyden to take a copy of Lacroze’s lexico; and this was accordingly done by
                    Woide, a Pole, then a student in that university, who also took a copy of the
                    dictionary for himself. Before this, Scholtz, being brother-in-law to Jablonski,
                    had been assisted in his Coptic studies by that celebrated scholar, who
                    communicated to him copies of his manuscripts; and having also at his disposal
                    all the treasures of the library of Berlin, with the inedited remarks of
                    Lacroze, he had composed a grammar of the Memphitic and Sahidic dialects, and a
                    dissertation on the Coptic language. Afterwards, becoming possessor of the
                    lexico of Lacroze, and conceiving that the size of the work would be an obstacle
                    to its publication, he made an abridgment of it, in which he carefully preserved
                    all the words and significations, contenting himself with retrenching only the
                    passages which in the original had been cited at length. This work had been
                    completed, when, in 1765, Woide, passing through Berlin on his way to England,
                    was intrusted by Scholtz with the abridgment of the dictionary, the grammar, and
                    the dissertation, in order that he might endeavour to get them published. Woide,
                    on his arrival in this country, applied to Dr Durell, vice-chancellor of Oxford,
                    and, after a negotiation of more than two years, it was at length decided that
                    the lexico, grammar, and dissertation should be published at the expense of the
                    university of Oxford. It was judged proper to print the dictionary first, as
                    being the most important work. Woide, however, being dissatisfied with the
                    abridgment of Scholtz, would have preferred publishing the lexico as Lacroze had
                    left it, with the passages cited at length; but although it would have been easy
                    to verify the citations from the New Testament and the Pentateuch by the printed
                    copies, it became almost impossible to refer to the passages from the psalms,
                    liturgies, and other inedited works, of which there existed at most only two or
                    three copies, in each of which the pagination was different. On the other hand,
                    Lacroze, in composing his dictionary, had possessed but few aids; the works
                    which he put under contribution being the New Testament, the psalms, the
                    liturgies of St Basil, St Gregory, and St Cyril, and some <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193643190" xml:id="kp-eb0711-3190-0315"/>extracts from the Pentateuch,
                    Daniel, and the office of passion week. Sensible of the imperfection of this
                    work, Woide, having collected a great number of additions from the Pentateuch, a
                    volume of Coptic prayers, and other sources, solicited and obtained permission
                    to insert these additions in the text of the dictionary. But the impression
                    being already considerably advanced, and Scholtz, who wished the dictionary to
                    be as short as possible, having desired the additions to be made at the end,
                    Woide, after printing a small number in the body of the dictionary, where they
                    appear in parentheses, resolved to publish a supplement in a separate form; and,
                    in fact, he composed a very extensive Sahidic dictionary, though he was
                    prevented by circumstances from completing his whole design.</p>
                <p>The dictionary of Lacroze appeared in the year 1775, and the printing of the
                    grammar was next commenced. But as this work, from its great length and want of
                    method, seemed rather calculated to repel than to encourage students, .it was
                    resolved to print only an extract, and to deposit the original in the Bodleian
                    Library. Scholtz consented to this arrangement, and Woide undertook to execute
                    an abridgment of the work, which appeared in 1778. Woide performed his task with
                    equal judgment and ability; he changed the plan adopted by Scholtz, who had
                    separated the elements of the Sahidic dialect from those of the Memphitic; he
                    recast both grammars into one, contenting himself with indicating, after each
                    rule of the Mcm-phitic dialect, the relations or the differences presented by
                    the Sahidic; he expunged whatever seemed superfluous or useless, and inserted
                    new observations, the fruit of a profound study of the language, with a
                    multitude of passages and examples drawn from the Memphitic and Sahidic
                    manuscripts which he had copied. His next undertaking was to collect and to
                    publish all the fragments extant of the Sahidic version of the New Testament;
                    and the impression was already far advanced, when death put a period to his
                    laborious and useful career. But the work was continued by Ford, professor of
                    Arabic at Oxford, and appeared in 1799, in one volume folio. Woide left numerous
                    copies of Coptic and Sahidic manuscripts, a dissertation in English on the
                    Coptic language, and the supplement to the lexico of Lacroze.</p>
                <p>With the aid of this dictionary, which Woide had lent him, J. Reinhold Foster
                    applied to the study of Coptic, in which he made great proficiency, as appears
                    by his letters to Michaelis, and by his work <hi rend="italic">De</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Bysso Antiquorum.</hi> In 1767, Tromler published at Leipsig a
                    small volume entitled <hi rend="italic">Bibliothecae Copto-</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Jacobiticae Specimen,</hi> containing an enumeration of the works
                    which had appeared on the language, history, and religion of the Copts, and
                    preceded by a dissertation <hi rend="italic">de Fatis Einguae Copticae.</hi> At
                    Rome, the celebrated Cardinal Borgia, distinguished as a zealous and munificent
                    patron of letters, engaged Georgi, who, in his <hi rend="italic">Alphabetuni
                    Tibetanum,</hi> had evinced an intimate acquaintance with Coptic, to publish an
                    ancient Sahidic fragment in his cabinet containing part of the Acts of St
                    Coluthus. This work appeared at Rome in 1781, with a translation and notes by
                    Georgi, and accompanied with a curious preface, in which the learned cardinal
                    himself relates all that is known of the history and worship of St Coluthus.
                    Georgi then occupied himself in translating and commenting on a very ancient
                    fragment in the same cabinet, containing the Greek text and the Sahidic version
                    of a portion of St John. This work appeared in 1789. In 1793, he published a
                    second edition of the Acts of St Coluthus, with new additions, numerous notes,
                    and a variety of Sahidic fragments from the cabinet of Cardinal Borgia. In the
                    preface he has inserted extracts from several acts of martyrs, written in the
                    Memphitic dialect, which the cardinal had caused to be copied by Tuki, from a
                    manuscript in the Vatican Library; but the careless Copt had done his work very
                    negligently, for the copy made by him is full of errors.</p>
                <p>Whilst the works of Georgi thus contributed to advance the study of Coptic in the
                    south, several learned men of the north of Europe directed their attention to
                    that language. Adler, already distinguished by his acquirements as an
                    orientalist, having learned Coptic during his residence at Rome, proceeded to
                    examine the Sahidic manuscripts of Cardinal Borgia, after which he copied the
                    book of Job and the fragments of the New Testament; he also employed the Coptic
                    language to explain several Egyptian words. Miinter, whom Cardinal Borgia had
                    induced to study Coptic, caused to be printed at Rome, in 1786, the ninth
                    chapter of Daniel, in the two dialects, with a translation and notes. On his
                    return to Copenhagen he also published an excellent dissertation on the Sahidic
                    version of the New Testament, to which he subjoined fragments of the epistles of
                    St Paul to Timothy. Munter afterwards undertook, in conjunction with Adler, to
                    publish the prophecy of Daniel in the Memphitic dialect, the book of Job, the
                    greater part of the book of Proverbs, and fragments of the New Testament, in the
                    Sahidic dialect.</p>
                <p>Mingarelli, who at an advanced age studied Coptic, published at Bologna in 1785,
                    several Sahidic fragments from the collection of the Chevalier Nani at Venice,
                    with a Latin translation and notes. Zoega, of whom we have already spoken, made
                    frequent use of the Coptic in his learned works on Egyptian coins, and also in
                    that on the origin and use of the obelisks. It was he whom Cardinal Borgia
                    selected to prepare a detailed catalogue of the Coptic and Sahidic manuscripts
                    of his collection. Father Simeon a Magistris, in his edition <hi rend="italic"
                    >of</hi> Daniel according to the Septuagint, and Bernard de Rossi in his
                    dissertation <hi rend="italic">Della Lingua propria di Cristo,</hi> have given
                    some details respecting the Coptic language. In the year 1785, Thomas Valperga,
                    abbot of Caluso, published at Parma a grammar of the Coptic language, under the
                    assumed name of Didymus of Turin. Baron Silvestre de Sacy, one of the most
                    learned orientalists of modern times, has made use of the Coptic language for
                    explaining several Egyptian words, in his Observations on the name of the
                    Pyramids, and also in his Letter on the triple inscription of Rosetta. Mr
                    Akerblad, a learned Swede, applied with indefatigable ardour to the study of
                    Coptic during his residence at Paris and at Rome; and his Letter on the
                    inscription of Rosetta, in which he displayed equal erudition and sagacity,
                    entitled him to rank amongst the small number of those who have thoroughly
                    understood Coptic. In this class a distinguished place must be allotted to the
                    accomplished author of the <hi rend="italic">Recherches sur</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">la Langue</hi><hi rend="italic">et la Littérature de
                    l’Egypte</hi><hi rend="italic smallcaps"> ;</hi> a work which is not more
                    remarkable for profound research and extensive erudition, than for sound
                    criticism and the happy union of conciseness and perspicuity. Nor is the
                    celebrated author of √1⅛M <hi rend="italic">Polyglotta</hi> inferior to any of
                    his predecessors or contemporaries in the knowledge of Coptic. This he has made
                    sufficiently evident by his Letters on Aerological Hieroglyphics, and still more
                    by his <hi rend="italic">Examen</hi><hi rend="italic">Critique des</hi><hi

                    severity, but of great learning and extreme critical acuteness.</p>
                <p>Without a knowledge of Coptic it is next to impossible to make any advance worth
                    mentioning in the study of hieroglyphics. This is too obvious to require almost
                    any illustration. If the Coptic be essentially identical with the ancient
                    Egyptian, that is, if the remains of the latter be incorporated in the different
                    dialects of the former, it is evident that the phonetic alphabet can never be
                    applied to any good purpose except by those who are in a condition to
                    distinguish and to understand something of the language in which the
                    inscriptions are written. A person ignorant of Coptic may indeed decipher, by

                    the days of Pierius and of Kircher. Accordingly, all those who have recently
                    treated of the subject evince, by their writings, that they have been at pains
                    to acquire in a greater or less degree this indispensable preliminary

                    Wilkinson, gives us an important piece of information connected with the subject
                    treated of in this section. After expressing his regret that the Delta has been
                    so little examined, “especially as some light might possibly be thrown on the
                    remains of a very interesting period,” he proceeds thus: “Another object worthy
                    of the attention of future travellers, is the ancient library of a Copt convent
                    at the Natron Lakes, where, besides many other manuscripts, is <hi rend="italic"
                    >α Coptic and Arabic dictionary,</hi> which, though it cannot be purchased, <hi
                    rend="italic">might be copied,</hi> on a proper application for that purpose to
                    the patriarch of Qaherah (Cairo). And as the study of hieroglyphics, and our
                    future insight into the long-lost language and early history of Egypt, depend
                    entirely on the possession of a similar work, it would at the present moment be
                    an inestimable acquisition.” <hi rend="italic">, {Topography of Thebes,</hi>

                    or grammarians, we are not inclined to estimate so highly as Mr Wilkinson has
                    here done, the advantages likely to result from the acquisition of this lexico;
                    but, at the same time, we entirely agree with him in thinking that “proper”
                    means should immediately be employed to obtain a copy of the dictionary, more
                    especially as it appears to be so highly prized by the Copts. Mr λVilkinson
                    informs us that his own efforts to obtain permission to copy it proved
                    fruitless. But if the viceroy were induced to signify his pleasure on the
                    subject, the patriarch would most probably find it convenient not to withhold
                    his assent.</p></note></p>
                <p>III. DR <hi rend="smallcaps">young’s</hi> ANALYSIS OF THE TRIPLE INSCRIPTION OF
                    ROSETTA.</p>
                <p>The block or pillar of black basalt, found by the French in digging up some
                    ground at Rosetta, and now placed in the British Museum, exhibits the remains of
                    three distinct inscriptions; and the last, which is in Greek, ends with the
                    information, that the decree which it contains was ordered to be engraved in
                    three different characters, the sacred letters, the letters of the country, and
                    the Greek. Unfortunately a considerable part of the first inscription is
                    wanting; the beginning of the second, and the end of the third, are also
                    mutilated; we have, therefore, no precise points of coincidence from which we
                    can set out, in our attempts to decipher the unknown characters. The second
                    inscription, which it will be safest to distinguish by the Greek name <hi
                    rend="italic">enchorial,</hi> signifying merely the characters <hi rend="italic"
                    >of the country,</hi> notwithstanding its deficiencies near the beginning, is
                    still sufficiently perfect to allow us to compare its different parts with each
                    other, and with the Greek, by the same method which we should employ if it were
                    entire. Thus, if we examine the parts corresponding, in their relative
                    situation, to two passages of the Greek inscription in which the proper names
                    <hi rend="italic">Alexander</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Alexandria</hi> occur, we
                    soon recognise two well-marked groups of characters resembling each other, which
                    we may therefore consider as representing these names; a remark which was first
                    made by Μ. de Sacy, in his letter relating to this inscription. A small group of
                    characters, occurring very often in almost every line, might be either pome
                    termination, or some very common particle; it must, therefore, be reserved till
                    it be found in some decisive situation, after other words have been identified,
                    and it will then be easily shown to mean <hi rend="italic">and.</hi> The next
                    remarkable collection of characters is repeated twenty-nine or thirty times in
                    the enchorial inscription; and we find nothing which occurs so often in the
                    Greek, except the word <hi rend="italic">hing,</hi> with its compounds, which is
                    found about thirty-seven times. A fourth assemblage of characters is found
                    fourteen times in the enchorial inscription, agreeing sufficiently well in
                    frequency with the name of <hi rend="italic">Ptolemy,</hi> which occurs eleven
                    times in the Greek, and generally in passages corresponding to those of the
                    enchorial text in their relative situation; and, by a similar comparison, the
                    name of <hi rend="italic">Egypt</hi> is identified, although it occurs much more
                    frequently in the enchorial inscription than in the Greek, which often
                    substitutes for it country only, or omits it entirely. Having thus obtained a
                    sufficient number of common points of subdivision, we may next proceed to write
                    the Greek text over the enchorial, in such a manner that the passages
                    ascertained may all coincide as nearly as possible; and it is obvious that the
                    intermediate parts of each inscription will then stand very near to the
                    corresponding passages of the other.</p>
                <p>In this process, it will be necessary to observe that the lines of the enchorial
                    inscription are written from right to left, as, Herodotus tells us, was the
                    custom of the Egyptians; the division of several words and phrases plainly
                    indicating the direction in which they are to be read. It is well known that the
                    distinct hierogiyphical inscriptions, engraved on different monuments, differ in
                    the direction of the corresponding characters. They always face the right or the
                    left of the spectator, according as the principal personages of the tablets to
                    which they belong are looking in the one or the other direction; but where there
                    are no tablets, they almost always look towards the right; and it is easily
                    demonstrable that they must uniformly have been read beginning from the front
                    and proceeding to the rear of each rank. But the Egyptians seem never to have
                    written alternately backwards and forwards, as the most ancient Greeks
                    occasionally did. In both cases, however, the whole of the characters thus
                    employed were completely reversed in the two different modes of using them, as
                    if they were seen in a glass, or printed off like the impression of a seal.</p>
                <p>By pursuing the comparison of the inscriptions thus arranged, we ultimately
                    discover the signification of the greater part of the individual enchorial
                    words; and the result of the investigation leads us to observe some slight
                    differences in the form and order of some parts of the different inscriptions,
                    which are indicated in the conjectural translation published in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Archaeologia</hi> and in the <hi rend="italic">Museum</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Criticum.</hi> The degree of evidence in favour of the supposed
                    signification of each assemblage of characters may be most conveniently
                    appreciated, by arranging them in a lexicoraphical form, according to the words
                    of the translation, the enchorial words themselves not readily admitting a
                    similar arrangement; but the subject is not of sufficient interest for the
                    public to make it necessary that this little lexico should be engraved at
                    length.</p>
                <p>It might naturally have been expected that the final characters of the enchorial
                    inscription, of which the sense is thus determined with tolerable certainty,
                    although the corresponding part of the Greek is wanting, would have immediately
                    led us to a knowledge of the concluding phrase of the distinct hieroglyphical
                    characters, which remains unimpaired. But the agreement between the two
                    conclusions is by no means precise; and the difficulty can only be removed by
                    supposing the <hi rend="italic">hing</hi> to be expressly named in the one,
                    whilst he is only designated by his titles in the other. With this slight
                    variation, and with the knowledge of the singular accident, that the name of
                    Ptolemy occurs three times in a passage of the enchorial inscription, where the
                    Greek has it but twice, we pro-cecd<pb break="no" facs="nls:193643216"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0711-3216-0317"/> to identify this name amongst the sacred
                    characters, •in a form sufficiently conspicuous to have been recognised upon the
                    most superficial examination of the inscriptions, if this total disagreement of
                    the frequency of occurrence had not imposed the condition of a long and
                    laborious investigation, as an indispensable requisite for the solution of so
                    much of the enigma. This step, however, being made good, we obtain from it a
                    tolerably correct scale for the comparative extent of the sacred characters, of
                    which it now appears that almost half of the lines are entirely wanting, whilst
                    those that remain are also much mutilated. Such a scale may also be obtained, in
                    a different manner, by marking, on a straight ruler, the places in which the
                    most characteristic words, such as <hi rend="italic">god, king, priest,</hi> and
                    <hi rend="italic">shrine</hi> occur, in the latter parts of the other
                    inscriptions, at distances proportional to the actual distances from the end;
                    and then trying to find corresponding characters amongst the hieroglyphics of
                    the first inscription, by varying the obliquity of the ruler, so as to
                    correspond to all possible lengths which that inscription can be supposed to
                    have occupied, allowing always a certain latitude for the variations of the
                    comparative lengths of the different phrases and expressions. By these steps it
                    is not very difficult to assure ourselves, that a <hi rend="italic">shrine</hi>
                    and a <hi rend="italic">priest</hi> are denoted by representations which must
                    have been intended for pictures of objects denoted by them; and this appears to
                    be the precise point of the investigation at which it becomes completely
                    demonstrative, and promises a substantial foundation for further inferences. The
                    other terms, <hi rend="italic">god</hi> and <hi rend="italic">king,</hi> are
                    still more easily ascertained, from their situation near the name of
                    Ptolemy.</p>
                <p>The most material points of the three inscriptions having been thus identified,
                    they may all be written side by side; and the sense of the respective characters
                    may be still further investigated, by a minute comparison of the different parts
                    with each other. The last line of the sacred characters, with the corresponding
                    parts of the other inscriptions, which the reader will find represented under
                    the head <hi rend="italic">Specimens of Phrases,</hi> will serve as an
                    illustration of the result which has been obtained from these operations.</p>
                <p>In thus comparing the enchorial with the sacred characters, we find many
                    coincidences in their forms, by far too accurate to be compatible with the
                    supposition that the enchorial could be of a nature purely alphabetical. It is
                    evident, for example, that the enchorial characters for a <hi rend="italic"
                    >diadem,</hi> an <hi rend="italic">asp,</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >everliving,</hi> are immediately borrowed from the sacred. But this coincidence
                    cannot certainly be traced throughout the inscriptions; and it seemed natural to
                    suppose, that alphabetical characters might be interspersed with hieroglyphics,
                    in the same way that the astronomers and chemists of modern times have often
                    employed arbitrary marks, as compendious expressions of the objects which were
                    most frequently to be mentioned in their respective sciences. But no effort,
                    however determined and persevering, had been able to discover any alphabet which
                    could fairly be said to render the inscription, in general, at all like what was
                    required to make its language intelligible Egyptian, although most of the proper
                    names seemed to exhibit a tolerable agreement with the forms of letters
                    indicated by Mr Akerblad; a coincidence, indeed, which might be found in the
                    Chinese, or in any other character not alphabetical, if they employed words of
                    the simplest sounds for writing compound proper names.</p>
                <p>The question, however, respecting the nature of the enchorial character, appears
                    to be satisfactorily decided by a comparison with each other, of various
                    manuscripts or papyri still extant. Several of these, published in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Description de ι</hi><hi rend="italic">Egypte,</hi> have always
                    been considered as specimens of the alphabetical writing of the Egyptians, and
                    certainly have as little appearance of being imitations of visible objects, as
                    any of the characters of this inscription, or as the old Arabic or Syriac
                    characters, to which they bear, at first sight, a considerable resemblance. But
                    they are generally accompanied by tablets, or delineations of certain scenes,
                    consisting .of a few visible objects, either detached, or placed in certain
                    intelligible relations to each other; and we may generally discover traces of
                    some of these objects amongst the characters of the text that accompanies them.
                    A similar correspondence between the text and the tablets is still more readily
                    observable in other manuscripts, written in distinct hieroglyphics, slightly yet
                    not inelegantly traced, in a hand which appears to have been denoted by the term
                    <hi rend="italic">hieratic</hi>, ∙ and by comparing with each other such parts
                    of the text of these manuscripts as stand under tablets of the same kind, we
                    discover, upon a very minute examination, that every character of the distinct
                    hieroglyphics has its corresponding trace in the running hand; sometimes a mere
                    dash or line, but often perfectly distinguishable, as a coarse copy of the
                    original delineation, and always alike when it answers to the same character.
                    The particular passages which establish this identity extend to a series of
                    above ten thousand characters; they have been copied in adjoining lines, and
                    carefully collated with each other; and their number has been increased, by a
                    comparison with some yet unpublished rolls of papyrus. A few specimens from
                    different manuscripts, sufficient to show the forms through which the original
                    representation has passed, in its degradation from the <hi rend="italic"
                    >sacred</hi> character, through the <hi rend="italic">hieratic,</hi> into the
                    <hi rend="italic">epistolographic,</hi> or common running hand of the country,
                    will be found under the head of <hi rend="italic">Comparison of
                    Manuscripts,</hi></p>
                <p>It seems at first sight incomprehensible that this coincidence, or rather
                    correspondence, should not be equally observable in the two inscriptions of the
                    Rosetta stone, which, if the enchorial character is merely a degradation of the
                    sacred, must naturally be supposed to be as much alike as those of the different
                    manuscripts in question; whilst, in reality, we can but seldom trace any very
                    striking analogy between them. But the enchorial character, having long been
                    used in rapid writing, and for the ordinary purposes of life, appears to have
                    become so indistinct in its forms, that it was often necessary to add to it some
                    epithet or synonym, serving to mark the object more distinctly; just as, in
                    speaking Chinese, when the words are translated from written characters into a
                    more limited number of sounds, it is often necessary, on account of the
                    imperfection of the oral language, to add a generic word, in order to determine
                    the signification, and to read, for example, <hi rend="italic">a goose
                    bird,</hi> when <hi rend="italic">a goose</hi> only is written, in order to
                    distinguish it from some other idea implied by a similar sound; and justas in
                    English we might sometimes be obliged to say <hi rend="italic">a yew tree,</hi>
                    ⅛ order to distinguish it from <hi rend="italic">a ewe sheep,</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">you yourself,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">the letter u.</hi> The
                    enchorial character, therefore, though drawn from the same source, can scarcely,
                    in this form, be called the same language with the sacred hieroglyphics, which
                    had probably remained unaltered from the earliest ages, whilst the running hand
                    admitted all the variations of the popular dialects, and bore but a faint
                    resemblance to its original prototype. Indeed, if it had been completely
                    identical, there could have been no propriety in repeating the inscription with
                    so slight a change of form.</p>
                <p>The rituals and hymns contained in the manuscripts which have been mentioned, are
                    probably either of higher antiquity than the inscription of Rosetta, or had
                    preserved a greater purity of character, as having been continually copied from
                    older originals. It is also remarkable, that in one of these rolls of papyrus,
                    engraved by Denon, the introduction is in the sacred character, and some of the
                    <pb break="no" facs="nls:193643229" xml:id="kp-eb0711-3229-0318"/>phrases
                    contained in it may be observed to be repeated in the subsequent part of the
                    manuscript, which is in a kind of running hand, though somewhat less degraded
                    than in most other instances.</p>
                <p>It was not unnatural to hope, that the comparison of these different manuscripts
                    would have assisted us very materially in tracing back all the enchorial
                    characters to the corresponding hieroglyphics, as far as the parts of the
                    respective inscriptions remain entire, and even in filling up the deficiencies
                    of the sacred characters where they are wanting; and something has certainly
                    been gained from it with respect to the names of several of the deities; but, on
                    account of the differences which had crept in between the forms of the language,
                    expressed by the sacred and the cursive characters, the advantage has hitherto
                    been extremely limited. It seems, indeed, to have been a condition inseparable
                    from the whole of this investigation, that its steps should be intricate and
                    laborious, beyond all that could have been imagined from our previous knowledge
                    of the subject; and that, whilst a number of speculative reasoners have
                    persuaded themselves, at different times, that they were able to read through a
                    hieroglyphical inscription in the most satisfactory manner, beginning at either
                    end, as it might happen, the only monument which has afforded us any real
                    foundations for reasoning on the subject, is more calculated to repress than to
                    encourage our hopes of ever becoming complete masters of the ancient literature
                    of Egypt; although it is unquestionably capable of serving as a key to much
                    important information with respect to its history and mythology. Nor is it by
                    any means impossible, that a careful consideration of other monuments already
                    known, or of such as are now discovered from day to day, may enable us to detect
                    a number of unknown characters, so situated with respect to others which are
                    already understood, as to carry with them their own interpretation, supported by
                    a degree of evidence far exceeding mere conjecture.</p>
                <p>IV. RUDIMENTS OF AN HIEROGLYPHICAL VOCABULARY.</p>
                <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Deities.</hi></p>
                <p>1. The word <hi rend="smallcaps">God</hi> is always represented in the
                    inscription of Rosetta, and often in many others, by a character resembling a
                    particular kind of hatchet, which is delineated repeatedly at Medinet-Habou as a
                    weapon in the hands of warriors, and is even found amongst the modern weapons
                    engraved by Denon.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See
                    plate xcv. of Denon’s work. In the figures inserted in the text the
                    representation is for the most part given in the sacred and in the enchorial
                    characters of the Rosetta inscription.</p></note></p>
                <p>This character is frequently exchanged, in parallel passages of different
                    manuscripts, or of the same, for a figure sitting or standing without distinct
                    arms or feet, either with a human head or a hawk’s head; or sometimes, by a
                    deviation from the correct nature of an abstract or general term, with the heads
                    of different animals, according to the character of the deity to whom it is
                    applied. But in the inscription of Rosetta this symbol appears to be exclusively
                    appropriated to the gods in their <hi rend="italic">judicial</hi> capacity; *and
                    it occurs several times in the term meaning <hi rend="italic">lawful,</hi> which
                    will be afterwards explained. This interpretation is also fully justified by the
                    testimony of Plutarch, that “the figures of <hi rend="italic">judges</hi> were
                    represented without hands.”</p>
                <p>2. A <hi rend="smallcaps">Goddess</hi> is denoted by the hatchet or sitting
                    figure, with the addition of the female characteristic, generally as a
                    termination; but sometimes the simple character is applied to gods and soddesses
                    indifferently.</p>
                <p>The semicircle and oblique oval, distinguishing the feminine gender, are
                    observable in almost all well-marked names of females found in different
                    tablets; and the crooked line, which corresponds to them, in the enchorial
                    character of the stone of Rosetta, may be distinguished at the end of each of
                    the five names of females that occur in the inscription. Occasionally the
                    characteristic is prefixed, and this position agrees better with the Coptic τι,
                    which distinguishes a female. Nor must we omit to observe, that a semicircle
                    seems to answer to the τ in some other cases, and is always expressed in the
                    running hand by the character which Mr Akerblad calls τ or D, and which is also
                    exactly the Syriac τ. The asp or basilisk standing erect is a symbol of
                    divinity, which occurs on the green sarcophagus called the tomb of Alexander,
                    and elsewhere, instead of the more ordinary character. In a few instances, the
                    semicircle is found without the oblique oval. The plural, <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Gods,</hi> is formed by repeating the character three times, or by placing
                    three dashes after, or sometimes before it. In the enchorial inscription, the
                    dashes are united into a crooked line, and are placed in this instance both
                    before and after the principal character; but, in general, the second line is
                    straighter than the first. The dual is expressed by a double character only.</p>
                <p>3. A winged globe, sometimes flattened as if intended for an egg, but often
                    coloured red, is very commonly represented as hovering over a hero, and
                    generally occupies the lintel of some of the doors of a temple.</p>
                <p>A globe nearly similar is also sometimes connected with the head and tail of a
                    serpent, bearing the symbol of <hi rend="italic">life,</hi> which is the common
                    characteristic of a deity. There can, therefore, be no objection to considering
                    these representations as belonging to the <hi rend="italic">Agathodaemon,</hi>
                    or <hi rend="italic">Chnuphis</hi> of the Greek authors; and the same symbol is
                    sometimes found in the text of an inscription, in the neighbourhood of the
                    pictural representation. Its sense may therefore be considered as tolerably well
                    ascertained; but the evidence being somewhat indirect, the name is inserted in
                    smaller characters, the same distinction being also observed in other instances.
                    Mr Bruce informs us, in his letter to Mr Wood, that in some parts of the
                    Tunisian dominions, serpents are still regarded as a kind of good angels. The
                    Chnubis, or Chnumis, of the amulets, is generally represented as a serpent with
                    a human head, or with that of a lion; and the former combination is not uncommon
                    in the tablets of the manuscripts; but the hieroglyphic denoting it is a long
                    undulated line, totally distinct from this character.</p>
                <p>4. The symbol, often called the <hi rend="italic">Hieralpha,</hi> or sacred <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">a,</hi> corresponds, in the inscription of Rosetta, to <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Phthah,</hi> or Vulcan, one of the principal deities of the
                    Egyptians.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:193643242" xml:id="kp-eb0711-3242-0319"/>
                <p>A multitude of other sculptures sufficiently prove, that the object intended to
                    be delineated was a plough or hoe; and we are informed by Eusebius, from Plato,
                    that the Egyptian Vulcan was considered as the inventor of instruments of war
                    and of husbandry. In many other inscriptions, the pedestal or pulley is used
                    indifferently for the plough. Horus Apollo tells us, that Vulcan was denoted by
                    a beetle; and the Monticolion obelisk of Kircher has the plough on three sides
                    and the beetle on the fourth. Horus Apollo, however, is seldom perfectly
                    correct; and the names of different divinities are frequently exchanged on the
                    banners of the same obelisk; nor is there any clear instance of such an exchange
                    of the plough for the beetle as occurs perpetually in the case of the pedestal.
                    The beetle is frequently used for the name of a deity whose head either bears a
                    beetle, or is itself in the form of a beetle; and in other instances the beetle
                    has clearly a reference to generation or reproduction, which is a sense
                    attributed to this symbol by all antiquity; so that it may possibly sometimes
                    have been used as a synonym for Phthah, as the father of the gods. The plough is
                    very rarely found as the name of a personage actually represented; and it is
                    difficult to say under what form the Egyptian Vulcan was chiefly worshipped; but
                    on the tablet of a Horus of bad workmanship, belonging to the Borgian Museum, he
                    is exhibited with a hawk’s head, holding a spear; whilst in the great ritual of
                    the <hi rend="italic">Description</hi><hi rend="italic">de l’Egypte</hi> (Antiq.
                    ii. pl. 72, col. 104), he seems to be represented by a figure with a human head;
                    an exchange, however, which is very common in some other cases, with respect to
                    these two personifications, though it does not extend to the substitution of the
                    heads of different animals for each other.</p>
                <p>5. <hi rend="smallcaps">Ammon,</hi> the Egyptian Jupiter, is sufficiently
                    identified by a combination of evidence of various kinds, although no single
                    link of the chain extends very far. A figure with a ram’s head is denoted, both
                    on the green sarcophagus and on the temple at Elephantine, by a water jar,
                    sometimes, but not always, accompanied by a bird.</p>
                <p>Now, a water jar of this form is constantly converted, in the running hand of the
                    manuscripţs, into a character like a z; and this character, in the enchorial
                    text of Rosetta, is made to express the name of Jupiter; a fact which confirms
                    the testimony of the Greek authors, who considered the Egyptian Jupiter as
                    having been represented with a ram’s head. A similar figure is found at Edfou
                    <hi rend="italic">(Apol-linopolis Magna),</hi> and at Esnch <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Latopolis).</hi> The temple at Edfou seems to have been dedicated by Amenophis
                    or Memnon; and he appears to be called “lover of Ammon,” that is, <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Miamun,</hi><note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Or rather <hi rend="smallcaps">Meiamun,</hi> which is more
                    like Memnon, and may also mean “beloved of Ammon.”</p></note> which is not
                    unlike the name <hi rend="smallcaps">Memnon.</hi></p>
                <p>6. The common astronomical diagram for the sun, Q, seems to have been adopted by
                    the Latin astrologers from their masters in Egypt; since it is not very probable
                    that both should have employed a point in the centre of the circle, without some
                    communication with each other, the circle alone having been mentioned by some of
                    the Greek authors, who say that it was the symbol of the sun.</p>
                <p>The deity <hi rend="smallcaps">Ra, Re,</hi> or <hi rend="smallcaps">Ph re,</hi>
                    is indicated by this character followed by an upright bar; and the circle is
                    often enveloped in the coil of the body of a serpent, whilst an oval and an arm
                    also frequently follow the circle. The encho <hi rend="subscript"> τ</hi> rial
                    name of the sun is extremely like that which corresponds in the manuscripts to
                    this hieroglyphic. And a similar circle, with rays diverging from it, though
                    seldom exactly in straight lines, is used in the sense of “enlightening,” or
                    “rendering illustrious ;” and it has also been observed by some of the French,
                    who have been in Egypt, to stand in several inscriptions with a manifest
                    reference to light. The circle occurs also as a part of the terms month and day.
                    In the great Hieratic Ritual, and in some other manuscripts, this name of Phré
                    occurs very frequently under or near the tablet which contains a representation
                    of the sun shining, as well as under the next to it, which exhibits a head
                    rising out of a lotus, an emblem mentioned by Plutarch as relating to the sun,
                    which here is made to spring from the pedestal, as the sun is said to have been
                    the offspring of Phthah. Whatever plant that called the lotus may have been, it
                    certainly does not much resemble the nelumbo of the East, which some imagine to
                    have been the original emblem of fertility. The name Phré is almost the only
                    intelligible combination of letters that ever occurs on the Abraxas<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The word <hi rend="italic"

                    in the manuscripts exhibit also little genii worshipping him, each of which is
                    always marked “star god.”</p>
                <p>7. The name of <hi rend="smallcaps">Rhea</hi> may, without impropriety, be
                    assigned to a female personage very commonly accompanying the sun, and
                    distinguished by many of his attributes, thus: although the evidence would have
                    been somewhat more conclusive if the name had been found attached to the figure
                    of the mother in the tablet of the birth of Isis. On the coffins of the mummies,
                    this personage is generally represented with outstretched wings, and in other
                    tablets without wings; but she carries in both cases a circle on her head,
                    emblematic of the sun. If we considered the analogy of the hieroglyphical name
                    only, we should be disposed to interpret it as meaning the wife or sister of
                    Ammon.</p>
                <p>8. <hi rend="smallcaps">Ioh,</hi> the moon, is not a deity of very frequent
                    occurrence; but the character is easily interpreted, both from its form, and
                    from its being found in a different position, as a part of the word month. , <pb

                    character is accompanied by the epithet God, and without any female termination,
                    as well as in several passages of an epistolographic manuscript sent home by Mr
                    Bankes; a circumstance which is favourable to the opinion that Ioh was
                    considered as masculine in mythology as well as in grammar, just as <hi
                    rend="italic">men</hi> or <hi rend="italic">lunus</hi> was sometimes made
                    masculine by the Greeks and Romans. The fact, however, is not absolutely
                    decisive of this question, since the character is not accompanied by the
                    delineation of any personification of the deity.</p>
                <p>9. The historical description of the god <hi rend="smallcaps">Thoth,</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">Hermes,</hi> as the scribe or secretary of Osiris, and the
                    inventor of writing, sufficiently identifies him with the person who is
                    perpetually represented standing before Osiris, and writing with a quill or a
                    style on a square or oblong tablet. He has always the head of an ibis, and this
                    bird, standing on a perch, constitutes his hieroglyphical name, as the ibis is
                    known to have been the emblem of Thoth. The hieroglyphic for letters is also
                    frequently found amongst his titles; and all these circumstances abundantly
                    confirm the opinion of his true character, which Zoega and others had already
                    advanced from conjecture only.</p>
                <p>The enchorial name is very much disfigured, but the manuscripts exhibit a
                    character which may serve to supply the connecting link, and another abridgment
                    of the name which deviates still more widely from the original, being simply the
                    common substitute for a feather, which here seems to stand for the whole bird,
                    or perhaps merely for a feather which is often found projecting from the end of
                    the perch. Next to Osiris, we find that Thoth is of more frequent occurrence
                    than any other deity in the great ritual; and it is probable that the mummies of
                    the ibis, which are so commonly found, were preserved in honour of him. The
                    semicircle with two oblique dashes, under the perch, seems to correspond to the
                    epithet “great and great” of the Rosetta inscription; this character being
                    generally significative of a dual. The scale, with eight dashes, and two other
                    characters, is also very frequently employed as an epithet, and sometimes as a
                    synonym of Thoth; it seems to mean “Dispenser of the eight treasures, or laws,
                    of the country,” for Diodorus informs us that the principal laws of Egypt w⅛rc
                    contained in eight books.</p>
                <p>10. The name of <hi rend="smallcaps">Osiris</hi> is found, with the epithet
                    “divine,” in a great majority of all the mythological inscriptions that have yet
                    been discovered; so that this circumstance alone is sufficient to show that it
                    must have been that of the principal deity of Egypt.</p>
                <p>The enchorial character of the inscription of Rosetta is readily identified, and
                    it agrees perfectly well with that of the manuscripts, answering to the eye and
                    the throne; so that the manuscripts here completely supply the want of that part
                    of the stone which contained the name in the sacred characters. This name is
                    also universally annexed to the great figure which is found at the end of almost
                    all the manuscripts, and on the coffins of mummies, holding a hook and a whip or
                    fan, and of which the small detached images are also extremely common. «In the
                    sculptured inscriptions, the eye generally precedes the throne; in the running
                    hand of the manuscripts, and on the coffins of some mummies, apparently of later
                    date, the eye sometimes follows. Plutarch had perhaps been rightly informed
                    respecting this character; but by a mistake, which was easily committed from a
                    want of perfect recollection, he has called it ' “an eye and a sceptre ;” and
                    this combination has not been recognised as the name of a deity, though a symbol
                    something like it occurs in some of the tablets. The pictured delineation of
                    Osiris has indifferently a human head or that of a hawk, but never that of any
                    other animal. The tear seems also sometimes to have been used as an emblem of
                    Osiris, as well as of Apis and Mneuis, who were considered as representations of
                    him. The name is found perpetually on monuments of all kinds as an epithet of a
                    departed person; and this is one great reason of the frequency of its
                    occurrence.</p>
                <p>11. This divinity, the Apollo of the Egyptian mythology, is sufficiently
                    identified by the comparison of various inscriptions with the fragment of
                    Hermapion, preserved by Ammianus Marcellinus, as the translation of the
                    inscription on a particular obelisk, with which, however, it does not exactly
                    agree, although its style completely resembles that of the Egyptian inscriptions
                    in general, and the beginning corresponds perfectly well to the beginning of
                    almost all the obelisks in existence, supposing only the hawk to be part of the
                    name of Arueris; which is, besides, an inference extremely probable, from the
                    tablets of several of the obelisks, representing a deity characterised by a hawk
                    with two bars, and styled the son of another personage who seems to be the sun,
                    as Apollo is called by Hermapion, and Arueris by Plutarch. Mr Hamilton has also
                    given us a Greek inscription at Ombos, in which Arueris is made synonymous with
                    Apollo; although the hieroglyphics which have been copied from this temple
                    afford us no assistance in the inquiry. The sort of ladder, which occurs as a
                    second name of Arueris, is found prefixed to the hawk in its usual form, on the
                    obelisk at Wanstead figured by Gordon, and on the frize of Montagu and Ficooni
                    <hi rend="italic">(Hieroglyphics of the Egyptian Society,</hi> 7 Eo p; 9 Lk);
                    and the same figure follows it on a statue of Pococke (vol. i. p. 212). Arueris
                    is commonly represented either with a human head, or with that of a hawk,
                    bearing a disc, as that of the sun is also generally depicted; and in one of
                    Denon’s plates, the two deities seem in some measure confounded. The Egyptian
                    name may be interpreted “evening sun,* as emblematic of the repose of victory;
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">er ruhi re.</hi></p>
                <p>12. Isis, the sister and wife of Osiris, is very naturally denoted by the throne
                    with the female termination, thus: and in more than one instance, the female
                    figures, which have long been recognised as representations of Isis by other
                    attributes, are distinguished by bearing the throne on the head, which is a
                    .common mode of characterising the different personages of the tablets. The
                    manuscripts, again, enable us to discover the connecting link between the sacred
                    and enchorial characters, and to supply the defects of the monument of Rosetta;
                    though the resemblance is somewhat too imperfect to have satisfied us without
                    their assistance. The goddess, thus distinguished, is very generally represented
                    as standing at the head or feet of a corpse, with another female figure opposite
                    to her; and we find the same personages at the opposite ends of several of the
                    sarcophagi; so that the analogy of Isis to Proserpine, and her character as the
                    guardian of the remains of the dead, are sufficiently consistent with these
                    representations. On a scaraboeus brought from Egypt by Mr Legh, and in a
                    hieroglyphical inscription at Philae, she appears<pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193643268" xml:id="kp-eb0711-3268-0321"/> to be called the offspring
                    of Phthah. Isis often bears in her hand a sceptre forked at the foot, with a
                    lotus for its head, whilst Osiris has more commonly a similar sceptre with the
                    head of an animal; but these attributes are sometimes assigned to other deities.
                    In one of the boats on the green sarcophagus, and on Letheuillier’s mummy, both
                    in the British Museum, she is personified as a basilisk. Mr Hamilton has
                    published some Greek inscriptions from Philae, and from the small temple at
                    Denderah, which show that Isis was the principal deity of these temples; and the
                    hieroglyphics, as far as they have been copied, are precisely of the same
                    import. The great temple at Karnak seems also to have been dedicated to Isis,
                    and probably the small southern temple. On a medal, of Greek workmanship, in the
                    Borgian Museum, we have a figure of Isis, with the word <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >thesi,</hi> which may probably have been intended for <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >tiesi,</hi> the Egyptian name with the feminine article.</p>
                <p>13. The constant companion of Isis can be no other than <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Nephthe.</hi></p>
                <p>Her name somewhat resembles that of Isis, with a scale or basin annexed to it;
                    but the square surrounding the throne is completed, while the scale is sometimes
                    detached from it, with a circle interposed; and, in this form, the name
                    comprehends one of the characters denoting a temple. It seems also to be a head
                    of Nephthe that is found at Denderah and elsewhere, supporting a little temple
                    or shrine, in the place of the capital of a column; nor is it improbable that
                    the temple at Denderah was dedicated to Nephthe; for the Greek inscription has
                    Aphrodite, which is mentioned by Plutarch as a synonym of Nephthe. It is true
                    that the birth of Isis is represented on one of the ceilings; but it does not
                    therefore follow that Isis was the principal goddess of the temple. A head
                    bearing a shrine is not an uncommon ornament of <hi rend="italic">a
                    sistrum</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and this agrees perfectly with the remark
                    of Plutarch, that the head of Nephthe, as well as that of Isis, was sometimes
                    represented on these instruments.</p>
                <p>14. The emblem of a bird in a cage, which is often found in the manuscripts
                    accompanied by the figure of achild, seems to indicate the character of a <hi
                    rend="italic">nurse,</hi> and may without inconvenience be interpreted as
                    relating to the goddess Buro, the nurse of Horus and Bubastis; though it would
                    perhaps have been more correct to engrave the name in smaller letters, as
                    denoting some degree of uncertainty. On the sarcophagus called the Lover’s
                    Fountain, in the British Museum, she is delineated with a hawk’s head; and in
                    the western temple at Philae she has a human head with a horned head-dress, and
                    she sits near Isis and Horus; a circumstance which strongly confirms the
                    propriety of the denomination.</p>
                <p>15. The enchorial name of <hi rend="smallcaps">Horus</hi> seems to be derived
                    from the figure of a hawk followed by the character denoting Isis; an
                    arrangement which agrees very well with the supposition that his usual
                    denomination was <hi rend="smallcaps">hôrsiesi.</hi></p>
                <p>The figure of the infant, the chain, and the knot, clearly form a part of the
                    name on a Horus engraved by Montfaucon <hi rend="italic">(Antiq. Expliq.</hi>
                    tom. ii. p. 302), and on an obelisk from Bose in the Supplement of the same
                    work. In some cases a feather, following the infant, seems to supply the place
                    of the bird, as in Cavlus <hi rend="italic">CPAcueih</hi> tom. iv. pl. 13).</p>
                <p>16. <hi rend="smallcaps">Paamyles,</hi> mentioned by several authors as the
                    Priapus of Egypt, is sufficiently distinguishable by his usual attributes. He is
                    often figured with one hand only, which is elevated towards the angle of a kind
                    of whip or fan suspended above him. At Edfou he is once denoted in an
                    inscription by a figure like that of the tablets; and in another place by a
                    distinct name, much resembling that of a female deity, found on some of the
                    cases of the mummies, and who might consequently be called <hi rend="italic"
                    >Paamylia.</hi></p>
                <p>17. The Nile seems to have been reckoned amongst the deities of Egypt, and the
                    character which appears to be appropriate to a river is found occasionally in
                    the tablets, followed by a vessel and a spiral, which seem indeed to make a part
                    of the name, and are accompanied by epithets of respect. This character has
                    already been considered by Kircher and others as representing a nilometer; and
                    the deity in question can only be distinguished by the name <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Nilus.</hi></p>
                <p>18. The sacred characters denoting <hi rend="smallcaps">Apis</hi> are pretty
                    clearly determined by the triple inscription; the enchorial name is perfectly
                    so.</p>
                <p>If, however, any doubt remained on the subject, it would be removed by an
                    examination of the inscriptions on four vases, found by Paul Lucas (<hi
                    rend="italic">Voyage</hi><hi rend="italic">dans la Turquie,</hi> vol. i. p. 346,
                    Amsterdam, 1720, in 2 vols. 12mo) at Abousir, the Busiris of the ancients; that
                    is, the <hi rend="smallcaps">be oshiri,</hi> or sepulchre of Osiris, as Diodorus
                    very properly translates it. There is a received tradition that Apis was
                    worshipped and buried here; and Lucas established its truth by finding the mummy
                    of a bullock in the catacombs. Now, all the inscriptions on the vases end with a
                    bullock preceded by this character, though the angles are turned in a different
                    direction from those of the inscription of Rosetta; so that the two forms of the
                    character seem to have been used indifferently. With this latitude, we have no
                    difficulty in identifying the name as it occurs in almost every line of the
                    inscriptions upon the great sarcophagus of granite, called the Lover’s Fountain,
                    formerly at Cairo, and now in the British Museum. There is some reason to
                    suppose, from the frequency of this name, that it may have been intended for
                    receiving a mummy of the bull Apis; although it must be confessed, that in
                    several other monuments the names of the deities are introduced in a manner
                    somewhat similar, with an evident relation to the designation of some human
                    being, whom they are intended to commemorate.</p>
                <p>19. The enchorial name of <hi rend="smallcaps">Mneuis</hi> is very completely
                    ascertained by the inscription of Rosetta; and from a comparison of different
                    passages in the manuscripts, there is reason to infer that it was intended as an
                    imperfect representation of a basilisk and a tear; emblems which are repeatedly
                    found in the great ritual, connected with the figure of a bullock. The sacred
                    cow, in the manuscripts sent home by Mr Bankes, is denoted by a serpentine line
                    with two dots, followed by the term goddess. We may venture to distinguish her
                    by the temporary name <hi rend="italic">Damalis.</hi> That of Io would imply too
                    great identity with the Greek mvtholocrv.</p>

                <p>20. In the tablets representing the judgment of the deceased, we generally find
                    two personages standing by the balance, and apparently weighing his merits; one
                    with the head of a hawk, the other with that of a wolf, and seeming to officiate
                    as the good and evil genius of the person. The former, denoted by a hawk with a
                    bar, and sometimes also a spear, appears, from various monuments, to have some
                    relation to the Sun or to Horus, and may therefore be called <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Hyperion</hi>; the latter is often observed to be employed in
                    the preparation of a mummy, and may be called from this occupation <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Cteristes,</hi> or the embalmer. He is also frequently
                    represented on the coffins of mummies, and elsewhere, under the form of a wolf
                    sitting on a kind of altar; and he seems to be an immediate minister of Osiris.
                    His hieroglyphical name is a feather, a wavy line, and a block; or a hatchet
                    under a sort of arch.</p>
                <p>21. Under the bier on which a mummy lies, āħd in many other situations near the
                    person of the deceased, we find representations of four deities who seem to be
                    concerned in the operation of embalming, and who might even be supposed to
                    preside over the different condiments employed, their heads frequently serving
                    as covers for four jars, of the kind sometimes called Canopi. They may also very
                    properly be considered as attendants of Isis, who seems to be a still more
                    important personage on such occasions. The first of the four has generally a
                    human head, and may be called <hi rend="smallcaps">Tetrarcha</hi>; his name
                    contains a sort of forceps, and a brokendine. The second and third have
                    respectively the heads of a dog or baboon, and of a wolf; and they agree very
                    satisfactorily with the well-known character of <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Anubis,</hi> and with that of <hi rend="smallcaps">Macedo</hi> his companion,
                    mentioned by Diodorus as having a wolf’s head, and whose name may possibly have
                    some relation to <hi rend="smallcaps">manchat,</hi><hi rend="italic">a worker in
                    silver,</hi> as that of Anubis has to <hi rend="smallcaps">nub,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">gold.</hi> The hieroglyphic name of Anubis differs from that of
                    Apis only in having the angles directed immediately upwards, a circumstance
                    which is not so indifferent to the signification as it at first appeared; that
                    of Macedo has a vulture with a star, and sometimes an arm instead of the
                    vulture. The fourth of these deities is represented with the head of a hawk, and
                    may therefore be called <hi rend="smallcaps">Hieracion.</hi> He is denoted by a
                    water jar, with three plants somewhat resembling leeks or onions.</p>
                <p>22. Amongst the many hundreds of deities who are represented in various
                    inscriptions and sculptures, some of the most remarkable are two personages with
                    the heads of wolves, the first characterised by a sort of raised frame or
                    banner, and a pair of horns, which may be expressed by the pseudonymous or
                    temporary term <hi rend="smallcaps">Cerexochus,</hi> and the second by a half
                    bow, and a sword or knife, whence he may be called <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Bioxiphus</hi>; a figure with a human head, generally wearing a feather on it,
                    and denoted by a broad feather reversed, which is implied in the name <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Platypterus</hi>; another wearing a cap with a whip in it, who
                    may be called <hi rend="smallcaps">Mastigias</hi>; and a fifth in the form of a
                    female, distinguished by a bier, who, at Edfou, bears a tear on her head, and
                    who may be called <hi rend="smallcaps">Soraea.</hi></p>
                <p>1. We are informed by Pliny, that the Alexandrian obelisk was erected by Mesphres
                    or Mestires, the reading of the different manuscripts being different; and since
                    no king of the name Mestires is mentioned by other authors, we may consider <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Mesphres</hi> as the Mephres or Mesphris who succeeded his
                    mother Amersis about 1700 B. c. or perhaps a century or two later. The
                    hieroglyphical name of his father contains that of the god Thoth, and may
                    therefore possibly have been intended for the <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Thothmosis</hi> of the chronologers, who is said to have been the grandfather
                    of Mesphres. The obelisk at Alexandria, now called Cleopatra’s Needle, like
                    almost all others which contain three lines on each side, exhibits different
                    names in the middle and the outer lines. From this circumstance, as well as from
                    the greater depth of the sculptures, which is generally observable in the middle
                    line, there is reason to suppose that this line stood at first alone, and that
                    the two on each side were added by a later monarch. The Lateran obelisk,
                    however, is remarkable for exhibiting the name of Mesphres on all the lines of
                    the different sides. The Constantinopolitan obelisk has only one line on each
                    side, with the name of Mesphres the son of Thothmosis. The same name is also
                    found on the gateway of the fifth catacomb, at Biban-el∙ Molouk; on a pillar of
                    the palace at Karnak, and in a splendidly-coloured bas-relief on one of the
                    interior architraves of the gallery; as well as on a seal of Denon, and on some
                    others which were brought from Egypt by Mr Legh. The Isean obelisk of Kircher
                    has a “son of Mesphres, favoured by Phthah we must therefore distinguish this
                    king by the name <hi rend="smallcaps">Misphragmuthosis,</hi> who is recorded as
                    the son and successor of Mesphres.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:193643294" xml:id="kp-eb0711-3294-0323"/>
                <p>2. A multitude of ancient Greek inscriptions identify the statue of Memnon,
                    celebrated by all antiquity for its musical powers, which, Strabo says, he heard
                    exemplified, though he could not very positively decide whether the sound
                    proceeded from the statue or from some of the bystanders. In one of the
                    inscriptions we find the word <hi rend="italic">Phamenoth,</hi> not as a date,
                    but as a synonym of Memnon, which must be considered as identical with the
                    Phamenoph given by Pausanias as his Egyptian name, and with the Ammenoph or
                    Amenophis of Manetho or others, which differs from it only as wanting the
                    article. There is, however, some doubt to which Amenophis this statue properly
                    belongs. Manetho makes Memnon the eighth king of the eighteenth dynasty, who may
                    be called Amenophis the Second; but Marsham brings him down to the Ammenephthes
                    of Manetho, or Amenophis the Fourth, principally because he thinks that only a
                    successor of Sesostris could have been well known in Asia; and he even supposes
                    him to have been later than Homer, who, he says, never mentions him, though
                    Hesiod calls him the son of Tithonus and Aurora. But, in fact, the name of
                    Memnon does occur in the Odyssey, where Ulysses alludes to his beauty in a
                    conversation with the shade of Achilles; and Hesiod could scarcely have
                    mentioned a king as descended from a deity, that was not considerably earlier
                    than his own time; so that the tradition of Manetho seems to be preferable to
                    the mere conjecture of Marsham. At the same time, we cannot well call him Memnon
                    the son of Thothmosis, the name of the father not agreeing with that of this
                    king; and there is another circumstance which seems to lead us to the third
                    Amenophis, intermediate between these two extremes, who was the son of Ramesses
                    Meiamun, or Ramesses the lover of Ammon; namely, that Amenophis himself appears
                    to have built a temple to Ammon in the isle of Elephantine, and is called
                    Meiamun in several of the hieroglyphical inscriptions still existing there. It
                    appears, then, that the name Memnon must have been derived from Meiamun. Besides
                    the different statues of the Memnonium, we find monuments of the same personage
                    in almost every part of Egypt, though they are much more frequent at Thebes and
                    in its neighbourhood. The name is marked on all the lion-headed goddesses of
                    black granite which are now in the British Museum, and on some others which were
                    in the possession of Mr Bankes. The first of this series having been purchased,
                    as Bruce informs us, for a large price, by Donati, for the king of Sardinia, the
                    inhabitants were induced to take some pains in digging the others out of the
                    sand. The building called by the French the tomb of Osymandyas bears also the
                    name of Memnon; and it is remarked by Strabo, that Memnon and Ismendes may
                    probably have been the same person. The name is also found in the grottos at
                    Biban-el-Molouk, on some statues representing Osiris, and in some inscriptions
                    at Ombos, as well as on a seal of Denon. Mr Bullock presented to the British
                    Museum a scaraboeus of very hard stone, on which we find the name of Memnon,
                    together with that of his father and mother, whom we may call, in order to
                    preserve the mythological analogy, <hi rend="italic">Tithous</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">Boa,</hi> although without asserting that this Tithous was the
                    builder of the Labyrinth, which some authors have attributed to a king named
                    Tithoes, and others to Ismendes. The mother’s name occurs also alone, as “the
                    goddess mother,” on the back of a beetle in Gordon’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Mummies</hi> (plate xxii.), a circumstance which removes the doubt that might
                    otherwise arise from the want of the female termination in the name; the
                    father’s is found upon a square seal in the possession of Mr Legh. There is
                    another copy of the inscription of Mr Bullock’s scaraboeus, on a scaraboeus
                    belonging to Mr Palin, which had long been used by a Greek priest at Athens for
                    stamping the paschal bread (Dubois, <hi rend="italic">Pierres Gravées,</hi>
                    Paris, 1817, pl. v. N. 5). The beautiful head brought from the Memnonium to the
                    British Museum has only a part of the father’s name remaining, which does not
                    appear to be that of the father of Memnon, though the first three characters are
                    the same; but the fourth is the pedestal representing Phthah; and a similar name
                    is found on some other colossal statues and obelisks remaining in Egypt, as well
                    as on a smaller figure of red granite brought by Mr Hamilton from Elephantine.
                    In the principal name upon the obelisk at Karnak, the final scale of the name of
                    Memnon is exchanged for a pair of arms stretched upwards; a variation which may
                    be expressed by calling it Amenuses or <hi rend="italic">Amenses,</hi> from <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">shesh,</hi> a pair. The father’s name is also a little like
                    that of Tithous; but, that the difference is constant, may be inferred from its
                    separate occurrence on a seal brought home by Mr Legh, a lion’s head making a
                    part of it in both instances. The true name and date of this personage must be
                    considered as wholly unknown; though the resemblance of the name to Memnon makes
                    it convenient to place them together. In Mr Boughton’s minute golden image,
                    engraved in the <hi rend="italic">Archoeologia,</hi> the name appears to be the
                    same, but with the synonymous substitution of the hatchet for the judge.</p>
                <p>3. The obelisk at Heliopolis has every mark of considerable antiquity, and the
                    shortness and simplicity of its inscription is appropriate to a remote period.
                    Pliny says that Mitres or Mestires first erected obelisks at Heliopolis; he also
                    mentions Sothis, and apparently Ramesses, as having left similar monuments of
                    their magnificence in the same place. The principal name upon the obelisk now
                    remaining at Matareah may also be observed in several other inscriptions, but
                    with the substitution of two other names for that of the father, so that the
                    name of the son must probably have belonged to many different individuals. This
                    circumstance, as well as the sounds belonging to the different characters,
                    agrees very well with Ramesses; for we have <hi rend="smallcaps">re,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">the sun,</hi> and <hi rend="smallcaps">mes,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >a birth,</hi> and <hi rend="smallcaps">shesh,</hi><hi rend="italic">a
                    pair,</hi> so that we may venture to call it <hi rend="smallcaps">Remesses</hi>;
                    and we may take <hi rend="smallcaps">Heron</hi> for the father of the first
                    Remesses, from Hermapion, though it is possible that he may be the Armais of
                    Manetho; but we have scarcely sufficient evidence to appropriate to him that
                    name. Another Ramesses seems to have been a son of Sesostris; a third Ramesses
                    follows Ammenephthes in Manetho, and agrees with the Rhampsinitus of Herodotus,
                    and the Remphis of Diodorus, who is mentioned as the successor of Proteus; and
                    this may, perhaps, have been the Ramesses of the frizes of Montagu and Ficooni
                    <hi rend="italic">(Hieroglyphics,</hi> 7 Ou. 9 If), who seems, from the
                    resemblance of the different parts of the work, to have been nearly contemporary
                    with Sesostris. <hi rend="italic">(Hieroglyphics,</hi> 7 H. I.) There is also on
                    the Lions at the fountain of Aqua Felice, near the baths of Diocletian at Rome,
                    another Ramesses, the name of whose father is a little like the name supposed to
                    belong to Arsinoe.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:193643307" xml:id="kp-eb0711-3307-0324"/>
                <p>4. The obelisk erected by Augustus in the Campus Martius is said, by Pliny, to
                    have been the work of Sesostris; and there are sufficient documents of its
                    identity with that which had long remained buried near the Monte Citorio, and of
                    which figures have been given by Zoega and others. The inscription was supposed,
                    in the time of Pliny, to contain a compendium of the physical and philosophical
                    learning of the Egyptians; but, in order to make this opinion credible, it would
                    be necessary to admit that the princes of earlier days entertained very
                    different ideas from those which have since been prevalent respecting the
                    comparative importance of the abstract sciences, and of national prosperity and
                    martial glory. II Sesostris was the son of Amenophis, he cannot have been the
                    reigning king mentioned in this obelisk. But it may safely be attributed to <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Pheron</hi> the son of Sesostris, who, according to Herodotus,
                    erected two obelisks; and the occurrence of the name of Sesostris as the father
                    may be considered as sufficiently conformable to the testimony of Pliny. The
                    same names are found, with a slight variation, on a small statue of basalt, very
                    highly finished, now standing in the British Museum; and Denon has copied them
                    from an inscription in the Memnonium.</p>
                <p>5. <hi rend="smallcaps">Nuncoreus,</hi> according to Diodorus, was another son of
                    Sesostris; his name occurs also in Pliny, and we may consider him as the son of
                    Sesostris mentioned in Montagu s frizes. The name is also found at Philae, and,
                    with a slight variation, on an altar of basalt figured by Caylus <hi
                    rend="italic">{Recueil,</hi> tom. i. plate xix.), now in the King’s Library at
                    Pans. The remains of the same name may also be observed on a block, apparently
                    of white sandstone, in the British Museum, which is figured by Norden, in its
                    old situation, as a part of the foundations of Pompey’s Pillar at Alexandria;
                    and it occurs on a fragment of a statue brought by Mr Hamilton from Thebes. The
                    name of <hi rend="smallcaps">Proteus,</hi> or Certus, otherwise Ammenephthes, is
                    only known as the predecessor of one of the kings named Ramesses; and we may
                    safely employ it for the father of the Ramesses of the frizes of Montagu and
                    Ficooni, the whole of which are remarkable for the excellence of their
                    workmanship.</p>
                <p>6. Until we obtain evidence of a more positive nature, we may give to the two
                    kings mentioned on the sarcophagus of green breccia the names of <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Amenophthes</hi> and <hi rend="smallcaps">Anysis,</hi>
                    supposing them to have lived about the time of Ammenephthes, or Amenophis the
                    Fifth, and his successor Osorchon. The fathers name might, without difficulty,
                    be read Me- oephthah, supposing some titles to follow it-There are also tvo
                    obelisks of the same king, brought from Cairo, which stand near the sarcophagus
                    in the British Museum; and the style of the workmanship somewhat resembles that
                    of the times of Sesostris and his immediate successors. It has been observed
                    that neither of the names can well be Alexander’s, since that of the father is
                    repeated much more frequently than that of the son, which could not have
                    happened if it had been meant for Philip; and Alexander had no son who could
                    have been mentioned on his sarcophagus. Nor is it at all probable that Alexander
                    should have erected any obelisks at Memphis or in its neighbourhood. The god
                    Ammon is nowhere mentioned amongst the titles of the king, and holds only an
                    inferior rank among the innumerable deities represented in the tablets. We find
                    both the names, without any addition, on a dovetail of copper (engraved in Lord
                    Valentia’s <hi rend="italic">Travels),</hi> which was found at Behbeit, the
                    Atarbechis or Aphroditopolis of the ancients, situated on the branch of the Nile
                    that runs to Damietta.</p>
                <p>7. We learn from Pliny that the Flaminian obelisk now standing near the Porta del
                    Popolo at Rome, which was the smaller of the two formerly in the Circus Maximus,
                    where they were placed by Augustus, and used as the gnomon of a dial, was the
                    work of Senneserteus or Semnesyr-taeus, who reigned in Egypt at the time when
                    Fythagoras visited it. This king seems to have been the same with Psamuthis or
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">Psammis</hi>; and the authority of the evidence is so much
                    the stronger, as the period in question is not extremely remote. The father of
                    Psammis, according to Herodotus, was Necos or <hi rend="smallcaps">Nechao.</hi>
                    The two names occur on all the middle lines of the obelisk; and that of the
                    father on the pillar of a colossal Isis in the <hi rend="italic">Supplement</hi>
                    of Montfaucon. The Sallustian obelisk, which seems to have been partly copied
                    from the Flaminian, has them both. In the middle lines of both the obelisks at
                    Luxor we find a name much resembling that of Psamm’s, which we may therefore
                    call <hi rend="smallcaps">Psammetius,</hi> conjecturing that it may have
                    belonged to Psammetichus, who reigned a little earlier. The father’s name is not
                    unlike in its import to that of Nechao, both implying <hi rend="italic">approved
                    by Phthah</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and it is remarkable, that in Manetho’s
                    series, the predecessor of Psammetichus is also Nechao.</p>
                <p>8. Amongst the most common of all the names of the kings of Egypt, on a great
                    variety of monuments, are those which were n istaken by Kircher for a sort of
                    amulets or charms, which he denominated the Mophthomendesian tablets. They occur
                    alone on three small obelisks only, the Medicean, the Mahutean, and the
                    Monticolian of Kircher; but they are found in the external lines of the
                    Alexandrian, the two at Luxor, the Flaminian, and the Sallustian, whilst none
                    are ever found exterior to them. They must, therefore, necessarily be attributed
                    to one of the latest kings of Egypt; and there is none so likely to have made
                    such a display as <hi rend="smallcaps">Amasis,</hi> a man of considerable
                    magnificence, and at the same time of a cautious and artful character. Indeed we
                    have no alternative left but to choose between him and some of the kings who
                    revolted against the Persians, and who do not appear so likely to have had <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193643320" xml:id="kp-eb0711-3320-0325"/> leisure or
                    finances for public works of splendour. His father’s name, like that of Nechao,
                    contains the character denoting Vulcan, and it may be called <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Menephthes</hi>; but he was not the son of a king. Both the
                    names are found in one of the middle lines of the Flaminian obelisk; and on that
                    side the king is represented in the tablet as doing homage to his predecessor,
                    who occupies the place of honour on the other side. The father’s name seems to
                    occur on the belt of a colossal statue in the palace at Karnak. On a fragment of
                    stone in the British Museum the names are repeated in various directions, as if
                    it had belonged to a floor or a ceiling. They also occur on a statue,
                    considerably mutilated, in the attitude of kneeling; and in Montfaucon’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Supplement,</hi> on the back of a colossal Isis, which seems also
                    to have been begun by Psammis. On the eastern colossus at Luxor there is a name
                    which might be taken either for that of Amasis or for that of the pseudonymous
                    Psammetius; but the sitting figure is somewhat different. The victor in the
                    naval combat at Medinet-Habou, who appears also frequently at Ombos,
                    considerably resembles them both. Lord Mountnorris has a rough seal with the
                    name of Amasis only, the epithet God being prefixed in a smaller character. The
                    names also occur on a small obelisk lying at Tsan, the ancient Tanis, of which a
                    sketch was brought home by Dr Merion.</p>
                <p>9. We find at Karnak the name of a king somewhat like Psammis, that of his father
                    resembling a compound of Ptolemy and Berenice. Perhaps they are not very
                    correctly copied, but they may stand, under the temporary names of <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Discozygus</hi> and <hi rend="smallcaps">Ptoleberius,</hi> as
                    specimens, somewhat singular, of a mixture of different dynastics; and in this
                    point of view they may be placed between the old Egyptian kings and their
                    Grecian conquerors.</p>
                <p>10. The name of <hi rend="smallcaps">Alexander</hi> has not yet been identified
                    in the sacred characters;<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>The name of Alexander has now been several times identified in the sacred
                    characters or hieroglyphics. It occurs on the edifices of Karnak, where it is
                    written <hi rend="smallcaps">AΛKΣΛntp∑</hi> and ΑΛΚΣΝΡΟΣ. (Champollion, <hi
                    rend="italic">Précis</hi><hi rend="italic">du Sysi. Hiiτοgh.</hi> p. 84. Paris,
                    1828.) We also learn from Mr Salt, that, besides the granite sanctuary at
                    Karnak, the name of Alexander, preceded by mystic titles, js found on the
                    granite propylon in the island of Elephantine. In these titles the word <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Amun</hi> is clearly distinguished. It likewise occurs in
                    another place, where it is preceded by a ring containing in hieroglyphic symbols
                    the legend, “beloved of Amun-Phre.” <hi rend="italic">(Essay οη the Phonet.

                    it will appear hereafter that a knowledge of the enchorial form may possibly
                    contribute very materially, at some future time, to assist us in determining
                    it.</p>
                <p>11. There can be no doubt whatever respecting the signification of the name of
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">Ptolemy,</hi> as it occurs on the pillar of Rosetta; but it
                    is not quite so easy to determine its identity in some other cases, where it may
                    possibly have been modified by contraction, mutilation, or combination. In this
                    and a few other proper names, it is extremely interesting to trace some of the
                    steps by which alphabetical writing seems to have arisen out of hieroglyphical;
                    a process which may indeed be in some measure illustrated by the manner in which
                    the modern Chinese express a foreign combination of sounds, the characters being
                    rendered simply <hi rend="italic">phonetic</hi> by an appropriate mark, instead
                    of retaining their natural signification, and this mark, in some modern printed
                    books, approaching very near to the ring surrounding the hieroglyphic names. The
                    enchorial name of Ptolemy appears at first sight to be extremely different from
                    the hieroglyphical; and it would have been impossible to deduce the one from the
                    other, without a knowledge of the epistolographic forms of the separate
                    characters, as ascertained by a comparison of the manuscripts. The beginning and
                    end are obviously parts of the ring, which, in the sacred character, surrounds
                    every proper name, except those of the deities. The square block and the
                    semicircle answer invariably in all the manuscripts to characters resembling the
                    p and τ of Akerblad, which are found at the beginning of the enchorial name. The
                    next character, which seems to be a kind of knot, is not essentially
                    necessary,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>This

                    always expressed by a similar character in the manuscripts; an oblique line
                    crossed standing for the body, and an erect line for the tail. This was probably

                    parts of the enchorial text may be considered as expressing something like
                    aspirations or accentuations. The appellation <hi rend="smallcaps">Soteres,</hi>
                    as a dual, is well marked in the inscription of Rosetta, and the character, thus
                    determined, explains a long name in the temple at Edfou, which must mean “the
                    two saviour gods,” with various titles of honour, such as “the agents of Phthah,
                    the emblems of triumph, the approved of Phré, the favoured of the Nile, the
                    venerable consorts in empire.” <pb break="no" facs="nls:193643333"

                    In this name we appear to have another specimen of syllabic and alphabetic
                    writing combined, in a manner not extremely unlike the ludicrous mixtures of
                    words and things with which children are sometimes amused; for, however
                    Warburton’s indignation might be excited by such a comparison, it is perfectly
                    true that, occasionally, the sublime differs from the ridiculous by a single
                    step only. The first character of the hieroglyphic name is precisely of the same

                    approaches to the name of a goose in many other languages. We have, therefore,
                    literally <hi rend="smallcaps">Birenice</hi>; or, if the <hi rend="smallcaps"

                    diversity which was allowed in the mode of representing the same name. The first
                    character has not the least resemblance to the basket; but the first and second
                    together are very commonly used in the manuscripts, as a coarse representation
                    of a boat, which was called <hi rend="smallcaps">bari,</hi> or possibly <hi

                    temple, by the infantry and cavalry of the nome.” We may therefore expect to
                    find in it the names of these sovereigns, together with those of some or all of
                    the earlier Ptolemies; and, accordingly, we are able to determine, without
                    difficulty, some epithets which seem to be characteristic of this and the two
                    preceding reigns; but hitherto nothing has been observed that can be considered
                    as so clearly denoting either Philadelphus and his queen Arsinoe, or Euergetes
                    and his Berenice, although some assistance might have been derived, in
                    identifying them, from the enchorial text of Rosetta. We have, however, in the
                    same temple, a name, evidently compound, in which a basilisk is followed by two
                    feathers and a bent line; and to judge from a comparison of the enchorial text
                    with the manuscripts, a basilisk ought to be the emblem of <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Euergetes.</hi> The part of the name preceding it is, however, not Berenice,
                    and must, therefore, in all probability, be <hi rend="smallcaps">Arsinoe,</hi>
                    the daughter of Euergetes. But it seems impossible to attempt to compare the
                    characters employed with the sounds; since they sometimes occur in an inverted
                    order, which the sounds could not do. Indeed, the name seems to be very often
                    repeated in situations where its most essential parts seem to be a quadrant of a
                    circle, two feathers, and a bent or broken line; in other places, as at
                    Denderah, the bird, the hand, and the oval, are added; and it is not impossible
                    that the quadrant may have been meant as a representation of a lentil, which in
                    Coptic is <hi rend="smallcaps">arshin,</hi> and which alone may have been
                    sufficient to identify the name. It occurs in the celebrated zodiac of Denderah,
                    and very frequently at Philae, and it may possibly, hereafter, lead us very
                    readily to discover the hieroglyphical name of Philadelphus. That of <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Philopator</hi> is satisfactorily ascertained by the assistance
                    of the character employed for <hi rend="italic">father</hi> in the Rosetta
                    stone, though that character is much mutilated, and could not have been
                    positively determined without this coincidence. The name is found in the temple
                    at Edfou still more distinctly than at Ombos, and it occurs several times at
                    Karnak. <hi rend="smallcaps">Epiphanes</hi> is never distinguished in any other
                    inscription by the characters appropriated to him in that of Rosetta; but we
                    continually find a synonymous emblem, which is employed in the Rosetta stone to
                    signify <hi rend="italic">enlightening,</hi> where the Greek translation has <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Epiphanes</hi>; and this character, placed between two hatchets
                    facing each other, can only have meant the <hi rend="italic">illustrious
                    deity,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">deities.</hi> In this form the name occurs very
                    frequently at Philae, and in the temple at Edfou, where it seems to be the
                    latest name. For the <hi rend="smallcaps">Philometores</hi> we have a character
                    which occurs in some other monuments, and means apparently <hi rend="italic"
                    >mother,</hi> the name containing it being found several times in the temple at
                    Ombos. At Kous, or Apollinopolis Parva, there is another Greek inscription of
                    the Philometores and their children; but in the hieroglyphics copied by Denon,
                    the names of <pb break="no" facs="nls:193643346" xml:id="kp-eb0711-3346-0327"

                    colossal statue of whom is figured by Montfaucon in his <hi rend="italic"

                    therefore, be justifiable to distinguish this personage by calling him <hi

                    attributed in these inscriptions to the reigning sovereigns, afford us an
                    explanation of the Greek inscriptions to the <hi rend="italic">Synthronous gods
                    of Egypt,</hi> which repeatedly occur; and of the description <hi rend="italic"
                    >Fraternal gods,</hi> as, indeed, Philadelphus and his queen are called in the
                    Greek inscription of Rosetta.</p>
                <p>3. <hi rend="italic">Private Persons.</hi></p>
                <p>We find the names of six individuals expressed in the enchorial text of the
                    inscription of Rosetta, though they are wanting in the distinct hieroglyphics;
                    but, as they are clearly ascertained by the context, they are of considerable
                    value in tracing the approach of the hieroglyphic to alphabetic writing. These
                    are, <hi rend="smallcaps">Aetus, Philinus, Diogenes,</hi><hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Pyrrha,</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">Areia,</hi> and <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Irene.</hi></p>
                <p>In Diogenes and Areia we discover no traces of the ring which is the usual
                    characteristic of proper names; and, on the other hand, we find occasionally, in
                    some of the manuscripts, the parts of the ring applied to a title of Osiris,
                    which is more regularly written without any such distinction. A name of a
                    private individual is inserted from a sarcophagus in the British Museum,
                    engraved by Alexander, in his <hi rend="italic">Egyptian Monuments.</hi> Its
                    form is not that of a parallelepiped, but more accommodated to the shape of the
                    body. The pseudonymous appellation <hi rend="italic">Ramuneus</hi> has been
                    derived from the elementary characters already observed in the names of <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Re</hi> and <hi rend="smallcaps">Amun.</hi></p>
                <p>1. A figure sitting on the ground, and stretching out one hand, seems to imply
                    simply a <hi rend="italic">man</hi> or person, which is certainly the sense of
                    the enchorial character that commonly answers to it in the manuscripts; but in
                    composition the figure often appears to lose this sense.</p>
                <p>2. The horned snake, creeping along, is clearly meant, in some parts of the
                    inscription of Rosetta, for <hi rend="italic">him</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >it</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> although it has other senses in composition. It
                    is very remarkable, that the enchorial character, and that of the manuscripts,
                    resembling a <hi rend="smallcaps">y,</hi> approaches extremely near to the
                    Coptic F, which also means <hi rend="italic">him</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi>
                    and <hi rend="smallcaps">hof,</hi> or <hi rend="smallcaps">hfo,</hi> is the
                    Coptic term for a snake; so that this coincidence seems to afford us another
                    trace of the origin of the alphabet.</p>
                <p>3-7. The <hi rend="italic">bullock,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">ram,</hi> the <hi
                    rend="italic">antelope,</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">tortoise,</hi> are proved
                    to be sometimes representations of the things which they resemble, by their
                    occurrence in inscriptions accompanied by tablets; though some of them have
                    probably elsewhere a metaphorical sense. The ram is often represented with two
                    pairs of horns; the one natural, the other imaginary. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >crocodile</hi> is identified by a very distinct drawing in a manuscript sent
                    home by Mr Bankes, and is repeatedly designated in the text by a figure
                    representing it. The deity with a crocodile’s head is a separate personage, and
                    is denoted by a figure of the same animal with the tail turned under it.</p>
                <p>8. The asp or <hi rend="italic">basilisk</hi> is so coarsely represented in the
                    stone of Rosetta, that the object intended by it could not have been conjectured
                    without a comparison with other inscriptions; the context was, however,
                    sufficient to determine its meaning from the examination of this monument
                    alone.</p>

                <p>1. The essential parts of the name of <hi rend="smallcaps">Egypt</hi> seem to be
                    the square and the wheel, signifying <hi rend="italic">splendid land</hi> Į <hi
                    rend="subscript"> n</hi> addition to these, or their rudiments, the enchorial
                    word has at the beginning a character which generally answers to an arm holding
                    a feather, or to the flame of a lamp, an emblem which seems also to relate to
                    Egypt in one of the lines of the inscription of Rosetta. A flame and a heart are
                    mentioned by Horus Apollo and by Plutarch as employed in the name of <hi
                    rend="italic">Egypt</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> but a word occurring so
                    frequently is very likely to have been expressed in a variety of ways. The exact
                    combination of characters generally used on the stone has not been observed in
                    any other inscription.</p>
                <p>2. The name of <hi rend="smallcaps">Memphis</hi> cannot be determined without
                    some uncertainty; the line of hieroglyphics in which it is contained being in
                    severa! respects obscure.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>The name of <hi rend="italic">Memphis</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Memphe</hi>
                    appears to be a Greek abbreviation of the hieroglyphical name MA-M-PHTHAH, the
                    <hi rend="italic">temple</hi> or <hi rend="italic">sacred place of Phthah,</hi>
                    which, according to Dr Young <hi rend="italic">{Rudiments of an Egyptian

                    also probably the first name of Cairo. The phonetic value of the hieroglyphics
                    here placed opposite the word <hi rend="superscript"> r</hi> √rf2ι&gt; <hi

                    rend="superscript"> m3</hi> to be HMSRN; a combination which, though no doubt
                    “in several respects obscure,” maybe resolved into HA-MISR, with the mark of
                    plurality, N, subjoined.</p></note></p>
                <p>3. The character supposed to denote the Nile, as a deity, must also sometimes be
                    understood as merely meaning a <hi rend="italic">river</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >;</hi> and there is reason to think that the Nile itself was generally called
                    by the Egyptians <hi rend="italic">the river</hi> only. The enchorial character
                    used to denote both the Nile and a river, or canal, sufficiently resembles the
                    hieroglyphic to favour this interpretation; and it is in some degree confirmed
                    by the occurrence of the character alone on a water jar of Pieresc, delineated
                    in Kircher’s <hi rend="italic">Oedipus,</hi> and, together with other
                    characters, on the five vases found by Paul Lucas at Abousir. By accident,
                    Kircher appears, in this single instance, to have been right in one of his
                    conjectures; for he calls this character a Nilometer, and considers it as
                    emblematic of the Nile.</p>
                <p>4. The word <hi rend="italic">Greek,</hi> in Coptic <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >uinin</hi> or <hi rend="smallcaps">oueinin,</hi> in Thebaic <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">ouceienin,</hi> supposed to have been derived from <hi
                    rend="italic">Ionian,</hi> seems to exhibit in its form something like an
                    imitation of the sound. The curve on a stem is sometimes exchanged for the term
                    <hi rend="italic">divine,</hi> and appears to mean <hi rend="italic">glory,</hi>
                    in Coptic oou or oii, which is nearly the sound attributed by Akerblad to the
                    enchorial character, a little like the Hebrew ü. The feather, as in Ptolemy and
                    Berenice, may be read ι or <hi rend="smallcaps">ei,</hi> having the three dashes
                    to express them, as usual, in the enchorial text; the serpent is <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">ench,</hi><hi rend="italic">ever</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi>
                    and the hat, which looks a little like a plough, is equivalent to the waved
                    line, and must be read <hi rend="smallcaps">n</hi>; so that we have very
                    accurately ouiENEHN, which seems to be near enough to ouiENiN to justify us in
                    considering these characters as phonetic.</p>
                <p>5. The ladder is well marked as meaning <hi rend="italic">country.</hi> It may
                    perhaps be intended to represent a field with its divisions; but it is uncertain
                    whether or not it is the same symbol which enters into one of the names of
                    Arueris, the sculptures of the Rosetta stone being by no means highly
                    finished.</p>
                <p>6. It is remarkable that the wheel, signifying <hi rend="italic">land,</hi> had
                    been noticed by the Jesuits as resembling the old Chinese character for the word
                    <hi rend="italic">field</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> but this is the only one of
                    a multitude of similar conjectures which has been justified by more complete
                    evidence. <hi rend="italic">{Phil. Trans.</hi> 1769, pl. xxviii.) <pb break="no"

                    inscriptions accompanying the zodiacs, to relate to a real <hi rend="italic"
                    >star.</hi> It has also elsewhere a figurative sense, meaning an attendant or

                <p>8. The open square is found in both the combinations of characters which are most
                    commonly used for expressing a <hi rend="italic">temple</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >;</hi> the feather signifies ornament or consecration, and the oblong figure
                    either the sacred inclosure or a sacred seat, the character for a god being
                    sometimes placed within it. The feather is occasionally converted into an
                    inclined oval, the square being at the same time a little altered; a difference
                    which may be observed in other inscriptions as well as in the Rosetta stone.</p>
                <p>9. The character representing a <hi rend="italic">shrine</hi> so much resembles
                    the object which it denotes, that it was the most readily identified of all
                    which were found on the stone of Rosetta. The character signifying a <hi
                    rend="italic">priest</hi> was the second; and the combination of both afforded a
                    full confirmation of the truth of the explanation. The enchorial character for a
                    shrine is derived from the sitting statue which always accompanies it.</p>
                <p>10. The open square, occurring in <hi rend="italic">habitation</hi> as well as in
                    <hi rend="italic">temple,</hi> must probably have meant <hi rend="italic"
                    >house</hi> or <hi rend="italic">building,</hi> or possibly <hi rend="italic"
                    >stone</hi> only.</p>
                <p>11. The <hi rend="italic">throne,</hi> or chair of state, occurs in a great
                    variety of tablets. It evidently bears its most natural signification in the
                    character denoting statue (No. 23), and in some other instances; but it appears
                    to bear, in some inscriptions, the metaphorical sense of a residence or
                    habitation.</p>
                <p>12. The <hi rend="italic">column,</hi> or pillar, is too much like the object it
                    denotes to allow us to doubt respecting its meaning, considering the sense of
                    that part of the inscription of Rosetta in which it occurs.</p>
                <p>13. The characters denoting a <hi rend="italic">diadem</hi> are sufficiently
                    determined by the first inscription of the stone; and they so much resemble the
                    corresponding passages of the enchorial text, that we can scarcely hesitate to
                    admit the intimate connection of the two modes of writing without seeking for
                    any further proofs.</p>
                <p>14. The sacred <hi rend="italic">ornaments</hi> are expressed by three feathers
                    fixed to a bar, which appears to be held by two arms. The remaining part of the
                    character occurs very frequently as a sort of termination, and seems to answer
                    to <hi rend="italic">ments.</hi></p>
                <p>15-20. The boat or <hi rend="italic">sldp,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">spear,</hi>
                    the <hi rend="italic">bow,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">arrow,</hi> the <hi
                    rend="italic">censer,</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">bier,</hi> are sufficiently
                    identified by the comparison of various tablets with their inscriptions. The <hi
                    rend="italic">ship</hi> occurs frequently as denoting the sacred boats, in which
                    the representations of the deities are conveyed, though they are not always
                    accompanied by water. But it has been observed, that the Egyptians attributed
                    ships rather than chariots to the sun and moon as gliding smoothly through the
                    skies. The first part of the enchorial word, which has been supposed to be a <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b,</hi> is evidently identical with the character always found
                    in the manuscripts written in the running hieroglyphics as the first part of the
                    delineation of a ship. It is remarkable, that in the inscription at Esnch, as
                    copied by the French, the point of the arrow is turned towards the back of the
                    bowman, instead of being directed towards the enemy.</p>
                <p>21. The <hi rend="italic">tear,</hi> in some of its representations, is very
                    clearly expressive of the thing intended; and this resemblance, together with
                    its frequent attendance on a corpse and a bier, is sufficient to explain its
                    sense. It occurs also sometimes within a border as a peculiar deity; but it
                    seems to be much more commonly emblematical of Osiris, of Apis, or of Mneuis. It
                    is not unfrequently found as a detached figure, in a kind of pottery, with a
                    green glazing, and may perhaps have been worn, instead of a mourning ring, as a
                    memorial of a departed friend. It has most commonly been called the <hi
                    rend="italic">equi sectio,</hi> and supposed to represent a horse’s head, or the
                    rostrum of a ship, whilst the ingenious Kircher has made it a <hi rend="italic"
                    >phallus</hi><hi rend="italic">oculatus.</hi> Amongst the antiquities collected
                    by Lord Mountnorris in Egypt is an eye seen in front, and apparently shedding a
                    tear.</p>
                <p>22. The character for an <hi rend="italic">image</hi> seems to mean <hi
                    rend="italic">a wrought man</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> for the hands,
                    connected with an eye, appear to be holding an oar as an emblem of <hi
                    rend="italic">labour.</hi> The same character, with a slight variation in the
                    form of the eye, means a rower.</p>
                <p>23. The sitting statue has no character to imply wrought; but it is followed by a
                    bent line, which seems to be a term of respect, and may possibly answer to <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">osh,</hi><hi rend="italic">great.</hi> The same bent line
                    occurs on the great sarcophagus of green breccia as a personification of one of
                    the qualities of Osiris, probably his <hi rend="italic">magnificence.</hi> It is
                    often exchanged in the manuscripts for the divided staff’; and both are
                    represented in the running hand by a figure like a 9 or a 4. In the enchorial
                    text this character seems sometimes to be expressed by a single line, either
                    straight, or bent sideways into an angle like part of a K. A similar <hi
                    rend="italic">divine statue</hi> is decreed to “King Nuncoreus, the son of
                    Sesostris,” on Mr Montagu’s frize. (See <hi rend="italic">Hieroglyphics,</hi> 7
                    S 1.)</p>
                <p>24. <hi rend="italic">Letters</hi> are denoted by a character which seems to
                    represent some of the materials employed in writing, and which is indeed not
                    extremely unlike an inkstand figured in Caylus’s <hi rend="italic">Recueil,</hi>
                    and consisting of two parallel tubes at some distance from each other, with a
                    cover connected by a chain instead of a hinge. Besides the very well marked
                    passage in the Rosetta stone, the character occurs in many manuscripts near the
                    representation of a Thoth employed in writing; and the enchorial character
                    corresponding to it is also found in the term <hi rend="italic"
                    >hierogrammatists</hi> or <hi rend="italic">sacred scribes</hi> at the beginning
                    of the inscription.</p>
                <p>25. In the numerical tablet of the great French work, believed to have been found
                    at Karnak, a character may be observed which frequently precedes a numeral, and
                    which resembles a weight with its handle. Hence we may conjecture, with
                    considerable probability, that it represents some <hi rend="italic">weight</hi>
                    of unknown value.</p>
                <p>26. The enchorial character for <hi rend="italic">gold</hi> is perfectly well
                    determined; and its resemblance to a little vase under a sort of arch is so
                    strong that we may safely attribute the same sense to this hieroglyphic,
                    although it appears to be wanting in one or two passages of the sacred
                    inscription of Rosetta, where it ought to be found. In the great ritual we
                    observe this character immediately preceding a shrine, as if a <hi rend="italic"
                    >golden shrine</hi> were intended; and, in several other places, it is connected
                    with a number, as if it meant <hi rend="italic">pieces of gold</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">;</hi> for instance, in the green sarcophagus, with the number
                    360. Sometimes, also, it appears to be used in a metaphorical sense as a
                    complimentary epithet of a monarch, or perhaps in allusion to his riches. Thus,
                    on the black frize of Nuncoreus, we have over the king’s figure the characters,
                    “Joy, Life, Stability, Power, <hi rend="italic">Riches,</hi> Like the Sun, for
                    ever.” <hi rend="italic">(Hieroglyphics,</hi> 7 p.)</p>
                <p>27. Near to the character for gold, in the margin of the great ritual, is a sort
                    of open box, supported on a flagstaff; and a similar box, with a semicircle
                    under it, seems to mean <hi rend="italic">silver,</hi> at least it considerably
                    resembles the enchorial character for silver, which is perfectly well
                    ascertained.</p>
                <p>28. We find, in several inscriptions, representations of objects which are also
                    observable in the tablets accompanying them, although it is difficult to say for
                    what they are intended. Two of these are copied from the frize of Ficooni and
                    Montagu <hi rend="italic">(Hieroglyphics,</hi> 9 okl, Rskl, 7 LMq). The former
                    seems to be a sort of cloak, with a fringe at the bottom; and the latter is a
                    little like a pear; but this character does not occur so clearly in the
                    inscription.</p>

                <p>6. <hi rend="italic">Attributes and Actions.</hi></p>
                <p>(See Plate CCLXXIV.)</p>
                <p>1. The <hi rend="italic">crux</hi><hi rend="italic">ansata,</hi> sometimes called
                    the key of the Nile, is usually employed as a symbol of divinity; but its
                    correct meaning is <hi rend="italic">life,</hi> as Lacroze rightly conjectured,
                    although his opinion respecting the origin of the character is inconsistent with
                    the form of its oldest and most accurate delineations; and there is no one
                    instance in which it is so represented as to stand in any relation to a sluice
                    or a watercock. According to Socrates and Rufinus, the Egyptian priests declared
                    to their Christian conquerors under Theodosius, who were going to destroy the
                    Serapeion at Alexandria, that the cross, so often sculptured on their temples,
                    was an emblem of the life to come. •This passage has been understood by some
                    authors as relating rather to the cross without a handle, which is observable in
                    some rare instances, and indeed twice on the stone of Rosetta; but this symbol
                    appears rather to denote a protecting power than an immortal existence. It
                    happens, perhaps altogether accidentally, that one of the contractions for the
                    word <hi rend="italic">god,</hi> which are commonly used in Coptic, approaches
                    very near to this character, except that the arms of the cross are within the
                    circle.</p>
                <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Eternity</hi> is represented simply by a serpent rising in
                    an oblique arch, and without horns; the serpent devouring its tail., and forming
                    a ring, is never found as an Egyptian emblem. Horus Apollo says that eternity
                    was denoted by a serpent having its tail hidden under its body, and that such
                    serpents were called <hi rend="italic">uraci,</hi> meaning in Greek <hi
                    rend="italic">basilishs,</hi> which agrees very well with the sense of the
                    Coptic <hi rend="smallcaps">uro,</hi><hi rend="italic">king</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">;</hi> but this description answers better to the <hi
                    rend="italic">asp</hi> of the inscription of Rosetta, which has also some
                    relation to the representations of the deities, though it does not exactly mean
                    immortality.</p>
                <p>3. The cross with the serpent is a very common epithet in the sense of
                    everliving, or <hi rend="italic">immortal,</hi> or <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >aeonobios</hi>; the waved line is in general a preposition, or a termination,
                    meaning <hi rend="italic">of, to,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">for</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">;</hi> and it appears to be synonymous with the hat or head-dress.
                    Almost all authors have very hastily taken it for granted that this character
                    must relate immediately to water wherever it occurs, although we find it
                    repeatedly in every line of the inscription of Rosetta, where water is not once
                    mentioned. The fact, however, is, that its prototype seems to have been a stream
                    of water, or of any other liquid, flowing <hi rend="italic">from</hi> a vessel,
                    and poured <hi rend="italic">on</hi> some other object; and that the idea of the
                    liquid was completely dropped in the general employment of the character, whilst
                    that of the <hi rend="italic">connection</hi> only was retained; the hat or cap
                    being also similarly forgotten, whilst its connection with the head of the
                    wearer only was suggested by its figure. In this compound character we have two
                    particles nearly alike, the semicircle and the line; for that they cannot be
                    very different is shown by the occasional substitution of two semicircles for
                    the combination. One of them seems to serve for the connection between life and
                    eternity, “life <hi rend="italic">for</hi> ever;” and the other to make the new
                    compound an adjective, “livwŷ for ever.”</p>
                <p>4. The triangle or pyramid occurs very commonly amongst other emblems of
                    prosperity and happiness; and it is found in the frize of Montagu and Ficooni in
                    the decided sense of an offering or a present in general, whilst in another
                    place it is made an offering in its own form; so that we can only interpret it
                    as signi lying <hi rend="italic">joy,</hi> or pleasure, or prosperity, <hi
                    rend="italic">(Uierogluphics,</hi> 7 Mqr, Uqr; 9 Re, Rl; 7 Uq, Urs.)</p>
                <p>5. <hi rend="italic">Power</hi> appears to be indicated by a sceptre having the
                    head of an animal, which is often placed in the hands of the deities, and often
                    stands with the cross, the pyramid, and the altar, as an emblem of the blessings
                    attendant on the favourites of the gods. It is seldom used in the text of
                    inscriptions, but it occurs once in that of Rosetta.</p>
                <p>6, 7. <hi rend="italic">Stability</hi> is denoted, on the Rosetta stone and
                    elsewhere, by the altar, which seems to have been fixed in the ground as a
                    column. When repeated it forms the verb <hi rend="italic">establish</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">;</hi> but it often occurs singly, and not uncommonly as an
                    unconnected emblem, accompanied by other characters of similar import; and it is
                    sometimes found as a detached figure formed of glazed porcelain. The two altars
                    are very conspicuous objects in some of the epistolographic manuscripts, and are
                    very useful in comparing them with the hieratic; but the word employed in the
                    enchorial inscription of Rosetta seems to be derived from a different
                    origin.</p>
                <p>8. A drop or club over a basin, followed by a bent line, seems to mean <hi
                    rend="italic">great strength,</hi> though it is difficult to say what the
                    character is meant to depict. In some other places it seems to resemble somewhat
                    a kind of headdress.</p>
                <p>9. The bullock and the arm, which generally occur at the beginning of the
                    inscriptions on the obelisks, agree very well with the epithet <hi rend="italic"
                    >mighty</hi> in the translation of Hermapion. The arm is, in many other
                    instances, used in compound characters.</p>
                <p>10. <hi rend="italic">Victory</hi> is denoted by a branch, perhaps by a palm
                    branch, with a semicircle and a circle, sometimes preceded by a waved line.</p>
                <p>11. The character signifying <hi rend="italic">fortune</hi> somewhat resembles
                    that which denotes <hi rend="italic">gold</hi>,∙ but instead of the arch we have
                    an angular line, which seems to be intended for a pair of arms grasping the
                    vase. The whole assemblage approaches also a little to the form of a pocket, or
                    purse, as it is frequently delineated.</p>
                <p>12. The open square, bent inwards, clearly means <hi rend="italic">splendour</hi>
                    or <hi rend="italic">glory,</hi> though it is uncertain what object it is
                    intended to represent. In some cases a crescent seems to be substituted for it,
                    as if it bore some relation to the sun, and the moon afforded a parallel
                    sense.</p>
                <p>13, 14. <hi rend="italic">Illustrious</hi> is expressed, in the inscription of
                    Rosetta, by the open square, for <hi rend="italic">splendour,</hi> the oval,
                    which signifies addition or respect, making it a kind of superlative, and the
                    pair of legs, which very naturally convey the idea of <hi rend="italic"
                    >bearing,</hi> or possessing; so that the whole forms the epithet <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Epiphanes.</hi> This assemblage is, in some of the manuscripts,
                    very commonly followed by a bird, or its equivalent, a half arch, apparently
                    serving as an intensive.</p>
                <p>15-17. The feather, when alone, seems to imply <hi rend="italic">honour,</hi> as
                    well as when accompanied by a man stretching out his arm, or by a bird. The bird
                    also frequently stands alone in similar passages, and must be translated <hi
                    rend="italic">respect,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">respectable.</hi> The block
                    with the bird has also manifestly the same sense in the great ritual, and the
                    vase with the bowl is so nearly synonymous with it that we can only translate it
                    <hi rend="italic">venerable</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and these characters
                    are frequently exchanged for a sort of bench, with a dash under it, a symbol
                    which, however, may possibly have been deduced from some different origin. The
                    sense of the feather is peculiarly illustrated by its occurrence with a drop or
                    club, a serpent, and a line, at the beginning of a great variety of
                    inscriptions, apparently signifying <hi rend="italic">immortal honour
                    to.</hi></p>
                <p>18. The eye, either with or without the pupil, and either preceded or followed by
                    the undulated line, has a sense somewhat similar to all these, and is often
                    employed at the beginning of the honorary inscriptions. On the Rosetta stone it
                    means distinctly <hi rend="italic">rite</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >adoration.</hi> The enchorial character corresponding to it expresses simply
                    <hi rend="italic">doing</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and in Greek the same word
                    signifies <hi rend="italic">to do</hi> and <hi rend="italic">to
                    sacrifice.</hi></p>
                <p>19. <hi rend="italic">Worship,</hi> or the Greek <hi rend="italic"
                    >therapeia,</hi> is denoted by a very unintelligible character, resembling a
                    kind of cap <pb break="no" facs="nls:193643398" xml:id="kp-eb0711-3398-0331"
                    />stan, which is frequently delineated in the boats of the tablets, if it is not
                    intended for some emblematical figure erected in the boats. On the great green
                    sarcophagus, the long bent line is a snake, and the point projecting upwards
                    from the middle is a sword. But these resemblances afford us little or no
                    assistance in tracing the connection between the whole emblem and its sense.</p>
                <p>20, 21. The character denoting <hi rend="italic">father</hi> is found in some of
                    the inscriptions of the Ptolemies in such circumstances that it might as easily
                    be supposed to mean mother; but, by means of Mr Bullock’s scaraboeus, compared
                    with some other monuments, another character having been determined for <hi
                    rend="italic">mother,</hi> it became easy to identify the symbol for father on
                    the Rosetta stone, where it had been a little injured, and imperfectly copied in
                    the engravings.</p>
                <p>22. The frequent occurrence of the Egyptian goose or sheldrake, with a circle
                    over it, between two proper names, sufficiently points out the meaning of these
                    characters, which can only relate to the connection between them, and which must
                    naturally mean <hi rend="italic">son.</hi> The circle may perhaps be intended
                    for an egg; but in the painted sculptures the disc is red and the circumference
                    light. The enchorial character nearly resembles the form in which some kinds of
                    birds are usually expressed in the manuscripts. Mr Bailey also observed the
                    occurrence of the bird between two proper names, and identified it with the <hi
                    rend="italic">chenalopex</hi> mentioned by Horus Apollo as employed to signify
                    son, on account of its courage in defending its offspring. This quality might
                    rather have been expected to lead to its adoption as a symbol for a parent; but
                    its existence in the bird in question is confirmed by the observations of modern
                    naturalists respecting the sheldrake (the <hi rend="italic">tadorne</hi> of
                    Buffon), which has generally been considered as the chenalopex, and resembles
                    very accurately the best of the hieroglyphical delineations of the bird,
                    although the colours, as exhibited in the <hi rend="italic">Description de
                    l'</hi><hi rend="italic">Egypte,</hi> are not correctly natural.</p>
                <p>23. The same bird, with a leg or a dash instead of a circle, seems to mean a <hi
                    rend="italic">minister</hi> or <hi rend="italic">attendant,</hi> especially in
                    several parts of the inscriptions on the Lover’s Fountain. There are also some
                    other characters which seem to be nearly synonymous with these; one of them may
                    possibly be meant for a <hi rend="italic">tail,</hi> implying a follower, as <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">sat</hi> and <hi rend="smallcaps">sa</hi> are nearly alike in
                    Coptic; another is sometimes worn as a collar, perhaps implying subjection, and
                    meaning servant.</p>
                <p>24, 25. Instead of the usual character for <hi rend="italic">son,</hi> we
                    sometimes find, between two names, a serpent with a globe substituted for the
                    bird, and an oval for the circle; and the context seems to require that the
                    'meaning of these symbols should be a <hi rend="italic">daughter,</hi> but
                    probably with some particular character of royalty or divinity. At Philae we
                    find a dual, meaning <hi rend="italic">sons</hi> or descendants, as a son and a
                    daughter, expressed apparently by two circles only.</p>
                <p>26. A <hi rend="italic">child,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">infant,</hi> is
                    represented by a figure bent as if sitting, and putting his finger on his lip.
                    This is sufficiently established by the triple inscription; but it is still
                    further confirmed by a plate of the <hi rend="italic">Description de l’</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Egypte</hi><hi rend="italic">(Antiq.</hi> tom. ii. pl. lxxxvi. f.
                    1), in which a figure of this kind is represented as immediately derived from
                    the father, who seems to be inspired by a beetle entering his mouth. The
                    manuscripts afford us here some valuable steps by which the enchorial character
                    is connected with the distinct hieroglyphics. Another figure, which is elsewhere
                    used as corresponding to a beetle, is also found in the enchorial text in the
                    sense of son or offspring.</p>
                <p>27, 28. A circle, with an arm holding an angular line, means a <hi rend="italic"
                    >director.</hi> The angular line is intended for part of a rudder; and the same
                    character, with the addition of the figure of a boat, denotes the <hi
                    rend="italic">pilot</hi> or <hi rend="italic">helmsman,</hi> as is obvious from
                    many parts of the green sarcophagus. The circle and arm are also found in the
                    character denoting <hi rend="italic">dedicate.</hi></p>
                <p>29. A pair of arms holding an oar, and connected by a sort of sector, signifies a
                    <hi rend="italic">rower,</hi> and possibly also a labourer, or workman in
                    general, as in <hi rend="italic">image.</hi></p>
                <p>30. A stem of a plant, perhaps a reed, followed by an insect like a wasp or
                    ichneumon, but probably intended for a bee, and by two semicircles, is the
                    complete emblem for a <hi rend="italic">hing</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> but
                    the reed is often used alone in the same sense, and the insect sometimes occurs
                    without the reed. Plutarch says that a king was denoted by a leaf, <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">turion</hi>; and Horus Apollo tells us that a bee signified a
                    people obedient to a king; hence this symbol might be interpreted <hi
                    rend="italic">hing</hi><hi rend="italic">of men.</hi> Ammianus Marcellinus,
                    however, asserts, more simply, that a king was denoted by a bee. It appears from
                    the manuscripts that the beginning of the enchorial character, which Mr Akerblad
                    read <hi rend="smallcaps">phu,</hi> is derived from the elementary traces
                    representing the reed, the semicircle, a waved line, and a sitting deity,
                    meaning <hi rend="italic">the divine king</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> an
                    assemblage which often occurs on the green sarcophagus, and elsewhere, as
                    applied to a royal person. The remainder of the enchorial character seems to
                    represent a termination consisting of a semicircle and a vessel, which is often
                    added to a name, apparently as a demonstration of respect, like the vessel and
                    the spiral in the case of the god Nilus.</p>
                <p>31. <hi rend="italic">Condition,</hi> or subjection, is denoted by a character
                    which somewhat resembles an altar with an offering of flowers, but which might
                    also be intended for the cup of a flower with an insect hovering over it.</p>
                <p>32. In the term <hi rend="italic">kingdom,</hi> the crown is figuratively
                    employed for its wearer; a metaphor common in many modern languages.</p>
                <p>33. The character denoting a <hi rend="italic">libation</hi> is very indistinctly
                    traced in the sacred inscription of Rosetta, so that it would have been
                    impossible to explain its original form without the assistance of any
                    hieroglyphical monuments. The long water jar, out of which the kneeling figure
                    is pouring a divided stream, somewhat resembles those which a modern Egyptian
                    woman is seen carrying in a plate of Mr Legh’s second edition.</p>
                <p>34, 35. The vase with the stream, which frequently occurs in the character for
                    <hi rend="italic">priest,</hi> is sometimes found alone, and must therefore
                    probably relate to some particular <hi rend="italic">ceremony</hi> performed by
                    the priests, approaching to the nature of a libation. On the monument of Rosetta
                    the line is a simple curve, not waved; nor is the vase more distinctly
                    represented. Instead of the sitting figure, a foot is sometimes substituted, as
                    in the word <hi rend="italic">attendant</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and the
                    enchorial character is a more tolerable approximation to this form than to the
                    complete figure.</p>
                <p>36. <hi rend="italic">Priesthood</hi> is simply the <hi rend="italic"
                    >condition</hi> of a <hi rend="italic">priest</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> the
                    character prefixed answering to the Coptic prefix <hi rend="smallcaps">met,</hi>
                    and to the Greek termination <hi rend="smallcaps">cia.</hi></p>
                <p>37. The ornaments of the head are very generally used as indicating the person by
                    whom they are worn; and flowers, probably those of the lotus, are frequently
                    found on the heads of the priests, as well as in the inscriptions which
                    accompany them. In the inscription of Rosetta the sense <hi rend="italic"
                    >sacerdotal</hi> agrees very well with the context where this character occurs,
                    though it cannot be deduced with absolute certainty from the comparison with the
                    Greek.</p>
                <p>38. It is by no means easy to explain why the figure like a buckle should clearly
                    mean an <hi rend="italic">assembly.</hi> Perhaps, however, the upper part may
                    originally have been a crescent, implying monthly; and the scale or basin below
                    is occasionally found supporting some offerings, which are set upright in it; so
                    that the whole may have meant <hi rend="italic">a monthly exhibition.</hi></p>
                <p>39. The character <hi rend="italic">god</hi> is made an adjective by the addition
                    of the waved line, and of the long drop, which seem <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193643411" xml:id="kp-eb0711-3411-0332"/>simply to convert it into the
                    term <hi rend="italic">sacred</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> or, if the drop has
                    any other meaning, it can only relate to worshipping or honouring, as the
                    character prefixed to the enchorial text, which is equivalent to the scale or
                    basin, is elsewhere employed to signify <hi rend="italic">honour</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">attention.</hi> In some other instances, a circle and a waved line
                    seem to be employed in a similar manner, for connecting one character with
                    another like substantive and adjective.</p>
                <p>4-0. An epithet implying <hi rend="italic">consecrated</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >dedicated</hi> is composed of a trident, or triple branch or root, followed by
                    a bent line. It occurs very commonly near the beginning of inscriptions, on
                    obelisks, and elsewhere.</p>
                <p>4L A little oblique cross, over an arm with a feather, seems to mean <hi
                    rend="italic">to give,</hi> and perhaps to fight and to defend, as, in Coptic,
                    the word τι has both these senses. It is often preceded by a circle and a
                    semicircle.</p>
                <p>42. The hand bearing the triangle or pyramid manifestly means, in the frize of
                    Montagu and Ficooni, <hi rend="italic">to offer,</hi> as an oblation to a
                    deity.</p>
                <p>43. In the inscription of Rosetta, we find the word <hi rend="italic"
                    >dedicate</hi> expressed by a bent line and a sitting figure, with the circle,
                    and the arm holding the rudder. The character already interpreted <hi
                    rend="italic">consecrated</hi> precedes, but it is not absolutely certain that
                    it belongs to, the same phrase.</p>
                <p>44. The term <hi rend="italic">lawful</hi> is naturally enough derived from a
                    deity in his judicial capacity; the figure is preceded by a bird, placed between
                    two semicircles, which must here mean <hi rend="italic">according to,</hi>
                    answering to the termination <hi rend="italic">ful.</hi> Sometimes a curved
                    line, supported by a stem, is substituted as a synonym for the figure of the
                    judge.</p>
                <p>45-47. The character representing <hi rend="italic">good</hi> strongly resembles
                    the figure of a lute, depicted in the chamber of the harps, amongst the
                    catacombs, and may have alluded to the pleasing sound of music. The plural, with
                    the scale or basin, which implies <hi rend="italic">bestowing,</hi> makes the
                    epithet <hi rend="smallcaps">eucha-ristos,</hi> which in Greek is somewhat
                    ambiguous, meaning either <hi rend="italic">grateful</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >munificent.</hi> The latter, however, must be its sense in this inscription,
                    because <hi rend="italic">good gifts</hi> or <hi rend="italic">delights</hi> may
                    be plural, but <hi rend="italic">gratitude</hi> not so easily. The lute is also
                    found denoting good in other parts of the inscription. The enchorial character
                    for the scale could scarcely have been suspected to be derived from it, without
                    the assistance of the manuscripts, which constantly exhibit an intermediate
                    form, intended, perhaps, to comprehend one of the lines supporting the
                    scale.</p>
                <p>48. The semicircle, with two oblique dashes, seems to mean <hi rend="italic"
                    >great</hi> in the name of Thoth, who is called, in the Greek inscription of
                    Rosetta, Hermes the <hi rend="italic">great and great</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >;</hi> whilst, in other places, this character seems almost always to convey
                    the sense of a dual. The enchorial epithet of Thoth is a little like the crown
                    with two semicircles, which is most frequently found amongst the titles of
                    Osiris, especially when he sits in judgment. The two kinds of hats, worn by the
                    different deities, seem to be intended by the characters of the Rosetta stone,
                    which express the <hi rend="italic">upper</hi> and <hi rend="italic">lower</hi>
                    regions or countries. These two characters are also found together in the green
                    sarcophagus as the names of two goddesses; and they occur together in one or two
                    passages of some of the manuscripts, and in an inscription at Philae, so that,
                    although the representation is very indistinct in the particular case of the
                    Rosetta stone, there is little doubt that the cap of Osiris meant, in this case,
                    <hi rend="italic">superior,</hi> and that of Hyperion and other personages <hi
                    rend="italic">inferior.</hi></p>
                <p>49. A circle and a semicircle stand, in several passages of the inscription of
                    Rosetta, for <hi rend="italic">others,</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >remaining.</hi></p>
                <p>50. Possibly the bowl and the bird together mean <hi rend="italic">say</hi> or
                    <hi rend="italic">call,</hi> and the figure of a man may serve to make the
                    passive <hi rend="italic">called.</hi></p>
                <p>51. The second bowl, substituted for the bird, does not appear very essentially
                    to alter the sense, which is still a thing <hi rend="italic">said</hi> or
                    proclaimed, a <hi rend="italic">declaration,</hi> or a decree.</p>
                <p>52. The characters denoting <hi rend="italic">manifest</hi> seem to have some
                    analogy to <hi rend="italic">called,</hi> though their derivation is obscure.
                    The first character may either be intended for the country, or for a kind of
                    flag or banner.</p>
                <p>53. The ring, which implies a <hi rend="italic">name,</hi> and which elsewhere
                    distinguishes proper names, seems to be an imitation of the label, called a
                    phylactery in the Greek inscription of Rosetta, on which the name of a figure
                    was usually distinguished.</p>
                <p>54. A disc, with rays descending from it, is one of the few characters in which
                    the form gives us some assistance towards determining the sense, which is found
                    to be <hi rend="italic">enlightening</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> though the
                    Egyptians do not seem to have been very correct in their delineation of the
                    motion of light, which they make to diverge in curved lines, like those
                    described by a common projectile.</p>
                <p>55. The square block, the semicircle, and the chain, are employed very clearly in
                    the sense of <hi rend="italic">loving</hi> or <hi rend="italic">beloved</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">;</hi> in Coptic <hi rend="smallcaps">mai.</hi> In the enchorial
                    character the square and semicircle seem to be sometimes transposed, and
                    sometimes changed into an oval.</p>
                <p>56. <hi rend="italic">Preserver,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">saviour,</hi> is
                    represented by a sort of trefoil, with a long stem, which answers to a cross or
                    obelisk in the enchorial text; but, in other passages, the character takes the
                    form of a still simpler club; and in others, again, it has something like a
                    bulbous root.</p>
                <p>57, 58. A frame like a ladder, supported by a stem, occurs sometimes as a part of
                    a head dress, but it is difficult to say if it represents any other object.
                    Followed by an arm, and a pair of legs, it signifies <hi rend="italic">set
                    up,</hi> and this combination of characters is of very frequent occurrence;
                    sometimes also the bent line or divided shaft forms a part of it. In Coptic, <hi
                    rend="italic">set up</hi> is expressed by <hi rend="italic">set on foot,</hi>
                    which seems to retain the analogy of the hieroglyphical character. The
                    substitution of a pair of feathers for the legs, however, does not appear
                    materially to alter the sense; the context, where it occurs, requiring the word
                    <hi rend="italic">prepare</hi> or <hi rend="italic">construct.</hi></p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:193643424" xml:id="kp-eb0711-3424-0333"/>
                <p>1. Two ovals, with a semicircle and an arm, very clearly signify <hi
                    rend="italic">in order that.</hi> The ovals seem to mean <hi rend="italic"
                    >to</hi> or <hi rend="italic">for,</hi> and the arm <hi rend="italic"
                    >action</hi> or <hi rend="italic">doing</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> as our own
                    <hi rend="italic">that</hi> seems to be allied to the German <hi rend="italic"
                    >that,</hi> which means <hi rend="italic">deed.</hi> The same combination of
                    characters appears to denote, in another passage, <hi rend="italic">to add
                    to</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and one of the ovals is sometimes omitted. The
                    Coptic may be either <hi rend="smallcaps">hina</hi> or <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >ethbe.</hi></p>
                <p>2. The symbols employed in the sense <hi rend="italic">wherever,</hi> seem to
                    mean separately, <hi rend="italic">at, in, one,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">in,
                    place, one</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and, transposing the two last, we may
                    make a very good Coptic word E-U-MA.</p>
                <p>3, 4. The arm and chain signify <hi rend="italic">and</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >also</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and the oval sometimes takes place of the
                    arm, without much variation of the sense. This combination is also found in the
                    sense of <hi rend="italic">with,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">together with.</hi>
                    The elementary ideas seem to be <hi rend="italic">put, with,</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">add, with.</hi> Between the names of Ptolemy and Berenice at
                    Karnak, the arm and chain are separate.</p>
                <p>5. The half arch, or the fork, which is perfectly equivalent to it, followed by
                    two curls and two semicircles, mean <hi rend="italic">moreover</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">;</hi> the reduplication probably resembling that of many of the
                    Coptic verbs, which generally imply a continued action.</p>
                <p>6. The combination of the loop or sling, with two semicircles and three ovals,
                    means very clearly <hi rend="italic">likewise.</hi> The loop seems to represent
                    a bucket, intended for one of a pair, to be carried on a pole, as they are
                    frequently delineated in the tablets, so that it must mean a <hi rend="italic"
                    >companion</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and accordingly we find it in a very
                    common epithet of a king, on obelisks and elsewhere, with a circle and a bar,
                    denoting <hi rend="italic">the companion of the sun,</hi> or simply <hi
                    rend="italic">resembling the sum</hi> In the enchorial character for <hi
                    rend="italic">likewise,</hi> the symbols seem to be transposed, and the loop is
                    doubled.</p>
                <p>7. An owl, signifying <hi rend="italic">in,</hi> seems to be nearly synonymous
                    with the half arch, which is also sometimes to be understood in the sense of <hi
                    rend="italic">all.</hi> Both these characters occur also in many instances where
                    they can only be considered as marks of respect, and not very essential to the
                    sense; and in this they resemble the Coptic prefix <hi rend="smallcaps">μ,</hi>
                    which is a particle not very distinctly intelligible, nor capable of being
                    translated. It is also not a little remarkable, that the <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >μ</hi> of Akerblad’s alphabet is the enchorial character which answers to both
                    of these symbols.</p>
                <p>8, 9. A hare over two waved lines is employed, either alone, or together with a
                    head, dash, circle, and dash, which have separately a similar sense, for <hi
                    rend="italic">upon, over,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">at;</hi> and it is
                    remarkable, that a similar relation exists in Coptic between <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">chreï</hi> and <hi rend="smallcaps">ejo, jo,</hi> or <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">dcho,</hi> also meaning a head. The enchorial character, in
                    some∙of its forms, is manifestly a coarse imitation of an animal. The head is
                    always represented in the manuscripts by a character nearly like a Greek Σ; and
                    this may possibly have been the origin of the Coptic letter <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >janjia,</hi> if it was derived from a hieroglyphic; but it is equally probable
                    that it may have been intended for a combination of a <hi rend="italic"
                    >delta</hi> and a <hi rend="italic">chi.</hi></p>
                <p>10. A semicircle and an oval signify <hi rend="italic">for,</hi> and have a
                    relation to time.</p>
                <p>II. A ball, with two short appendages, one narrower than the other, occurs
                    several times on the Rosetta stone, and seems to have been intended for a head
                    seen in profile, which is often found on other monuments. This character,
                    together with a dash, seems to signify <hi rend="italic">by the,</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">each</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> for instance <hi rend="italic"
                    >every</hi> year, or <hi rend="italic">every</hi> month.</p>
                <p>12. The hat, interposed between an image and the king, can only mean <hi
                    rend="italic">of</hi> or <hi rend="italic">for.</hi> It is often substituted, in
                    passages which are frequently repeated, for the waved line, each being probably
                    equivalent to the Coptic <hi rend="smallcaps">nte',</hi> or rather N; which also
                    sometimes makes an adjective of a substantive, as NNUB, golden, from <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">nub,</hi> gold.</p>
                <p>1. A <hi rend="italic">day</hi> seems to be very naturally expressed by <hi
                    rend="italic">splendour</hi> of the <hi rend="italic">sun,</hi> or sunshine.</p>
                <p>2. A crescent turned downwards, with a star and the sun, makes up the character
                    signifying a <hi rend="italic">month</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> to which a
                    semicircle and a scale or basin are sometimes added. Horus Apollo says that a
                    month is denoted by a palm branch, or by an inverted crescent; but the crescent
                    is too indistinct on the monument of Rosetta to have allowed us to recognise it
                    without the assistance of the collateral inscriptions.</p>
                <p>3. A <hi rend="italic">year</hi> is denoted by a bent line with a little
                    projection from the middle, which seems to represent a plant with an annual
                    shoot or bud; it is commonly followed by a semicircle and a block or dash.</p>
                <p>4. There is some little uncertainty respecting the exact limits of the characters
                    denoting the first month, <hi rend="italic">Thouth.</hi> The name seems to have
                    some relation to gathering the harvest, and the emblem is probably intended for
                    a field of corn; and, perhaps, as the year is said to have begun originally with
                    the dogdays, the appropriation of this character to the first month may have
                    been contemporaneous with the origin of the calendar.</p>
                <p>5, 6. The sixth month, <hi rend="italic">^Mechir,</hi> is remarkable for having
                    half as many crescents as the twelfth, <hi rend="italic">Mesore.</hi> This
                    relation would without doubt be further illustrated if we could discover any
                    thing like a calendar among the immense mass of Egyptian literature which is
                    still in existence. The manuscript which Montfaucon calls a calendar, merely
                    because it is divided into twelve columns, has no pretensions to the name.</p>
                <p>7, 8. The symbol for the sun seems to be employed in the designation both of the
                    <hi rend="italic">first day</hi> of the month, the <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >neomenia</hi> of the Greek inscription, and of the last, or <hi rend="italic"
                    >thirtieth day.</hi> Of the characters following the sun, the one seems to mean
                    good, or rather <hi rend="italic">new,</hi> as in Thouth, the month of the new
                    year; the other <hi rend="italic">old</hi> or <hi rend="italic">last.</hi> This
                    character might be taken for a serpent, or for a branch of a tree; but it <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193643437" xml:id="kp-eb0711-3437-0334"/> seems more
                    probable that it is intended for the <hi rend="italic">tail</hi> of an animal,
                    since it occurs in several passages of the manuscripts as representing a tail;
                    and the tail of the month is sufficiently expressive of the sense.</p>
                <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Units</hi> are denoted by short lines, like the Roman I. Mr
                    Akerblad first noticed the first three numerals in the last line of the sacred
                    characters of Rosetta, where the Greek text is deficient, and the words “first
                    and second” only remain; and this observation alone was sufficient to prove that
                    the hieroglyphical characters related to a real language, and were not simply
                    ornamental decorations, as some persons have imagined.</p>
                <p>2-11. The twisted line distinguishing the <hi rend="italic">ordinal numbers</hi>
                    answers to the Coptic <hi rend="smallcaps">mah,</hi> which is prefixed to the
                    cardinals in the same sense; in the enchorial text the cor- ' responding
                    character follows the number. The <hi rend="italic">three</hi> points are more
                    commonly employed, when they follow a word, to make it plural; but when they
                    signify a numeral, they are generally placed immediately above some other
                    character; and, in the enchorial inscription, this numeral is distinguished by
                    making the lines oblique, and joining them.</p>
                <p>12. For the number <hi rend="italic">ten</hi> we have a Greek <hi rend="italic"
                    >pi,</hi> either square or rounded, not only in the inscription of Rosetta, but
                    in many other places.</p>
                <p>13. We find the number <hi rend="italic">seventeen</hi> occurring twice as a date
                    in the inscription of Rosetta; the Greek text, in another part, alluding to the
                    same period, has <hi rend="italic">eighteen</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and the
                    enchorial words are too indistinctly marked to allow us to judge of the identity
                    or diversity of the two numbers; but the difference of a day is of no
                    consequence, since the festival of the “assumption of the kingdom” may easily
                    have begun on the 17th of Mechir, and continued till the next day, which is the
                    date of the decree.</p>
                <p>14, 15. The enchorial character for <hi rend="italic">thirty,</hi> when applied
                    to years, seems to be the same as is elsewhere used in the sense of the <hi
                    rend="italic">thirtieth day</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> but the numbers are
                    almost always confused in the running hand, and exhibit several deviations from
                    the regular system of the sacred characters. The number <hi rend="italic"
                    >forty,</hi> for example, in the remarkable passage relating to the forty-two
                    assessors of Osiris, seems to be denoted by a single line with a dash on it.</p>
                <p>16-18. The curve, like the figure 9, meaning <hi rend="italic">a hundred,</hi>
                    and the notched circle, supported by a cross, denoting α <hi rend="italic"
                    >thousand,</hi> occur, in several inscriptions, so combined with units and tens,
                    as to leave no doubt respecting the numbers which they represent. This is
                    particularly evident from the consideration of an inscription “believed to have
                    been found at Karnak.” <hi rend="italic">(Description</hi><hi rend="italic">de
                    l’Egypte,</hi><hi rend="italic">Antiq.</hi> tom. iii. pl. xxxviii. F. 26. .
                    30.)</p>
                <p>19. <hi rend="italic">Plurals</hi> are distinguished by writing a character three
                    times, or by putting three dashes after it, and sometimes, perhaps, though very
                    rarely, before it; occasionally also by repeating a part of a collection of
                    symbols once only. In the manuscripts, the three dashes are generally joined
                    into a crooked stroke, which, in the enchorial inscription, sometimes both
                    precedes and follows the word; whilst, in other cases, the second stroke is
                    converted into a single vertical line, which serves to limit the extent of the
                    characters meant to be made plural; the representation being so imperfect, that
                    this assistance is more required than in the sacred characters. And it may be
                    observed, that this second mark is never wanting in the enchorial inscription,
                    as it must frequently have been if the character had been alphabetical; since
                    many of the Egyptian plurals end precisely as their singulars do, and even when
                    they differ from them, it is not by the addition of any one uniform
                    termination.</p>

                <p>The phonetic characters, according to the traces which may be discovered in the
                    words <hi rend="italic">Berenice, Ptolemy, Greek,</hi> and some others, will
                    afford something like a hieroglyphic alphabet, which, however, is merely
                    collected as a specimen of the mode of expressing sounds in some particular
                    cases, and not as having been universally employed where sounds were required.

                    probably also to some other symbols which have been the prototypes of the
                    characters. It is taken from the alphabet of Akerblad, but is considerably

                    Champollion pretends that his labours on the demotic text of the Rosetta
                    inscription had also led him to increase, and in certain points to rectify, the
                    alphabet of Mr Akerblad; and that the comparison of the hieratic manuscripts
                    with a large hieroglyphical papyrus had enabled him to ascertain that the
                    hieratic was a simple tachygraphy of the hieroglyphic writing. In this last
                    point, however, he seems to have been anticipated by Tyschen of Göttingen, who,
                    as early as the year 1816, announced to the world, in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Magasin Encyclopédique,</hi> that the hieratic was merely an abridged or
                    simplified form of the hieroglyphical method of writing.</p>

                <p>The enchorial text in many parts agrees extremely well with the hieroglyphics,
                    according to the general style of imitation which has already been explained and
                    exemplified, although in some passages there is a greater difference than might
                    have been expected. The beginning of the enchorial line seems to contain the
                    word <hi rend="italic">decree,</hi> which cannot be found in this part of the
                    hieroglyphics; the character for letters occurs three times in it, as if the
                    sacred character used in the third place meant <hi rend="italic">language;</hi>
                    the sacerdotal decree of the sacred characters is omitted in the corresponding
                    part of the enchorial; the word <hi rend="italic">temples</hi> is repeated
                    before each numeral; the term <hi rend="italic">wherο-ever</hi> is amplified;
                    the image is a very coarse imitation, and is followed by the character for a
                    deity, meaning sacred or divine; and, lastly, the name of Ptolemy is omitted,
                    the word king being only followed by “whose life shall be for ever,” or a phrase
                    of similar import.</p>

                <p>The subjoined specimens of a comparison of the different manuscripts, which
                    deviate more or less from the form of distinct hieroglyphics, with others in
                    which those characters are preserved almost entire, though slightly traced, will
                    serve to show the complete identity of the different systems in their original
                    form; the first and fourth lines being taken from the great hieratic manuscript
                    of Strasburg, and the rest from other copies of the same text, which are
                    universally considered as written in the epistolographic character. We cannot
                    discover the entire connected sense of the whole passages, but we may easily
                    observe the symbols for <hi rend="italic">gods, established, Osiris, Isis,

                <p>V. DR <hi rend="smallcaps">young’s</hi> OBSERVATIONS ON THE GENERAL CHARACTER OF
                    THE EGYPTIAN MONUMENTS.</p>
                <p>By means of the knowledge of the hieroglyphic characters which has already been
                    obtained, we are fully competent to form a general idea of the nature of the
                    inscriptions on the principal Egyptian monuments which are extant. Numerous as
                    they are, there is scarcely one of them which we are not able to refer to the
                    class either of sepulchral or of votive inscriptions; astronomical and
                    chronological there seem to be none, since the numerical characters, which have
                    been perfectly ascertained, have not yet been found to occur in such a form as
                    they necessarily must have assumed in the records of this description. Of an
                    historical nature, we can only find the triumphal, which are often sufficiently
                    distinguishable, but they also may always be referred to the votive; since
                    whoever related his own exploits thought it wisest to attribute the glory <hi
                    rend="italic">of</hi> them to some deity, and whoever recorded those of another
                    was generally disposed to intermix divine honours with his panegyric. It has,
                    indeed, been asserted that the Egyptians were not in the habit of deifying any
                    mortal persons; but the inscription of Rosetta is by no means the only one in
                    which the sovereigns of ⅞ypt are inserted in the number of its deities. The
                    custom is observable in monuments of a much earlier age; indeed, in such a
                    country it might be considered as a kind of dilemma of degradation, whether it
                    was most ridiculous to be made a divinity, or to be excluded from so plebeian an
                    assemblage; but flattery is more prone to err <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193643476" xml:id="kp-eb0711-3476-0337"/>by commission than by
                    omission, and consequently we find the terms <hi rend="italic">hing</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">god</hi> very generally inseparable. The sepulchral inscriptions,
                    from the attention which was paid in Egypt to the obsequies of the dead, appear,
                    upon the whole, to constitute the most considerable part of the Egyptian
                    literature which remains; and they afford us, upon a comparative examination,
                    some very remarkable peculiarities. The general tenor of all these inscriptions
                    appears to be, as might have been expected from the testimony of Herodotus, the
                    identification of the deceased with the god Osiris, and probably, if a female,
                    with Isis; and the subject of the most usual representations seems to be the
                    reception of this new personage by the principal deities, to whom he now stands
                    in a relation expressed in the respective inscriptions; the honour of an
                    apotheosis, reserved by the ancient Romans for emperors, and by the modern for
                    saints, having been apparently extended by the old Egyptians to private
                    individuals of all descriptions. It required an extensive comparison of these
                    inscriptions to recognise their precise nature, since they seldom contain a name
                    surrounded by a ring in its usual form. Sometimes, however, as on the green
                    sarcophagus of the British Museum, a distinct name is very often repeated, and
                    preceded by that of Osiris; whilst, in most other instances, there is a certain
                    combination of characters, bearing evident relation to the personage delineated,
                    which occurs, after the symbols of Osiris, instead of the name; so that either
                    the ring was simply omitted on this occasion, or a new and perhaps a mysterious
                    name was employed, consisting frequently of the appellations of several distinct
                    deities, and probably analogous to the real name. That the characteristic
                    phrase, so repeated, must have had some relation to the deceased, is proved by
                    its scarcely ever being alike in any two monuments which have been compared;
                    whilst almost every other part of the manuscripts and inscriptions is the same
                    in many different instances, and some of them in almost all; and this same
                    phrase may be observed, in Lord Mountnorris’s and Mr Bankes’s manuscripts,
                    placed over the head of the person who is brought up between the two goddesses,
                    to make his appearance before Osiris, in his own person, and in his judicial
                    capacity, with his counsellors about him, and the balance of justice before him.
                    <hi rend="italic">(Hieroglyphics,</hi> 5 E F G e f.) In this instance the phrase
                    consists of the names of <hi rend="italic">Hyperion</hi> and the <hi
                    rend="italic">Sun,</hi> preceded by a block and an arm with an offering; and it
                    may be interpreted, without any violence, “the votary of Hyperion and of Phré.”
                    In a small manuscript, engraved by Denon, the part which resembles the
                    characteristic phrase of other manuscripts is followed by the name of a king,
                    which is nearly identical with that of the father of the Pseudomemnon in the
                    British Museum; the one having the hieralpha laid flat, the other the traces of
                    the pedestal, which are equivalent to it.</p>
                <p>The tablet of the last judgment, which is so well illustrated by the testimony of
                    Diodorus concerning the funerals of the Egyptians, is found near the end of
                    almost all the manuscripts upon papyrus, which are so frequently discovered in
                    the coffins of the mummies, and, amongst ethers, in Lord Mountnorris’s hieratic
                    manuscript, printed in the Collection of the Egyptian Society. The great deity
                    sits on the left, holding the hook and the whip or fan; his name and titles are
                    generally placed over him; but this part of the present manuscript is a little
                    injured. Before him is a kind of mace, supporting something like the skin of a
                    leopard; then a female Cerberus, and on a shelf over her head the tetrad of
                    Termini, which have already been distinguished by the names Tetrarcha, Anubis,
                    Macedo, and Hieracion, each having had his appropriate denomination written over
                    his head. Behind the Cerberus stands Thoth, with his style and tablet, having
                    just begun to write. Over his head, in two columns, we find his name and titles,
                    including his designation as a scribe. The balance follows, with a little baboon
                    as a kind of genius sitting on it. Under the beam stand Cteristes and Hyperion,
                    who are employed in adjusting the equipoise; but their names in this manuscript
                    are omitted. The five columns over the balance are only remarkable as
                    containing, in this instance, the characteristic phrase, or the name of the
                    deceased, intermixed with other characters. Beyond the balance stands a female,
                    holding the sceptre of Isis, who seems to be called Rhea, the wife of the sun.
                    She is looking back at the personage who holds up his hand as a mark of respect,
                    and who is identified as the deceased by the name simply placed over him,
                    without any exordium. He is followed by a second goddess, who is also holding up
                    her hands in token of respect, and whose name looks like a personification of
                    honour or glory, unless it is simply intended to signify “a divine priestess”
                    belonging to the order of the Pterophori mentioned on the Rosetta monument. The
                    forty-two assessors are wanting in this tablet; and, in many other manuscripts,
                    their number is curtailed, to make room for other subjects; but, in several of
                    those which are engraved in the <hi rend="italic">Description de l</hi><hi
                    rend="italic superscript"> ,</hi><hi rend="italic">Egypte,</hi> they are all
                    represented, sometimes as sitting figures, and sometimes standing as Termini,
                    with their feet united.</p>
                <p>The principal part of the text of all these manuscripts appears to consist of a
                    collection of hymns, or rather homages, to certain deities, generally expressed
                    in the name of the deceased, with his title of Osiris, although the true Osiris
                    is not excluded from the groups which are introduced. The upper part of each
                    manuscript is occupied by a series of pictural tablets; and under them are
                    vertical columns of distinct hieroglyphics, or, in the epistolographic
                    manuscripts, pages of the text, which are commonly divided into paragraphs, with
                    a tablet at the head of each, the first words being constantly written with red
                    ink, made of a kind of ochre, as the black is of a carbonaceous substance. The
                    beginning of the manuscript is seldom entire, being always at the outside of the
                    roll; as the <hi rend="italic">umbilicus</hi> of the Romans was synonymous with
                    the end. Not far from the beginning, we always find a large tablet, occupying
                    the whole depth of the paper, representing the sun adored by his ministering
                    spirits. In the large hieratic manuscript, which occupies four plates of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Description de l’</hi><hi rend="italic">Egypte,</hi> and which may
                    be considered as a fine specimen of the most highly finished copies, there are
                    at present only four columns remaining before this tablet.</p>
                <p>It is followed by a short section, with a rubric, which is not very distinctly
                    expressed; after this are thirty-five others, beginning with a long rubric,
                    which is usually followed by the name of a divinity, represented in a
                    neighbouring part of the margin, and which may be supposed to mean something
                    like “Respect and reverence be paid to each of the sacred powers.” The next ten
                    sections begin with the rubric of a feather, <pb break="no" facs="nls:193643489"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0711-3489-0338"/>and a sitting figure raising his hand to his head,
                    as if holding a vase on it, meaning probably “Honour is due,” or belonging to;
                    then follow the name and titles of Thoth or Hermes, and the phrase describing
                    the deceased in the character of Osiris; and afterwards the names of each of a
                    group of deities, which is represented in the corresponding tablet with an altar
                    and a suppliant before them. These groups are different in the different
                    sections, but they correspond pretty accurately with each other in the various
                    manuscripts; and this hermetic decade is the most constant part of the
                    manuscripts found with the mummies, though a little more extended in some than
                    it is in others. <hi rend="italic">{Hieroglyphics,</hi> 4.) After these, we find
                    thirty-five sections, beginning with a drop, a feather, a serpent, and a line;
                    the rubric being immediately followed by the deified name peculiar to the
                    manuscript. This exordium, from the analogy of the term sacred, we can have no
                    hesitation in understanding as a derivative of the feather, signifying honour or
                    ornament, and the serpent signifying perpetuity, and in translating it, “Eternal
                    honour” or respect. A similar sense seems, in other places, to be expressed by
                    the open square or the pyramid instead of the feather; and not uncommonly the
                    hat is substituted for the line, without any variation of the meaning.</p>
                <p>After these thirty-five sections, we have two others, of which the rubrics are
                    less intelligible, followed by forty-two short ones, which evidently contain the
                    names and titles of as many separate deities, whose figures are commonly
                    represented in the great tablet, near that of Osiris. We may generally observe,
                    amongst the epithets of each, the term <hi rend="italic">illustrious</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">;</hi> and each section has a second paragraph, beginning with a
                    pair of arms extended, a character which seems occasionally to be used in
                    reference to the equal scales of justice, though on the stone of Rosetta it
                    appears to signify a kind of temple, so that it may possibly relate to the
                    honours to be paid to these divine judges. With a few additional columns, and
                    with the great tablet of the judgment, the manuscript concludes. It does not
                    contain the figure of the sacred cow, which is the termination of most other
                    manuscripts; nor the agricultural representations, which are frequently found in
                    many of them, especially in that of Lord Mountnorris <hi rend="italic"
                    >{Hieroglyphics,</hi> 3), with the three deities sitting in a grotto under it.
                    The last of these, according to the inscriptions over the two boats, is meant
                    for Arueris, the second apparently for the mother of the sun, and the first for
                    Osiris; and one of the boats carries the steps, which seem to be emblematic of
                    the solar power; the other, the throne or chair of state, which is universally
                    appropriated to Osiris.</p>
                <p>The coffins of the mummies, and the large sarcophagi of stone, are generally
                    covered with representations extremely similar to some of those which are found
                    in the manuscripts. ' The judicial tablet is frequently delineated on the middle
                    of the coffins; above it are Isis and Nephthe at the sides, and in the middle
                    apparently Rhea with outspread wings. The space below is chiefly occupied by
                    figures of from twenty to thirty of the principal deities, to whom the deceased,
                    in his mystical character, is doing homage; each of them being probably
                    designated by the relationship in which he stands to the new representative of
                    Osiris. In the sculptures, the figures are generally less numerous; the same
                    deities are commonly represented as on the painted coffins, but without the
                    repetition of the suppliant, and in an order subject to some little variation.
                    The large sarcophagus of granite, in the British Museum, which was brought from
                    Cairo, and formerly called the Lover’s Fountain, has the name of Apis, as a part
                    of the characteristic denomination. This circumstance, at first sight, seemed to
                    make it evident that it must have been intended to contain the mummy of an Apis,
                    for which its magnitude renders it well calculated; but when the symbols of
                    other deities were found in the mystic names upon various other monuments, this
                    inference could no longer be considered as absolutely conclusive.</p>
                <p>Of the votive or dedicatory inscriptions, we find an interesting example on a
                    small scale, in the engraving on the bottom of a scaraboeus, very neatly
                    sculptured in a softish steatite, or lapis ollaris, brought from Egypt by Mr
                    Legh.</p>
                <p>It is remarkable for its simplicity, and for affording an intelligible sense in
                    all its parts. The chain, the semicircle, and the square block, mean clearly [
                    <hi rend="italic">To] the beloved;</hi> the loop supporting a wreath or crown,
                    and the imperfect sitting figure, resemble some of the titles often given to
                    Osiris, and, with the following oval, pretty certainly signify <hi rend="italic"
                    >of the great god;</hi> the throne, the semicircle, and the oval, <hi
                    rend="italic">Isis;</hi> the sitting figure, <hi rend="italic">the goddess;</hi>
                    the looped wreath, perhaps <hi rend="italic">the great;</hi> the bird and
                    circle, <hi rend="italic">offspring of;</hi> the hieralpha or plough, and the
                    two feathers, <hi rend="italic">Phthah;</hi> the pillar, perhaps <hi
                    rend="italic">the powerful,</hi> but it is not distinctly formed; the beetle
                    seems to be here a synonym or epithet of Phthah, as if <hi rend="italic">the

                    ring with the handle seems to be nearly synonymous with the chain, and may be
                    rendered, in conjunction with the line and the hieralpha, <hi rend="italic">the
                    approved of Phthah,</hi> an epithet found in the inscription of Rosetta; the

                    >;</hi> and the concluding ring and staff or hatchet may either mean, <hi
                    rend="italic">this is dedicated,</hi> or may, with rather more probability, be
                    considered as a reduplication of the beginning of the line, in an inverted
                    position. It may be remarked, that all the inscriptions on the scaraboei run
                    from right to left, as is most commonly observed wherever the direction was
                    indifferent; so that if they were used as seals, the impression must have
                    assumed the form which is somewhat less usual in other cases.</p>
                <p>We have a most valuable example of a dedicatory inscription on a larger scale in
                    the decree preserved on the monument of Rosetta, which, besides its utility in
                    affording the only existing clue for deciphering the hieroglyphical characters,
                    gives us also a very complete idea of the general style of the records of the
                    Egyptian hierarchy.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>In
                    another place, Dr Young, after remarking that the French expedition to Egypt was
                    most liberally provided, by the government of the day, with a select body of
                    antiquaries, architects, surveyors, naturalists, and draughtsmen, whose business
                    it ’.vas to investigate all that was interesting to science or to literature in
                    that singular country, and, further, that their labours have been made public
                    with all the advantage, of chalcographical and typographical elegance in the
                    splendid collection entitled <hi rend="italic">Description de l’</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Egypte,</hi> proceeds to observe: “But it is scarcely too much to
                    say, that the only real benefit conferred on Egyptian literature by that
                    expedition, was the discovery of a huge broken block of black stone, in digging
                    for the foundations of Fort St Julian, near Ilosetta, which the British army had
                    afterwards the honour of bringing to this country as a proud trophy of their
                    gallantry and success. It is not to a want of ability, nor of industry, nor of
                    accuracy, nor of fidelity, in the Egyptian Commission, that so total a failure
                    is to be at <pb break="no" n="339"/>tributed; but partly to the real difficulty
                    of the subject, and still more to the preconceived opinion, which was very
                    generally en-ertained by their men of letters, of the exorbitant antiquity of
                    the Egyptian works of art, which caused them to neglect the lights that might
                    have been derived from a comparison of Greek and Roman inscriptions, with the
                    hieroglyphics in their neighbourhood; and to suppose, that whatever bore the
                    date of less than thirty or forty centuries, must necessarily be an
                    interpolation, unconnected with the original architecture and decorations of the
                    edifice to which it belonged.” <hi rend="italic">(Account of some Recent
                    Discoveries in Hieroglyphical Literature,</hi> pp. 4, 5.) We shall hereafter
                    find that this opinion was not confined to the members of the Egyptian
                    Commission. Others have entertained the same extravagant notion of the antiquity
                    of the Egyptian monuments, and, what has proved even More prejudicial, have lost
                    sight of the important fact that, by the aid of translations alone, can we ever
                    hope to attain the means of interpreting the inscriptions with which they are
                    covered. It is only by pursuing analytical processes analogous to that of which
                    Dr .Young gave the first example,—by making repeated trials and comparisons with
                    translations to guide and direct us,—by following the method of exhaustion, and
                    at each step narrowing the limits of error,—that the truth will ultimately be
                    attained, and a sure foundation be laid for constructing a system of
                    interpretation alike certain in its principles and universal in its
                    application.</p></note> Of <pb break="no" facs="nls:193643502"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0711-3502-0339"/>the triumphal monuments, the most magnificent are
                    the obelisks, which are reported by Pliny to have been dedicated to the sun; and
                    there is every reason to suppose that the translation of one of these
                    inscriptions, preserved by Ammianus Marcellinus, after Hermapion, contains a
                    true representation of a part of its contents, more especially as “the mighty
                    Apollo” of Hermapion agrees completely with the hawk, the bull, and the arm,
                    which usual-fly occupy the beginning of each inscription. These symbols are
                    generally followed by a number of pompous titles, not always very intimately
                    connected with each other, and amongst’them we often discover that of “Lord of
                    the asp-bearing diadems,” with some other epithets immediately preceding the
                    name and parentage of the sovereign who is the principal subject of the
                    inscription. The obelisk at Heliopolis is without the bull; and the whole
                    inscription may be supposed to have signified something of this kind: “This
                    Apollinean trophy is consecrated to the honour of King Ramesses, crowned with an
                    asp-bearing diadem; it is consecrated to the honour of the son of Heron, the
                    ornament of his country, beloved by Phthah, living for ever; it is consecrated
                    to the honour of the revered and beneficent deity Ramesses, great in glory,
                    superior to his enemies; by the decree of an assembly, to the powerful and
                    flourishing, whose life shall be without end.” It is true that some parts of
                    this interpretation are in a great measure conjectural; but none of it is
                    altogether arbitrary, or unsupported by some probable analogy; and the spirit
                    and tenor of the inscription are probably unimpaired by the alterations which
                    this approximation to the sense may unavoidably have introduced.</p>
                <p>Of the obelisks still in existence, there are perhaps about thirty larger and
                    smaller, which may be considered as genuine. Several others are decidedly
                    spurious, having been chiefly sculptured at Rome in imitation of the Egyptian
                    style, but so negligently and unskilfully as to exhibit a striking difference
                    even in the character of the workmanship. Such are the Pamphilian, in
                    explanation of which the laborious Kircher has published a folio volume, and the
                    Barberinian or Veranian. In both of these the emblems are put together in a
                    manner wholly arbitrary; and where an attempt is made to imitate the appearance
                    of a name, the characters are completely different at each repetition. The
                    Sallustian obelisk has also been broken, and joined inaccurately, and some
                    modern restitutions have been very awkwardly introduced, as becomes evident upon
                    comparing with each other the figures of Kircher and of Zoega. Another very
                    celebrated monument, the Isiac table, which has been the subject of much
                    profound discussion, and has given birth to many refined mythological
                    speculations, is equally incapable of supporting a minute examination upon solid
                    grounds; for the inscriptions neither bear any relation to the figures near
                    which they are placed, nor form any connected sense of their own; and the whole
                    is undoubtedly the work of a Roman sculptor, imitating only the general style
                    and the separate delineations of the Egyptian tablets; as indeed some of the
                    most learned and acute of our critical antiquaries had already asserted,
                    notwithstanding the contrary opinions of several foreigners, of the highest
                    reputation for their intimate acquaintance with the works of Greek and Roman
                    art. We may hope, however, that in future these unprofitable discussions and
                    disputes will become less and less frequent, and that our knowledge of the
                    antiquities of Egypt will gain as much in the solidity and sufficiency of its
                    evidence, as it may probably lose in its hypothetical symmetry and its imaginary
                    extent; and whilst we allow every latitude to legitimate reasoning and cautious
                    conjecture in the search after historical truth, we must peremptorily exclude
                    from our investigations an attachment to fanciful systems and presupposed
                    analogies on the one hand, and a too implicit deference to traditional authority
                    on the other.</p>
                <p>VI. FURTHER INVESTIGATIONS OF DR YOUNG; CASATI AND TURIN MANUSCRIPTS.</p>
                <p>The Egyptian investigations of Dr Young had been as laborious as they were
                    unremitting; but, at this stage, they had, in his own estimation, “been so
                    little enlivened by any fortunate coincidences or unexpected facilities,” that,
                    having occasion to adopt a motto, he chose the words <hi rend="italic"
                    >Fortunam</hi><hi rend="italic">ex</hi><hi rend="italic">aliis</hi> as
                    appropriate to his own history. But the result showed that, in giving way to
                    this fretful and complaining humour, he did injustice to fortune, which had in
                    reserve for him a most “fortunate coincidence,” the occurrence of which forms an
                    epoch in the history of these investigations. We allude to the marvellous
                    accident of the existence of a Greek manuscript, in perfect preservation, which,
                    upon examination, proved to be a translation of an unique Egyptian manuscript,
                    that had been purchased by the king of France. A little previous detail is
                    necessary to put the reader in full possession of the facts.</p>
                <p>In 1820 or 1821, an individual of the name of Casati arrived at Paris, bringing
                    with him a parcel of Egyptian manuscripts, amongst which Μ. Champoilion
                    discovered one the preamble <hi rend="italic">of</hi> which bore a considerable
                    resemblance to the enchorial text of the Rosetta inscription. This observation
                    naturally excited considerable interest, from its immediate connection with a
                    subject which then engrossed the attention of the learned; and accordingly, Dr
                    Young, having procured a transcript of the papyrus in question, immediately
                    proceeded, with his accustomed ardour, to decipher and translate it. But whilst
                    he was engaged in this difficult and laborious undertaking, in which, by his own
                    unaided exertions, he had made considerable progress, Mr, afterwards Sir George
                    Francis Grey, returned from his travels in the East, bringing with him several
                    fine specimens of writing and drawing on papyrus, which he had purchased from an
                    Arab at Thebes in January 1820. Fortunately for the cause of Egyptian
                    literature, Mr Grey instantly put these manuscripts into the hands of Dr Young,
                    at the same time calling his attention to two of them in particular, which were
                    in a high state of preservation, and contained some Greek characters, apparently
                    written in a pretty legible hand. Upon a closer inspection, <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193643515" xml:id="kp-eb0711-3515-0340"/>however, it was found that
                    one of these, being the <hi rend="italic">antigraph</hi> of an Egyptian deed or
                    conveyance, was altogether in Greek; whilst in the other, and in two more of the
                    same kind, the <hi rend="italic">registry</hi> was in Greek, and the <hi
                    rend="italic">agreement,</hi> or body of the deed, in the enchorial
                    character.</p>
                <p>Without losing a moment, Dr Young proceeded to examine that which was in Greek
                    only, and, to his inexpressible surprise and delight, discovered that it was a
                    translation of the enchorial manuscript of Casati. “I could scarcely believe,”
                    says he, “that I was awake, and in my sober senses, when ĩ observed, among the

                    lines further back, <hi rend="italic">Portis</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Apollonii,</hi> although the last word could not have been deciphered without
                    the assistance of the conjecture which immediately occurred to me, that this
                    manuscript might perhaps be a translation of the enchorial manuscript of Casati.
                    I found that its beginning was, <hi rend="italic">A Copy of an Egyptian
                    Writing</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and I proceeded to ascertain that there
                    were the same number of names intervening between the Greek and Egyptian
                    signatures which I had identified, and that the same number followed the last of
                    them; and the whole number of witnesses appeared to be sixteen in each. The last
                    paragraph in the Greek began with the words, <hi rend="italic">Copy of the
                    Registry</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> for such must be the signification of the
                    word ΠTΠMATOΣ employed in this papyrus, though it does not appear to occur
                    anywhere else in a similar signification. I could not therefore but conclude,
                    that a very extraordinary chance had brought into my possession a document,
                    which was not very likely, in the first place, ever to have existed, still less
                    to have been preserved uninjured, through a period of near two thousand years;
                    but that this very extraordinary translation should have been brought safely to
                    Europe, to England, and to me, at the very moment when it was most of all
                    desirable to me to possess it, as the illustration of an original which I was
                    then studying, but without any reasonable hope of being able fully to comprehend
                    it—this combination would, in other times, have been considered as affording
                    ample evidence of my having become an Egyptian sorcerer.”<note anchored="true"

                <p>But a still more extraordinary coincidence, connected with the revival of
                    Egyptian literature, remains to be mentioned. Exclusively of the Greek
                    antigraph, which relates to the sale of part of the offerings made from time to
                    time on account of a certain number of mummies, Mr Grey’s collection contained a
                    second papyrus of considerably greater magnitude, upon which were engrossed
                    three other deeds or conveyances, with separate registries upon the margin
                    written in very legible Greek. In the hope of making some further progress in
                    the study of Egyptian, Dr Young had resumed the examination of these enchorial
                    conveyances, and, amongst other things, had observed the agreement of the
                    numbers in the registries and in the Egyptian text; but whilst he was thus
                    occupied, Μ. Peyron’s account and translation of an Egyptian papyrus in the
                    Royal Library at Turin made its appearance,<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    Amadeus Peyron, the ingenious translator of this papyrus, is known to civilians

                    place.</p></note> and proved to be the record of a law-suit, in which reference
                    is made to three distinct title-deeds or conveyances. The following is an
                    abstract of the contents of this singular instrument.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>This abstract is taken from Dr Young’s <hi

                <p>The record begins with a date: “In the year <hi rend="smallcaps">liv.</hi> the
                    22d of Athyr, at Diospolis. Before Heraclides, one of the captains of the

                    the same rank, and gymnasiarch; Apollonius, the son of Apollonius, and

                    >Cholchytae</hi> were probably so called “ab <hi rend="italic">involvendo</hi>
                    cadavere and hence the name is supposed by Dr Young to be a derivative of the
                    Egyptian word DCHOLH or JOLH, <hi rend="italic">to dress, to put on,</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">to swathe.</hi> Μ. Peyron indeed dissents from the opinion that
                    they were “dressers,” observing that “i Colchiti non sono piu <hi rend="italic"
                    >dressers,</hi> sacri 'paratori delle divinità, come sospettò il Y.” He
                    confesses, however, that “etymon tamen acute vidit,” and adds, that “dicti sunt
                    ab <hi rend="italic">involvendo</hi> cadavere,” conformably to the Coptic
                    etymology suggested by Dr Young. But the author of an <hi rend="italic">Essay on
                    the Enchorial Language of Egypt,</hi> published at Dublin, 1833, ridicules as
                    groundless and absurd the etymology proposed by the English and approved by the
                    Italian scholar. “The name of this profession, <hi rend="italic">χ,oaχ</hi><hi
                    rend="italic subscript"> ι</hi><hi rend="italic">υτr,s,"</hi> says he, “is not
                    to be found in any Greek lexico; it is, however, analogically formed, and
                    conveys a clear meaning, ‘ the pourer out of libations.’ Dr Young read the word
                    <hi rend="italic">χ</hi><hi rend="italic                     subscript">
                    ι</hi><hi rend="italic">oλχ</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> ι</hi><hi

                    >,</hi> and supposed it to be derived from a Coptic word signifying ‘ to dress,’
                    as if the mummies, <hi rend="italic">after</hi> being buried, were every now and
                    then taken up to be dressed-The mistake is a palpable one.” We think it is, but
                    only on the part of the Dublin critic. For, in the first place, if the name of
                    this profession be not found n any Greek Lexico, Dr Young and Μ. Peyron had
                    surely as good a right to call it as the writer in question had to call it
                    “secondly, the word read in the manuscripts is not <hi rend="italic"
                    >χoaxprris,</hi> but <hi rend="italic">χoλχprns,</hi> and in such a matter their
                    authority must certainly be preferred to a mere unsupported conjecture; thirdly,
                    from the terms of the record contained in the Turin manuscript, it appears that
                    it was the business of persons belonging to this profession, not to “pour out
                    libations,” but to “dress” or “swathe” dead bodies after these had been
                    embalmed; and, lastly, although Egyptian mummies were unquestionably “dressed”
                    or “swathed” <hi rend="italic">after</hi> being <hi rend="italic">embalmed,</hi>
                    it is worse than ridiculous to allege that the existence of such a profession as
                    that of the Colchytae would imply that these “mummies, <hi rend="italic"
                    >after</hi> being <hi rend="italic">buried,</hi> were, every now and then, taken
                    up to be <hi rend="italic">dressed."</hi> If, then, “the Colchytae have passed
                    muster in many Reviews and Encyclopaedias,” it is probably because an
                    ascertained reading, supported by collateral evidence, has been thought
                    preferable to an “imaginary word” like <hi rend="italic">χβaχυm,</hi> which,
                    though “analogically formed,” would convey a meaning inconsistent with the
                    truth. <hi rend="superscript"> o</hi></p></note> of the place, Horus, and
                    Psenchonsis, and Chonapres, and their family.” A memorial which had been
                    addressed to Hermias, strategus, or commander-in-chief, and governor of the
                    nome, was then read; in which the plaintiff, Hermias, accuses the Cholchytae,
                    and mentions a former memorial addressed to Demetrius, the epistrategus or high
                    commander in the preceding year, and which had been referred by Hermias, the
                    strategus, to the judgment of Heraclides. The cause having been pleaded by
                    Philocles for Hermias, and by Dinon for the Cholchytae, Heraclides summed up the
                    evidence, discussed the arguments on both sides, and finally gave judgment for
                    the defendants.</p>
                <p>The claim of Hermias seems to have been founded on an alleged right of property,
                    supported only by an admission on the part of Lobais or Lubais, one of the
                    vendors of the house, that she had never had any right or title to the tenement
                    in question. He had maintained in the memorial that his ancestors had held
                    possessions in Diospolis during their lives respectively; that the defendants,
                    whose proper habitation was confined to the Memnonia, where their ancestors had
                    resided, knowing that he had been induced by the troubles of the times to change
                    his residence, had seized upon his house, which was situated in the <pb

                    part of Diospolis, to the north of the course or parade leading to the canal of
                    the great goddess Juno, and to the south of the course leading to the temple of
                    Ceres, the walls of which were left standing; that when they had repaired it
                    they continued to occupy it, and, not content with simple occupation, they had
                    received into it <hi rend="italic">dead bodies,</hi> not considering the
                    penalties to which they became liable from their proximity to the courses or
                    parades of the great goddesses Juno and Ceres, which would be equally polluted
                    by the corpses and those who had charge of them.</p>
                <p>The Cholchytae, on the other hand, alleged, first, that Hermias had already been
                    nonsuited in a similar action brought on the same grounds; and, secondly, that
                    they had been in possession of the house for many generations, an averment in
                    support of which they produced their <hi rend="italic">Egyptian title-deeds</hi>

                    attests the sale of a fourth part of the said house, being 3⅜ cubits, to
                    Pechytes, the father of the others, Panas, and Patus, and Pasemis, and
                    Arpchemis, and Se-namunis, by Ammonius and Zbendetis, to whom it belonged. The
                    duties on these transactions had also been paid into the office for the purchase
                    of the tribute; and the parties had held undisturbed possession for thirty-seven
                    years. Some passages of the Benevolent Edict are also cited, in which it is
                    provided that such persons as have for a length of time been in possession of
                    property shall be continued therein even though they be unable to produce the
                    titles by which it was originally acquired. It was added by Dinon, on the part
                    of the defendants, that, since the plaintiffs father left Diospolis at the time
                    of the troubles under Epiphanes, his departure must have taken place

                    claim, except a fraudulent decree obtained in collusion with Lobais, who had no
                    interest in defending the action; that with respect to the removal of the
                    embalmers to the Memnonia, the subject was wholly foreign to the question, as
                    Horus and his colleagues were not embalmers, but dressers <hi rend="italic"

                    processions, when Ammon passes over to the Memnonia, it was their privilege to
                    be the leaders of the ceremony, to act as Cholchytae, and to be rewarded
                    accordingly.</p>
                <p>Such is an abstract of this extraordinary document, which, besides its general
                    interest, embodies the most curious details illustrative of the notions
                    entertained respecting property, and also of the mode in which justice was
                    administered, amongst the Egyptians. But the most remarkable circumstance
                    connected with it yet remains to be mentioned. For, if the reader turn to the
                    <hi rend="italic">three</hi> conveyances of Sir George Grey, as translated by Dr
                    Young,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic"
                    >Discoveries in Hìeroglyphical Literature,</hi> pp. 78-83.</p></note> he will
                    find, to his astonishment, that <hi rend="italic">they</hi> are the actual
                    title-deeds founded on in the abridgment of the record which we have here placed
                    before him. Μ. Peyron, indeed, has only identified <hi rend="italic">two</hi> of
                    them, the purchasers mentioned in the registry of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >third</hi> being Ammonius and Psenamu-nis instead of Ammonius and Zbendetis or
                    Zthenaëtis; but it is probable that Zbendetis or Zthenaëtis had two names, as
                    well as Sisois or Spois, who is also called Erie us; for the date of the deed
                    coincides perfectly with the record, and the same thing may be said of all the
                    rest of the names, as well as the measures, in which there is the most entire
                    agreement. It would almost seem, therefore, that the age of miracles has not yet
                    passed away. Whilst Dr Young was occupied in studying the enchorial papyrus of
                    Casati, the Greek manuscript of Sir George Grey, being the antigraph of an
                    Egyptian deed, arrived as if by conjuration, and proved to be a translation of
                    the document before him; and, next, when the same learned and ingenious person
                    had been accidentally led to resume consideration of the Egyptian deeds of Sir
                    George Grey, the record of a lawsuit founded upon, and expressly referring to,
                    these very deeds, arrived unexpectedly from Turin, and afforded a precise
                    confirmation of the date which, from the Egyptian text, he had previously
                    assigned to the <hi rend="italic">first deed,</hi> together with an exact
                    description of the precise spots of ground to which all the three conveyances
                    relate. Here, then, we have a series of “fortunate coincidences,” such as have
                    seldom concurred in confirmation of a new discovery, and which, happening*· at
                    the propitious instant of time, when their great importance could not fail to be
                    at once perceived, contributed materially, not only to establish what had been
                    previously done, but also to facilitate the prosecution of future researches in
                    the same field of inquiry.</p>
                <p>VII. INVESTIGATIONS AND DISCOVERIES OFCHAMPOLLION AND OTHERS.</p>
                <p>Although for a number of years it has been the custom to speak with enthusiasm of
                    the discovery of the phonetic alphabet made by Μ. Champollion, few persons
                    appear to have a distinct idea, either of what it really is, or of the results
                    which have been obtained by means of it. That Dr Young was the original author
                    of this discovery has already been shown in the preceding sections, and may be
                    proved, independently of all that has yet been stated, by evidence of the most
                    incontrovertible kind. As early as the year 1818, he had ascertained the
                    alphabetical value of the greater part of the hieroglyphical signs which compose
                    the names of <hi rend="italic">Ptolemy</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Berenice,</hi>
                    amongst which he had very exactly determined seven corresponding with the
                    results obtained by Μ. Champoilion, viz. the phonetic signs of B, F, I, Μ, N, P,
                    and T. But although the determination of these seven letters must be regarded as
                    the basis on which Μ. Champoilion founded his phonetic alphabet, the sagacity of
                    the English scholar, signally displayed in the discovery itself, did not foresee
                    the consequences to which it might lead; and it was reserved for his French
                    competitor to reap the glory which justly attaches to the development and
                    illustration of a principle, fertile in results of the very highest interest and
                    importance. Dr Young had adopted the notion that the characters employed by the
                    Egyptians were essentially ideographic or symbolical, and were only used <hi

                    combinations of sound; but this idea, though it led him to neglect the
                    prosecution of his own discovery, did not prevent him from laying the foundation
                    of the hieroglyphicophonetic alphabet, afterwards improved and extended by Μ.
                    Champoilion, and from presenting an enchorial alphabet comparatively so complete
                    that but few additions of any importance have since been made to it by his
                    successors. In short, to use the words of Mr Salt, Dr Young seems to us to stand
                    alone with regard to the progress made by him in the enchorial, as well as for
                    having led the way to the true knowledge of hieroglyphics.<note anchored="true"

                <p>A considerable time previous to the date of this dicovery, however, Μ.
                    Champollion had applied himself to the interpretation of hieroglyphics; indeed,
                    from the period of his quitting the Lyceum, he had begun to devote himself with
                    ardour to this study. Jablonski, Zoega, and the authors of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Description</hi><hi rend="italic">de l’Egypte,</hi> then exercised a sort of
                    dominion over the different branches of Egyptian antiquities. The mythology of
                    Egypt was exclusively explained by relative passages in the ancient writers, and
                    vain theories, which could never lead to any positive results, were applied to
                    the hieroglyphical inscriptions. M. Champoilion devoted himself entirely to the
                    examination and study of every monument of this kind to which he could obtain
                    access. Of these he made numerous copies, and, as it were, engraved on his
                    memory all that he could find either in public or private collections; he also
                    exercised himself in reproducing texts from recollection, and in this acquired
                    astonishing dexterity. But, during many long years, the hieroglyph!chi
                    inscriptions remained as great a mystery to him as to the rest of the learned.
                    He pored over them without intermission, and he attempted a hundred systems of
                    interpretation; but the time had not yet arrived when the secret of ancient
                    Egypt was to be revealed. Nevertheless, more accurate notions as to the true
                    nature of hieroglyphical writing had already begun to be entertained.</p>
                <p>Zoega had suspected that several of the hieroglyphics might have been employed as
                    <hi rend="italic">signs of sounds,</hi> and for that reason he had denominated
                    them <hi rend="italic">phonetic.</hi> This conjecture, however, had at first
                    made no impression upon those persons who were occupied with the study of the
                    ancient Egyptian writings. On the contrary, in all their labours they followed
                    the ancient system, regarding the mass of the hieroglyphics as composed of
                    ideographic or symbolic signs; nor was it until some time after the discovery of
                    the Rosetta inscription that the <hi rend="italic">only method</hi> by which the
                    Egyptians could possibly have expressed either foreign or national proper names,
                    that is, by means of phonetic signs, forced itself on the attention of the
                    learned. In this inscription everybody at once recognised the position of the
                    name of <hi rend="italic">Ptolemy,</hi> when Dr Young had, by a happy artifice
                    of collocation, pointed it out; and on other monuments the ovals or scrolls
                    containing the names of <hi rend="italic">Berenice</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Arsinoe,</hi> as well as those of several kings belonging to the old Egyptian
                    dynastics, were likewise indicated with tolerable certainty. At this period, the
                    current or enchorial writing engaged the attention of several learned and
                    ingenious men, such as Baron de Sacy and Mr Akerblad in France, and Dr Young in
                    England, and considerable progress was made, particularly by the latter, not
                    only in determining the equivalents of groups, but even in ascertaining the
                    values of individual characters. Μ. Champoilion, however, continued to labour in
                    a different direction, the idea that the hieroglyphics might contain a portion
                    of characters purely alphabetical not having taken root in his mind. This is
                    established beyond dispute by a passage in his work entitled <hi rend="italic"
                    >De l'</hi><hi rend="italic">Ecriture Hiératique des Anciens Egyptiens,</hi>
                    published at Grenoble in 1821, little more than a year before the appearance of
                    his <hi rend="italic">Lettre à</hi><hi rend="italic">Μ. Dacier.</hi> In this
                    production, after stating that “long study, and, above all, an attentive
                    comparison of the <hi rend="italic">hieroglyphic</hi> texts with those of the
                    second order, regarded as <hi rend="italic">alphabetical,</hi> had conducted him
                    to a contrary conclusion,” he proceeds to lay down the following general
                    principles, viz. 1sZ, That the writing of the Egyptian manuscripts of the second
                    order is <hi rend="italic">not</hi> alphabetical; 2<hi rend="italic">dly,</hi>
                    That this second system is only a simple modification of the hieroglyphical
                    system, from which it differs merely in the form of the signs; 3<hi
                    rend="italic">dly,</hi> That this second species of writing is the <hi
                    rend="italic">hieratic</hi> of the Greek authors, and may be regarded as a
                    hieroglyphic tachygraphy, or abbreviated mode of writing; <hi rend="italic"
                    >⅛thly,</hi> That the hieratic characters, and consequently those also from
                    which they are derived, namely, the <hi rend="italic">hieroglyphic,</hi> are
                    signs of <hi rend="italic">things,</hi> and not signs of <hi rend="italic"
                    >sounds</hi> (“sont des signes de <hi rend="italic">choses,</hi> et non des
                    signes de <hi rend="italic">sons').</hi> It follows, then, that in 1821, Μ.
                    Champoilion did not believe in the existence of alphabetical signs amongst the
                    hieroglyphics; although Dr Young had communicated his discovery to the learned
                    of Europe in a memoir printed in 1818, and incorporated it in the article <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Egypt,</hi> published the following year in the Supplement to
                    the former editions of the present work, and although the ingenious conjecture
                    of Zoega had been partially verified both by Μ. de Sacy and by Mr Akerblad.<note

                    and want of fairness which marked the commencement of Μ. Champoilion’s career as
                    a claimant for the honour of discovery continued to distinguish it throughout.
                    Of this we have an instance connected with the subject now under consideration.

                    (April 1827), then published at Paris. This translation, which was generally
                    attributed to Μ. Champollion, scarcely represents the half of the original,
                    although it is passed off on the public as complete. Several important passages
                    are expunged, especially from the historical part of the article; others are
                    altered so as to suit the views of the translator; and notes are added which
                    clearly indicate the source whence they emanated. “Ces suppressions et ces

                <p><hi rend="italic">It is</hi> no doubt true that Μ. Champollion afterwards
                    attempted to give currency to a different story, and to lay claim to the merit
                    of independent discovery. Having, on a frivolous pretence, endeavoured to
                    suppress the work to which we just referred, by calling in all the copies in the
                    hands of the booksellers, “de ne pas donner one mesure trop précise des progrès
                    qu’il avait fait jusqu’en 1821,” he ventured to assert that, without having any
                    knowledge of the opinions of Dr Young, he had, about the same period, arrived at
                    very nearly similar results. <hi rend="italic">“Je</hi> dois dire,” says he,

                    several circumstances which render it impossible to give credit to this
                    statement. In the first place, it is wholly irreconcilable with the doctrine
                    laid down in his work on the Hieratic Writing of the ancient Egyptians,
                    published in 1821, in which it is formally stated that both the hieratic and
                    hieroglyphic characters are signs of <hi rend="italic">things,</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">not</hi> signs of <hi rend="italic">sounds.</hi> Secondly, it is
                    contradicted by the direct testimony of Dr Young. “At the beginning of my
                    Egyptian researches,” says he, “I had accidentally received a letter from Mr
                    Champollion, which accompanied a copy of his work on the state of Egypt under
                    the Pharaohs, sent as a present to the Royal Society; and <hi rend="italic">as
                    he requested some particular information respecting several parts of the
                    enchorial inscription of Rosetta,</hi> which were imperfectly represented in the
                    engraved copies, I readily answered his inquiries, from a reference to the
                    original monument in the British Museum, and a short time afterwards <hi
                    rend="italic">sent him a copy of my conjectural translation of the
                    inscriptions,</hi> as it was inserted in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Archoeologia”</hi> Dr Young then adds, that with regard to the enchorial
                    inscription, Μ. Champollion appeared to him to have at that time done but
                    little, and that the few references he made to it seemed to depend entirely on
                    the investigations of Mr Akerblad, whose conclusions he had <hi rend="italic"
                    >tacitly</hi> adopted. It is not easy to imagine how Μ. Champollion, with the
                    knowledge of these facts in his mind, could venture to affirm that he had
                    commenced his hieroglyphical researches at the same time with Dr Young; and
                    that, without any knowledge of the opinions of the latter, he had arrived at
                    nearly the same results. Thirdly, it is evident from the respective dates of Μ.
                    Champollion’s publications, that nearly six years must have elapsed between the
                    date of the above communication and that of his <hi rend="italic">Lettre
                    à</hi><hi rend="italic">Μ. Dacier</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and it also
                    appears, that when Dr Young published his “conjectural translation” in 1815, Μ.
                    Champollion had done nothing beyond tacitly adopting the conclusions of Mr
                    Akerblad. The priority of publication cannot, therefore, be disputed. But as Μ.
                    Champollion has not contradicted the statement of Dr Young regarding the
                    communication above mentioned, and as it is undeniable that he saw the article
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">Egypt</hi> nearly two years before he published his <hi
                    rend="italic">Lettre</hi><hi rend="italic">a Μ. Dacier,</hi> containing the
                    first statement of his discoveries in hieroglyphics, it is evident that he was
                    in the full knowledge of Dr Young’s “opinions” at every stage of his progress,
                    and that the question of <hi rend="italic">originality</hi> may be as easily
                    settled as that of priority of publication. A sense of justice alone compels us
                    to make these remarks, impeaching, as they do, the literary honesty of Μ.
                    Champollion; and although it may appear an ungracious office, now that he is no
                    more, to detract from his fame, yet flattery as well as obloquy should be silent
                    over his grave. The merits of Champollion will not be the less fully appreciated
                    if they are fairly estimated: it is exaggeration alone that can inflict any
                    permanent injury on his reputation.</p>
                <p>We have seen that, in 1821, Μ. Champollion did not believe in the existence of
                    alphabetic signs amongst the hieroglyphics, although Dr Young had published his
                    discovery nearly three years before. At this period, however, Mr Bankes made
                    known a Greek inscription which he had discovered upon an obelisk in the island
                    of Philae, and which mentioned the erection of a monument in honour of King
                    Ptolemy. The discovery of the English traveller attracted the attention of
                    scholars, and Μ. Letronne, in some learned observations on the text of the
                    inscription, stated it as his opinion that the monument in question would be
                    found to contain, in hieroglyphical characters, the same sense as the Greek
                    inscription, or, in other words, that the one would prove to be a version of the
                    other. Mr Bankes, having learned the opinion expressed by this distinguished
                    scholar, and being anxious to afford every means in his power for verifying its
                    accuracy, transmitted to the Academy of Inscriptions, in the month of January
                    1822, a lithographed copy of the hieroglyphics covering the four faces of the
                    obelisk of Philae, upon the base of which he had discovered the Greek
                    inscription already mentioned. And it was this lithograph which, having been
                    communicated to Μ. Champollion, enabled him to make those observations and
                    comparisons the results of which he published in his <hi rend="italic">Lettre
                    à</hi><hi rend="italic">Μ. Dacier,</hi> dated the 22d of September 1822. Then,
                    indeed, but not before, did he recognise the name of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Cleopatra,</hi> and the use of alphabetical characters amongst the
                    hieroglyphics; then only it was that he abandoned the notions which he had
                    hitherto entertained respecting the nature of the Egyptian writing, and which,
                    as already shown, had at first led him to reject the discoveries of Dr
                    Young.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Nevertheless he
                    appears to have been of opinion at this period, that the employment of
                    alphabetical characters was confined to the transcription of Greek and Roman
                    proper names, and that the greater part of the other hieroglyphics were
                    ideographic; one more proof how closely he had followed the footsteps of Dr
                    Young.</p></note></p>
                <p>Having entered upon this new career, Μ. Champollion pushed on with irrepressible
                    boldness, and devoted himself with more ardour than ever to the study of the
                    Egyptian monuments. He applied his alphabet to deciphering the names of the
                    Roman emperors and those of the Greek and Egyptian kings; and finding his
                    observations not only <hi rend="superscript"> r</hi> multiply, but likewise
                    extend to objects which had not been touched on in his <hi rend="italic">Lettre
                    à</hi><hi rend="italic">Μ. Dacier,</hi> he embodied the results, modified in
                    some points and verified in others, into a more extended work, which appeared at
                    Paris in 1824, under the title of <hi rend="italic">Precis</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >du Système Hiéroglyphique des Anciens Egyptiens.</hi> We must, however, guard
                    the reader against the misconception which this title is calculated to produce
                    respecting the extent and results or Μ. Champollion’s labours. From it he may
                    perhaps expect to find the exposition of a “system,” and a summary of the
                    principles by means of which the hieroglyphic texts can be read and interpreted;
                    whilst, in reality, the book only contains a more ample and extensive
                    application of the ideas explained in the <hi rend="italic">Lettre à</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Μ. Dader.</hi> It embraces a great number of proper names
                    belonging to persons of all ranks, accompanied with observations and conjectures
                    as to the meaning of certain concomitant signs, to which the author attributes a
                    grammatical value, but without having sufficiently established the point by
                    induction. This, however, did not prevent him from proceeding to generalise;
                    and, <pb break="no" facs="nls:193643567" xml:id="kp-eb0711-3567-0344"/>as he had
                    formerly maintained that the greater part,, if not the whole, of the
                    hieroglyphic texts were ideographic, so now he passed to the opposite extreme,
                    and concluded that alphabetical signs predominated in the monumental
                    inscriptions, all of which might, in a great measure, be interpreted by means of
                    the phonetic method. Such a conclusion, if it had been sufficiently established,
                    would no doubt have proved of the highest importance; but, instead of applying
                    his new system to the inscription of Rosetta, of which the import was known from
                    the accompanying Greek version, or to other texts of still more considerable
                    extent, M. Champollion confined himself to the interpretation of detached
                    phrases, which of themselves were not sufficient to establish the certainty of
                    his system; and hence his work, important and interesting as it unquestionably
                    is, has still left much to be desired by the friends of archaeological
                    science.</p>
                <p>But although the ardour of his mind had, at first, hurried him away, Μ.
                    Champollion appears soon to have become sensible that he had advanced too
                    rapidly; indeed he could not but feel an urgent necessity for augmenting the
                    mass of materials at his disposal, and multiplying more and more the points of
                    comparison indispensable to the progress of his studies. Accordingly he
                    undertook a journey to Italy to explore the treasures contained in the rich
                    collections of that country, and spent much time in the museum of Turin, then
                    recently enriched with the noble collection of Drovetti, containing a great
                    number of papyri, pillars, and inscriptions of every kind. From this museum were
                    written the <hi rend="italic">Lettres</hi> addressed to the Duc de Blacas, in
                    which the author began to make more numerous applications of his system,
                    particularly to all that concerned the ancient Egyptian dynastics; and he even
                    hazarded more extensive interpretations, comprehending not only simple proper
                    names, but names preceded or followed by titles, or by certain portions of
                    phrases. These readings, however, were not accompanied with the requisite
                    explanatory details, which alone could give them authority; and, with reference
                    to the Egyptian system of writing, the <hi rend="italic">Lettres</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">a Μ.</hi><hi rend="italic">de</hi><hi rend="italic">Placas</hi>
                    seem not to have produced any change of importance in the theory of the author.
                    When, on his return from Italy, he published a second edition of his <hi
                    rend="italic">Precis</hi><hi rend="italic">du Système Hiéroglyphique,</hi>
                    Paris, 1828, he accordingly introduced but few modifications of the statements
                    contained in the first, and saw no reason to alter the opinion which he had
                    therein expressed as to the phonetic value of the great mass of the
                    hieroglyphics. On the contrary, he formally repeated his fundamental
                    proposition, “That the figurative and symbolical characters are employed in the
                    Egyptian texts in a smaller proportion than the phonetic characters; that the
                    latter are the true alphabetical signs which express the sounds of words in the
                    spoken language of ancient Egypt; and that every phonetic hieroglyph is the
                    image of a physical object, the name of which, in the spoken language of Egypt,
                    commenced with the sound or articulation which the sign itself is employed to
                    express.”</p>
                <p>Such were the general views entertained by Μ. Champollion before setting out for
                    Egypt with the intention of examining the monuments themselves, and of seeking
                    on the spot the confirmation of his discoveries. In his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Pantheon</hi><hi rend="italic">Egyptien,</hi> the publication of which
                    commenced in 1824, he had given representations of the Egyptian divinities,
                    accompanied with hieroglyphic legends, to which explanatory notices were
                    subjoined; and he had made ( frequent use of notions borrowed from the Greek and
                    the Latin authors, and already classed in the Egyptian Pan- <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ξ</hi> theon of Jablonski. Yet he laid it down as a
                    principle, “que c’était de preference dans les monumens Egyptiens qu’il fallait
                    chercher les noms d’une foule de divinités et de personages mythologiques, qu’on
                    chercherait en vain dans les auteurs classiques ;” a proposition which,
                    according to Klaproth, is only admissible upon the supposition that we have
                    already arrived at a complete intelligence of the graphic monuments of Egypt;
                    and until such knowledge has been attained, no one has any right to found new
                    theories on their alleged contents. The proposition, however, is admissible upon
                    a much more limited supposition, namely, that we have attained the means of
                    deciphering with tolerable certainty names, titles, and legends; and the result
                    has accordingly been, that “the names of a crowd of divinities and mythological
                    personages, which would be sought for in vain in the classical authors,” have
                    been ascertained by Wilkinson, Rosellini, Burton, Felix, and others, not to
                    mention Μ. Champollion himself. We ought to add also, that, at the period of his
                    departure for Egypt, Μ. Champollion held as demonstrated the existence of a
                    considerable number of signs employed phonetically, that is, used to represent
                    the sounds of the Egyptian language, each sign standing for the initial sound of
                    the name of the physical or other object of which it was the image or picture
                    ∙,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>On a reconsideration
                    of the subject, Dr Young regarded this notion as altogether fallacious, “Mr
                    Champollion,” says he, “has never been led, <hi rend="italic">in any one
                    instance,</hi> from the Egyptian name of an object, to infer the phonetic
                    interpretation, that is, the alphabetical power °t its symbol; but the letters
                    having once been ascertained, he has ransacked his memory or his dictionary for

                    and that, entertaining this view, he departed from the common opinion, which
                    attached a symbolical value to the greater number of the hieroglyphics. Such
                    being the doctrine maintained by him, we shall now proceed to place before the
                    reader a short abstract of the investigations and discoveries of Μ. Champollion,
                    reserving for the conclusion of this section some general observations and
                    criticisms of his labours.</p>
                <p>The conditions of the problem which Μ. Champollion undertook to resolve may be
                    very briefly explained. Every body has seen Egyptian monuments, and every body
                    knows in a general way the form and disposition of the characters called <hi
                    rend="italic">hieroglyphics;</hi> but few persons, perhaps, have reflected on
                    the nature of these characters, and still fewer know wherein consists the real
                    difficulty of interpreting them. The passages of ancient authors being for the
                    most part vague and incoherent, afforded no explanation of this system of
                    writing; even the celebrated text of Clemens Alexandrinus, so far from serving
                    as a guide to direct inquiry, has only received an approximate interpretation by
                    means of knowledge otherwise acquired of the subject to which it relates; and we
                    cannot be absolutely certain that all the difficulties which this passage
                    presents have as yet been overcome. But the main point for determination was,
                    whether the hieroglyphics were destined to represent ideas <hi rend="italic"
                    >directly,</hi> or by the <hi rend="italic">intervention of the sounds of the
                    spoken language</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> whether they were the symbols of
                    <hi rend="italic">things,</hi> or the signs of vocal articulations; whether, in
                    short, they were to be considered as <hi rend="italic">ideographic</hi> or as
                    <hi rend="italic">phonetic.</hi> In the one case, that is, supposing the signs
                    ideographic, it must be evident that we could never hope, by any effort, to
                    attain a complete intelligence of such characters; because, to attempt to divine
                    the sense of ancient symbols is to expose ourselves at every step to fall into
                    the very errors which now appear so ludicrous or extravagant in Pierius,
                    Kircher, Palin, and Pluche. But, on the other hand, supposing the <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193643580" xml:id="kp-eb0711-3580-0345"/>hieroglyphics were regarded
                    as in a great measure composed of phonetic signs, the interpretation of these
                    characters would, on such a supposition, be not only possible, but, under
                    certain conditions and in certain circumstances, might be easy. This accordingly
                    was the doctrine espoused by Μ. Champollion in its utmost latitude. The analysis
                    given by Dr Young of the names of <hi rend="italic">Ptolemy</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">Berenice</hi> had proved beyond dispute that these were expressed
                    phonetically; but as it was not unreasonable to conclude that the method
                    employed in representing graphically two proper names might be applied to all,
                    or perhaps even extended to common words and phrases in the language, M.
                    Champollion was led to conceive, that if an alphabet of phonetic characters
                    could be constructed, it would probably furnish a key to hieroglyphical writing
                    in general, and produce new and unexpected results of the utmost importance to
                    history. The first and great object, therefore, was, if possible, to obtain an
                    alphabet; and to the accomplishment of this Μ. Champollion primarily directed
                    his attention.</p>
                <p>But the task which he had to perform was, comparatively speaking, an easy one. Dr
                    Young, as we have already seen, had not only demonstrated the practicability of
                    constructing such an alphabet, but, by his analysis of the names <hi
                    rend="italic">Ptolemy</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Berenice,</hi> he had assigned
                    phonetic values to <hi rend="italic">nine</hi> distinct characters, the greater
                    number of which corresponded with the results which were afterwards obtained by
                    M. Champollion. The first step had therefore been made, and it only required
                    perseverance and good fortune to ensure success. We say “good fortune,” because
                    Dr Young had already done all that was possible with his materials. If the
                    hieroglyphical inscription of Rosetta had come to Europe entire, a tolerably
                    complete alphabet of phonetic hieroglyphics would in all probability have been
                    formed before Μ. Champoilion was heard of as a labourer in this interesting
                    field of inquiry. But unfortunately the pillar contains only the last fourteen
                    lines of the hieroglyphic text, and even these are so much mutilated, that the
                    name of <hi rend="italic">Ptolemy,</hi> enclosed in an oval or cartouche, is the
                    only one of all those mentioned in the Greek text which has escaped destruction.
                    This name is represented by eight hieroglyphic characters, one of them (the
                    feather, E) being repeated; but, as the Greek name, ΠΤΟΛΕΜΑΙΟΣ, consists of <hi
                    rend="italic">ten</hi> letters, it was of course impossible, without further
                    materials, to fix with certainty the relation between the seven or eight
                    hieroglyphical signs and the ten letters of the Greek name. But the discovery of
                    a new monument (and in this consisted Μ. Champollion’s good fortune) at length
                    removed all uncertainty in this respect, and led directly and easily to the
                    formation of the alphabet required. The obelisk discovered by Mr Bankes in the
                    island <hi rend="italic">of</hi> Philae was found to contain the hieroglyphic
                    name of one of the Ptolemies, expressed by the same characters which occur in
                    the inscription of Rosetta, surrounded by a ring or border; and this was
                    followed by a second ring or scroll which obviously contained the proper name of
                    a woman, and a queen of the family of the Lagidae, inasmuch as the group was
                    ter* minated by the hieroglyphics expressive of the feminine gender, which had
                    been previously determined by Dr ìoung. The obelisk in question was fixed on a
                    basis or pedestal containing a Greek inscription, which proved to be a petition
                    of the priests of Isis, addressed to King Ptolemy, to Cleopatra his sister, and
                    to Cleopatra his wife. But if, as Μ. Letronne ingeniously conjectured, this
                    obelisk, and the hieroglyphical inscription engraved upon it, were the result of
                    this petition, which in fact adverts to the consecration of a monument of the
                    kind, the border with the feminine proper name could only be that of one of the
                    <hi rend="italic">Cleopatras</hi> mentioned in the petition. This name,
                    therefore, and that of <hi rend="italic">Ptolemy,</hi> which in the Greek <hi
                    rend="italic">have several letters in common,</hi> were capable of being
                    employed for a comparison of the hieroglyphical characters composing them; and
                    if the similar characters in these names were found to express in both the same
                    sounds, it would follow demonstratively that the nature of these characters must
                    be entirely phonetic.</p>
                <p>The course of investigation here indicated appears sufficiently simple and
                    conclusive; but as the development of a hieroglyphical alphabet has been mainly
                    effected by a comparison of the characters which enter respectively into the
                    composition of the names <hi rend="italic">Ptolemy</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Cleopatra,</hi> we shall endeavour to exemplify the process by means of which
                    the phonetic values of individual signs were determined.</p>
                <p>This figure exhibits three proper names written hieroglyphically, each of them
                    enclosed within an elliptical ring or cartouche, viz. the name of <hi
                    rend="italic">Ptolemy,</hi> No. 1, taken from the hieroglyphical branch of the
                    triple inscription of Rosetta; that of <hi rend="italic">Berenice,</hi> No. 2,
                    copied from a ceiling of the great temple at Karnak; and that of <hi
                    rend="italic">Cleopatra,</hi> No. 3, as furnished by the obelisk of Philae. Of
                    the first and second, viz. <hi rend="italic">Ptolemy</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Berenice·,</hi> the reader has already seen Dr Young’s analysis, deduced with
                    singular ingenuity from the enchorial text of the Rosetta inscription. At
                    present, however, we have only to do with the first and third, or with the names
                    ∙of <hi rend="italic">Ptolemy</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Cleopatra.</hi> And, on
                    referring to the ovals or rings, Nos. 1 and 3, containing these names, the
                    reader will at once perceive that, in the scroll of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Ptolemy,</hi> ΠTOΛMHΣ, the fourth, sixth, third, and first characters are
                    identical with the second, third, fourth, and fifth characters in the scroll of
                    <hi rend="italic">Cleopatra,</hi> and that these characters must therefore
                    correspond respectively to the Greek letters A, E or H, O, and II. Their
                    relative positions remove all doubt as to their respective values; and the
                    evidence afforded by this comparison is strengthened by the circumstance that,
                    contrary to the common usage, the name of <hi rend="italic">Cleopatra</hi> is
                    spelled fully out, leaving none of the vowels to be supplied. Here, then, we
                    have the values of four characters (the lion, the feather, the flower with the
                    recurved stem, and the square) determined by a sort of <hi rend="italic"
                    >instantia crucis,</hi> and at the same time a striking confirmation of the
                    soundness of the original hypothesis, which, of course, becomes absolute
                    certainty by the repetition of such comparisons. But the same process which
                    enables us to ascertain the values of the characters <hi rend="italic"
                    >common</hi> to both names, equally enables us to infer the values of those in
                    which they <hi rend="italic">differ.</hi> The name ΚΛΕΟΠΑΤΡΑ, for instance, is
                    spelled hieroglyphically by <hi rend="italic">nine</hi> phonetic characters or
                    signs, together with the symbols (a semicircle and ovaD of the feminine
                    termination; in other words, there is a phonetic character corresponding to
                    every letter in the Greek name. <hi rend="italic">But four</hi> of these
                    characters consecutively A, E, Ο, ∏, have been determined by the direct method
                    of comparison; and as the name is, by the supposition, known, it follows that
                    the values of the remaining <hi rend="italic">five</hi> may be inferred without
                    almost the <pb break="no" facs="nls:193643593" xml:id="kp-eb0711-3593-0346"
                    />possibility of error. Having ascertained the values of the second, third,
                    fourth, and fifth, we necessarily obtain, at the same instant, the true values
                    of the first, sixth, seventh, eighth, and ninth. The same thing precisely is
                    applicable to the name of <hi rend="italic">Ptolemy.</hi> But as the name of <hi
                    rend="italic">Cleopatra</hi> contains <hi rend="italic">eight</hi> distinct
                    characters (one, the phonetic sign of A, being repeated), and as the name of <hi
                    rend="italic">Ptolemy,</hi> deducting the four letters which it has in common
                    with that of Cleopatra, supplies <hi rend="italic">three</hi> more, we thus
                    obtain, from the analysis of these two names, <hi rend="italic">eleven</hi>
                    distinct characters representing as many distinct sounds; and if the same
                    indirect method of comparison be applied to the name of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Berenice,</hi> it will furnish other <hi rend="italic">four</hi> signs, three
                    of them representing distinct sounds, whilst the fourth, a <hi rend="italic"
                    >vulpanser</hi> or goose of the Nile, is a homophone of the letter <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">a.</hi> On the whole, then, it appears that from these three
                    proper names were deduced <hi rend="italic">fourteen</hi> distinct phonetic
                    characters, being only two less than the number of the Cadmean letters, and
                    forming no inconsiderable portion of a phoneticohieroglyphical alphabet, which
                    it was an easy matter to extend, and, at the same time, to verify by the
                    comparison of other scrolls or rings with those of which the characters had in
                    this way been ascertained.</p>
                <p>As far as we have advanced, then, the process followed in determining the
                    phonetic values of characters seemed equally simple and certain; it carried its
                    own evidence along with it; and the results were afterwards confirmed in the
                    most complete and satisfactory manner by a series of observations conducted with
                    surprising diligence and ingenuity by Μ. Champollion, who established by
                    unassailable evidence that all proper names were written alphabetically. But,
                    not content with a mere induction of <hi rend="italic">facts,</hi> the French
                    archaeologist attempted to discover the <hi rend="italic">principle</hi> which
                    regulated the phonetic application of certain characters or signs, and at length
                    came to the conclusion that every <hi rend="italic">phonetic hieroglyphic</hi>
                    is the image of a physical object, the name of which, in the spoken language of
                    Egypt, commenced with the <hi rend="italic">sound</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >articulation</hi> which the sign itself is destined to represent. Thus,
                    according to him, the image of an eagle, which, in Coptic, is <hi rend="italic"
                    >Ahôm</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Achôm,</hi> became the sign of <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">a</hi>; that of a small vase or censer, in Coptic <hi
                    rend="italic">Berbé,</hi> a sign of <hi rend="smallcaps">b</hi>; that of a hand,
                    <hi rend="italic">Tot,</hi> a sign of τ; that of a hatchet, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Kelebin,</hi> a sign of κ; that of a lion or lioness, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Labo</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Laboi,</hi> a sign of <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >l</hi>; that of a nycticoax or owl, <hi rend="italic">Mouladj,</hi> a sign of
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">μ</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">;</hi> that of a flute, <hi
                    rend="italic">Sebiandjo,</hi> a sign of s; that of a mouth, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Ro,</hi> a sign of it; the abridged image of a garden, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Schné,</hi> a sign of sit; and so on. But this hypothesis, which reduces the
                    phonetic hieroglyphics to a species of calembourgs, and leaves, in the greater
                    part of the inscriptions, only a writing in <hi rend="italic">rebuses,</hi>
                    seems obnoxious to insuperable objections. In the first place,as Dr Young
                    remarked, Μ. Champollion was never, in any one instance, led, from the Egyptian
                    name of an object, to infer the phonetic interpretation or alphabetical power of
                    its symbol; but the letters having been ascertained by other means, he ransacked
                    his memory or his dictionary for some name which he thought capable of being
                    applied to the symbol, though not always in the most natural manner. Secondly,
                    as the same letter is represented by a diversity of characters, it would be
                    necessary to show, which Μ. Champollion has not attempted to do, that all these
                    homophonous characters are employed on the principle above enunciated, or, in
                    other words, that every one . of them is the image of a physical object, the
                    name of which, in the spoken language of Egypt, began with the sound which the
                    sign itself was intended to represent. Thirdly, the Coptic language, which was
                    undoubtedly . formed from that of ancient Egypt, of which it may in one sense be
                    considered as a precious remnant, nevertheless represents the latter in a very
                    incomplete and imperfect manner; many Coptic words are not Egyptian; many
                    Egyptian words are no longer to be found in the Coptic; the latter, as it now
                    exists, is merely a mutilated and imperfect fragment, through which some traces
                    and lineaments of an elder form of speech are faintly reflected; and even with
                    the Coptic, as we now have it, Μ. Champollion was but indifferently acquainted.
                    It is obvious, therefore, that no reliance whatever can be placed on any theory
                    connected with hieroglyphics which professes to depend exclusively upon Coptic,
                    although, as in this instance, it be propounded with as much confidence as if
                    the language of Egypt had descended unaltered from the days of Ramesses, or the
                    author had possessed a glossary composed under the reign of Sesostris.</p>
                <p>Having constructed a phoneticohieroglyphic alphabet in the manner above
                    described, Μ. Champollion proceeded to apply it in deciphering the proper names
                    inscribed on the temples and other edifices of Egypt; and in his <hi
                    rend="italic">Lettre</hi><hi rend="italic">d Μ.</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Dacier,</hi> which is embodied in his larger work, he exhibited the results
                    obtained from the inscriptions on the monuments of Denderah <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Tentyris'),</hi> Thebes, Esnch <hi rend="italic">(Latopolis),</hi> Edfou <hi
                    rend="italic">(Apollonopolis Magna),</hi> Ombos, and Philae, relative to the
                    Greek and Roman periods of the history of Egypt. Of these, however, we can only
                    afford to give a very condensed abstract. And, <hi rend="italic">First,</hi>
                    connected with the Greek period we read, I. the name of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Alexander the Great,</hi> whicĥ is sculptured twice on the edifices of Karnak,
                    and written AΛK∑NTP2 and AΛKΣNTPE2. This name Dr Young had previously deciphered
                    from the enchorial text of the Rosetta inscription.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See <hi rend="italic">Supplement</hi> to the

                    to all the Lagidae, or sovereigns of the Macedonian dynasty. It is commonly
                    written ΠT0ΛMH2, sometimes ΠTΛ0MH2; it occurs in the hieroglyphic text of the
                    Rosetta inscription, at Denderah, on the monolith of Kous, and on other
                    monuments; it is preceded by the particular surnames of Ptolemy, and followed by
                    one or other of the legends, <hi rend="italic">alivays living, beloved of
                    Phtha</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi><hi rend="italic">always living, beloved of

                    Phtha and of Isis.</hi> 3. The name of <hi rend="italic">Berenice,</hi> written
                    BPNHK∑, which occurs twice on the ceiling of the triumphal arch or gate on the
                    south of Karnak. 4. The name of <hi rend="italic">Cleopatra,</hi> written
                    ΚΛΕΟΠΑΤΡΑ on the obelisk of Philae already mentioned, and KΔAOΠATPA and KΛOΠTPA
                    on the edifices of Ombos, Thebes, and Denderah. 5. The name of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Ptolemy</hi> surnamed <hi rend="italic">Alexander,</hi> and accompanied with
                    the legend, <hi rend="italic">always living, beloved of Phtha.</hi> The name is
                    written ΠT0ΔMH2, and this is separated from APK2NTP2 by a group corresponding to
                    the Greek word <hi rend="italic">innοahovμiνος, surnamed.</hi> 6. The name of
                    another <hi rend="italic">Ptolemy,</hi> scarcely known in history, the son of
                    Julius Caesar by the same Cleopatra for whom Antony gave up the empire of the
                    world. This boy, according to Plutarch, bore the name of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Coesarion</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> Dion Cassius calls him <hi rend="italic"
                    >Ptolemy-Coesarion</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and his scroll, sculptured at
                    Denderah, next to that of his mother, contains the name ΠT0ΛMH2 <hi
                    rend="italic">surnamed</hi> NHOKH2P2, <hi rend="italic">Ptolemy the young
                    Caesar,</hi> followed by the ideographic symbols for <hi rend="italic">always
                    living,</hi> and the title <hi rend="italic">beloved of Isis</hi> spelled
                    phonetically.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Secondly,</hi> the phonetic alphabet was found to apply,
                    without modification either in the values or the arrangement of the signs, to a
                    much more numerous class of hieroglyphic names of sovereigns sculptured on the
                    monuments of Egypt; we mean to those of the Roman emperors: But, contrary to all
                    expectation, it was found that their titles, names, and surnames, on the
                    bas-reliefs of the temples, were expressed in hieroglyphical characters,
                    suggesting not Latin, but <hi rend="italic">Greek</hi> words; a circumstance <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193643606" xml:id="kp-eb0711-3606-0347"/> which seems to
                    prove, what indeed is otherwise pretty well established, that latterly these
                    sacred sculptures were executed by Greek workmen, or at least under the
                    direction of Greek artists. Thus, connected with the Roman period, we read, 1.
                    the imperial title <hi rend="italic">Aυroκgarωg,</hi> spelled AOTOKPTP,
                    AOTKPTOP, AOTAKPTP, and AOTOKΛTΛ, “le A étant employe <hi rend="italic"
                    >baschmouriquxment</hi> pour le P,” according toM. Champollion. This title
                    usually occupies an entire cartouche, and is followed by the ideographic symbols
                    for <hi rend="italic">always living.</hi> 2. The title of Kα∕o <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ,</hi> αg or Ka∕o ’ agoς, written indifferently KH2P2 or
                    KH2Λ2. It occupies an entire scroll, is followed by the epithets <hi
                    rend="italic">always living, beloved of Isis,</hi> and occurs on the edifices of
                    Philae and of Denderah. 3. The legend AOTKPTP KH2P2, the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Emperor Caesar, always living, beloved of Isis,</hi> which, Champollion
                    conceives, can only apply to Augustus, whose Greek medals struck in Egypt
                    commonly contain only the two words of this legend which are spelled
                    phonetically. It is repeated six times on the cornice of the posterior part of
                    the western temple at Philae. 4. The name of the <hi rend="italic">Emperor
                    Tiberius,</hi> which occurs several times on the walls of the western temple at
                    Philae. Two scrolls joined together contain the legend AOTKPTP-TBPH2-KH2PΣ, the
                    <hi rend="italic">Emperor Tiberius Caesar, alινays living.</hi> 5. The titles
                    and name of <hi rend="italic">Domitian,</hi> contained in conjoined scrolls, and
                    written AOTKPTP TOMHN2 2B2T2, the <hi rend="italic">Emperor</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Domitian</hi><hi rend="italic">Augustus.</hi> This occurs on the
                    monuments of Philae; but a more extensive legend of this emperor is found on the
                    edifices of Denderah, where the hieroglyphic scrolls give the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Emperor</hi><hi rend="italic">Caesar Domitian</hi> surnamed <hi rend="italic"
                    >Germanicus.</hi> 6. The name of the same emperor on the Pamphilian obelisk at
                    Rome; but this monument, in explanation of which Kircher published a folio
                    volume, is believed, on good grounds, to be spurious.</p>
                <p>The name of the <hi rend="italic">Emperor Trajan</hi> occurs on the walls of the
                    intercolumniation of the eastern edifice at Philae. The image of this good
                    prince, presenting an offering to Isis and to <hi rend="italic">Arsiesi</hi> or
                    <hi rend="italic">Horsicsi,</hi> Horus, the son of Isis, is accompanied by two
                    cartouches or scrolls containing the words AOTKPTP KII2P2 NPO TPHN2, the <hi
                    rend="italic">Emperor Caesar</hi><hi rend="italic">Nerva</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Trajan</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and the legend, <hi rend="italic">Trajan
                    Caesar, everliving,</hi> contained in a scroll, terminates the perpendicular
                    column of hieroglyphics sculptured to the right of the basrelief. The frize of
                    the same intercolumniation is decorated with nine small scrolls. That of the
                    centre, supported by two <hi rend="italic">urcei</hi> or royal asps, contains
                    the name of <hi rend="italic">Trajan,</hi> TPHN2, with the ideographic epithet
                    <hi rend="italic">ever-living</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and, combined with
                    the scroll on the right and that on the left, it produces the legend, <hi
                    rend="italic">The Emperor always living, Trajan ever-living, Caesar, eternal
                    germ of Isis.</hi> The three cartouches placed to the right of these last
                    produce the words, <hi rend="italic">Trajan ever-living, Caesar,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Germanicus, Dacicus,</hi><hi rend="italic">always living.</hi>
                    And, lastly, the three cartouches on the left give the legend, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Nerva</hi><hi rend="italic">Trajan always living, Emperor Caesar always living,
                    Augustus ever-living beloved of Isis.</hi> The name of Trajan is also read on
                    the great temple of Ombos, where two scrolls found amidst the ruins of that
                    monument form together the legend, AOTOKPTP KH2P NPOA TPHN2 ⅛7%αλouμswς KPMNHK∑
                    THKK2, <hi rend="italic">The Emperor Caesar</hi><hi rend="italic">Nerva</hi><hi

                    rend="italic">;</hi> which is, word for word, the legend of the Greek medals of
                    this emperor struck in Egypt. The name of the <hi rend="italic">Emperor
                    Hadrian</hi> is found on the pyramidion of the fourth face of the Barberini
                    obelisk, which now stands in the new promenade of the Monte Pincio at Rome; the
                    cartouche containing it being placed before a figure of the emperor on foot,
                    presenting an offering to <hi rend="italic">Phre</hi> or the Sun. This monument,
                    however, like the Pamphilian obelisk, is supposed to be, not an Egyptian
                    original, but a Roman copy, executed by Roman workmen. The name of the Empress
                    <hi rend="italic">Sabina,</hi> the wife of Hadrian, written in phonetic
                    hieroglyphics, is likewise found upon this obelisk. Finally, on the Typhonium at
                    Denderah, two scrolls joined together contain the legend AOTKPTP K2P2 ANTONHN2,
                    <hi rend="italic">The Emperor Caesar Antoninus,</hi> with the ideographic
                    epithet <hi rend="italic">always living</hi> subjoined; and this is several
                    times repeated on the monuments.</p>
                <p>Such is an abstract of the results obtained by the application of the phonetic
                    alphabet to the inscriptions connected with the Greek and Roman periods of
                    Egyptian history. How far they tend to establish the soundness of the original
                    discovery we shall endeavour to explain after we have adverted to the first part
                    of Mr Salt’s <hi rend="italic">Essay,</hi> which applies to the subject
                    immediately under consideration. The late consul-general of Egypt informs us
                    that, on the first intimation of the discovery, he had “conceived a very decided
                    prejudice against the phonetic system,” thinking it “founded on too conjectural
                    a basis ;” but having received Μ. Champollion’s <hi rend="italic">Lettre
                    à</hi><hi rend="italic">Al. Dacier,</hi> and Dr Young’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Discoveries in Hieroglyphical Literature,</hi> he applied himself seriously to
                    the examination of their contents, “being unwilling to suppose that so much
                    importance could be given, without reason, by many persons of acknowledged
                    talent in Europe, to a discovery which appeared to him only a very vague and
                    conjectural hypothesis.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    4. London, 1825, in 8vo. ...</p></note> This led to a complete conviction of his
                    error, and enabled him not only to confirm the truth of the “hypothesis” from
                    his own investigations on the spot, but also to add several new phonetic
                    homophones, as well as the names of a number of kings and gods; in regard to
                    which, however, he had, without his knowledge, been anticipated by Champollion.
                    We shall here state as briefly as possible a few of the more remarkable results
                    obtained by Mr Salt in the course of his researches amongst the monuments
                    themselves.</p>
                <p>Of names connected with the Greek and Roman periods, Mr Salt was enabled to add
                    to the list of those previously deciphered, 1. that of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Arsinoe,</hi> which was found by him at Gau-Kibeer, Edfou, and Dakké, with a
                    figure of Isis, and the symbols of the female termination subjoined;<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>On the noble propylon at
                    Karnak, the finest remaining specimen of Egyptian architecture, this name is
                    also found in conjunction with that of Ptolemy, who'is designated as the
                    “father” of Ptolemy, who had for his wife Berenice.</p></note> 2. the name of
                    <hi rend="italic">Philip,</hi> the father of Alexander, which occurs on the
                    granite sanctuary at Karnak, and on the same building is sculptured the name of
                    his son, who is designated as <hi rend="italic">Mai-Amun,</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">beloved of Ammon</hi>,∙<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>The phonetic hieroglyphics representing the name of <hi

                    ΚΛΕΟΠΑΤΡΑ, which coincides with it, letter for letter.</p></note> 3. a
                    correction of the reading of the name <hi rend="italic">Berenice,</hi> the final
                    character of which Mr Salt considered as a hawk, a crow, or an eagle, instead of
                    a <hi rend="italic">vulpanser,</hi> as Dr Young and Μ. Champollion had concurred
                    in representing it; 4. the names of the Roman emperors <hi rend="italic"
                    >Nero,</hi><hi rend="italic">Commodus,</hi><hi rend="italic">Hadrian,
                    Antoninus,</hi> and one which appeared to be <hi rend="italic">Marcus</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Verus</hi><hi rend="italic">Antoninus Augustus,</hi> forming the
                    ornaments of a cornice in the anterior of a small propylon on the west of the
                    island of Philae. The name of Domitian Mr Salt copied from the Beneventine
                    obelisk as delineated by Zoega; and from the whole of these readings he deduced
                    about twenty homophones, in the greater part of which, however, he was, as
                    already mentioned, anticipated by Champollion.</p>
                <p>Before proceeding to give the phonetic names of the Egyptian deities, from which,
                    as Dr Murray remarked,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>See <hi rend="italic">Summary of Egyptian Mythology,</hi> in Appendix to
                    Bruce’s <hi rend="italic">Travels,</hi> vol. ii.</p></note> after Jablonski, the
                    names of the Egyptian kings are almost <pb break="no" facs="nls:193643619"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0711-3619-0348"/>all derived, Mr Salt stops to mention an
                    intermediate discovery of no inconsiderable interest. It struck him forcibly,
                    that as the phonetic characters had been applied to the names of stranger kings,
                    the Ptolemies and Roman emperors, so they must likewise, if known, have in all
                    probability been employed in expressing the names of the Ethiopian sovereigns
                    who had previously held Egypt in subjection. And the result proved the soundness
                    of this conjecture. From some sketches made at Abydos, Mr Salt was enabled to
                    decipher the name of ΣABAKO or ΣA-BAKOΦΘ, with the same termination as was
                    afterwards found in ΑΜΕΝΟΦΘ; and in a sketch taken from the back of a small
                    porticoat Medinet-Habou he discovered the name of TIPAKA, whom he conceives to
                    be the same with “<hi rend="italic">Tirhahah,</hi> king of Ethiopia, who came
                    out to make war against Sennacherib, king of Assyria,” as mentioned in the
                    second book of Kings.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>óecona <hi rend="italic">Kings,</hi> chap. xix. v. 9.</p></note> If this
                    supposed identity be admitted, and if the inscription of these Ethiopian names
                    on the Egyptian monuments be allowed, as we think it must, to have been
                    contemporaneous with the age of the invaders, then it would follow that the
                    phonetic characters were in use about seven centuries before the Christian era,
                    that is, as far back as the reign of Psammeticus and the time of the prophet
                    Isaiah; and a sovereign named in the Bible, of whose existence learned men had
                    entertained doubts, would be restored to history. Further, upon the high granite
                    rocks at Elephantine, and also beneath the intrusive name of a Ptolemy, Mr Salt
                    deciphered, with the utmost ease, the name ΠΣAMITIK, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Psam-miticus,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Psammeticus,</hi> written phonetically;
                    a name which he also found sculptured on one of the small temples of Elethyas,
                    on the Campensian obelisk, and also on that in Monte Clitorio, of which
                    engravings are given by Zoega at the end of his learned and valuable work on the
                    origin and use of the obelisks.</p>
                <p>Mr Salt then proceeds to give an account of some of the principal Egyptian
                    divinities, and the images under which they are represented, together with their
                    hieroglyphic and phonetic names, wherever these were deciphered. He commences
                    with the eight more ancient divinities mentioned by Herodotus, whose names he
                    determines to have been, 1. <hi rend="italic">Knuph</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >Ich-Neuphi,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Kneuph,</hi> represented symbolically by
                    a chicken watching an ostrich feather, or by the feather alone with a crouching
                    figure, or by the flag indicating god, or as the agathodaemon, or by the image
                    of the sacred serpent, which enters into the celebrated union of the globe,
                    wings, and serpent, placed over the entrance of all the temples of Egypt, the
                    phonetic name being uncertain; 2. <hi rend="italic">Neith,</hi> phonetic name
                    NEET or NΘ, expressed by a zigzag or broken line, two feathers, and a pair of
                    tongs, one of the great goddesses of the firmament, represented as a human
                    figure with the head of a lion; 3. <hi rend="italic">Phtha,</hi> phonetically
                    ΦΘA, having for his emblem a scaraboeus,<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>See Horus Apollo, <hi rend="italic">Hieroglyphica,</hi> voce
                    <hi rend="italic">Phiha.</hi></p></note> and represented on the temples under
                    the form of a human figure with a scaraboeus over its head, sometimes encircled
                    by the globe and serpent; 4. <hi rend="italic">Amun, Amoun, Ammon,</hi> commonly
                    represented by a human form of a black colour, with the head of a ram,
                    surmounted by the globe and serpent, and written phonetically ANN; 5. <hi
                    rend="italic">Phré,</hi> the sun, represented generally by a globe or disc,
                    encircled by a serpent, and hieroglyphically designated by the same emblem; 6.
                    <hi rend="italic">Athor</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Hathor,</hi> phonetic name
                    AΘP, represented under the form of a female, with a peculiar head-dress,
                    composed of a globe, encompassed by two slender horns, and surmounted by two
                    long leathers, and symbolized by the figure of a hawk enclosed in a square, with
                    a smaller square at one of its corners; 7. <hi rend="italic">J3uto</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">Maut,</hi> phonetic name MT, representing the lower firmament, and
                    designated, like Neith, by an outstretched female figure, which is also found
                    sometimes as her symbolical characteristic; 8. <hi rend="italic">Mendes,</hi> or
                    the generative power of nature, represented under the form of a human figure,
                    with the head of a goat advanced in front of the forehead, and designated by a
                    square, a dot, and a chicken, the phonetic name being unknown.</p>
                <p>Of the minor divinities of the Egyptian Pantheon, Mr Salt explains the phonetic
                    names and symbols of, 1. EPMΣ, <hi rend="italic">Hermes</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >;</hi> 2. TT or ΘΘ, <hi rend="italic">Taut</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >Thoth,</hi> represented by a human figure, with the head of an ibis; 3. OT∑IPE
                    or OTΣIPI, <hi rend="italic">Osiris,</hi> designated, as is well known, by an
                    eye, and a chair or throne; 4. ANEΦΘE, <hi rend="italic">Αnepkthe</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">Nephthe</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> 5. OPΣ, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Horus,</hi> designated by a hawk, or the figure of a child with one hand
                    pointing to the lips, the emblem of silence; 6. ANΦ, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Anubis,</hi> designated by the head of a shakal or Egyptian fox, commonly
                    mistaken for a dog; 7. ΣΘ, <hi rend="italic">Seth</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >Sothis,</hi> symbol unknown; 8. ∑APΠI, <hi rend="italic">Seraρi</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">;</hi> and, 9. IMOTΘΦ, <hi rend="italic">Imouth,</hi> the Egyptian
                    Aesculapius, the reading of whose name is confirmed by a papyrus containing the
                    expression, ’Aσ ’ κλjjπιoυ ô lffn <hi rend="italic">Iμουθου ùioí’ĩĩípai¢-
                    rou,</hi> “Asclepius (or Aesculapius), also called <hi rend="italic"
                    >Imouth,</hi> the son of Phtha.” Mr Salt then subjoins a tabular list of
                    Egyptian kings and queens whose names are all written phonetically, and
                    concludes with expressing an opinion, that, as the fact of phonetic
                    hieroglyphics having been in use in the earlier periods of the Egyptian monarchy
                    seems to be clearly established, so their application will be found not to have
                    been confined to the names of gods and kings or queens; an opinion the truth of
                    which Μ. Champollion had already, unknown to Mr Salt, produced a pretty
                    extensive series of readings to confirm. That the reader, however, may not be
                    bewildered by details, but may be enabled to comprehend the true nature and
                    bearing of these investigations, it may be proper to pause a little in our
                    exposition, and to take a retrospect, not merely of the results obtained, but of
                    the principles which have guided inquiry, and of the evidence by which the
                    different readings are supported.</p>

                    Young and Champollion, differs so greatly from every mode of writing known or
                    practised amongst Europeans, that a little scepticism at the outset of our
                    acquaintance with it is perhaps unavoidable. But we are much mistaken if the
                    evidence which prevailed over the early incredulity of Mr Salt will not prove
                    sufficient to convince the intelligent reader that, however anomalous this
                    system may appear, it was in reality employed by the Egyptians as an instrument
                    of communication, though most probably not to the extent which some contended
                    for. And, first, the fact of characters being used in a similar manner, in a
                    living language which upon the whole is not written phonetically, shows that the
                    system in question is not so contrary to analogy as might at first be imagined.
                    The Chinese, for instance, is a sylla-bicoideographic language, consisting of
                    diversified combinations of certain elements or <hi rend="italic">heys,</hi> two
                    hundred and fourteen in number; but, in order to express <hi rend="italic"
                    >foreign</hi> sounds, or combinations of sounds, the characters of that
                    language, instead of retaining their ordinary values, are rendered simply <hi
                    rend="italic">phonetic</hi> by an appropriate mark, and thus represent merely
                    the initial or predominant sound of the name or word of which they are the
                    common and recognised signs. Of this Μ. Klaproth has given an example in the
                    Chinese method of transcribing the name of <hi rend="italic">Maria,</hi> which
                    is represented by three characters, <hi rend="italic">Ma-li-ya,</hi> rendered
                    phonetic; the first signifying Jasper, the second <hi rend="italic">gain,</hi>
                    and the third <hi rend="italic">second in rank.</hi><note anchored="true"

                    break="no" facs="nls:193643632" xml:id="kp-eb0711-3632-0349"/> that the ordinary
                    system of Japanese writing resembles, more perhaps than any other, that employed
                    by the ancient Egyptians. “Les Japonais,” says he, “mêlent leurs signes
                    syllabiques, <hi rend="italic">exprimant des sons,</hi> aux caractères
                    idéographiques des Chinois, exactement comme les Egyptiens, dont l’écriture se
                    composait à-la-fois de signes phonétiques et de symboliques.” Lastly, on this
                    point, Μ. Saint-Martin, who has succeeded in deciphering an inscription in the
                    cuneiform characters, makes it evident by the word <hi rend="italic">Khchearcha,
                    Xerxes,</hi> which is written phonetically, that, in representing proper names,
                    these characters were employed on the same principle as the phonetic
                    hieroglyphics; and it is a singular enough coincidence that Μ. Champollion
                    recognised the same proper name, spelled in the very same manner, in a cartouche
                    engraved on a beautiful vase of oriental alabaster in the cabinet of the king at
                    Paris.</p>
                <p>In the second place, the progress of the discovery, and the facts connected with
                    it, seem to demonstrate its general truth and certainty. The name of <hi
                    rend="italic">Ptolemy,</hi> taken from the Rosetta inscription, rests upon the
                    basis of an accompanying translation; the same thing may be said of the name <hi
                    rend="italic">Cleopatra,</hi> obtained from the obelisk of Philae; and from
                    these two have the elements of the phonetic alphabet been derived. But the
                    strongest evidence, perhaps, in support of this alphabet, is the perfect
                    agreement of the results obtained by means of it with known facts in the history
                    of the individuals whose names have been deciphered, with the dates of the
                    edifices on which these names are sculptured, or with other circumstances of a
                    personal or general nature, the combination of which it is impossible to ascribe
                    to accident, or to account for in any way except by admitting the truth and
                    certainty of the discovery. Thus, the name of Ptolemy is found only upon
                    buildings which, in the style of their architecture, are evidently of a date
                    posterior to the older monuments of Egyptian art. The name of Cleopatra is
                    found, <hi rend="italic">as mother of a Ptolemy,</hi> at Ernent and at Kous,
                    where there is also a Greek inscription, in which Cleopatra is represented as
                    reigning <hi rend="italic">with her son;</hi> and a queen of the same name is
                    represented as the wife of a Ptolemy at Gau-Kibeer, at Dakké, in a temple of
                    Philae dedicated to Aphrodite, and in another discovered by Mr Salt, dedicated
                    to Aesculapius, in all of which it corresponds with the Greek inscriptions found
                    there; whilst, upon many other temples, a Cleopatra is constantly associated
                    with a Ptolemy. On the magnificent propylon at Karak, one of the wonders of
                    Egyptian architecture, the name of a Ptolemy accompanies, as usual, that of
                    Cleopatra; the name of Alexander, called the son of Ammon, is found in
                    juxtaposition with that of his father Philip; but at Edfou, the name of Ptolemy
                    is followed by the title of Alexander, and by the name of Berenice his wife.
                    Again, the titles of <hi rend="italic">Autohrator, Sebastos, Eusebes,
                    Kaisar,</hi> are continually found in conjunction with the names of Roman
                    emperors, but never with those of the Ptolemies; the titles of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Germanicus, Dacicus,</hi> are found annexed only to the names of those
                    sovereigns who bear these titles on their medals; the name of Hadrian is
                    prefixed, as it ought to be, to that of the Emperor Trajan; and the greater part
                    of the names of the emperors from Augustus to Commodus are found upon temples
                    and edifices, the style of which indicates that they are of more modern date
                    than those which belong to the age of the Ptolemies. Nor are these names and
                    titles, which have all been interpreted by means of the phonetic alphabet,
                    confined to a few insulated scrolls. On the contrary, they are sculptured by
                    hundreds throughout the different edifices in which there are no scrolls that do
                    not apply to those who were concerned in their construction. The oval or ring
                    containing the name of Hadrian is sculptured on a column the hieroglyphics of
                    which are known by a Greek inscription to have been executed immediately after
                    his reign; the name of <hi rend="italic">Soter</hi> repeatedly occurs, in
                    phonetic characters, amongst the hieroglyphics upon the <hi rend="italic"
                    >soros</hi> or mummy-case of a person whose name was Soter, as appears by the
                    Greek inscription upon the same coffin; and this name is also found, in the
                    Greek, immediately after that of <hi rend="italic">Osiris,</hi> exactly as Dr
                    Young had before stated, that the names of persons deceased were found in the
                    hieroglyphics on the body. Here, then, we have a mass of concurring evidence, a
                    series of corroborative circumstances, the coincidence and harmony of which
                    amount to a demonstration of the truth of the principles on which the phonetic
                    alphabet is founded, and of the certainty of its application, in as far at least
                    as regards proper names. True results can never be obtained from false
                    assumptions.</p>
                <p>Thirdly, it is greatly in favour of the phonetic system of interpretation that
                    the same lax and uncertain use of the vowels, which is observed in the
                    hieroglyphic writing, prevails also in the Coptic,<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>This has been very clearly shown by Mr Tattam
                    in his excellent <hi rend="italic">Grammar,</hi> and by Professor Kosegarten in
                    his very learned work <hi rend="italic">De Ρri</hi><hi rend="italic subscript">

                    there is the same confusion between the L and the R. The mixture of symbolic and
                    phonetic signs seems likewise a necessary consequence of the process by which,
                    it may reasonably be supposed, the transition from ideographic to phonetic
                    writing was produced. In this, as in so many other things, necessity was the
                    mother of invention. The impossibility of representing or discriminating by
                    symbols the proper names of individuals, led, as in the Chinese, to the
                    employment of phonetic characters, or, in other words, to the separate
                    indication of each letter or sound in the name by means of an appropriate sign
                    used phonetically; but as the names of the kings, which were probably the first
                    they desired to record, were usually formed from those of the gods, as <hi
                    rend="italic">Thoth-moξ,, Thoth-</hi> mosis, √4∕wn-rnai (Mai-α∕nwzz, Memnon),
                    <hi rend="italic">Amun-ορhth, jRam-ses, Osir-tesen,</hi> the sign which
                    represented the name of the god would still indicate, in a compendious and
                    intelligible manner, the syllable itself, instead of being composed into
                    separate letters, each with a separate representative. Thus, in the phonetic
                    name of Ranieses or Ramses, the emblem or symbol of the sun stands for the
                    syllable RA. Μ. Klaproth has not, we think, allowed sufficient weight to these
                    considerations, in some of his strictures on Μ. Champoilion. It is obvious,
                    however, that, as the Coptic is the descendant of the ancient Egyptian, and as a
                    knowledge of the latter can only be obtained by means of the former, our
                    confidence in the phonetic interpretation must be increased when we find that it
                    evolves the very same peculiarities observed in that language which embodies all
                    that remains of the idiom of the Pharaohs.</p>
                <p>But it is time to return to Μ. Champollion. We have already seen, that the
                    primary idea developed in his <hi rend="italic">Lettre</hi><hi rend="italic">a
                    Μ. Dacier</hi> received a more ample and extended application in his <hi
                    rend="italic">Precis</hi><hi rend="italic">du Système Hiéroglyphique des Anciens
                    Egyptiens,</hi> the first edition of which appeared in 1824&lt;; that in his <hi
                    rend="italic">Lettres</hi><hi rend="italic">d Μ. de Blacas,</hi> written from
                    Turin, he made numerous applications of his system, particularly to the ancient
                    dynastics of Egypt; and that, on his return from Italy, he published a second
                    edition of his <hi rend="italic">Precis,</hi> in which, however, he introduced
                    but few modifications of the statements and assertions contained in the first,
                    and in no degree altered or modified the opinion which he had therein expressed
                    as to the phonetic nature of the great mass of the hieroglyphics. This work,
                    which <pb break="no" facs="nls:193643645" xml:id="kp-eb0711-3645-0350"/>is
                    written with admirable clearness, and often displays great ingenuity, has for
                    its object to demonstrate, by inductive interpretations, 1. That the
                    phoneticohieroglyphic alphabet is applicable to the royal legends of every epoch
                    in the history of Egypt; 2. that this alphabet is the true key to the whole
                    liieroglyphical system; 3. that the ancient Egyptians constantly employed
                    hieroglyphics to represent alphabetically the sounds of words in their spoken
                    language; 4. that all the hieroglyphical inscriptions are, to a certain extent,
                    alphabetical; 5. that different kinds of characters, the nature of which
                    respectively he endeavours to define, were simultaneously employed in the
                    hieroglyphical texts; and, lastly, from all these propositions, each of which is
                    supported by a great variety of readings and examples, he attempted to deduce a
                    general theory of the graphic system of the ancient Egyptians, generalising with
                    a premature boldness, which afterwards exposed him to the merciless severity of
                    Μ. Klaproth’s criticism. With all its errors, contradictions, and
                    inconsistencies, however, this work displays extreme ingenuity, infinite
                    acuteness, and often rare felicity in the development of views, suggested,
                    perhaps, by an incidental analogy, which would have escaped a less ardent and
                    penetrating observer. This will be sufficiently evinced by the following brief
                    abstract of its contents.</p>
                <p>Neglecting the purely controversial, which is the least interesting part of the
                    work, and also omitting that portion in which he retraces the results already
                    obtained, we proceed at once to the application which he makes of the phonetic
                    alphabet to different hieroglyphical groups and grammatical forms of constant
                    recurrence in the inscriptions. The hieroglyphical groups of most frequent
                    occurrence in the texts are those which correspond to <hi rend="italic">son,
                    daughter, child</hi> or <hi rend="italic">nursling, offspring, father, mother,
                    sister,</hi><hi rend="italic">hing,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">place</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">locality.</hi> 1. The idea of <hi rend="italic">son</hi> is
                    expressed by three different hieroglyphic groups, which are often employed upon
                    the same monument. The most common is a goose <hi rend="smallcaps">sh</hi> or
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">sch,</hi> and a small perpendicular line <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">a</hi> or <hi rend="smallcaps">e,</hi> forming the word <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">ska, she,</hi> or sHi, connected with the Sahidic <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">sha,</hi><hi rend="italic">oriri, nasci,</hi> and the Memphitic
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">shai</hi> of the same import, and involved in the compounds
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">sheniot,</hi><hi rend="italic">son of father,</hi> or
                    brother consanguinean; <hi rend="smallcaps">shenmau,</hi><hi rend="italic">son
                    of mother,</hi> or brother uterine; <hi rend="smallcaps">shenson,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">son of brother,</hi> or cousin. The second group is formed of an
                    oval or ellipse s, and a small perpendicular line <hi rend="smallcaps">e,</hi>
                    making <hi rend="smallcaps">se</hi> or si, which appears in the composite Coptic
                    name <hi rend="smallcaps">Hôr-si-Êse</hi> or <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Hôr-si-Êsi,</hi><hi rend="italic">Horus the son of Isis.</hi><note

                    third is composed of the figure of a child with its hand at its mouth,
                    representing Σ in the title ∑g,8α&lt;rτoς of the Pamphilian obelisk, and the
                    small perpendicular line, which, as before, give the word <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >se</hi> or si. A fourth group, which in the hieroglyphical inscriptions
                    expresses <hi rend="italic">filiation,</hi> is written <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >ms,</hi> equivalent to the Coptic <hi rend="smallcaps">mes,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">enasci, gignere,</hi> whence <hi rend="smallcaps">mas</hi> and <hi

                    group is generally employed to indicate maternal descent, whilst the group <hi

                    Isis.</hi> 2. The group expressing <hi rend="italic">father,</hi> formed of the
                    segment of the sphere τ, the horned snake ou, and the small perpendicular line

                    is expressed in the hieroglyphical text by an owl <hi rend="smallcaps">μ,</hi>
                    and an extended arm <hi rend="smallcaps">a,</hi> thus giving the Coptic word <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">ma,</hi><hi rend="italic">place,</hi> which Dr Young
                    erroneously supposed to signify <hi rend="italic">father.</hi></p>
                <p>We come next to the signs or groups in the hieroglyphical texts which perform
                    certain grammatical functions, and express genders, numbers, persons, and times
                    or tenses. And, 1. The ordinary mark of feminine groups s, the segment of a
                    sphere τ, answering to the Coptic article τ', which also characterises the
                    feminine gender. Thus, si, <hi rend="italic">son,</hi> τsι, <hi rend="italic"
                    >the daughter</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> SN, <hi rend="italic"
                    >brother,</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">tsn</hi><hi rend="superscript smallcaps">
                    t</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">,</hi><hi rend="italic">the sister</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">;</hi> and TMAu, <hi rend="italic">the mother.</hi> But, in the
                    hieroglyphical inscriptions, the feminine article is sometimes placed at the end
                    of a group, which, accounts for our meeting sometimes with <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >mau,</hi><hi rend="italic">mother,</hi> and <hi rend="smallcaps">maut,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">the mother;</hi> although the Coptic presents no example of this
                    species of inversion in the use of the article. The masculine definite article
                    in Coptic is p, the equivalent of which is the striated square, the constant
                    sign of the same letter in all the Greek and Roman inscriptions. The plural
                    articles are two in number; first, the zigzag, or the simple horizontal line N;
                    and, secondly, the vase, which is also <hi rend="smallcaps">n</hi><hi
                    rend="smallcaps">;</hi> both being followed by the small perpendicular line <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">e, so</hi> that we have the Coptic articles <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">ne, ni,</hi> and <hi rend="smallcaps">να,</hi> of all which the
                    Rosetta inscription presents several examples. 2. The plural of nouns is
                    expressed either by prefixes or by terminations. The prefixes are the broken or
                    horizontal line N, which is the determinate plural article, and the vase, also
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">n,</hi> followed in both cases by the small perpendicular
                    line E, and equivalent to <hi rend="smallcaps">ne</hi> or <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >ni.</hi> The terminations are either two small perpendicular lines indicating
                    duality, or three such lines indicating indefinite plurality, as Dr Young
                    originally remarked. The two small lines, taken phonetically, are in proper
                    names and others equivalent to the <hi rend="smallcaps">e</hi> or i; the three
                    lines, preceded by the crooked staff <hi rend="italic">(lituus),</hi> or by the
                    quail, represent the Coptic plural termination <hi rend="smallcaps">oue</hi> or
                    oui. 3. As in the Sahidic or Theban dialect of the Coptic certain qualifying
                    words are formed by the conjunctive <hi rend="smallcaps">nt,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">qui,</hi> so in the hieroglyphical texts a number of groups
                    expressing qualifications, or employed adjectively, commence with the vase and
                    the segment of the sphere, the phonetic signs of <hi rend="smallcaps">nt.</hi>
                    4. In the hieroglyphical texts there has only been recognized one distinct group
                    representing a pronoun, the subject of a proposition: it is the pronoun of the
                    third person singular masculine, which is written phonetically <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">ntoph,</hi> being letter for letter Coptic. But numerous
                    examples occur of pronouns of the second, and particularly of the third person,
                    combined with nouns and verbs, sometimes as prefixes, though more commonly as
                    affixes. Thus, keeping in view that <hi rend="smallcaps">nph,</hi> or simply <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">ph,</hi> equivalent <pb break="no" facs="nls:193643658"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0711-3658-0351"/>to the Coptic NAPH or <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >neph,</hi> is the masculine, and s, equivalent to the Coptic <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">nes,</hi> the feminine affix of the third person., we have <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">toueph,</hi><hi rend="italic">father of him,</hi><hi
                    rend="smallcaps">toues,</hi><hi rend="italic">father of her;</hi> MOUTPH or
                    TMOUPH, <hi rend="italic">the mother of him,</hi> MOUTS, <hi rend="italic">the
                    mother of her</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> SEPH, <hi rend="italic">the son of
                    him,</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">ses,</hi><hi rend="italic">the son of her</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">;</hi> TSEPH or SETPH, <hi rend="italic">the daughter of him,</hi>
                    TSES or <hi rend="smallcaps">sets,</hi><hi rend="italic">the daughter of
                    her</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">snph,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >the brother of him,</hi> sκ <hi rend="superscript"> τ</hi> s, <hi rend="italic"
                    >the brother of her</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">t"snph</hi>
                    or <hi rend="smallcaps">sntph,</hi><hi rend="italic">the sister of him,</hi><hi
                    rend="smallcaps">snts,</hi><hi rend="italic">the sister of her.</hi> 6. In
                    Coptic the preposition <hi rend="smallcaps">n,</hi> prefixed to a noun,
                    indicates the genitive case; and in hieroglyphics the broken line N performs the
                    same function. Thus, in all the hieroglyphical legends placed beside the
                    representation of the god Horus, we read either <hi rend="smallcaps">Hôr she' n
                    Ousire',</hi><hi rend="italic">Horus, the son of Osiris,</hi> or <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Hôr she' n Ousire' ms n Ese,</hi><hi rend="italic">Horus, son
                    of Osiris, born of Isis.</hi></p>
                <p>In the hieroglyphical branch of the Rosetta inscription we meet with verbs in
                    three distinct tenses, present, past, and future, but only in the third person.
                    The characteristic signs of these tenses, taken phonetically, are however
                    nothing more than Coptic prefixes and affixes. Thus the third person plural of
                    the present is indicated in the hieroglyphical texts by a phonetic sign of s,
                    prefixed to the group representing the verb, and equivalent to the Coptic prefix
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">se.</hi> Next, the third person of what seems to be a past
                    tense is indicated by the affix of the horned snake <hi rend="smallcaps">ph</hi>
                    if the subject be masculine, and by that of the two sceptres s, if the subject
                    be feminine. Of these verbal forms distinct traces appear in one of the past
                    tenses of the verb <hi rend="smallcaps">djô,</hi><hi rend="italic">dicere,</hi>
                    as <hi rend="smallcaps">pedjai, pedjak, pedje, pedjaph,</hi> PEDJAS, in the
                    Sahidic, and <hi rend="smallcaps">pedjei, pedjek, pedje, pedjeph,</hi> in the
                    Memphitic dialect. Lastly, the third person plural of the future, in which form
                    appear all the verbs in the last nine lines of the hieroglyphical text of
                    Rosetta, is marked by a group of three characters, the recurved stem s, the
                    broken line N, and the three small perpendicular lines I or <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >e,</hi> from which we obtain <hi rend="smallcaps">sne,</hi> equivalent to <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">sene</hi> or <hi rend="smallcaps">sena,</hi> the characteristic
                    mark of the third person plural of the Coptic future definite. So much, then,
                    for the application of the phonetic alphabet to different hieroglyphical groups
                    of frequent occurrence, and also to certain grammatical forms; an application
                    which, in Champollion’s estimation, goes far to prove his general position, that
                    a great part of every hieroglyphical textis written alphabetically.</p>
                <p>The next subject of investigation, viz. deciphering the hieroglyphical names of
                    the Egyptian divinities, is one of equal interest and importance; but after the
                    notice which has already been taken of Mr Salt’s readings, and the publication
                    of Dr Young’s catalogue at the end of the article <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Egypt</hi> in the present work, it will only be necessary to advert to the
                    additional results obtained, and the corrections applied by Μ. Champollion. And
                    here it may be observed generally, that the images of the gods and goddesses
                    with which the Egyptian monuments of all orders abound, are preceded by
                    hieroglyphical legends, invariably commencing with three or four characters,
                    importing, <hi rend="italic">This is the aspect,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">mode
                    of existence,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">presence,</hi> or the <hi rend="italic"
                    >resemblance;</hi> and this formula is succeeded by the preposition <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">n,</hi><hi rend="italic">of,</hi> expressed by the broken or
                    horizontal line, after which comes the proper name of the god or goddess, which
                    is always written in the same phonetic characters with those of individuals. But
                    there is this difference observable, that instead of the figurative character
                    <hi rend="italic">man,</hi> which is found at the end of the latter, the names
                    of divinities are constantly terminated by the ideographic sign of <hi
                    rend="italic">god or goddess,</hi> as the case may be; a sign the import of
                    which was determined by a comparison of the Greek with the hieroglyphical and
                    enchorial texts of the Rosetta inscription. By this initial formula, and this
                    terminal character, the names of the Egyptian divinities may easily be
                    recognised on the monuments.</p>
                <p>From the testimony of the Greek writers, there can be no doubt that the god
                    represented on the monuments by a human figure with the head of a hawk,
                    surmounted by a globe or disc, is the Egyptian ’ Hλ∕og, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Sun,</hi> denominated <hi rend="smallcaps">Ra, Re',</hi> and <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Phre'.</hi> This name, which is of very frequent occurrence,
                    enters into the composition of Rameses or Ramses, written <hi rend="italic"

                    vowel, <hi rend="smallcaps">Pharaii,</hi> identical with <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Pharaoh,</hi> the denomination common to all the monarchs of Egypt. Josephus
                    informs us <hi rend="italic">(Αntiq. Jud.</hi> lib. viii. cap. 6, § 2) that
                    amongst the Egyptians <hi rend="italic">Pharaoh</hi> signified <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">He'</hi>;—and that to each king they gave the title of <hi
                    rend="italic">Sun,</hi> that is, called him <hi rend="smallcaps">Phre'</hi> or
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">Phra,</hi> is demonstrated by all the royal legends, and
                    even by the cartouches themselves, where this title is often expressed, not with
                    the symbolical disc, as when applied to the divinity himself, but with an
                    equivalent character, the figurative image of the sun, that is, a human figure
                    with the head of a hawk surmounted by a disc. This idea, which was originally
                    suggested by Air Wilkinson, has been fully developed and illustrated by Signor
                    ltosellini∙ “Il titolo di Faraone,” says the latter, “dobbiamo prenderlo dal
                    testo originale della Bibbia, ove sta seritto rrjr∣s, <hi rend="italic"

                    alterata dai Masoreti, forse non a capriccio, ma per rendere il suono Egiziano

                    potè probabilmente conservarsi nella tradi-zone degli Ebrei. Or dunque tra il

                    come vuol dirsi; e tale rimane nella stessa pronuzia dei Masoreti. Ma che la <hi

                    <hi rend="italic">uraeus</hi> or asp placed between his horns, or by a

                    >Amon-ra</hi> or <hi rend="smallcaps">Amon∙re',</hi> but more frequently a third

                    sculptured on the bas-reliefs of Ibsambul, Philae, Edfou, Ombos, and Thebes, is
                    the figure of a second divinity (d’uwao¢ dεoς), distinguished either by a solar
                    disc and crescent surmounting his head-dress, or by the ordinary sceptre of the
                    gods, combined with a nilometer, a handled cross, a lash, and a balance, or
                    enveloped from neck to heel in a close tight vestment, leaving at liberty only
                    the hanos which hold the sceptre; and there can be no doubt that this figure was
                    intended to represent Phtha, because the adjacent hieroglyphical group contains
                    the name of Phtha expressed in phonetic characters. These readings, then, serve
                    to confirm the statement of Eusebius, that Phtha was believed to be the son of
                    Kneph or Ammon-Chnuphis, the demiurgos of the Egyptian mythology. Amongst the
                    titles which the decree of Rosetta applies to Ptolemy Epiphanes is <hi

                    Latins Saturn, was deciphered from a Coptic manuscript in the Borgian Museum. In
                    a Greek inscription discovered by Ruppel at Schélé, between Elephantine and
                    Philae, and containing the names of different Egyptian divinities, is that of
                    the goddess ΣATH-Σ, or ΣATI-Σ, which occurs immediately after Ammon-Chnoubis,
                    and corresponds to the <hi rend="italic">'Hp]</hi> of the Greeks and the <hi
                    rend="italic">Juno</hi> of the Romans. But on the bas-reliefs the figure of
                    Ammon is always accompanied by that of a goddess, whose distinctive emblem is a
                    large feather stuck in her head-dress, and whose hieroglyphical name expressed
                    phonetically is <hi rend="italic">Sate</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Sati,</hi>
                    identical with the ∑αnjς or ∑ar∕ς of the Greek inscription above mentioned. Of
                    the divinities better known, the names deciphered by Μ. Champollion are, 1. <hi

                    rend="italic">B∙∕ς,</hi> and distinguished by the head of a shakal or fox, which
                    the Greeks mistook for that of a dog; 2. <hi rend="italic">Osiris,</hi> the

                    together with <hi rend="italic">Horus, Apis, Mnevis, Besa, Socka-ris,
                    Thermouthis,</hi> and the names of the greater part of the Decans represented on
                    the circular zodiac or planisphere of Denderah. From all this, then, the
                    inference deduced by Champollion is, that the Egyptians employed phonetic
                    hieroglyphics in writing the names of the different members of their populous
                    Pantheon.</p>
                <p>Results at once curious and interesting were likewise obtained by the application
                    of the phonetic alphabet to the names of private persons of both sexes. Of these
                    the Greek writers have preserved a considerable number, all of them composed of
                    the proper names of divinities, with the addition of some distinctive epithet,
                    and easily explicable with the aid of the Coptic. Thus <hi rend="italic"
                    >Kμυwaιος</hi> signifies given by Ammon; N∕rωκg∕ς, victorious Neith; ’Aðwd/;
                    engendered of Thoth; Mαg∕ς or Mo∕g∕ς, gift of Ré, or the Sun; ∑i∕4pouκgarjjς,
                    Hercules-Harpocrates; <hi rend="italic">Qομaι^a,</hi> the world friend of Phtha;
                    ΠαjjΛς, the consecrated to Isis; ∏αvoup∕ς, the consecrated to Chnuphis; <hi
                    rend="italic">Hα0εgμovr,</hi> the consecrated to Thermuthis; ΠsnjΛς, he who
                    belongs to Isis; <hi rend="italic">IIíroffiğ</hi><hi rend="italic">/ς,</hi> he
                    who belongs to Osiris; <hi rend="italic">MαηΛς,</hi> gift of Isis, or loving
                    Isis; <hi rend="italic">Ψεvaμovv,</hi> the child of Ammon; ∑gvoσ⅛g, the child of
                    Osiris; ∏sreag∙τo%gαr&gt;ji, he who belongs to Harpocrates; ∏mαgωjjg∕ς, he who
                    belongs to Aroueris; and so of the rest. The same observation may be applied to
                    the names deciphered by Champollion; they are all formed on the analogy
                    indicated by those which the Greek writers have preserved, and by their
                    composition they show that the mythological system of Egypt, like that of India,
                    had become interwoven with the whole texture of society, and with every
                    circumstance of life and manners. Religion, indeed, like a subtile spirit,
                    insinuated itself into every thing; and even the names of private individuals
                    contain evidence of its universal predominance. Thus we find <hi rend="italic"
                    >Petamun,</hi> he who belongs to Ammon; <hi rend="italic">Petarnu∙ ra,</hi> he
                    who belongs to Ammon-Ra; <hi rend="italic">Amenoph, Αμsvu- &lt;p</hi><hi

                    powerful, or the powerful by Phtha; <hi rend="italic">Pethorpre,</hi> he who
                    belongs to Horus and the Sun; <hi rend="italic">Petepré</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">Peteplire,</hi> the same with the <hi rend="italic">Putiphar</hi>
                    or rather <hi rend="italic">Putiphrah</hi> of Scripture, and in the Coptic text
                    of Genesis regularly written <hi rend="italic">Petephre,</hi> he who belongs to
                    <hi rend="italic">Ré</hi> or the Sun (priest of the Sun); <hi rend="italic"
                    >Isidjer</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Isidjor,</hi> Isis the great or powerful; <hi
                    rend="italic">Hatorshé</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Hatôrshet,</hi> child (male or
                    female) of <hi rend="italic">Hathôr</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Hor-amun,</hi> Horus-Ammon; <hi rend="italic">Hôrsiesi,</hi>
                    Horus, son of Isis; and <hi rend="italic">Amun-Hôrsiesi,</hi> Ammon-Horus, son
                    of Isis. It is to be observed, however, that the Egyptian proper names of
                    private individuals are never included in an elliptical ring or cartouche, which
                    is the distinctive mark of the proper names of sovereigns alone; they are
                    written like the ordinary current text of the hieroglyphics, but are constantly
                    terminated either by the figurative emblem of <hi rend="italic">man,</hi> or by
                    the sign of the feminine gender, as the case may be. From this branch of his
                    analysis Champollion concludes that the proper names of individuals were written
                    phonetically; and consequently that theopi-</p>

                    Eusebius informs us that the Egyptians represented the <hi rend="italic"
                    >demiurgos,</hi> or creator of the world, under a human form, covered with blue
                    flesh, encircled by a zone or girdle, holding a sceptre, and having on the head
                    a royal ornamented head-dress of feathers-Porphyry gives us the same
                    information. “Hujus porro Kvij¢ imaginem, inquit, humana fonna depingunt, colore
                    caeruleo, zonam tenentem et sceptrum, pennam gerentem in capite; ovum ab ore
                    producit, a quo nascitur deus quem Aegyptfi Phtha, Graeci Vulcanum vocant.” On
                    all the monuments the god called alternately <hi rend="smallcaps">Amun</hi> and
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">Noub</hi> accordingly appears under a human form, with
                    flesh painted blue, encircled with a zone, and having his head-dress surmounted
                    by two enormous feathers of different colours. Eusebius further informs us <hi
                    rend="italic">(Proeparatio Εvangelii,</hi> lib. iii. cap. 9, p. 115, Paris,
                    1628) that <hi rend="italic">Knaph</hi> was emblematically represented under the
                    form of a serpent; and we have already seen that, on the Basilidian Stones, the
                    names <hi rend="italic">Xtevļnţ, Xvoυβn,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Xwυμn,</hi>
                    are accompanied by the image of a serpent. On the monuments in the elder style
                    of Egyptian art, this divinity is sometimes found with an <hi rend="italic"
                    >uroeus</hi> on his head; but he is more frequently preceded or followed by a
                    huge serpent nearly covering his visible image with its voluminous coils. Kneph
                    was regarded by the Egyptians as the ’ <hi rend="italic">ΑγaHoδa&gt;μωv,</hi> or
                    good genius, and, in this character, he was also represented by a serpent. Nor
                    is it undeserving of notice, in considering his distinctive attributes or
                    emblems, that the surname of <hi rend="italic">Hioaγaio^a</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >∣</hi><hi rend="italic">μωv,</hi> given by flattery to Nero upon those of his
                    medals which were struck in Egypt, is combined with the image of an enormous
                    bearded serpent having its head ornamented with a symbolical head-dress. Lastly,
                    the Greek and Latin inscriptions, in which <hi rend="italic">Ammon-Chnoubis</hi>
                    is mentioned, were found, the one in the isle of Schélé, near Syene, and the
                    other at Syene itself; in short, at a small distance from the isle of
                    Elephantine, where Strabo places the temple of K&gt;βy∣p&lt;i, and where,
                    according to Eusebius, the divinity worshipped was represented under a human
                    form with the head of a ram surmounted by a solar disc, and had the flesh
                    painted blue. There can be little doubt, then, that the god who, in the
                    hieroglyphical text, bears the name of <hi rend="smallcaps">Neb</hi> or <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Ner, Noub</hi> or <hi rend="smallcaps">Nouf,</hi> and <hi

                <p>The next subject which engaged the attention of Champollion was the analysis of
                    the royal titles and qualifications inscribed on the more ancient Egyptian
                    monuments; an analysis the object of which is to show that, even anterior to the
                    Persian invasion, the Egyptians employed in their hieroglyphical texts
                    characters representing the sounds of the spoken language; and that these words
                    are expressed by signs similar in form and in value to those which were
                    afterwards used for transcribing the proper names and titles of the Greek kings
                    and Roman emperors. In his <hi rend="italic">Lettre à</hi><hi rend="italic">Μ.
                    Dacier,</hi> Μ. Champollion proved by an unbroken series of facts that the
                    Egyptians wrote phonetically, or employed the figures of objects to express
                    sounds, from the conquest of Egypt by Alexander the Great <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >(a. c.</hi> 332) till the close of the reign of Antoninus <hi rend="smallcaps"

                    preceded the Macedonian by nearly two hundred years (193), the question which
                    next arose was, whether, in the interval between these two conquests, and still
                    more in the periods of the Egyptian monarchy anterior to the first or Persian,
                    any traces of the same system of writing could be discovered. If this point were
                    determined in the affirmative, Μ. Champollion conceived that the chain of
                    evidence would thus be rendered complete. His reasoning, however, involves
                    several elements of uncertainty. In the first place, the period at which any
                    given name was inscribed on a monument may not have been contemporary either
                    with the erection of the monument itself, or with the age of the individual
                    whose name has been so inscribed. Secondly, the style of the architecture of the
                    monuments is by no means an infallible indication of the epoch to which their
                    construction should be referred, inasmuch as the rise and decline of the art
                    must necessarily exhibit many points in common, and show nearly the same
                    relative imperfection, and as the more ancient are consequently in danger of
                    being confounded with the more modern edifices. Thirdly, though the dates of the
                    monuments may be ascertained from these dedications, or from independent
                    historical authority, the time when any given name was inscribed thereon is not
                    determinable by the same evidence, and can only be inferred from accessory
                    circumstances, which seldom amount to more than a probability, the value of
                    which, in ordinary circumstances, cannot exceed that of a reasonable
                    conjecture.</p>
                <p>But, however this may be, we shall complete our abstract of Μ. Champollion’s
                    investigations by exhibiting a few of the results which he obtained by
                    deciphering hieroglyphic names sculptured on the monuments supposed to belong to
                    the early age of Egyptian art. And, 1. In a cartouche engraved on a vase of
                    oriental alabaster, preserved in the cabinet of the king at Paris, Μ.
                    Champollion, as already mentioned, deciphered the name of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Xerxes,</hi> written <hi rend="smallcaps">Khschearscha,</hi> which is the
                    Persian name of that monarch, without any other omission than that of a sort of
                    medial vowel; and this hieroglyphic name is accompanied by five characters, the
                    phonetic values of which give the word <hi rend="smallcaps">Ierina</hi> or <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Iriena,</hi> the same with <hi rend="smallcaps">Iere,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Iranian</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Persian.</hi> 2. In the
                    twenty-ninth or Mende-sian dynasty Manetho places a king whose name is written
                    Aχω^∕j, probably the ’ Aκog∕ς of Diodorus Siculus; and this king had for his
                    immediate predecessor and immediate successor two princes of the name of
                    N≡ς≡g∕r^ς, as written by Manetho, or <hi rend="italic">N&gt;φsgsυς,</hi> as
                    written by Diodorus. But on two sphinxes, the style of which approaches that of
                    the sculptures executed under the Greek kings of Egypt, were found the
                    hieroglyphical name of a king <hi rend="smallcaps">Hakr,</hi> ’AKÓP-z¢, and that
                    of a king <hi rend="smallcaps">Naifroue'</hi> or <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Naifroui,</hi> supposed to be identical with <hi rend="italic">Neplιereus</hi>

                    Augustus caused to be transported from Egypt to Rome, and placed as a gnomon in
                    the Campus Martius, may be read <hi rend="smallcaps">Psmt</hi> or <hi

                    lib. xxxvi. c∙ 8, 9, 10.) The name on this obelisk is, according to Champollion,

                    conquest.</p></note> one of the most enlightened kings of Egypt, who opened the
                    ports of that kingdom to the Greeks, encouraged commerce, patronised the arts,
                    and sought to revive the maritime power of his country. 4. According to Manetho,
                    the second king of the twenty-third or Tanite dynasty bore the name of <hi

                    >Osortasen,</hi> which also occurs on a small statue of carnelian in the cabinet

                    sixteenth dynasty, and he with whom the monumental history of Egypt is supposed
                    to commence. 5. From the same monuments have been obtained the names of several
                    other kings and queens belonging to the twenty-third dynasty, particularly those
                    of <hi rend="smallcaps">Ptahaftep,</hi> the Petubastes of the Greeks, and father
                    of Osorthos; <hi rend="smallcaps">Ran,</hi> his queen; <hi rend="smallcaps"

                    is denominated by Manetho Σf&lt;r0χ⅝∕5 or being the Pharaoh who in Scripture is

                    Rehoboam the grandson of David, pillaged Jerusalem, and carried off “all the
                    shields of gold which Solomon had made.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>See First Kings, chap. xiv. ver. 25, 26.</p></note> Upon one
                    of the colonnades which decorate the court of the grand palace at Karnak are two
                    royal legends, the praenomen in the first of which contains the title “approved
                    of the Sun,” followed by “the beloved of <hi rend="italic">Ammon,
                    Scheschonk,''</hi> apparently identical with the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Sesonchis</hi> of Manetho; but, in the second legend, we read “the beloved of
                    Ammon, <hi rend="italic">Osorhon,”</hi> and the king called <hi rend="italic
                    superscript"> ,</hi><hi rend="italic">Qδo1∙χοv,</hi> who has sometimes been
                    confounded with <hi rend="italic">’Offoğâan,</hi> was the immediate successor of
                    Sesonchis. A variety of other legends serve to confirm this conclusion. 7. The
                    next Pharaonic name deciphered by Champollion is that of the head of the
                    nineteenth dynasty, which was one of theDiospolitan. It occurs on almost every
                    monument executed in the ancient style of art; it is written <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Remses,</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">Ramses, Amun-mai-Ramses,
                    Amun-Ramses-mai</hi>; and, according to Champollion, it is <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ,</hi> that of Rameses the Great, the same sovereign who is
                    called <hi rend="italic">Sethosis</hi> by Manetho, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Sesoosis</hi> by Diodorus Siculus, and <hi rend="italic">Sesostris</hi> by
                    Herodotus and Strabo. This conclusion is not hypothetical or conjectural; it has
                    been established by a very elaborate historical investigation, in which, as
                    appears to us, the identity of these various names has been made out in a very
                    satisfactory manner. 8. Lastly, of the sovereigns belonging to the eighteenth
                    <pb break="no" facs="nls:193643697" xml:id="kp-eb0711-3697-0354"/>dynasty, which
                    was also Diospolitan, Champollion deciphered those of <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Meiamoun-Ramses, Ramses</hi> 1., <hi rend="smallcaps">Amenophis</hi> II. whom
                    the Greeks, mistaking a title <hi rend="smallcaps">(Meiamoun)</hi> for a name,
                    called <hi rend="italic">Memnon,</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">Amenophis</hi> I.,
                    and, finally, that of <hi rend="smallcaps">Thouthmosis,</hi> the founder.</p>
                <p>These results are supposed to have received a remarkable confirmation from the
                    Genealogical Table of Abydos. This interesting monument was disinterred by Mr
                    Bankes in 1818, while excavating for the purpose of obtaining an accurate ground
                    plan of the extensive ruins of Abydos; and, soon after his return to England, he
                    caused it to be lithographed, and copies to be distributed to different persons
                    both in this country and in France.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    A design of the Tablet was also made by Caillaud, but it is exceedingly ill
                    executed, and, in the first or uppermost row of royal names, a cartouche is
                    wanting. This important and interesting monument is composed of three rows of
                    royal names, each row containing twenty-six; and the two upper rows exhibit the
                    names of kings, arranged in the order of immediate succession, to perform a
                    propitiatory act in favour of Ramses III. whose name and praenomen repeated
                    occupy the whole of the last row. That the names in the two upper compartments
                    present an immediate succession of kings, is rendered certain by other monuments
                    which are particularly referred to by Rosellini. The names in this tablet are
                    arranged in retrograde order from the right to the left, so that the fifty-first
                    scroll, reckoning from the commencement, is the last of the series, whilst the
                    fifty-second contains the proper name of that king whose praenomen is included
                    in the scroll immediately preceding; and the first of the upper compartment on
                    the right is of course the most ancient of all these kings. With the forty-first
                    scroll commences the series of kings belonging to the eighteenth dynasty; the
                    six preceding rings to number thirty-five contain the seventeenth dynasty of
                    Theban Pharaohs, which was composed of the same number of kings; and in the five
                    scrolls to thirty we should have read the names of the five kings who composed
                    the sixteenth dynasty, if the characters had not been obliterated by time; but
                    two of these have fortunately been preserved by other monuments. In the second
                    compartment there still remain three scrolls (the 29th, 28th, and 27th), which,
                    with the twenty-six of the first or uppermost row, form the names of twenty-nine
                    kings, who must have preceded the accession of the sixteenth dynasty. The
                    chronological Canon of Manetho does not give the number of kings who belonged to
                    the fifteenth dynasty; it merely informs us that this dynasty was Theban, and
                    lasted two hundred and fifty years. “Nel silenzio delle liste (di Manetone),”
                    says Rosellini “viene opportunissima la Tavola di Abydos, la quale io credo fuor
                    d’ogni dubbio darci, in questi ventinove cartelli, l’esatto numero dei re che
                    formarono la dinastia XV.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>“E del mio credo ecco le prove,” says the learned Italian. “La dinastia xiv.

                    non esser probabile che, nei rimanenti ventinove cartelli del quadro di Abydos,
                    consumato il numero, taciuto da Eusebio, dei re della dinastia xv., si possano
                    comprendere ancora alcuni re della xiv. Poichè esprimendo questo quadro una

                    s’introducano i soli re delle familie Tebane, che con lui ebber commune la
                    patria e verisimilmente la discendenza. Nè sarebbe credibile che sovrani di una
                    altra famiglia, quai fu la Choite, la quale lungamente interruppe il regno delle
                    familie Tebane, cominciato fino dalla dinastia decimaprima, fossero ammessi in
                    comunione di prece a favore di un re Tebano. Imperocchè il cangiamento delle
                    dinastic fu quasi sempre operato, in tutti i tempi e presso tutti i popoli, per
                    civili discordie e per violenze; e sempre partori negli ofiesi, od; implacabili
                    e lunghi. I re poi della dinastia xv. regnarono dugento e cinquant’anni. Dato
                    pertanto un numero approssi-mativo di re per riempier questo spazio, non
                    resterebbero, dei ventinove nomi della Tavola di Abydos, altro che pochi da
                    ascriversi alla dinastia xiv. la quale ebbe settantasei sovrani. E perché poi se
                    qualcuno di loro in questo quadro fu ammesso, sarebbero tutti gü altri rimasti
                    esclusi? I limiti della Tavola di Abydos non crano fissati da alcuna legge. La

                    to form this opinion; but if he be right in ascribing all these twenty-nine
                    names to the fifteenth dynasty, it will follow that the average duration of each
                    reign of that dynasty was only about eighty years and a half, which is
                    considerably below the average duration of a reign in other dynastics of which
                    complete lists have been given. This monument has suffered severe injury from
                    time. In the first or uppermost compartment, twelve scrolls have been entirely
                    and two of them partially effaced; in the second, eight have been totally
                    obliterated; and in the third, three have been destroyed, four rendered
                    illegible, and one partially injured. Μ. Klaproth has given it as his opinion
                    that the Table of Abydos, instead of being read horizontally from right to left,
                    should be read perpendicularly from right to left, in columns of two lines;<note

                    he has marked his copy of the monument, so as to indicate such a mode of
                    interpretation, he has not ventured to exemplify his suggestion; and a very
                    careful examination of the tablet has convinced us that this idea is erroneous.
                    The repetition of the name and praenomen of Ramses <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Amun-mai-Ramses),</hi> each thirteen times, in the third row or compartment,
                    excludes such a supposition. But there can be no doubt whatever that the
                    ordinary hieroglyphics in the two vertical columns on the left, containing the
                    propitiatory act, are to be read perpendicularly, from the top to the bottom,
                    beginning with the column towards the right.</p>
                <p>Hasty, premature generalization formed the prominent defect of Μ. Champollion’s
                    mind. The importance of the monument discovered by Mr Bankes cannot well be
                    estimated too highly; but we are not yet perhaps in a condition to appreciate
                    its full value. Μ. Champollion, however, assuming a tone of confidence, which,
                    on a subject of this nature, is worse than ludicrous, boldly laid it down,
                    first, that his investigations had been confirmed, in the most remarkable
                    manner, by the monument of Abydos; secondly, that, as far as these proceeded,
                    they had established the accuracy of the royal chronological Canon of Manetho,
                    preserved by Julius Africanus, Josephus, and Eusebius, a record which the
                    learned in their ignorance had contemned as unworthy of credit; and, thirdly,
                    that by his researches, taken in conjunction with the TableorAbydos, the Canon
                    of the high-priest of Heliopolis<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>This celebrated Egyptian priest, who was a native of
                    Sebennytus, flourished in the reign of Ptolemy Philadelphus, about 260 years
                    before our era. He discharged the functions of sacrificer, and keeper of the
                    sacred animals, in the temple of Heliopolis, where <pb

                    Phtha. Of his history of Egypt, which was written in Greek, some fragments only
                    are extant. Μ. Klaproth seems to think that he has given the true names of the
                    Egyptian monarchs, and that the series of Egyptian kings extracted from the
                    monuments should generally be conformable to the catalogue given by Manetho. “On
                    ne peut done pas douter, says he, “qu’il ne nous ait conservé les véritables
                    noms des monarques Egyptiens, et non pas, comine Μ. Champollion le dit, par

                    Manetho can only be considered as a standard in regard to what was believed or
                    represented by the priests; in other respects, his statements must be liable to
                    every objection which can be competently urged against the records from which he
                    copied, or the authorities upon which he relied.</p></note> had <pb

                    considerations, which render it impossible for us to acquiesce implicitly in
                    these conclusions.</p>
                <p>And, first of all, the Table of Abydos differs in many most essential particulars
                    from the royal Canon of Manetho. In the eighteenth dynasty, for instance,

                    type="authorial"><p>“Allowing to Μ. Champollion,” says Sir William Drummond, in
                    a letter dated Naples, 27th April 1827, addressed to the author of this article,
                    “that he reads and comprehends the hieroglyphical monuments of the Egyptians as
                    well and as accurately as he does the <hi rend="italic">Moniteur,</hi> or the
                    <hi rend="italic">Gazette de Paris,</hi> I should still hesitate before I
                    admitted his testimony in favour of Manetho. I bave not seen his book on the
                    chronology of Egypt; but I have had in my possession a very accurate copy of the
                    Table of Abydos, and I have examined it with the assistance of one of the most
                    devoted of Μ. Champoilion’s admirers. That gentleman pointed out to me several
                    names, which, he said, were those of kings of the eighteenth dynasty. But I
                    inquired in vain for dates. Perhaps Μ. Champollion has since discovered them,
                    and can tell us whether Josephus, or Julius Africanus, or Eusebius, be right, or
                    whether all three are wrong.” We suspect Μ. Champollion never made such a
                    discovery.</p></note> and other discrepancies of equal magnitude might easily be
                    pointed out. But our objections strike deeper, and apply much more to principles
                    than to details. The Table of Abydos, with which M. Champollion began his
                    defence of the chronology of Manetho, is the foundation upon which his disciples
                    and followers, including Rosellini, still in a great measure build. We do not
                    object to Manetho, that if his chronology be right, that of Herodotus, Diodorus,
                    and Eratosthenes must be wrong. Neither would we reject it þecause, if all his
                    dynastics existed, and if he were accurate in every point, as Μ. Champollion
                    contended, we might give the chronology of Moses to the winds. Truth is our
                    first object; and if it had been proved to be on the side of the high priest of
                    Phtha, we should not have hesitated a moment to join his standard. But the
                    inconsistencies, not to say contradictions, of which this high priest has been
                    guilty, and the improbable, nay incredible, stories which he relates, render his
                    honesty questionable, and accuse his judgment of positive imbecility. Manetho,
                    however, has had his supporters amongst chronologers. If the system of
                    collateral dynastics, so ingeniously and at the same time so erroneously
                    imagined by Marsham, should be revived, the assistance of Manetho might again be
                    required. Even Fréret, whilst he contended against Newton, where Newton was not
                    in his strength, did not disdain to invoke that assistance. It is not the less
                    true, that the learned in general have condemned the chronology of Manetho as
                    erroneous and untenable. But in Μ. Champoilion’s speculations we have all at
                    once a new defence set up for the high priest of Phtha. By the results of a
                    double discovery, that of the long-lost key of the Egyptian hieroglyphics, and
                    the disinterment of a new monument containing a catalogue of the Egyptian kings,
                    predecessors of Ramses III. the royal Canon has been replaced within the pale of
                    history, and Manetho proved to have been accurate in all his statements.</p>
                <p>But this assertion, though very confidently made, has not served to overcome our
                    incredulity. Our objections to Manetho’s chronology are numerous. It would be
                    nothing to us if Μ. Champoilion had found the Hermetic books from which Manetho
                    affirmed that he had made his extracts. We do not deny that the latter copied
                    documents which existed in his time, and which the zeal and success of future
                    inquirers may, perhaps, prove to exist at present. We allow that he quoted from
                    the records of the priests; but we dispute the authenticity of those records. We
                    hesitate not to believe Herodotus when he tells us that the priests of Egypt
                    communicated to him their archives. We doubt not the word of this honest, though
                    somewhat credulous historian, when he says that the wooden images of three
                    hundred and forty-one pontiffs, whohad succeeded each other, from father to son,
                    had been exhibited to him by the priests. We only contend that the archives were
                    forgeries, and that the images, like some other images, were the fabrications of
                    fraud and imposture. Three hundred and forty-one descents, in unbroken
                    succession, would be nearly as great a miracle as any of those which the
                    legislator of the Jews, in preparing the deliverance of his countrymen,
                    performed in Egypt; and, even if this difficulty were overcome, all chronology
                    would be disturbed by an hypothesis which, taking the ordinary average of human
                    life, and allowing thirty-three years for a generation, involves a period of
                    rather more than eleven thousand years. Nor is this all. It would seem that, in
                    every separate district of Egypt, the priests had distinct and totally different
                    records. How shall we account otherwise for the very different statements of
                    Herodotus, of Manetho, of Eratosthenes, of the author of the Old Chronicle, and
                    of Diodorus Siculus? The Greeks were clearly made the dupes of these falsified
                    archives, and now the moderns are to be duped by them in their turn. But if the
                    archives of the Egyptians plainly and positively contradict each other, as it is
                    manifest from the testimony of the Greeks that they do; if the internal evidence
                    of these records show that one is not more worthy of belief than another, as Sir
                    William Drummond has most conclusively proved in the second volume of his <hi
                    rend="italic">Origines;</hi> to what purpose, unless it be to gratify curiosity,
                    can they be reproduced at the present time? It would be no answer to this that
                    Μ. Champollion had found the very records themselves which Manetho copied, and
                    in which a lamb is said to have spoken in the time of Busiris; for we should
                    still contend that these records, like those shown to Herodotus, and those
                    explained to Diodorus Siculus, were mere fabrications forged by the priests of
                    Egypt.</p>
                <p>But whilst we distrust the authority of Manetho as founded on documents unworthy
                    of credit, and contend that the coincidences discovered in the Table of Abydos
                    cannot make that authority either better or worse than it was before, we are at
                    the same time prepared to admit that Μ. Champoilion has done much to prepare the
                    way for a more extensive acquaintance with the monumental records of ancient
                    Egypt. That he has pushed his conclusions a great deal too far, is undeniable;
                    that when he adopted new opinions he seldom or never took the trouble to retract
                    his old ones, or explain why he had abandoned them, is certain; that, in his
                    interpretations, a sign sometimes represented one letter, sometimes another, has
                    been indisputably established by Μ. Klaproth; and that too much still rests on
                    his unsupported authority, is unfortunately<pb break="no" facs="nls:193643723"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0711-3723-0356"/> beyond dispute. Considered in one point of view,
                    he was little better than a brilliant empiric. Instead of cautiously working out
                    his conclusions from fixed and settled premises, he dashed off conjectures which
                    sometimes dazzled by their ingenuity, and at other times overcame all objections
                    by their extreme felicity, but which, upon many occasions, were extravagant and
                    empirical in the highest degree. In a subject beset with difficulties of the
                    most formidable kind, he refused to admit that to him any obstacles were
                    insuperable. Signs at one moment assumed a phonetic, at another a symbolic or
                    ideographic power, as the occasion seemed to require, at the fiat of this
                    hieroglyphical conjuror; when he happened not to find a Coptic word suited to
                    his purpose, he scrupled not to invent one; and, with the strongest adverse
                    facts staring him in the face, he persisted to the last in asserting the almost
                    unlimited applicability of his alphabet. On several occasions, indeed, he acted
                    as if he wished it to be believed that he read and comprehended hieroglyphical
                    inscriptions, and even enchorial texts, with as much facility and,accuracy as he
                    did the <hi rend="italic">Moniteur</hi> or the <hi rend="italic">Gazette de
                    Paris.</hi> Of this he gave a striking but most unfortunate exemplification in
                    the affair of the papyrus in the collection of Μ. Sallier at Aix; an affair
                    which, very soon after its occurrence, was placed in its true light before the
                    public by the author of this article, in a journal which he then conducted. Μ.
                    Champollion remained two days at Aix;<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    evening of the second day that a packet of papyri was placed in his hands. No
                    matter for this; time and labour, which are so necessary to other men, the
                    intuitive penetration of Μ. Champollion enabled him to dispense withal. In a
                    single evening he ascertained the contents of all these manuscripts, and decided
                    off-hand that the third, of which the first pages were wanting, was “a real
                    historical treasure,” containing the praises and exploits of Rameses the Great,
                    or Sesostris, in the form of a kind of dithyrambic dialogue between the gods and
                    the king. He also read, or rather pretended to read, the names of fifteen
                    conquered nations, amongst which were mentioned the Ionians <hi rend="italic"
                    >{Iouni</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Iavani),</hi> the Lycians <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Louka</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Loukι),</hi> and also the Ethiopians and
                    Arabs; and he further informed us that the manuscript spoke of the chiefs of
                    these nations, “led into captivity, and the tributes imposed upon their
                    countries.” All this was the work of one evening; all this, if Μ. Champollion
                    may be in aught believed, was deciphered from a manuscript papyrus written in a
                    character the signs of which are but imperfectly ascertained, in a language of
                    which it is only known that the Coptic, in its various forms or dialects, bears
                    to it nearly the same relation as the Italian or Spanish does to the Latin, or
                    the modern to the ancient Greek.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>No sooner did. Μ. Champollion arrive in Egypt than he gave a
                    fresh proof of his unhesitating decision. At eight o’clock in the evening he had
                    an interview with the viceroy, who requested a translation of the inscription on
                    the obelisks of Alexandria, which have three, columns of characters on each
                    face. The Frenchman at once undertook to gratify the viceroy’s curiosity, and

                    sufficient to alarm the most credulous believer, and to excite suspicion and
                    distrust in regard to all that he had actually accomplished.</p>
                <p>In contradistinction to all this haste and empiricism, we shall here introduce
                    the deliberately-expressed opinion of a sober and patient inquirer, formed after
                    twelve years’ laborious practice in the application of the phonetic system.
                    “With regard to the translation of hieroglyphics,” says Mr Wilkinson, “Μ.
                    Champollion must allow, no one is yet sufficiently advanced in the language of
                    ancient Egypt to enable him literally to translate an inscription of any length,
                    or moderately complicated, though a general meaning may frequently be obtained.
                    Time will no doubt do more, and we may hope to see this language interpreted
                    with the same facility as many with which we have long been acquainted. But the
                    steps must be slow and cautious; and the only mode of convincing those who still
                    adhere to a contrary opinion, is to trust little to conjecture, or at least to
                    state an uncertainty, whenever it exists; to admit and correct errors when
                    discovered; and to settle a fixed rather than a temporary interpretation to the
                    groups which will answer to their meaning whenever they occur.”<note

                    Champollion’s unlimited confidence in his alphabet, enchorial as well as
                    hieroglyphical, and his consequent adoption of the principle that the Egyptian
                    system of writing hitherto regarded as almost wholly consisting of symbols or
                    emblems of ideas, was, on the contrary, composed of signs, a large proportion of
                    which expressed merely the sounds of words in the spoken language of ancient
                    Egypt. The consequence was, that he disregarded the tentative or experimental
                    method of investigation, to which Dr Young was mainly indebted for the
                    discoveries which have given such lustre to his name; believing his alphabet an
                    instrument of general if not universal applicability, he shrunk from the labour
                    of the exhaustive process of hypothetical induction, by which the values of
                    entire <hi rend="italic">groups</hi> maybe determined, notwithstanding their
                    constituent elements remain unknown; and to this unfortunate misconception, or
                    rather limitation, may be attributed all the inconsistencies into which he was
                    betrayed in endeavouring, by means of his alphabet, to interpret signs which are
                    not alphabetical. It was not by the enchorial alphabet, for example, that Dr
                    Young was enabled to translate enchorial manuscripts, which, in fact, are not
                    reducible to any alphabet, except in proper names; it was the <hi rend="italic"
                    >words</hi> or groups themselves which he translated, with now and then only a
                    hint from a letter or two. In regard to the sacred characters, Μ. Champollion
                    has no doubt rendered it highly probable that the phonetic signs were much more
                    extensively employed than Dr Young had at first imagined; but, on the other
                    hand, he pushed his system to an extravagant length, and neglected that method
                    of investigation so successfully exemplified by Dr Young, which, when
                    systematically applied, must ultimately lead to certain results, because it is
                    founded on the principle of a constant correction of errors and accumulation of
                    evidence.</p>
                <p>Even in deciphering proper names, which are incontestably written phonetically,
                    the difficulty experienced is great, and the risk of error often incalculable.
                    This arises from the capricious and arbitrary manner in which they are written;
                    sometimes from the left to the right, at other times from the right to the left,
                    most frequently up and down; whilst the elements of one word are often thrown
                    together pell-mell, in such a way that unless the sound of the word were somehow
                    known beforehand, it would be absolutely impossible to dispose or arrange the
                    characters representing it in correct order; and where this previous knowledge
                    is wanting, the chance of error must be very <pb break="no" facs="nls:193643736"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0711-3736-0357"/>great, and the probability will therefore be,
                    either that a barbarous word will be involuntarily formed, or that one very
                    different from that which is actually formed will be evolved. This observation
                    applies rigorously to all the words of the Egyptian language, and even extends
                    to such proper names of gods and kings as are not derived from the Greek or
                    Latin, and the exact forms of which have not been transmitted to us by the
                    ancient authors. Let us suppose, for example, that, by means of the phonetic
                    alphabet, the following groups of literal characters are recognised in an
                    inscription:</p>
                <p>A person skilled in the interpretation of hieroglyphics would readily discover
                    that No. 1 is the name of <hi rend="italic">Cleopatra,</hi> which, in fact, is
                    so written in a ring or cartouche contained in an inscription of Philae,
                    published by Mr Salt; and that No. 2 is the name of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Tσutmosis,</hi> which is otherwise well known. But if this were not so, and if
                    we were devoid of all extrinsic information or assistance, the doctrine of
                    probabilities has no formula to exhaust the number of combinations amongst which
                    an interpreter might fluctuate before discovering the true collocation; and,
                    what is more, he could never be absolutely certain that he had discovered it at
                    all.</p>
                <p>Another and still more formidable obstacle to be surmounted, is the incomplete
                    and imperfect manner in which the Coptic represents the ancient Egyptian,
                    notwithstanding it may, in one sense (as we have already shown), be considered
                    as a precious remnant of that language. Hence, supposing that the forms and
                    values of the letters were perfectly determined, that their arrangement was well
                    understood, that, in a word, we could spell syllables and distinguish words with
                    as much certainty and precision as in the improved alphabets of the West, there
                    would yet always remain one difficulty, over which genius itself could not
                    triumph, namely, to discover the signification of the words, when it is not
                    known by tradition or otherwise. Some of the misjudging admirers of Μ.
                    Champollion have talked of his labours in deciphering the hieroglyphical
                    inscriptions, as if he had been accustomed to read the most ancient legends with
                    the greatest facility and certainty; and, from a number of circumstances, it is
                    but too.obvious that he himself evinced no disposition whatever to disturb this
                    belief in the omniscience of his genius for interpretation. But the interests of
                    truth require that so gross a delusion should be dissipated; and this cannot be
                    better accomplished than by stating, as Μ. Klaproth has done, the real
                    difficulties of the problem which he undertook to resolve, and tracing a clear
                    line of demarcation between the province of rational inquiry, and the
                    fantastical domain of archaeological empiricism.<note anchored="true"

                    pendant des siècles.”</p></note></p>
                <p>In fact, the discoveries of Μ. Champoilion apply only to a limited number of the
                    hieroglyphical signs; that is, to proper names, and some other words incapable
                    of symbolization, which are expressed by means of an alphabet in some measure
                    resembling that of the Semitic languages, in which the consonants of words are
                    written sometimes with only part of the vowels, and frequently without any vowel
                    whatever. But in deciphering these names and epithets Μ. Champollion had an
                    excellent guide in the lists supplied by the tables contained in the Egyptian
                    Dynasties of Manetho and other ancient authors; he knew beforehand what he had
                    to seek for, and he was not a person to be long in finding the precise thing
                    which he wanted. But, notwithstanding this, he is by no means at one with
                    himself as to the extent of his discovery. In the introduction to his <hi
                    rend="italic">Precis,</hi> he affirms “that his hieroglyphic alphabet applies to
                    the royal hieroglyphic legends of <hi rend="italic">every epoch,</hi> that the
                    discovery of the phonetic alphabet is the true key to the whole hieroglyphic
                    system, and that <hi rend="italic">at all epochs</hi> the ancient Egyptians
                    employed it to represent alphabetically the sounds of their spoken language.”
                    (P. 11.) But at the commencement of the eighth chapter of the work, he
                    contradicts this dogma in the most explicit manner. “I admit,” says he, “that we
                    do not yet know <hi rend="italic">with any degree of certainty</hi> whether the
                    inscriptions and hieroglyphic texts, in which are found Egyptian words expressed
                    phonetically, belong to the tiroes of the Pharaohs <hi rend="italic">(remontent
                    aux temps des Pharaons),</hi> kings of the Egyptian race; or only to the Greek
                    period, as the inscription of Rosetta, the obelisk of Philae, and the temples of
                    Ombos and Edfou; or merely to the Roman period, as the obelisks of Albani,
                    Borgia, Pamphilius, Barberini, that of Benevento, part of the edifices of
                    Philae, and the temples of Esnch and Denderah.” With respect to the alleged
                    universality of the phonetic mode of writing “at <hi rend="italic">all</hi>
                    epochs,” it is therefore evident, first, that Μ. Champollion flatly contradicts
                    his own fundamental proposition; secondly, that this proposition being at
                    variance with all that the ancient authors, particularly Clemens Alexandrinus,
                    have stated respecting the dit’-ferent<pb break="no" facs="nls:193643749"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0711-3749-0358"/> kinds of Egyptian writing, it cannot be
                    established by their authority; and, thirdly, that Μ. Champollion has not only
                    not demonstrated its truth, but that, in the actual state of our knowledge, such
                    demonstration appears to be impossible.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>It may be proper to state here a fact, which seems to be
                    decisive of the question. The phonetic alphabet consists of about <hi
                    rend="italic">a hundred and thirty-four</hi> characters, more than the half of
                    which are purely conjectural. But supposing the whole to have been completely
                    ascertained, the absolute number of distinct hieroglyphics on the monuments is,
                    according to Champoilion’s computation, 864, whilst Zoega makes it 958; and if
                    from the former we deduct 134, there will remain 730 signs, the greater part of
                    which, it is certain, <hi rend="italic">are not employed phonetically,</hi> and
                    their real values as yet altogether unknown. With this fact before him, it is
                    not easy to conceive how Μ. Champollion could venture to affirm that his
                    phonetic alphabet applied to the royal hieroglyphical legends of <hi
                    rend="italic">all periods;</hi> that it was the <hi rend="italic">true key</hi>
                    to the <hi rend="italic">whole</hi> hieroglyphical system; and that the ancient
                    Egyptians employed it, <hi rend="italic">at all epochs,</hi> to represent
                    alphabetically the sounds of their spoken language.</p></note></p>
                <p>We could have wished to follow up these observations by stating concisely the
                    results of the searching analysis by means of which Μ. Klaproth has reduced to
                    their real dimensions the discoveries of Μ. Champollion. But after what has
                    already been said, we must content ourselves with stating generally, that
                    different and often incongruous values are arbitrarily assigned by him to the
                    same character, without any previous notice or explanation; that the image of an
                    <hi rend="italic">eye,</hi> for instance, which was originally set down as a
                    phonetic sign of s, has been successively employed to represent <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">a, e,</hi> and o; that, in numerous other instances, changes
                    still more arbitrary have been made; that we are left in equal ignorance of the
                    process by which the original values were pretended to have been ascertained,
                    and of the reasons which induced the author to abandon them; that he attributes
                    values to signs which are not contained in his alphabet, and of which no account
                    or explanation is given anywhere else; that he is frequently betrayed into
                    incongruities and inconsistencies which impeach his judgment, and would even
                    warrant a suspicion of bad faith; that in the interpretation of ideographical
                    characters or symbols, he adopted conjectures and fancies of his own, which,
                    however ingenious, are wholly unsupported by evidence, or even by probability;
                    that, for instance, the symbolical group which, as far as page 265 of his second
                    edition, is rendered “the goddess <hi rend="italic">Sate,”</hi> becomes suddenly
                    converted into <hi rend="italic">Tme,</hi> and this name continues to the end of
                    the work, though, in the plates, the goddess appears under the name of <hi
                    rend="italic">Smé</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> that changes of a similar
                    description occur in many other words, and almost invariably without any
                    previous intimation; and, lastly, that not a few of his pretended discoveries
                    are mere conjectures and imaginations, sometimes exceedingly ingenious, seldom
                    altogether extravagant, but, in as far as evidence is concerned, not more
                    rational nor better founded than the cabbalistical reveries of Kircher or the
                    fanciful vagaries of Palin. For the details and demonstrations of these
                    anomalies, however, we must refer to the <hi rend="italic">Examen</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Critique</hi> itself, one of the most masterly works of criticism
                    that has yet appeared on the subject of which it treats, and which is well
                    deserving of the most attentive perusal.</p>
                <p>It now only remains, under this head, to notice the French and Tuscan expeditions
                    to Egypt; the former undertaken at the urgent solicitation of M∙ Champollion,
                    who, as early as the month of April 1827, had digested the plan of such an
                    enterprise, and both having for their common object a re-examination of the
                    monuments, as well as a more extended application of that method of
                    interpretation which had originally been divined in this country, but which was
                    subsequently enlarged and improved in France. The discovery of the phonetic
                    alphabet, generally regarded on the Continent as the basis of the graphic system
                    of Egypt, promised to the historical sciences an ample harvest of new facts, the
                    more interesting and important, as these might perhaps fill up with some degree
                    of certainty the large blanks in the first pages of human annals. But, to answer
                    this expectation, it became indispensable that the new lights which had been
                    acquired on the subject of hieroglyphical writing should be applied to the
                    innumerable inscriptions engraved on all the monuments, public and private, of
                    Egypt and Nubia; and it was with this special object that the governments of
                    France and Tuscany appointed each a commission, the former directed by Μ.
                    Champollion, and the latter by Signor Rosellini, professor of history and
                    antiquities in the university of Pisa. With Μ. Champollion were associated A.
                    Bibent, architect, and Nestor l’Hôte, Salvador Cherubini, Alexander Duchesne,
                    Bertin the younger, and Lehoux, as draughtsmen; with Professor Rosellini,
                    Gaetano Rosellini, architect, Dr Ricci, Giuseppe Angelelli, and Raddi, professor
                    of natural history, with an assistant. Μ. Champollion set out from Paris on the
                    16th of July 1828, reached Toulon on the 24th, and set sail for Egypt on the
                    31st of that month, accompanied by the members of the Italian commission. During
                    the remainder of 1828, and the whole of 1829, the members of both commissions
                    were unremittingly occupied in exploring the antiquities scattered along the
                    valley of the Nile, from the Mediterranean as far as the second cataract, and in
                    accumulating those treasures which, now that Champollion is no more, Signor
                    Rosellini is giving to the world in his splendid work, entitled <hi

                    (1835) appeared, accompanied with engravings equally remarkable for their
                    accuracy and beauty.</p>
                <p>The indefatigable travellers, never once losing sight of the determinate object
                    of their enterprise, and exploring, one by one, the monuments still extant on
                    both banks of the river, or on the different points of the valley of the Nile,
                    transferred to their portfolios all kinds of positive documents furnished by
                    each ruin. Every bas-relief and every inscription, whether establishing an
                    historical fact, a point of religious belief, or a usage of ordinary life, was
                    designed or copied with the most scrupulous care; and in the work of Signor
                    Rosellini these bas-reliefs have been r&amp;produced by faithful designs, with
                    all the details and colours exhibited by the originals, as often as this
                    appeared necessary either to illustrate the subject, or to convey a just idea of
                    the compositions of art which adorn the monumental remains of ancient Egypt. The
                    result has been an accumulation of not less than fifteen hundred designs,
                    together with a particular description, drawn out on the spot, of every monument
                    in Egypt and in Nubia, containing the subject of each bas-relief, the detail of
                    the decorations, which are always significant, and copies of the accompanying
                    inscriptions, whenever the texts presented any subject of historical
                    interest.</p>
                <p>In a climate like that of Egypt, the fatigue incident to such an undertaking must
                    have been trying even to the most robust constitutions; and it is not to be
                    wondered therefore that some of the travellers should have sunk under it.<note

                    obliged, from bad health, to take leave of his associates amidst the ruins of
                    Memphis, and to return to France, where he soon afterwards died. Professor Raddi
                    died at Rhodes, when on his way back to Europe. The assistant of the latter had
                    sailed for Leghorn some months before, but sunk during the voyage under the
                    effects of the fatigue and labour to which he had been exposed. Lastly, Dr Ricci
                    had the left side of his body paralysed in consequence of the bite of a scorpion
                    at Thebes.</p></note> Μ. Champollion died soon after his return to <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193643762" xml:id="kp-eb0711-3762-0359"/> France, though
                    not until he had prepared a Hieroglyphic Grammar, which will doubtless contain
                    the ultimate conclusions established by himself and his learned associates; and
                    it is to Signor Rosellini that we must now look for the exposition and
                    illustration of all that was collected during the time that the commissions were
                    occupied in exploring, designing, and describing the monuments of Egypt and of
                    Nubia. Nor, judging from the portion which has already appeared, could the work
                    of digesting and arranging the materials thus accumulated have fallen into abler
                    or more competent hands. The designs are in every view worthy of the subject,
                    and will not suffer much by a comparison with those contained in the French
                    national work, in point of execution, whilst in all other respects they are
                    greatly superior. As to the literary part of his undertaking, it is composed in
                    a spirit of perfect candour and liberality, evincing not only the acquirements,
                    but also the accuracy, of an accomplished scholar, and uniting to great
                    erudition the utmost anxiety to render justice towards all his colleagues in
                    this branch of inquiry. With regard to Μ. Champollion’s <hi rend="italic"

                    these hasty productions never appeared. Signor Rosellini attributes the
                    publication and reprint of the <hi rend="italic">Lettres</hi> to a speculating
                    bookseller in Paris; and states, what is no doubt the truth, that Μ.
                    Champollion, if he had lived, would have altered and retracted much that is
                    contained in them. But it is nevertheless obvious that they were originally
                    intended foi-publication; they were evidently written for effect, to keep up the
                    excitement in favour of his project; in short, they were calculated for the
                    meridian of Paris.</p>
                <p>VIII. SYSTEM OF SPOHN AND SEYFARTH.</p>
                <p>The conflicting results at which both ancient and modern writers had arrived
                    respecting the contents of the Egyptian texts, as well as the kind and
                    description of characters in which these had been expressed, were well
                    calculated to stagger an ordinary reader, and to seduce him into complete
                    scepticism as to the possibility of the hieroglyphical inscriptions being ever
                    deciphered and interpreted. According to Horus Apollo, these mysterious writings
                    contained obscure indications of things sacred and profane; according to Clemens
                    and Plutarch, moral sentences; according to Hermapion, as quoted by Ammianus
                    Marcellinus, the praises of kings; according to Kircher, cabbalistic,
                    metaphysical, and theosophistical dogmas; according to Pluche, matter connected
                    with meteorology, astronomy, and the division of time; according to Denon, the
                    rules of husbandry; and, according to the author of the work <hi rend="italic"
                    >De l</hi> ’ <hi rend="italic">Etude</hi><hi rend="italic">des
                    Hiéroglyphes,</hi> a version of the psalms of David. Prior to the researches of
                    Dr Young, nothing deserving the name of investigation had been attempted, and
                    one bold or fanciful conjecture was merely displaced by another perhaps still
                    more extravagant. It was therefore high time that the subject should be either
                    abandoned as hopeless, or that conjecture and hypothesis should give place to
                    rational inquiry conducted on ascertained or demonstrable principles. Dr Young
                    felt this, and, starting from a point entirely new, succeeded, by means of
                    collocation, comparison, and tentative or experimental investigation, in fixing
                    the values of certain characters and groups, and, generally, in tracing out the
                    line or direction which inquiry ought to pursue. Μ. Champollion followed close
                    in his footsteps, and, enlightened even by the errors of his predecessor,
                    unfolded a method of interpretation, the soundness of which, at least within
                    certain limits, has been established by the truth of the results it has
                    evolved.</p>
                <p>But not long after these interesting discoveries had been made known to the
                    world, a system was imagined in Germany which, as far as we are able to
                    comprehend it, seems to proceed on assumptions at once ingeniously original and
                    demonstrably unsound. This system was first obscurely revealed in the work of
                    Spohn <hi rend="italic">De Lingua</hi><hi rend="italic">et Litteratura
                    Veteris</hi><hi rend="italic">Aegypti,</hi> and afterwards more fully expounded
                    in the splendid work of Professor Seyfarth, entitled <hi rend="italic"
                    >Rudimenta</hi><hi rend="italic">Hieroglypliices,</hi><note anchored="true"

                    countrymen. Spohn died young, without completing his investigations or maturing
                    his system; but Seyfarth undertook to do both, and, if we may credit a writer in
                    the Leipsic Journal, he has succeeded so well that, besides establishing the
                    truth of his own method of interpretation, he has demonstrated the utter fallacy
                    of the <hi rend="italic">pretended</hi> discoveries of Dr Young and Μ.
                    Champollion. The investigations begun in England, and so successfully prosecuted
                    in France, were by no means calculated to find favour with the Germans, who seem
                    to have a natural distaste for what may be acquired without labour or understood
                    without effort; and hence the very simplicity of the principles upon which these
                    inquiries were conducted, served to confirm their habitual prejudices, and to
                    fortify their understandings against the conviction naturally arising from the
                    results actually obtained. Dr Young’s researches had no flavour of mystery about
                    them; and those of M. Champollion were communicated in language singularly
                    remarkable for the most transparent perspicuity. The lovers of the profound,
                    therefore, saw to the bottom at once, and because they did so, they concluded
                    that the waters were shallow. The question at issue, however, is not so much one
                    of erudition as of evidénce, of which the German scholars and orientalists are
                    not the only competent judges; and we think we shall be able to show that if
                    Young, Champollion, and others who have followed in their footsteps, have done
                    but little, Spohn, Seyfarth, and their disciples, have literally done nothing at
                    all.</p>
                <p>Μ. Seyfarth modestly professes himself to be a mere expounder of the doctrines of
                    Spohn, and candidly admits his obligations to the work of that distinguished
                    scholar, not only for the theory proposed, but for the greater part of the
                    materials by which it is illustrated. “Quod sibi videtur hic libellus rationem
                    tradere, qua hieroglyphica scripta legenda sint; id cujus nomine adscribi

                    and even if Spohn had interpreted, hi his own way, entire demotic inscriptions,
                    his system is so groundless and untenable, not. to say visionary, that a
                    question of <hi rend="italic">priority</hi> could not possibly be raised between
                    him and Dr Young. The tentative method of interpretation so successfully
                    exemplified by the latter has nothing in common with the imaginative
                    transcendentalism of Spohn, and the methodical absurdity of Seyfarth.</p></note>

                <p>The first of these propositions, which is professedly founded on a statement of
                    Manetho, quoted by Syncellus, is thus explained by Professor Seyfarth: “E verbo

                    insigniverunt, satis clarum est, hanc neque convenisse cum vulgari, neque

                    definition, the language of Chaucer should be denominated the “sacred dialect”
                    of English, in contradistinction to the “profane” dialect by which it has, in
                    the progress of improvement, been displaced; and a similar title of honour
                    should be conferred on the antiquated phraseology of our venerable countryman
                    Gawin Douglas. But how, we would ask, are we to detect the existence of this
                    “sacred dialect,” or elder form of the Egyptian? All that remains of the ancient
                    language of Egypt is preserved in the Coptic, of which there are still extant
                    two dialects, the Memphitic and Sahidic, with a few words belonging to a third,
                    called the Bashmouric. But of these three dialects the <hi rend="italic">most
                    ancient</hi> is undoubtedly the Bashmouric, of which scarcely a vestige can now
                    be discovered; and hence the “hieroglyphical language” or “sacred dialect” of
                    Spohn and of Seyfarth is a perfect nonentity. Not to dwell upon this, however,
                    we may observe, that there is no such thing known as a “hieroglyphical <hi
                    rend="italic">language?</hi> the term “hieroglyphical” being applied only to a
                    particular <hi rend="italic">method</hi> of writing, and never to the <hi
                    rend="italic">thing written.</hi> The proposition of Seyfarth, therefore,
                    involves an assumption which is contrary to the fact, and at the same time
                    amounts nearly to a contradiction in terms. Secondly, since hieroglyphical
                    inscriptions continued to be executed as late as the reign of Antoninus,<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>A learned countryman of
                    Professor Seyfarth’s, Dr Sickler, wrote a book to prove that the language
                    concealed under the hieroglyphics is Hebrew, or, at least, a form of speech
                    composed of the different Semitic dialects.</p></note> if the “sacred dialect”
                    or elder form of Egyptian was alone employed in these texts, it follows that an
                    antiquated dialect still remained in use, and co-existed with the more modern
                    form by which it had been displaced. Thirdly, if one dialect was employed in
                    hieroglyphical writing, it is at least equally probable that another was used in
                    the hieratic, and a third in the enchorial. Lastly, Spohn and Seyfarth have
                    equally misunderstood the statement of Manetho, quoted by Syncellus, in which
                    the “sacred dialect,” whatever it may have been, is expressly distinguished from
                    the “hieroglyphical characters” which had been written in the time of Thoth, the
                    first Hermes, “and which were taught after the transition from the <hi
                    rend="italic">sacred dialect</hi> to the Greek language.” So much, then, for the
                    first proposition, in support of which no proof of any kind is produced by
                    Professor Seyfarth.</p>
                <p>But the main pillar of the theory is the second proposition, namely, that the
                    hieroglyphical characters are <hi rend="italic">not</hi> letters, but <hi
                    rend="italic">symbols</hi> of letters. Remove this, and the whole fabric must at
                    once fall to pieces. A letter is a character or symbol, representing either an
                    elementary sound, or the simplest combination of elementary sounds. But what are
                    we to understand by the symbol of a symbol of a sound? The symbol of a sound
                    either represents a particular sound, or it represents nothing at all. If then a
                    hieroglyphic be <hi rend="italic">not</hi> a letter, but only the <hi
                    rend="italic">symbol</hi> of a letter, it follows that it is the representative
                    of a representative, yet is neither that which it represents, nor the sign or
                    symbol of the thing represented, namely, sound; in other words, it is merely the
                    shadow of a shade. This fundamental principle or proposition, therefore, when
                    taken by itself, would seem to be rather a <hi rend="subscript"> t</hi> ∕eu <hi
                    rend="italic">de mots</hi> than a statement of an elementary truth. But
                    Professor Seyfarth labours to make himself intelligible; and, having narrowly
                    examined his exposition, we shall endeavour, as distinctly as possible, to state
                    the substance of his doctrine, or rather that of his master Spohn.</p>
                <p>He admits that in every country, not excepting Egypt, the first attempts at
                    writing consisted in rude delineations of material or physical objects; that,
                    from the difficulty and inconvenience of this practice, men were soon led to
                    abridge those delineations by putting, <hi rend="italic">per</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">synecdochen,</hi> a part for the whole, and by other devices; that
                    as this pictural tachygraphy was incapable of representing changes of relation
                    and qualities, as well as the sentiments and passions of animated beings, it
                    soon came to be enriched with <hi rend="italic">symbols</hi> strictly so called,
                    that is, with arbitrary marks or characters employed to represent those ideas
                    which had no sensible archetypes in nature; that, in the progress of time, all
                    traces of connexion between the sign and the thing signified would be lost, and
                    the characters, being applied to the spoken language, would become the
                    representatives of words, or portions of words, as in the Chinese; and, lastly,
                    that from accident, or the fortunate contrivance of a superior mind, some of
                    these known characters would at length be appropriated to represent the
                    elementary sounds of the spoken language, or, in other words, an alphabet would
                    be invented and introduced. But, whilst he does not, and indeed cannot, dispute
                    this gradual progression of the human mind from picture-writing to an alphabet,
                    the first and greatest of all inventions, the finest result of the finest
                    analysis, Professor Seyfarth at the same time contends that the Egyptians had
                    passed all these different stages <hi rend="italic">before</hi> they began to
                    fabricate hieroglyphical characters; that, amongst them, alphabetical signs,
                    instead of being the eventual offspring of picture-writing, through the
                    intervention of kuriological and tropical writing, were in reality the parent of
                    both these forms, primary as well as secondary; and that, in Egypt, <hi
                    rend="italic">after</hi> attaining the simplest and last refinement in the art
                    of writing, they retrograded to the imperfect, obscure, and cumbrous methods
                    which in every other country disappeared as soon as an alphabet had been
                    invented.</p>
                <p>According to Spohn and Seyfarth, the Egyptians as well as the Greeks received
                    letters from Phoenicia.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    made an extraordinary use of this invaluable acquisition. Instead of attempting
                    to improve the invention, or to apply it directly to the purposes of writing,
                    which it was so eminently calculated to facilitate, they did exactly the
                    reverse, and immediately commenced embellishing, varying, and multiplying these
                    elementary characters, as fancy or caprice happened to dictate. “Licuit cuivis
                    calamo, cuivis cestro, variare hieroglyphica.” Such is the broad and unqualified
                    statement of Μ. Seyfarth; but how these arbitrary variations were to be rendered
                    intelligible to any but the scribe, painter, or sculptor by whom they were
                    executed, or even to <hi rend="italic">him</hi> after the lapse of a
                    considerable interval of time, the learned professor has not condescended to
                    explain. It would seem, indeed, that nothing short of inspiration itself could
                    enable any one to read and understand writing formed and executed in the manner
                    here described. Yet the three kinds of Egyptian writing, now perfectly
                    distinguished, were, it seems, the fortuitous results of this most extraordinary
                    procedure, first imagined by Spohn, and afterwards zealously contended for by
                    Seyfarth.</p>

                    the appendix to Μ. Seyfarth’s work, there is a very learned criticism, by

                    speaking of the perplexing 5τ^a&gt;τα <hi rend="italic">στaιχ</hi><hi

                    accordingly, they lay it down as a principle that the demotic is the basis upon
                    which the whole superstructure has been reared, the original stem which the
                    fancy or caprice of writers in time covered and adorned with a variety of
                    branches. In plain terms, their notion is, that the hieratic has been generated
                    by variations on the epistolographic or demotic, and the hieroglyphic by similar
                    or analogous variations on the hieratic; and they contend that all these
                    variations are <hi rend="italic">not</hi> letters, but only <hi rend="italic"
                    >symbols</hi> of letters <hi rend="italic">(ΰυμβοΚα</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >γ%αμμaτων).</hi> Taking Μ. Seyfarth’s assumption, therefore, that the original
                    alphabetic characters were twenty-five in number, and supposing also with him,
                    that each of these underwent thirty variations, in order to constitute the total
                    amount of demotic characters, that the demotic underwent an equal number to form
                    the hieratic, and the hieratic again an equal number to produce the
                    hieroglyphic; we shall have 25 × 30 × 30 × 30 = 675,000 “symbols of letters,” or
                    27,000 variations of every one of the twenty-five original alphabetic
                    characters. This is Μ. Seyfarth’s own calculation; and it is inconceivable how
                    it should have failed to convince him of the utter extravagance and absurdity of
                    his whole system. No critic, however ingenious or malicious, could have more
                    effectually exposed it to ridicule than he has himself done. The total number of
                    the Chinese characters, which are combinations of little more than two hundred
                    elementary “keys,” does not much exceed the number of variations (27,000) here
                    supposed to have been made upon one original alphabetical character; yet, of all
                    the languages, living or dead, that of China is the most difficult of
                    acquisition, and to master it fully, so as to be able to write it with tolerable
                    facility, is even to a native the work of half a life-time. But what shall be
                    said of a language the graphic system of which must, upon this hypothesis, have
                    embraced nearly 700,000 distinct characters, called “symbols of letters ?”</p>
                <p>There are data, however, from which a more direct and conclusive refutation may
                    be deduced. Bruce, Zoega, and Champollion have each given approximate
                    computations of the absolute number of hieroglyphics. From a somewhat
                    superficial survey of the temples and other edifices of Egypt, Bruce reckons
                    only 514; from a careful examination of the obelisks at Rome, and the monuments
                    preserved in the museums of Italy, Zoega makes out 958; and, from a painful
                    analysis of all the inscriptions which have been copied into the French national
                    work <hi rend="italic">Description de l’</hi><hi rend="italic">Egypte,</hi> and
                    other publications, Μ. Champollion reduces them to 864. By taking a mean of the
                    two last computations, 911, we shall probably make a pretty close approximation
                    to the truth. If this, then, be added to the known heratic and demotic
                    characters, it will be found that the total number of characters, in the three
                    different kinds of Egyptian writing, does not exceed, if in truth it amounts to,
                    1200. Suppose it, however, 2000, or, if you will, 20,000, and still Μ.
                    Seyfarth’s case will not be improved; for, even on the last supposition, which
                    is at least <hi rend="italic">ten times</hi> more than the truth, the learned
                    professor will have to account for 655,000 “symbols <hi rend="italic">of</hi>
                    letters,” of which no trace can be discovered on the monuments.</p>
                <p>Having thus unfolded the general principles of the theory of Spohn, Μ. Seyfarth
                    next proceeds to classify the hieroglyphics. And these he divides into <hi
                    rend="italic">emphonic, symphonic,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">aphonic.</hi> The
                    <hi rend="italic">emphonic</hi> are those which “suo ambitu integram litteram
                    hieraticam pluresve describunt,” and which “sistuntur pro situ litterarum in iis
                    latentium, et ratione rerum quas significant.” They are susceptible of
                    transposition, variation, and abridgment, and may be affected by defective or
                    superfluous writing, permutation of vowels or consonants, and by conjunction.
                    The <hi rend="italic">symphonic</hi> are those “quae nonnisi cum aliis, sive
                    singulis sive pluribus, elementa verborum vel litteras exprimunt ;” that is, a
                    sort of enclitic “symbols,” significative only in combination with emphonics.
                    They are of hieratic origin, but occur more frequently in the hieroglyphic than
                    in the hieratic characters; and they are affected by permutation, position,
                    order, conjunction, omission, and sejunction. The <hi rend="italic"

                    metaphorically, not letters, but ideas, and are accordingly not phonetic, but
                    ideographic symbols. They are divided into <hi rend="italic">mimetic,</hi>
                    “ipsae rerum imagines ;” <hi rend="italic">tropic,</hi> “quae imagine aliena

                    quam quae proxime significentur, innuunt.” And this is all the information which
                    the learned professor has vouchsafed to afford us respecting the system which is
                    said to have enabled Spohn to decipher entire demotic inscriptions, and to
                    achieve other wonders in <pb break="no" facs="nls:193643801"

                    way, or by what process of investigation, the trim classification here proposed
                    was discovered; no examples are produced in illustration of any of these
                    classes, or to enable us to distinguish an emphonic from a symphonic, and both
                    from an aphonic hieroglyphic. Every thing is left in the uncertainty and
                    obscurity of vague generality; and after being informed that the hieroglyphical
                    characters arc the “symbols of letters,” and nothing more, we learn, to our
                    astonishment, that there is nevertheless a class of these characters (the <hi
                    rend="italic">aphonic)</hi> which consists, <hi rend="italic">not</hi> of
                    “symbols of <hi rend="italic">letters,</hi><hi rend="italic">”</hi> but of
                    symbols of <hi rend="italic">ideas.</hi> In short, there is neither sense nor
                    coherence in the system itself, or in any explanation which can be given of it,
                    even by so learned an expositor as Professor Seyfarth.</p>
                <p>The plates, or rather hicroglyphical tables, which accompany Professor Seyfarth’s
                    work, though very beautiful specimens of lithography, are constructed on a
                    principle which it is not easy to understand; unless, indeed, it was his object
                    to involve the subject in impenetrable mystery. But upon this supposition they
                    are undoubtedly masterpieces of skill and ingenuity. The order of the
                    hieroglyphics on the monuments is totally disregarded; an arbitrary collocation
                    is introduced; imaginary or fantastical values are assigned to detached
                    characters; and no attempt whatever is made to bring this pretended system to
                    the test of experiment, by applying it directly to the interpretation of
                    Egyptian texts, whether enchorial, hieratic, or hieroglyphic. It is no doubt
                    true that Μ. Seyfarth has ventured to give some scraps of translation, which are
                    set forth with all the learned parade of the Chaldaic letters. But, in the first
                    place, we are left completely in the dark as to the method of interpretation
                    pursued by him; and, secondly, the versions actually given arc either absolute
                    nonsense, or, where they disclose a glimpse of meaning, are evidently
                    mystifications of Μ. Champollion∙ A single example will be sufficient to
                    establish the truth of what is here stated. Μ. Champollion renders a certain
                    hieroglyphical legend thus: “Soutien de l’Egypte, dieu fils d’un dieu, soutien
                    de l’Egypte, Horus, manifesté ou engendré par ou d’Osiris, engendré d’Isis
                    déesse.” But, according to Seyfarth, the meaning of the legend is, “Venias age,
                    Isis, venias age, Aegyptiorum generator in Aegyptum <hi rend="italic">deus</hi>
                    or “Venias age, Isis venias age, Aegypti generator in Aegyptum generator which
                    is merely a mystification of Μ. Champollion’s version, with an absurdity
                    peculiar to itself, in the first form, namely, that of calling Isis, the
                    sister-spouse of Osiris, a <hi rend="italic">god.</hi> It would be easy to
                    multiply examples, of the same description, and, moreover, to show that, where
                    the learned professor has not the aid of a prior version to guide him, the
                    obscurity thickens into impenetrable night, unilluminated even by a solitary
                    flicker of sense or intelligence sufficient to make the darkness visible.</p>
                <p>Professor Seyfarth, unmindful of his obligations to the system which it is his
                    object to overthrow, contends that the interpretations of Μ. Champollion cannot
                    be genuine, because, in the hieroglyphical spelling of proper names, sometimes
                    one vowel is omitted, and sometimes another. But he forgets that such is the
                    practice in almost all the oriental languages; that systematic accuracy was
                    scarcely to be expected in writing foreign names and words; that it is often
                    exceedingly difficult to transfuse the sounds of one language into another; that
                    the workmen employed in sculpturing the hieroglyphics were most’probably
                    ignorant of the language to which the proper names in question belonged; and
                    that their natural impulse must have been to shorten or abridge their labour as
                    much as they possibly could. The learned professor also forgets that, according
                    to his own system of arbitrary variations, no two persons would write the same
                    word in the same way, or in precisely the same sort of characters; and that,
                    whilst such differences or discrepancies as those he has referred to exist in
                    all languages, without in the least degree affecting the certainty of the mode
                    of writing, or materially obscuring the names thus variously spelled, the number
                    must, on his system, have been almost infinite; and hence, if there be any force
                    in the objection he has raised, it must bear principally against his own
                    hypothesis. In every view, then, we consider the doctrine of Spohn and Seyfarth
                    as wholly untenable. It rests on assumptions which are either false in principle
                    or erroneous in fact; it requires, in its exposition, the admission of elements
                    totally inconsistent with these assumptions; and it leads to results, or, at
                    least, results are deduced from it, which have either no meaning at all, or one
                    which is absurd and extravagant.</p>
                <p>IX. ΔCROLOGICAL HIEROGLYPHICS.</p>
                <p>The discovery of what M. Klaproth has termed <hi rend="italic">aerological
                    hieroglyphics</hi> belongs to the Chevalier Goulianoff. Having adopted the idea
                    that τα wgωra ffro∕χs∕a, in the passage of Clemens, so often referred to, means
                    <hi rend="italic">the initial elements</hi> of the names of objects, the
                    chevalier imagined a system of writing according to which the same sign may
                    equally well represent all objects the names of which commence with the same
                    letter, as <hi rend="italic">cat, cabin, capstan, coast, caravel, castanet',
                    duke, dunce, ditch, day, doom, devil.</hi> The first intimation of this
                    discovery given to the world was contained in a letter which Μ. Klaproth
                    addressed to Μ. de Goulianoff; but the ironical tone which pervades this
                    composition was calculated to excite a suspicion that the object of the learned
                    author was rather to banter his correspondent, than to evince a frank and
                    sincere adhesion to a burlesque system, based solely on the hieroglyphical
                    explanations given by Horus Apollo, and without the slightest support from the
                    monuments, on which nothing had as yet been discovered that bore the slightest
                    resemblance to an <hi rend="italic">aerology.</hi><note anchored="true"

                    This letter, however, was not long afterwards followed by another addressed to a
                    different person, in which Μ. Klaproth employed all the resources of his
                    ingenuity and learning to give a colouring of plausibility to a system
                    essentially ridiculous, and, at the same time, to expose the ignorance of Coptic
                    displayed by Μ. Champollion, as well as the unwarrantable liberties which the
                    latter had taken with that language, in coining words when he could not find
                    any, and perverting known terms to answer his immediate purposes. Nor can it be
                    denied that, if he signally failed in convicting the ancient Egyptians of having
                    employed so absurd a system of writing as that imagined by Μ. de Goulianoff, he
                    nevertheless succeeded in establishing, by irresistible proofs, the ignorance,
                    and, what is much worse, the bad faith, of M. Champollion, in as far as regards
                    the Coptic language. It would be a waste of time <pb break="no"

                    of the aerological hypothesis, the original conception of which appears to have
                    been suggested by an ingenious mistranslation of the words of Clemens, whilst
                    the development of the conceit thus imagined rendered it necessary to adopt,
                    without challenge, all the puerilities of Horus Apollo. A system of writing
                    according to which a <hi rend="italic">god</hi> may be designated by a <hi

                    >walnut,</hi> is surely a fitter subject for ridicule than for reasoning.</p>
                <p>X. ELEMENTARY PRINCIPLES OF HIEROGLYPHICS.</p>
                <p>The ancient Egyptians employed three distinct kinds of writing; I. the
                    Hieroglyphic or sacred; II. the Hieratic or sacerdotal; and, III. the Demotic or
                    popular, called also the Epistolographic, and Enchorial or common running hand
                    of the country.</p>
                <p>I. The Hieroglyphic or sacred writing is of three Sorts; 1. Phonetic, in which
                    the hieroglyphic stands for a letter, as the feather for A or <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">e</hi>; 2. Emblematic or symbolic, when the object is
                    represented by an emblem or symbol, as a hawk’s head surmounted by a disc for
                    the sun; 3. Figurative or pictural, when it is a representation of the object
                    itself, as the image of a man or a horse to indicate <hi rend="italic">man</hi>
                    or <hi rend="italic">horse.</hi></p>
                <p>In the first of these modes, words are formed of a number of phonetic
                    hieroglyphics, in the same manner as in any other alphabetical mode of writing:
                    thus <hi rend="smallcaps">mai,</hi><hi rend="italic">beloved,</hi> is expressed
                    by three characters respectively representing <hi rend="smallcaps">μ,</hi><hi
                    rend="smallcaps">a, i</hi>; and <hi rend="smallcaps">ioh,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >the moon,</hi> by an equal number representing ι, o, H. In words which arc
                    written phonetically, the medial vowels are very often suppressed, as in the
                    Hebrew, Phoenician, Arabic, and other oriental languages; sometimes, indeed, the
                    vowels are altogether omitted. Each sound or articulation may be represented by
                    several homophonous signs; but the employment of one in preference to another
                    seems to have been regulated by considerations derived from* <hi
                    rend="superscript"> r</hi> the material form of the sign, and the nature of the
                    idea to be expressed by the phonetic characters.</p>
                <p>The emblematic and figurative kinds arc too simple to require any remarks. In the
                    former, ideas arc expressed by symbols, as when a part is put for the whole, or
                    one thing is metaphorically employed to represent another. The latter is merely
                    picture-writing. In the Egyptian sentence, “We give you the assemblies of Ra,
                    the God,” all the three kinds of hieroglyphic writing are simultaneously
                    employed; “We give you” being expressed phonetically, “the assemblies”
                    figuratively, “of” phonetically, “Ra” emblematically, and “the God”
                    figuratively.</p>
                <p>When two words resembled each other, the same character often stood for either of
                    them; as <hi rend="smallcaps">neb,</hi><hi rend="italic">lord,</hi> and <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">niben,</hi><hi rend="italic">all,</hi> each of which is
                    represented by a segment of a sphere, or, as some think, a species of hatchet.
                    The force or value of a phonetic sign is, according to Champollion, derived from
                    the initial sound of the Egyptian name of the object which it represents. Thus
                    the figure of an owl, <hi rend="smallcaps">mouladj,</hi> represents <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">μ,</hi> that of a goat or ram, <hi rend="smallcaps">baampe,
                    b,</hi> and that of a star, srou, s. This might seem calculated to occasion
                    great confusion, from the miscellaneous use of different signs; but,
                    practically, the Egyptians confined themselves to particular characters in
                    writing particular words; for example, <hi rend="italic">Amun,</hi> which is
                    invariably expressed by the same phonetic signs. Some few variations are,
                    however, to be met with in writing the same word, as in <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >mai,</hi><hi rend="italic">beloved,</hi> and <hi rend="smallcaps">n,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">of,</hi> in which the characters are occasionally changed; but
                    these variations are limited in number, and used with great discretion. Be
                    sides, many signs, as, for instance, a camel, are always excluded from the
                    phonetic alphabet.</p>
                <p>The next material point is the expletive sign. This is put after words to denote
                    their grammatical force or effect. Thus an arm, with the forefinger of the hand
                    pointing upwards, denotes an active sense, as “cuts,” and a straight line, with
                    a small leaf or flourish on one side, shows that the word preceding it is a
                    noun, as in the expression “great honour,” where the expletive is inserted after
                    the adjective as well as after the substantive. But in those groups which are of
                    most frequent occurrence, or the sense of which is unequivocal, these signs are
                    often omitted.</p>
                <p>The plural number is indicated by three lines,! ĩ I, following the object, or by
                    that object being thrice repeated; the dual number, when employed, is
                    represented by two lines, but this is of rare occurrence.</p>
                <p>The names of kings are contained in two scrolls or elliptical rings, the first of
                    which includes the praenomen, composed of titles derived chiefly from the names
                    of the gods, and the second the nomen or phonetic name of the king; as <hi
                    rend="italic">Amasis,</hi><hi rend="italic">Ptolemy.</hi> The former is
                    generally preceded by the title “king of men, lord of the worlds, good god” <hi
                    rend="italic">(divus</hi><hi rend="italic">bonus)</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi>
                    the latter by “son of Ra, lord of the strong.” The queens have only a phonetic
                    scroll or ring, preceded by the title “royal wife, the potent queen of the
                    world.”</p>
                <p>The names of individuals are followed by the figure of a man, and are not
                    enclosed in an oval or scroll; as “Germanicus, man.”</p>
                <p>The hieroglyphics are always to be read <hi rend="italic">towards</hi> the faces
                    of the figures. Thus, if the front be to the left, they must be read from left
                    to right; if to the right, from right to left; and if arranged in perpendicular
                    lines, from the top downwards. Historical tablets commence with the year of a
                    king’s reign, and the month of that year; but no trace of any era, such as the
                    Christian or Mohammedan, has been discovered in these sculptures.<note

                    adoration or prayer.</p>
                <p>In historical subjects the names of kings are preceded and followed by a
                    profusion of titles relating to “power,” “victory,” and other attributes or
                    distinctions, or by such expressions as “like the sun, like Atmoo, lord of the
                    assemblies, like his father Phtha, like Horus, and so forth.</p>
                <p>Pronouns combine with the groups which they qualify; as <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >sonph,</hi> Coptic <hi rend="smallcaps">pepiison,</hi><hi rend="italic">his
                    brother,</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">sonk,</hi> Coptic <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >person,</hi><hi rend="italic">your brother.</hi></p>
                <p>In the names of districts and towns, the sign of “land” is placed after them:
                    thus, “Philae or Ailak, land of ;” “Ap or Tape (Thebes), land of.” The sign
                    which signifies “foreign land,” may also apply to “country” in general, in
                    opposition to the particular sign indicating “land.” Town or abode is indicated
                    by the hieroglyphic equivalents of <hi rend="smallcaps">ei,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">house,</hi> as Ei-Aenzm, the “abode of Amun,” or <hi rend="italic"
                    >Diospolis.</hi></p>
                <p>II. The Hieratic or sacerdotal writing is immediately derived from the
                    hieroglyphic, of which it is merely a tachygraphy or abbreviated form. The signs
                    are accordingly considerably abridged; but they nevertheless comprehend
                    figurative, emblematic, and phonetic characters, though instead of the two
                    former are often substituted groups of characters, which are either phonetic or
                    altogether<pb break="no" facs="nls:193643827" xml:id="kp-eb0711-3827-0364"/>
                    arbitrary, "qui ne conservent plus la forme de leur signe correspondant dans le
                    système hiéroglyphique.”</p>
                <p>All the hieratic manuscripts extant, whether they are of the Pharaonic, the
                    Macedonian, or the Roman epochs, belong to one system, that is, exhibit merely
                    an abbreviated form of the hieroglyphic writing, however widely some of the
                    characters may at first view appear to differ from it. This method seems to have
                    been confined to the transcription of texts connected with matters of religion
                    or science, or to inscriptions of a character purely religious.</p>
                <p>III. The Demotic, Epistolographic, or Enchorial, is a method of writing distinct
                    from the hieroglyphic, and also from the hieratic, of which it is an immediate
                    derivative. The signs employed in the demotic or enchorial texts are, in fact,
                    only simple characters, borrowed from the hieratic. The demotic nearly excludes
                    all figurative characters, picture-writing being incompatible with the object
                    aimed at in a current hand; but it admits emblematic or symbolical signs,
                    though, according to Champollion, “sculement pour exprimer des idées
                    essentiellement lieés au système religieux.”</p>
                <p>The characters employed in the demotic or enchorial are much less numerous than
                    those of the other methods; and Champollion affirms that a large proportion of
                    them are phonetic. But this is evidently a mistake; for Mr Akerblad, who
                    proceeded upon the assumption that the greater part of the enchorial characters
                    were letters, or signs of sounds, failed to interpreta single word of the
                    demotic text of the Rosetta inscription; whilst Dr Young, who conceived that
                    proper names alone were written alphabetically, succeeded in interpreting the
                    words or groups, and eventually deciphered all that remains of this branch of
                    the triple inscription. During a long series of ages, the demotic, the hieratic,
                    and the hieroglyphic methods of writing were simultaneously in use throughout
                    the whole extent of Egypt.</p>
                <p>In stating the elementary principles of the demotic writing, we shall begin with
                    the verb. It appears to possess only a single form. When the root is prefixed to
                    a noun or to a personal pronoun, without any qualification preceding, it may be
                    translated by an indefinite past tense; and sometimes, when the sense requires
                    it, even by the present, as happens in several of the Semitic languages. When
                    the conjunction signifying <hi rend="italic">that</hi> is prefixed to the
                    radical form, the latter is thereby converted into a kind of optative or
                    subjunctive, as “he took care <hi rend="italic">that they should do it;'</hi>
                    and the particle appears to convert the same primary form into a preterperfect.
                    Of the pronouns annexed to the root, only four, <hi rend="italic">I, he,
                    we,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">they,</hi> have as yet been met with; but there
                    are probably three others, which still remain to be discovered, <hi
                    rend="italic">thou, she,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">ye.</hi> The auxiliary verb
                    denoting <hi rend="italic">ought</hi> is used to express the imperative and
                    future. It precedes the nominative, whether it be noun or pronoun, and then
                    follows the root, as in the example <hi rend="italic">(Rosetta Inscript.</hi><hi
                    rend="italic superscript"> y</hi><hi rend="italic">)</hi> signifying <hi
                    rend="italic">debent sacerdotes colere,</hi> the priests ought to attend to. The
                    passive voice is commonly expressed periphrastically by means of the plural
                    pronoun of the third person. Thus, for “the priests ought to be called,” we
                    have, “they ought to call the priests ;” and for “that the customary things
                    should be done,” we find, “that they should do the customary things.”</p>
                <p>The only exception to the general rule, that the verb precedes its nominative,
                    occurs when the nominative is a relative pronoun. The pronoun whence comes the
                    Coptic <hi rend="smallcaps">été,</hi> prefixed to the verbal root, forms a kind
                    of past participle, as in the example “who established,” in Greek <hi
                    rend="italic">xaraατrfiaμεwv</hi>; but the particle used pronominally seems
                    always to express the present participle, as in the example “who enter,” in
                    Greek <hi rend="italic">iusnοκυομεvw.</hi> If no verb follow this particle, it
                    signifies “who is” or “who are.” The initial vowel of this word is seldom
                    expressed; indeed the omission of vowels may be regarded as a general practice
                    in the enchorial writing.</p>
                <p>A masculine noun is made feminine by the addition of the termination τ; and this
                    termination, or an equivalent one, added to adjectives, converts them into
                    abstract nouns. The plural of nouns is usually formed by adding an upright
                    stroke A or <hi rend="smallcaps">e,</hi> as may be seen in the plural of <hi
                    rend="italic">“</hi><hi rend="italic">priests</hi><hi rend="italic">;'</hi> but,
                    in the enchorial, as in the hieroglyphical writing, plurality is more commonly
                    indicated by subjoining to the noun three upright strokes. Masculine nouns
                    singular take one article; feminine nouns, singular and plural, take another,
                    which is also used generally before the possessive pronoun when it precedes the
                    noun. The possessive pronouns experience no change on account of gender or
                    number, and are sometimes represented by affixes, as in the hieroglyphical
                    method of writing.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">All</hi> or <hi rend="italic">every</hi> is expressed after the
                    noun, as “the temples of Egypt, <hi rend="italic">all</hi> of them.” <hi
                    rend="italic">Each</hi> is expressed by the adjective following the noun written
                    twice, as in the example, “the priests who are of the temple, temple each,” that
                    is, “the priests who are of each temple.” Cardinal numbers follow the noun in
                    the singular, with the singular article prefixed, if there be occasion to use
                    one. This is contrary to the usage of almost every other language; but it is
                    well established that such is the enchorial practice. Ordinal numbers are the
                    same as the cardinal; but, for distinction, a τ is sometimes placed after such
                    numbers.</p>
                <p>In the enchorial method of expressing the common fractions after figures, and in
                    sentences, we discover a striking resemblance to that which we now employ, the
                    fraction being represented by an oblique line, with the denominator placed
                    underneath. The word denoting “one half,” is easily read <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >phakat,</hi> a word which, with a slight modification, is used at this day in
                    both parts of Nubia to signify the same thing.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>We learn from Burckhardt that the Kensy word
                    for “one half” is <hi rend="italic">bαgatto,</hi> and that the Nouba word is <hi
                    rend="italic">Fagal-wera.</hi> literally, “half one,” <hi rend="italic"
                    >Fagat</hi> meaning half, and <hi rend="italic">wera</hi> one.</p></note> The
                    words denoting one third, one fourth, and so on, are used with or without the
                    accompanying word signifying <hi rend="italic">part,</hi> just as in English we
                    say indifferently <hi rend="italic">a fourth</hi> or <hi rend="italic">a fourth
                    part.</hi></p>
                <p>For the numerals, hieroglyphic, hieratic, and enchorial, the reader is
                    particularly referred to Professor Kosegarten’s first Commentation <hi
                    rend="italic">De</hi><hi rend="italic">Prisea</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Aegyptiorum</hi><hi rend="italic">Litteratura,</hi> also to Young’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Rudiments of an Egyptian Dictionary,</hi> and to Wilkinson’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Materia Hieroglyphica.</hi> That the forms of the Arabic numerals
                    have been borrowed from the Egyptian, the slightest inspection will show; but
                    the latter have no value in position, a circumstance which forms the
                    distinguishing characteristic, as well as the great superiority, of the Arabic
                    method of notation.</p>
                <p>Plate CCLXXXV. contains the hieroglyphicophonetic alphabet, according to
                    Wilkinson’s arrangement, which we consider as decidedly the best. The characters
                    are divided into <hi rend="italic">certain, probable,</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >doubtful.</hi> The <hi rend="italic">certain</hi> are those for which there is
                    sufficient authority or evidence, deduced chiefly from the names of the
                    Ptolemies and the Caesars. The <hi rend="italic">probable</hi> are those which,
                    on good grounds, are supposed to correspond to the respective letters under
                    which they have been arranged, but for which no direct or positive authority can
                    be produced. The <hi rend="italic">doubtful</hi> are not only without positive
                    authority, but in a great measure conjectural; though, as far as conjecture
                    goes, they are supposed to correspond to the letters under which they are
                    respectively placed.</p>
