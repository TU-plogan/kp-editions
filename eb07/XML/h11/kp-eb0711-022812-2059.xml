                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra

                <p><label type="entry">HELVETIUS, <hi rend="smallcaps">Claude Adrian</hi></label>, a
                    man of letters, and celebrated French philosopher, was born at Paris about the
                    beginning of 1715. After receiving the rudiments of his education in his
                    father’s house, he was sent to the College of Louis-le-Grand, where he
                    discovered greater indications of genius than any of his fellow-students, and
                    thus gained the esteem of the professor of rhetoric, by whom particular
                    attention was paid to his education. By his elegant and graceful exterior he
                    endeavoured to ingratiate himself with the fair sex; but he was soon convinced,
                    that although external advantages may dazzle for the moment, nothing but
                    intellectual accomplishments can command esteem and respect. The circumstance
                    which led him to perceive the absolute necessity of mental improvement, in order
                    to be truly esteemed and admired, is worthy of notice. When walking alone in one
                    of the public gardens, he discovered a most extravagant figure amidst a circle
                    of young and amiable ladies. This was the geometer Maupertuis, who engrossed all
                    the care and attention of this charming group, notwithstanding the ridiculous
                    and grotesque singularity of his dress, appearance, and manners. This convinced
                    Helvetius, that if he wished to be sincerely admired or esteemed, dancing,
                    tennis, and all other bodily exercises must give place to the cultivation of the
                    mind. Immediately, therefore, he became a solitary, recluse student; the
                    mathematics in particular attracted his attention; and in a short time he was
                    admitted as the companion of some of the most distinguished literary characters
                    of the period in which he lived. Voltaire and Montesquieu were amongst his early
                    acquaintance; and with the latter he contracted a cordial and lasting
                    friendship. The first literary production of Helvetius was of the poetical kind,
                    consisting of epistles on happiness; but these were not communicated to <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193642072" xml:id="kp-eb0711-2072-0229"/> the public until
                    after his decease. When read in private, however, they were much admired, and
                    Voltaire considered them as a strong proof of the didaetic and philosophical
                    powers of their author. When the <hi rend="italic">Esprit des Loix</hi> of
                    Montesquieu appeared, the work was studied by Helvetius with the utmost care and
                    attention; and his only objection to it was, that it did not contain the first
                    ideas respecting the things of which it professed to treat. Instead of examining
                    systems of legislation, and comparing them with each other, Helvetius was of
                    opinion, that the nature of man should first be studied, and that the laws for
                    governing him should be founded on the principles of his own constitution. This
                    seemed to him true philosophy, and with such ideas he determined to undertake a
                    work which might supply what he conceived to be defects in the publication of
                    Montesquieu. Accordingly, in 1758 appeared his famous book <hi rend="italic">De
                    l’Esprit,</hi> which was published without the author’s name, but which was
                    condemned by the parliament of Paris, as tending to degrade the nature of man; a
                    proceeding which had the effect of making the book be sought for with avidity
                    all over France, as well as other European countries, and gave to the
                    speculations of the author much more importance than perhaps they would have
                    otherwise acquired. To avoid the malice of his enemies, he visited England in
                    the year 1762; and in the following year went to Prussia, where he was received
                    with every mark of respect by the king, who gave him lodgings in the palace, and
                    admitted him into his familiar parties. He was uncommonly liberal to the
                    indigent, some of whom but ill requited him; on which occasions he was wont to
                    say to his friends, “If I were a king I would correct them; but as I am only
                    rich, and they are poor, I do my duty in relieving them.” Although his
                    constitution was excellent, and his friends thence concluded that they would
                    long enjoy the happiness of his society, he fell a victim to the gout in his
                    head and stomach in the month of December 1771, being then in the fifty-sixth
                    year of his age.</p>
                <p>Besides his work <hi rend="italic">De</hi><hi rend="italic">VEsprit,</hi>
                    Helvetius was the author of, 1. De l’Homme, de ses Facultés intellectuelles, et
                    de son Education, in two vols. 8vo; 2. Le vrai sens du Système de la Nature,
                    London, 1774, in 8vo; 3. Le Bonheur, a poem in six cantos, London, 1772, in 8vo;
                    all published after his death. Helvetius possessed considerable taste and
                    ingenuity, some knowledge of human nature, and a turn for ridiculing the follies
                    of mankind; but as a philosopher he was plausible rather than profound, fond of
                    paradoxes, and so prone to scoff at what he considered as false religion, that
                    his belief in the true faith came to be questioned. At the same time his works
                    abound in just observations, often very happily expressed; and he displays a
                    knowledge of the world, of which we but rarely meet with indications in the
                    works of speculative men.</p>
