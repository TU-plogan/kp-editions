                <p><label type="entry">HAT</label> is a term of Saxon derivation, from <hi
                    rend="italic">haet,</hi> a cover for the head. It is sometimes called castor,
                    from its being made of the fur of the castor or beaver. As a piece of dress, the
                    period of its introduction is not certain, although it may with great
                    probability be referred to the early distinctions of Roman Catholic dignitaries.
                    Froissart chronicles, that it was “saide to the cardynals, Sirs, advyse you if
                    ye de-lyvere us a Pope Romayne, we be content, or els we woll maike your heddes
                    reeder than your hattes be;” from which, and many other documents, it appears
                    that at this period, as well as for some centuries thereafter, hats were
                    generally of a scarlet or red colour, and made of “a fine kinde of haire matted
                    thegither.” A “hatte of biever,” about the middle of the twelfth century, was
                    worn by some one of the “nobels of the lande, mett at Clarendom ;” and Froissart
                    describes hats and plumes which were worn at Edward’s Court in 1340, when the
                    garter order was instituted. In the Diary of Henry’s secretary, there is “ane
                    scarlet beever hatte” presented on new year’s day 1443. Even at this early
                    period hats were of various shapes, both in the crowns and the brims; the latter
                    being chiefly broad, sometimes narrowing towards the back, and a little bent up
                    and scooped in front. In Henry’s privy purse expenses, during his congress with
                    Francis I. in 1520 or 1521, there is “peid for a hatte and plume for the king,
                    in Boleyn, xvs.;” and in Wolsey’s inventory, taken on his resigning the great
                    seal to Sir Thomas Moore, there are no fewer than five mentioned. The fashion of
                    this article was then much more diversely capricious than even now, as will
                    appear from an extract from Stubbs’ <hi rend="italic">Anatomic of Abuses,</hi>
                    published about 1585: “Sometimes they use them sharpe on the crowne, pearking up
                    like the spire or shaft of a steeple, standing a quarter of a yard above the
                    crowne of theire heads; some more, some lesse, as please the fantasies of their
                    inconstant mindes. Othersome be flat, and broade on the crowne, like the
                    battlements of a house. Another sorte have rounde crownes, sometimes with one
                    kind of bande, sometimes with another; now black, now white, now russed, now
                    redde, now grene, now yellow; now this, now that; never content with one colour
                    or fashion two daies to an end. And as the fashions be rare and strange, so is
                    the stuffe whereof their hattes be made divers also; for some are silk, some of
                    velvet, some of taffetic, some of sarsnet, some of wool, and, which is more
                    curious, some of a certaine kindc of fine haire, these they call bever hattes,
                    of xx. xxx. or xl. shillings price, fetched from be-yonde the seas, from whence
                    a great sorte of other vanities doe come besides; and so common a thing it is,
                    that every servyng man, countreiman, and other, even all indifferently, doe
                    weare of these hattes.” About the beginning of 1700, the crowns of hats were
                    mostly round, much lower than before, and had very broad brims, resembling what
                    are now occasionally called Quakers’ hats, the protrusive encumbrance of which
                    soon suggested the convenience of their being turned up in front; fashion
                    dictated the upbending of another side or flap, and ultimately a third, so that
                    by this progress, in 1704, the regular three-cocked hat became the order of the
                    day, when feathers ceased to be usually worn. Near the middle of the eighteenth
                    century, a round-edged but flat-topped and fullbrimmed hat got into very general
                    use, and the flat and other cocked hats now dwindled almost into a mere
                    distinction of real or assumed rank. Twenty-five years after this, a very near
                    approach to that of the present times became fashionable, and, within ten years,
                    altogether superseded the ordinary use of the cumbrous and antique cock.</p>

                    official dignity. The <hi rend="italic">opera</hi> or soft folding hat is the
                    only relic at present in general use, of the hats worn by our grandfathers,
                    although it is not improbable that the affluent and growing extravagance of this
                    century is likely to re-introduce the elegant Spanish hat as the precursor
                    perhaps of the prevalence of various other styles, as well as the cocked hat,
                    not yet entirely discarded from the revolving wheel of luxurious fashion.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Hat-making</hi> now embraces two distinct kinds of
                    manufacture, felted and covered hats; the covering of the latter being sometimes
                    silk, and at other times Braganza or cotton Angola.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Felted hats</hi> comprehend two classes, differing chiefly in
                    the materials used in making, the process being nearly identical. The lower
                    class is marked by inferior ingredients, unmixed with beaver, and embraces <hi
                    rend="italic">wool, plated,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">short nap</hi> hats.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Wool hats</hi> are made entirely of coarse native wool and hair
                    stiffened with glue, chiefly for negroes’ wear. Value Is. 2d. to 2s. 2d. <hi
                    rend="italic">Plates</hi> have a <hi rend="italic">nap</hi> or pile rather finer
                    than their body, and are sometimes <hi rend="italic">waterproof</hi> stiffened.
                    Value 3s∙ to 4s. 6d. <hi rend="italic">Short naps</hi> are distinguished from
                    plates by additional kinds of wool, viz. hare’s back, seal, neuter, musquash
                    (Muscovy cat), and are all waterproof stiffened. Value 5s. to 9s.</p>
                <p>The second class may be said to comprehend two orders, called stuff and beaver
                    hats. The first includes mottled and stuff bodies. The latter term is not used
                    generally, as all <hi rend="italic">stuffs</hi> are understood to be of this
                    sort when <hi rend="italic">mottled</hi> is not expressed. <hi rend="italic"
                    >Mottled bodies</hi> are made chiefly of fine Spanish wool, and inferior rabbit
                    down or coney wool. Value Is. 8d. to 2s. 6d. <hi rend="italic">Stuff bodies</hi>
                    consist of the best hare, Saxony, and red wools, mixed with Cashmere hair and
                    silk. Value 3s. to 4s. <hi rend="italic">Stuff hats</hi> are <hi rend="italic"
                    >napped,</hi> that is, covered with pile of mixed seal, neuter, hare-back,
                    inferior beaver, and musquash. Value lθs. to 15s. <hi rend="italic">Seaver
                    hats</hi> are, or ought to be, napped with beaver only; the lower priced
                    qualities with <hi rend="italic">brown wοοms</hi> taken from the back; the more
                    valuable kinds with <hi rend="italic">cheek</hi> and <hi rend="italic">white
                    woorns,</hi> being the finest parts of the fur found on the belly and cheeks of
                    the beaver. Value 16s. to 22s.</p>
                <p>The apparatus and terms used in making felted hats, which it is necessary to
                    describe briefly, are the bow, bowpin, basket, hurdle, battery, and planks.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">bow</hi> is about six feet long, usually made of ash, thick
                    enough not to be elastic. The handle A, B, C, is called the <hi rend="italic"
                    >stang</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> A is named the <hi rend="italic"
                    >breech;</hi> C, the end farthest from the workman’s hold, the <hi rend="italic"
                    >cock.</hi> D, the <hi rend="italic">bowstring,</hi> is a strong catgut cord
                    tensely fastened.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">bow-pin</hi> is used (just as the finger on the guitar) for
                    vibrating the bowstring.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">hurdle</hi> is a fixed bench, with three enclosing sides,
                    to prevent the stuff being flittered off in bowing.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">basket</hi> is of light wicker-work, about twenty by
                    twenty-two inches in size.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">battery</hi> consists of A, the kettle; B, C, the planks,
                    which are inclined planes, usually eight in number, one only being appropriated
                    to each workman. The half of each plank next the kettle is lead, the upper half
                    is mahogany.</p>
                <p>The first process in hat-making is <hi rend="italic">bowing</hi> the stuff or
                    furs, which are weighed out to a proportionate scale, and laid on the hurdle,
                    immediately under the bow, which is suspended by a pulley. The bow is held
                    firmly with the left hand, rather toward the <hi rend="italic">breech-end,</hi>
                    not edgewise, but on its side, with the string in contact with the stuff, the
                    clotted and adherent portions of which are separated into single fibres, and
                    attain a loose, flocky, mixed condition by the continued vibration of the
                    bowstring, caused by a very rapid succession of touches with the bowstick. It is
                    then divided as nearly as possible, and one half laid aside, whilst the other is
                    again bowed. In this second operation, partly by the bowing, but chiefly by the
                    <hi rend="italic">gathering,</hi> or patting use of the basket, the stuff" is
                    loosely matted into a conical figure, about fifty by thirty-six inches, called a
                    <hi rend="italic">bat.</hi> In this formation care is taken to work about two
                    thirds of the wools down towards what is intended for the brim, which being
                    effected, greater density is induced by gentle pressure with the basket. It is
                    then covered with a wettish linen cloth, upon which is laid the <hi
                    rend="italic">hardening skin,</hi> a piece of dry half-tanned horse hide. On
                    this the workman presses or bakes for seven or eight minutes, until the stuff
                    shall have adhered closely to the damp cloth, in which it is then doubled up,
                    freely pressed with the hand, and laid aside. By this process, called basoning
                    (from a metal plate or <hi rend="italic">bason,</hi> used for like purposes in
                    making <hi rend="italic">wool</hi> hats), the bat has become compactly felted
                    and thinned toward the sides and point. The other half of the flocked stuff is
                    next subjected to precisely the same proceedings, after which, a cone-shaped
                    slip of stiff paper is laid on its surface, and the sides of the bat folded over
                    its edges to its form and size. It is then laid paper-side downward upon the
                    first bat, which is now replaced on the hurdle, and its edges transversely
                    doubled over the introverted side-lays of the second bat, thus giving equal
                    thickness to the whole <hi rend="italic">body.</hi> In this condition it is
                    re-introduced between folds of damp linen cloth, and again hardened, so as to
                    unite both halves, the knitting together of which is quickly effected. The paper
                    is now withdrawn, and the body being folded into three plies, is removed to the
                    plank or battery room.</p>
                <p>In the battery the <hi rend="italic">liquor</hi> is scalding heat, composed of
                    pure soft water, about half a gill of oil of vitriol as an astringent, and a
                    full handful of oatmeal to correct its pernicious tendencies. Herein the body is
                    imbrued, and withdrawn to the plank to partly cool and drain, when it is
                    unfolded, rolled gently with a pin tapering towards the ends like a liquor
                    horse, turned, and worked with in every direction, to toughen, shrink, and at
                    same time prevent adhesion of its sides. <hi rend="italic">Stopping</hi> or
                    thickening the thin spots which now appear on looking through the body, is
                    carefully performed, by additional stuff daubed on by successive supplies of the
                    hot liquor from a brush frequently dipped into the kettle, until the body be
                    shrunk sufficiently (about one half), and thoroughly equalized. When quite
                    dried, <hi rend="italic">stiffening</hi> is performed with a brush dipped into a
                    glutinous pulpy composition, <pb break="no" facs="nls:193641253"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0711-1253-0166"/>and rubbed into the body; the surface intended for
                    the inside having much more imposed than the outer, while the brim is made to
                    absorb many times the quantity applied to any other part. This viscous matter
                    contains <hi rend="italic">proofing,</hi> or those ingredients which render the
                    hat waterproof.</p>
                <p>On being again dried, the body is ready to be <hi rend="italic">covered,</hi> and
                    is once more taken to the battery. The first cover of beaver or napping, which
                    has been previously <hi rend="italic">bowed,</hi> is equally strewed on the
                    body, and patted upon with the brush charged with the hot liquor, until
                    incorporated; the <hi rend="italic">cut</hi> ends only, being the points which
                    naturally intrude. Here the body is put into a coarse hair-cloth dipped and
                    rolled in the hot liquor, until the beaver is quite worked in. This is called
                    <hi rend="italic">rolling off,</hi> or ruffing. A stripe for the brim, round the
                    edge of the inside, is treated in like manner, and is thus prepared for the
                    second cover, which is applied and inworked in like manner; the rolling, &amp;c.
                    being continued until the whole has become incorporated, and a clean, regular,
                    close, and well-felted <hi rend="italic">hood</hi> is the result. The dry hood,
                    after having the nap beat up and freed, is clipped to the length which may be
                    thought best, by means of common shears. A clipping machine, invented nearly
                    four years ago in Scotland, is now very generally preferred, and doubtless will
                    soon everywhere supersede the ordinary process; much greater regularity, speed,
                    and certainty being secured by it. When the nap is thus disposed of, the hood is
                    soaked in the battery kettle, and then <hi rend="italic">drawn down</hi> on a
                    block to the size and shape wanted, firmly tied at the bottom with a cord,
                    around which the brim is left in a frilled condition.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Dyeing</hi> is the next step. A <hi rend="italic">suit,</hi> or
                    six dozen, are put into the dye kettle at a time, all on the croavn-blocks
                    already mentioned, and allowed to remain three quarters of an hour in the
                    liquor, which is kept as near as possible one degree below the boiling point.
                    These being taken out and set in the yard to cool, another suit is introduced
                    for a like period, and the various suits are so treated at least twelve times in
                    successive order. Each of the first four introgressions of every suit is
                    accompanied by about seven pounds of copperas, and two pounds of verdigris. The
                    body is then washed and brushed out in changes of hot water, until no colouring
                    can be recognized in it. When thus thoroughly cleansed, it is steamed on a block

                    heavy (2l-pound) heated irons and moisture, the frilled brim is shrunk until
                    rendered quite level, the nap gently raised all over with a fine wire card, and
                    brushed and ironed smooth in the uniform directions. The tip, a thin lath sheet,
                    is then fitted and stuck to the inside of the crown, and <hi rend="italic"

                    the fur of amphibious animals, that have escaped the search of the machine used
                    in blowing the beaver, so as to separate them from its fine parts. This being
                    carefully accomplished, it is transferred to the finisher, who, with a plush
                    cushion or <hi rend="italic">velure,</hi> a brush, and hot iron, imparts to it
                    that bright sleeky lustre so characteristic of English and Scotch hats. The <hi

                    by hot irons, first on the top, which passes through to the lath-tip within;
                    then on the upper brim, the sides, and, finally, the under brim. When this is
                    hardened, it is coated with thick ordinary flour-paste, which is dried, and the
                    shell again blocked and smoothed; then once more glue-sized outside, dried, and

                    inferiority. This cross part is sewn to a circular piece for the crown, whilst
                    the brims are singly patched together. These preparations being completed, the
                    <hi rend="italic">top-side</hi> or upper brim is first stuck, then the crown,

                    part is the <hi rend="italic">side-seam,</hi> which is disposed of thus: The

                    other selvidge end is then stuck and cut with the utmost nicety, in close
                    parallel with the other. It is then finished very much in the same manner as a

                <p>Imported hats are each subject to ten shillings and sixpence of duty. In 1832
                    there were exported 62,854 dozens. In this branch of manufacture there are
                    employed annually nearly 25,000 men, besides about 10,000 females in the
                    trimming and picking departments.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Hats, Straw.</hi> Any attempt to ascertain when straw was
                    first used in the manufacture of hats would be useless, because it would be
                    impossible to fix a date with any correctness. In Italy it had arrived at a
                    great degree of perfection two centuries ago; but it is not above sixty or
                    seventy years since it began to be followed as a trade in England. Wheat straw
                    is the material chiefly used by our <pb break="no" facs="nls:193641266"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0711-1266-0167"/>manufacturers; and the counties most favourable
                    for its production are Bedford, Hertford, and Buckingham, which have been called
                    the <hi rend="italic">straw-plait district.</hi> The making of straw hats is
                    carried on in other places, but not to the same extent as there. Leghorn bonnets
                    had long been a considerable article of import; but the late war having put a
                    stop to this, a new spirit was given to the home manufacture. It now became a
                    flourishing trade, which produced competition and a consequent improvement in
                    the article. At the close of the war, however, Leghorn hats again usurped the
                    market to a considerable extent, and the domestic manufacture proportionally
                    declined. Many of the straw plaiters having been reduced to great distress, the
                    Society of Arts turned its attention to the subject, and offered premiums for
                    improvements in plaiting, finishing, and bleaching. The straw of Tuscany having
                    been found very superior to British straw, the former became an article of
                    import; and the Italian method of plaiting the straw has also been introduced.
                    So completely successful has this scheme been, that, whilst the importation of
                    Leghorn hats has gradually decreased during the last few years, the introduction
                    of the raw material has gradually increased. Upon this straw there is a düty of
                    only one penny per hundredweight, and it is chiefly plaited in our own straw
                    districts. What is called the Tuscan plait, upon which a heavy duty is levied,
                    has likewise been largely imported, and made into bonnets of equal fineness and
                    beauty to the genuine Leghorn hat.</p>
                <p>There are seven descriptions of plait in general use, the difference in the kinds
                    arising from the number of straws used in the plait, and from their being either
                    whole or split. Other varieties are also manufactured, but chiefly for
                    exportation. In Scotland, rye straw, dwarfed by being grown on poor land, has
                    been employed in plaiting straw in imitation of Leghorn, and with such complete
                    success, that the hats manufactured in Orkney, where the rye is raised, are
                    considered by the best judges as quite equal, both in colour and quality, to
                    those of Leghorn. The following description of the preparation of the Italian
                    straw is extracted from M‘Culloch’s <hi rend="italic">Dictionary of
                    Commerce,</hi> “The description of straw used, which is cultivated solely for
                    the purposes of the manufacture, and not for the grain, is the <hi rend="italic"
                    >triticum turgidum,</hi> a variety of bearded wheat, which seems to differ in no
                    respect from the spring wheat grown in the vale of Evesham and other parts of
                    England. <hi rend="italic">(Trans, of Soc. Arts.)</hi> After undergoing a
                    certain preparatory process, the upper parts of the stems (being first sorted as
                    to colour and thickness) are formed into a plait of generally thirteen straws,
                    which is afterwards knitted together at the edges into a circular shape called a
                    ‘ flat,’ or hat. The fineness of the flats is determined by the number of rows
                    of plait which compose them, counting from the bottom of the crown to the edge
                    of the brim, and their relative fineness ranges from about No. 20 to 60, being
                    the rows contained in the breadth of the brim, which is generally eight inches.
                    They are afterwards assorted into first, second, and third qualities, which are
                    determined by the <hi rend="italic">colour</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >texture</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> the most faultless being denominated the
                    first, whilst the most defective is described as the third quality. These
                    qualities are much influenced by the season of the year in which the straw is
                    plaited. Spring is the most favourable, not only for plaiting, but for bleaching
                    and finishing. The dust and perspiration in summer, and the benumbed fingers of
                    the workwomen in winter, when they are compelled to keep within their smoky
                    huts, plaiting the cold and wet straw, are equally injurious to the colour of
                    the hats, which no bleaching can improve. The flats are afterwards made up in
                    cases of .ten or twenty dozen, assorted in progressive numbers or qualities, and
                    the price of the middle or average number governs the whole. The <hi
                    rend="italic">Brozzi</hi> make bears the highest repute, and the <hi
                    rend="italic">Signa</hi> is considered secondary; which names are given to the
                    flats, from the districts where they are plaited. Florence is the principal
                    market, and the demand is chiefly from England, France, Germany, and America;
                    but the kinds mostly required are the lower numbers; the very finest hats, and
                    particularly of late, being considered as too expensive by the buyers. <hi
