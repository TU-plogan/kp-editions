                    Brunswick. In the course of the revolutionary war, under the influence of
                    France, the dukedoms of Bavaria, of Saxony, and of Wirtemburg had been raised to
                    the rank of kingdoms; and when the overthrow of Bonaparte was accomplished, the
                    dukedoms which had composed the electorate of Hanover were thought by the allied
                    powers of sufficient consequence to be elevated to the same dignity, as, with
                    the additions then made to them, they were nearly equal in extent and population
                    to the other portions of Germany whose rulers had received that rank. It
                    accordingly assumed that grade in 1814, under George III., and was acknowledged
                    as such by all the powers of Europe.</p>
                <p>The obscurity in which antiquity has involved the early history of nations can
                    only be in a slight degree cleared up by tracing the origin of the families that
                    maintained the continued rule over them. The ruling family of Hanover has been
                    traced, by the combined efforts and researches of Muratori and Leibnitz, to an
                    Italian origin, in the dark ages, that is, to the princely house of Este; and by
                    Gibbon, from that house up to the descendants of Charlemagne. A Marquis of Este,
                    in the eleventh century, married Cuniza or Cunegonda, an heiress of a princely
                    family in Bavaria, whose son received the name of Guelph, derived from his
                    maternal ancestors, and inherited their dominions, including the dukedom of
                    Bavaria. The grandson of this Guelph, named Henry the Black, and his son named
                    Henry the Proud, acquired by marriage new and extensive dominions on the banks
                    of the Elbe and the Weser; and Henry the Lion, the most powerful prince of his
                    age, was the first of the race who assumed the title of Duke of Brunswick. Under
                    this Henry, who distinguished himself as a great warrior, an uncle wrested from
                    him the southern portion of his territory in Bavaria and Suabia, and left him,
                    at the conclusion of most bitter hostility, in the possession of the northern
                    portion of it. He made the city of Brunswick the capital of his dominions, and,
                    being in possession of the rich silver mines of the Hartz, was enabled to extend
                    his power over the tribes of Northern Germany, inhabiting Holstein, Mecklenburg,
                    and nearly the whole coast of the Baltic Sea.</p>
                <p>FIenry the Lion was twice married. By his first wife he left no family; and by
                    his second wife, who was Maud, the daughter of Henry II. of England, though he
                    had several sons, none of them left any issue except William, under whose only
                    son Otho the partition of the house took place, Brunswick and Luneburg being
                    divided into two dukedoms. The latter branch received the Hanoverian portion as
                    a fief from William Sigefred, bishop of Hildesheim. After the death of Otho, and
                    of his two sons Otho and William, who successively followed, the male line
                    became extinct in 1369. Otho, elector of Saxony, who had married a daughter of
                    William, was, by the influence of the emperor of Germany, Charles IV. invested
                    with the government. He died without issue, having by his testament bequeathed
                    the dukedom to his uncle Wenceslaus, elector of Saxony; a bequest which was
                    contested by Torquatus Magnus, duke of Saxony, but at length was terminated in a
                    compromise, by which Bernard, the eldest son of Torquatus, obtained the
                    dominion, and reigned until 1434. After several successions, the power became
                    vested in Ernest of Zell, who first introduced the Lutheran religion into his
                    states, and died in the year 1546. The succession since has been, William, who
                    died in 1592; Ernest, in 1611; Christian, in 1633; August, in 1636; Fredrich, in
                    1648; Ernest Augustus, bishop of Osnaburg, who was made an elector of the German
                    empire in 1692, and died in 1698; George Louis, who, after the death of his
                    uncle George William, inherited the dukedom of Zell in 1705, and succeeded to
                    the crown of Great Britain by the title of George I. in 1714. He died in 1727,
                    since which period the succession has been the same as in that kingdom.</p>
                <p>The accession of the electors of Hanover to the throne of Great Britain, though
                    it has led ultimately to a great extension of territory, has, on the other hand,
                    subjected the electorate to sufferings and to oppression during the wars between
                    Great Britain and France. At the commencement of the Seven Years’ War, a French
                    army invaded it; and the forces under the Duke of Cumberland, being unequal to
                    its defence, were compelled, by the convention of Kloster-Severn, to abandon the
                    country to the invaders. By the peace of 1763 it was again restored to its
                    ancient sovereign. At the renewal of hostilities after the treaty of Amiens,
                    Hanover was once more seized upon by the French, and by them delivered over to
                    the king of Prussia, who ruled it till after his defeat at Jena. It was then
                    incorporated as part of the kingdom of Westphalia, erected in favour of Jerome
                    Bonaparte. This rule was terminated by the battle of Leipsic, by which Hanover,
                    with the rest of Germany, was delivered from French domination, and returned to
                    its ancient sovereigns, with the addition of the provinces of Hildesheim,
                    Osnaburg, East Friesland, Goslar, and some other territories. On the other hand,
                    Hanover gave up the ancient duchy of Lauenburg, which was transferred to
                    Denmark, and some portions or bailiwicks, a part to Prussia, and a part to the
                    Duke of Oldenburg.</p>
                <p>Hanover has thus become a compact dominion, extending over 14,720 English square
                    miles. It lies between 50° 18' and 53° 54' north latitude, and 6° 58' and ll <hi
                    rend="superscript"> o</hi> 56' east longitude. It is bounded on the north by the
                    duchy of Oldenburg, the bailiwick of Ritzebüttel, belonging to Hamburg, and the
                    mouth of the Elbe. On the north-east the river Elbe divides it from Holstein and
                    Luneburg, belonging to Denmark, and from the duchy of Mecklenburg-Schwerin; but
                    it possesses the small territory of Neuhof on the right bank of that river. On
                    the east it is bounded by the Prussian province of Saxony, and by the duchy of
                    Brunswick; on the south it touches the dominions of Prussia, of Hesse-Cassel, of
                    both the Lippes, and of Westphalia; and on the west the kingdom of the
                    Netherlands is the boundary.</p>
                <p>The kingdom of Hanover is divided in the following manner :—</p>

                <p>A new survey and division of provinces has been made within the last four years.
                    The population returns are grounded on a census taken in 1817, since which the
                    deaths have been deducted and the births added each year. This gives an increase
                    of inhabitants of 236,400 in fifteen years. In the year 1832 the births appear
                    to have been 48,273, and the deaths 39,806. The capital of each of the provinces
                    is the city of the same name.</p>
                <p>The chief cities and their population are as follows: Hanover, 26,300;
                    Hildesheim, 13,800; Luneburg, 12,500; Emden, 12,100; Osnabruck, 11,800;
                    Göttingen, 11,000; Zell, 10,300; Clausthal, 8850; Goslar, 7160; Leer, 6340;
                    Hameln, 5750; Norden,-5600; Stade, 5500; Eimbeck, 5100.</p>
                <p>The province of Hildesheim is somewhat mountainous, and that of Clausthal,
                    containing the Hartz, is <pb break="no" facs="nls:193640876"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0711-0876-0137"/>wholly so, as well as some parts near Göttingen.
                    The other provinces form a part of that extensive plain which commences on the
                    shores of the German Ocean, and terminates on the frontiers of Russia. The whole
                    plain is a sandy soil, resting on a bed of granite, and is generally sterile,
                    except on the banks of the various rivers that water it, or near the cities,
                    where cultivation has improved it by artificial means. The most fruitful part of
                    the kingdom is on the banks of the Elbe, and near the German Ocean, where, as in
                    Holland, rich meadows are preserved from being immersed in water, by broad dykes
                    and deep ditches, constructed and kept in repair at a great expense.</p>
                <p>The most remarkable mountains are those of the Hartz Forest, three fifths of
                    which are in this kingdom, and two fifths in the duchy of Brunswick. These
                    mountains arc not a part of any chain, but rise from a plain in a group by
                    themselves, the highest points of which are nearly in the centre. The mass is
                    about eighty miles in length from east to west, and about twenty-eight in
                    breadth from north to south. The highest points, and their height above the
                    level of the sea, are Bruchbcrg, 3020 feet; Wormberg, 2880 feet; Achtermanshöhe,
                    2710 feet; the Little Winter-berg, 2684 feet; Kahlenberg, 2180 feet; and the
                    Rammelsberg, 1915 feet. These mountains are wholly covered with forests. On
                    their lower sides the trees are of the deciduous kinds, but the summits are
                    exclusively covered with pines. These mountains abound with minerals of almost
                    every kind, and the principal employment of the inhabitants consists either in
                    mining, or in manufacturing the iron and copper into domestic utensils. Some of
                    the mining and manufacturing towns, as Clausthal, Andreasbcrg, Ccller-feld, and
                    several others, are from 1700 to 1900 feet above the level of the sea; and their
                    population would suffer most severely from the cold of the severe winters, but
                    for the abundance both of wood and fossil coal with which they arc supplied.</p>
                <p>The whole of the kingdom of Hanover dips towards the north, and the courses of
                    all the rivers are in that direction. These are, <hi rend="italic">first,</hi>
                    the Elbe, which borders a large part of the dominion, and receives into it the
                    Ohre, which rises in the province of Luneburg; the Aland and the Jeetze, which
                    come out of Prussia, and are navigable before they terminate in the Elbe; the
                    Ilmenau, which becomes navigable at Luneburg; the Este, which is navigable to
                    Buxtehude; the Lühe, navigable to Hornburg; the Schwinge, by which vessels reach
                    Stade; the Oste, which passes Harburg, and is navigable to Kirchosters; and the
                    Medem, which runs through the land Hadeln, and admits large vessels as high as
                    Ottendorf. <hi rend="italic">Second,</hi> the Weser, which enters the dominions
                    of Hanover at Münden, being there formed by the junction of the Fulda and the
                    Werra. It is navigable for barges from the spot at which its name commences, and
                    it receives, in its course, the Hamel, the Aller, the Oertze, the Line, the
                    Böhme, the Eyther, the Wümme, the Lesum (formed by the three streams, Rodau,
                    Wiste, and Worpe), the Greste, and the Hunter; all of which are Hanoverian
                    rivers, and continue their united courses till they are lost in the German Ocean
                    near Bremen. <hi rend="italic">Third,</hi> the Ems, a river rising in the
                    Prussian province of Westphalia. After entering Hanover, it receives the waters
                    of the Aa, the Hase, the Else, and the Leda. Before reaching the sea, it falls
                    into the Dollart near Emden, which is the principal seaport in the kingdom. The
                    vessels belonging to this port are about 270, and their tonnage 19,289 lasts.
                    There are equipped at the mouth of this river upwards of fifty busses, which are
                    employed in the herring fishery, and usually take and cure from 12,000 to 14,000
                    tons of that fish annually. <hi rend="italic">Fourth,</hi> the Vecht, a river of
                    short course, rising in the Prussian province of Westphalia, and terminating in
                    the Zuydcr Zee. Its principal importance is derived from a navigable canal,
                    which commences at the city of Münster, arid is the channel õf some trade
                    through the Vecht to Amsterdam.</p>
                <p>Though Hanover is generally a sandy soil, it has some small fresh-water lakes.
                    The Dummersee, in Diepholtz, is about twelve miles in circuit. The
                    Steinhudermecr, in the province of Kalenburg, is about four miles long and two
                    broad; and the Dollart, at the mouth of the Eins, which is rather an estuary
                    than a lake, is twelve miles across. The canals are all of short course. The
                    Bremen Canal is designed to unite the Hamme, the Oste, and the Schwinge; and the
                    Treckschuit Canal is intended to connect Witmund with Aurich. The Pappenburg
                    Canal is only navigable from the Ems to that city.</p>
                <p>Though considerable variations, in conformity to the different natures of the
                    soils, occur in the husbandry of Hanover, yet it may be generally described as
                    at a very low standard. The land mostly belongs either to the king, or to the
                    nobles, as lords of the soil, who have under them a species of tenants called
                    bauers, having the use of small portions of land, under many and various feudal
                    conditions. These bauers pay little or no rent in money, but render the lord a
                    stipulated number of days’ work in seed time and harvest on his demesne lands,
                    or give him a certain proportion of the proceeds of their crops. In most
                    instances the lords have the right of pasture for their cattle over the whole
                    land, and arc the proprietors of most of the sheep and cows. There is an
                    exception to this mode of holding, called the <hi rend="italic">meyer
                    law</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> but it extends over so small a portion of the
                    kingdom as not to merit a detailed notice of it. The rotation of crops usually
                    followed in Hanover is first a fallow, on which the land is cultivated to
                    potatoes, peas, or flax; then follows winter corn, either rye or wheat, but
                    chiefly the former; and to these succeeds summer corn, either barley or oats. As
                    the fields arc usually divided into small portions, like many of our common
                    fields in England, and the larger divisions must all be cultivated alike, though
                    belonging to different occupiers; and as the course that has prevailed from time
                    immemorial must be continued; there is little or no room for improvement, and
                    little encouragement for superior knowledge or greater activity. Such is the bad
                    state of cultivation, that the increase of grain is not estimated to exceed four
                    for one of the quantity sown throughout the whole kingdom. The breeding and
                    fattening of cattle is a branch of rural economy, confined to particular
                    portions adapted to that purpose, and is in the same backward state as the
                    agriculture. By the latest enumeration of the live stock, which was previous to
                    some provinces of 600,000 acres in extent being added to it, there were 224,500
                    horses; 675,926 head of horned cattle; 1,540,794 sheep and lambs; 15,728 goats
                    and kids; 176,974 swine; and 1498 asses and mules. Much of the heath land,
                    especially in the province of Luneburg, is used for no other purpose but that of
                    rearing bees for the sake of their honey and wax. The hives are transported in
                    waggons, at the commencement of the spring, to those more southern countries
                    where the flowers bloom early, and are afterwards brought back when the heath
                    flowers are fit for them, and remain till the proper time for taking the
                    contents of the hives. Large numbers of geese are also kept by the bauers on the
                    moist situations: their flesh is salted for winter domestic consumption, and
                    their feathers arc preserved for sale. These two sources, affording wax, honey,
                    and feathers, yield the principal disposable produce of some of the
                    provinces.</p>
                <p>The manufactures of Hanover arc very numerous, but none of them extensive. Except
                    linen, linen yarn, and domestic utensils, few of them afford a surplus beyond
                    the home consumption. The linen is of four kinds: first, that called <hi
                    rend="italic">Hauseleinwand,</hi> or household linen, the making as well as use
                    of which is to be met with in every family; secondly, a coarse kind, that called
                    the <hi rend="italic">Lowentleinen</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> thirdly, <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193640889" xml:id="kp-eb0711-0889-0138"/> the fine linen,
                    which is only made in some of the cities to a small extent, and almost wholly
                    consumed by the richer families of the kingdom; and, fourthly, sail-cloth and
                    hempen linen, which is principally made in East Friesland and the duchy of
                    Bremen, and is mostly sold for foreign consumption. Besides the linen yarn used
                    in the home fabrics, a great quantity is spun for foreign trade. Spinning is
                    indeed the constant operation of almost all the females in the villages during
                    the long nights of winter. The spinning of coarse wool, and making it into
                    cloth, either by itself or mixed with linen, occupies a considerable portion of
                    the industry of the peasantry, and furnishes them with clothing from the produce
                    of their own lands. Besides these, they spin cotton, and mixing the yarn with
                    that of linen, manufacture dresses for the females and the younger part of their
                    families. The stockings they wear, whether of linen, cotton, or worsted, arc
                    usually made at home. In some parts of the country much oil is made from
                    linseed. Coarse pottery ware is made in many parts. Paper-mills, which supply
                    about 80,000 reams annually, are not sufficient for the home consumption. In the
                    cities, woollen cloths, silk goods, cotton of various kinds, hats, hosiery,
                    soap, and leather, are manufactured. The principal branches that employ much
                    capital are the breweries of Hanover, Eimbeck, and Goslar, and the corn
                    distilleries which are to be found in all the cities. The former of these are
                    suffering <hi rend="italic">a</hi> gradual declension, whilst the latter are as
                    rapidly increasing.</p>
                <p>The mines are a source of wealth, which, from having been neglected during the
                    French occupation, have required considerable expenditure to make them as
                    productive as they were before that calamitous period. The gross quantities
                    delivered of all the mines in the seventeen years from the beginning of 1815 to
                    the end of 1832, have been as follows, viz.</p>

                <p>It is expected that in future the proceeds will be more considerable, and the
                    expense of working much less, as some new shafts have been recently sunk, and
                    the cost of them deducted from the price of the metals.</p>
                <p>As may be supposed from the small quantity of surplus production, the trade of
                    Hanover cannot be extensive. The principal port, Emden, has some export and
                    import trade; but from the state of the roads between that place and the more
                    populous parts of the kingdom, more of its trade passes through Hamburg and
                    Bremen than through that city. Besides the more considerable articles made from
                    flax, its honey, wax, feathers, and large quantities of timber, are sent to
                    Hamburg and Bremen. Hops, rapeseed, oil-cake, fruit, hams, and sausages, form
                    also articles of export of small amount. In very fruitful years some corn is
                    exported, but in general the consumption is equal to the produce. The imports
                    consist principally of wine, coffee, tea, sugar, indigo, tobacco, and a few
                    manufactured articles, which are consumed by the richer classes. As the roads to
                    the great fairs of Leipsic and Frankfort pass through Hanover, the transit of
                    goods by these create a pretty large commission trade, and give employment to
                    many waggons, horses, and men, as well as to the barge owners. The exports and
                    imports nearly balance each other, and the amount of neither exceeds L.500,000
                    sterling.</p>
                <p>Hanover is a hereditary monarchy in the house of Guelph, with a Salic law, which
                    prevents the throne being filled by a female. In case the present branch becomes
                    extinct, the heir of the duchy of Brunswick will succeed. The legislative power
                    was vested in the several states formerly, which caused a great complication,
                    both in the financial and the judicial departments. This arose from the several
                    parts which have successively been added to Hanover having possessed ancient
                    constitutions, with considerable differences in the laws, religion, and
                    institutions. Ry gradual arrangements these have been assimilated into one
                    system, and a legislative body formed, which, as far as it has hitherto
                    proceeded, works rather favourably for the general good. It consists of two
                    houses. The upper house contains fifty-five members. They are in part the
                    mediatorial sovereigns within the kingdom, in part the Protestant and the
                    Catholic bishops or prelates, and in part the ministers at the head of the
                    several departments of the government; but the greater number consists of the
                    representatives of the nobility, proprietors of estates in the several
                    provinces.</p>
                <p>The second chamber is composed of seventy-two members, who are chosen for six
                    years. Twenty-nine of them are elected by the cities, and the remainder by the
                    proprietors of the estates in their respective provinces. Amongst these are
                    several clergymen and lawyers. The president and vice-president are selected by
                    the assembly, but subject to the approbation of the king, or, in his absence, of
                    the viceroy. They assemble every year, and their attention recently has been
                    chiefly addressed to the simplification of the finances, and to the abolition of
                    those inferior local justiciaries, which had belonged to the proprietors of
                    certain estates.</p>
                <p>The revenue of the kingdom is derived from various sources, all of which have
                    been clearly communicated to the public by one of the chiefs of the board of
                    revenue, Mr Ubbelohde, up to the beginning of 1834.</p>
                <p>The sovereigns of Hanover were, like most others in Germany, the largest landed
                    proprietors in their dominions. Their land, called the domains, with what was
                    denominated the royalties, such as the mines, the posting, the road and harbour
                    tolls, and other branches, amounted to nearly as much as the taxes. These have
                    recently been given up by the crown, and form one branch of the general revenue
                    applicable by the legislature to the purpose of paying the interest of the
                    public debt, and defraying the expenses of the several departments of the
                    administration.</p>
                <p>The nett amount of this royal property, after deducting the expense of management
                    and collection, and the sum appropriated to the viceregal household, appears to
                    have been, in 1833, 1,194,640 rixdollars, or L.89,598 sterling, besides that
                    derived from the mines and salt springs, which amounted to 117,000 rixdollars,
                    or L.8775 sterling. The remainder of the revenue is obtained by taxation of
                    various kinds, such as land, house, personal, and income taxes, by imposts on
                    beer and corn spirits, by stamps, and by a custom-duty on foreign goods. These
                    are the chief subjects of taxation, but there are some few of a smaller kind,
                    more troublesome than productive.</p>
                <p>The nett revenue now is found to produce as follows:</p>

                <p>The public debt consists in part of annuities, and in part of loans. The annual
                    interest, as is shown in the account of expenses, amounts to nearly one quarter
                    of these. It is, however, annually diminishing, by means of a sinking fund, <hi
                    rend="italic">tillgungo fond,</hi> the amount paid towards which is included in
                    the 1,306,400 rixdollars of the expenditure. It now amounts to 311,100
                    rixdollars, or nearly one quarter of the annual interest.</p>
                <p>In the expenditure of the ministry of the interior is comprehended the cost of
                    improving the roads, the dykes, and the navigable rivers. It has been well
                    expended, especially that on the roads, which have, within the last fifteen
                    years, from the worst become some of the best in any part of Europe.</p>
                <p>The military force of Hanover consists of an engineer and artillery corps, the
                    latter composed of two companies of horse and one of foot, a corps of riflemen,
                    a battalion of infantry, of which two are the guards and two light troops, and
                    four regiments of cavalry. The total number amounts to about twelve thousand
                    men, but many of them are indulged with furloughs, so that the whole expense of
                    the army, including the repairs of the fortifications, is very small. Hanover
                    has a single vessel of war moored in the Elbe to collect the dues on that
                    stream, and some small craft at the mouths of the Weser and of the Ems.</p>
                <p>The religious establishments of Hanover are the three Christian sects in
                    different parts. The Lutherans are the most numerous, comprehending 1,235,200
                    persons, having ten superintendents or bishops, and 924 clergymen. They have
                    also nine convents for men and eighteen for females, but the members of these
                    are not bound to celibacy. The tithes are commonly paid in kind, but some of
                    them have stipends from the government. The Catholics are about 200,000, having
                    one bishop, and 143 parish priests. The Reformed are about 100,000, and have 114
                    parish churches, and a minister to each. There are, besides, three Mennonite and
                    One Moravian congregation. The Jews are allowed the freest toleration as regards
                    their worship, but are excluded from some of the civil privileges. Their number
                    is about 12,000.</p>
                <p>The business of education is well attended to, and abundant means are supplied to
                    aid it, both by the government and the voluntary contributions of corporations
                    and individuals. The first establishment is the university of Göttingen, founded
                    by George II. in 1734. Its professors are scholars of great eminence in every
                    branch of science and literature, and in 1833 it contained 845 students. There
                    are, besides, five ecclesiastical seminaries, twenty-nine schools for the common
                    sciences, and sixteen gymnasiums or public classical schools; and each village
                    and town has the appropriate number of elementary schools, amounting to the
                    number of 3560. All are taught to read and to write, and the common rules of
                    arithmetic. There are also surgical and medical schools, hospitals for
                    midwifery, and a good veterinary college. The freedom of the press is allowed to
                    the professors of the university, but all other writings must pass through a
                    very mild censorship; though of late, from the proceedings of the diet at
                    Frankfort, some restrictions have been enacted against the unlimited publication
                    of political newspapers, and other smaller works.</p>
                <p>The poor are provided for wholly by voluntary contributions, which are made from
                    house to house at stated periods. They are in a great degree supported in
                    workhouses, where their own labour contributes in some measure to their
                    maintenance. Their food and clothing are of the coarsest kind. There are many
                    hospitals and other charitable establishments for the relief and cure of the
                    diseased; and, upon the whole, the poor are as well taken care of as in other
                    countries where their maintenance is compulsory.</p>
                <p>The language usually spoken in Hanover is the Plat-Deutsche, a dialect of the
                    High German, more pure, and less complicated in its construction, but treated by
                    the learned with more contempt than it merits. As the service in the churches
                    and the instruction in the schools are exclusively in the High German, all the
                    peasantry understand it, though they never use it when they can avoid it. The
                    higher classes pride themselves in speaking the High German with greater purity
                    than is practised in any other part of the empire.</p>
                <p>Hanover has two standards of money, the Leipsiger and the convention. The public
                    accounts are kept in the latter. The gold coin called Georgs d’or is five
                    rixdollars eight groschen in convention money; or, in Leipsiger money, four
                    rixdollars sixteen groschen. The other gold coin, the Gold-Gulden, is two
                    rixdollars six groschen in convention, two dollars two groschen in Leipsiger
                    money.</p>
                <p>The long measure is the rood of eight ells; the ell is two feet; the foot twelve
                    inches. Six Hanoverian are equal to five Brabant ells. Land is measured by hufen
                    and morgens. The hufe is thirty morgens, the morgen 120 ruthen, equal to 24∙844
                    Paris feet. The morgen by which woodland is measured contains 160 ruthen. The
                    liquid measure is the cimen, ’ of 3∙136 cubic inches, or the anker of l∙960
                    cubic inches. The latter makes sixteen Stübchens or thirty-two kannen, and
                    sixty-four quartiere or 128 nosel. The weights in common use are shipspounds,
                    lies-pounds, hundreds, and customary pounds. The ships-pound is equal to twenty
                    lies-pounds; the hundred is 110 lies-pounds. The lies-pound is divided into two
                    marks, the mark into eight ounces, the ounce into two loths, the loth into four
                    quentins. The local weights and measures vary from these standards in all the
                    villages of the several provinces.</p>

                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Hanover,</hi> a city, the capital of the kingdom of the same
                    name, in Germany, as well as of the province of Kalenburg. It is built on an
                    extensive plain on the river Leine, which receives the waters of the Ihme, and
                    then becomes navigable to the Weser. The former walls, which were indefensible,
                    have been destroyed, and planted, and thus converted into pleasant promenades.
                    The city is divided into the old and the new town by the river. The former is
                    old, ill built, and dirty; the latter is much <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193640915" xml:id="kp-eb0711-0915-0140"/>, better, contains a fine
                    square, some good streets, and several handsome public and private buildings.
                    The most prominent of these are the palace of the Duke of Cambridge, the
                    theatre, and the house of assembly of the states. The royal library, containing
                    25,000 volumes, and the cabinet of natural history, are objects of attention.
                    The city contains seven Lutheran, two Reformed, and one Catholic church, with
                    2195 houses, and about 25,000 inhabitants. The chief trade is brewing beer, but
                    it has those kinds of manufactures which are naturally encouraged in the capital
                    of each kingdom, however small or poor. As the residence of a court, of an armed
                    force, of the legislature, the courts of justice, and of several of the
                    nobility, a great number of small tradesmen obtain subsistence by supplying
                    their wants. The trade by water consists chiefly in transmitting wood, and some
                    corn and flax, to Bremen, where it is shipped for markets at a distance. There
                    is, however, an exchange and a chamber of commerce, and some of the bankers are
                    considerable capitalists. It is situated in longitude 9. 39. 40. E. and latitude
                    52. 22. 18. N. Near the city is the royal palace of Hemhausen, with fine walks,
