                    a distinguished writer and physician at Paris, was born at Conac in 1757. His
                    father, John Baptistë Cabanis, was a lawyer of eminence, and chief magistrate of
                    a district in the Lower Limousin, highly respected for his extensive knowledge
                    and inflexible integrity, and entitled to the gratitude of his country for the
                    many improvements he has introduced in agriculture and farming. He brought the
                    culture of the vine to great perfection in his province, and introduced a mixed
                    breed of sheep, by crossing the Spanish with those of Limousin and Berri. France
                    is more particularly indebted to him, however, for the successful methods he
                    discovered of grafting fruit trees, and also for contributing to render more
                    general the use of the potato in the southern provinces. He was exceedingly
                    anxious that his son, the subject of the present article, and who had given
                    early indications of talent, should have the advantage of a learned education;
                    and he accordingly placed him, when only seven years old, under the tuition of a
                    neighbouring priest. It was remarked that, even at this early age, he had
                    acquired habits of steadiness and perseverance, from which, under proper
                    direction, the best results might be expected. At the age of ten he entered the
                    college of Brive, where the severity of discipline to which he was subjected had
                    an injurious effect upon his temper, and fostered that habitual impatience of
                    restraint which formed part of his character, and which afterwards so frequently
                    operated to interrupt his progress. When raised to the second class, he was
                    fortunate in meeting with a master whose kind treatment soon softened a
                    disposition which harshness only had rendered stubborn and intractable. He was
                    not only reconciled to study, but applied to it with the utmost diligence, and
                    became passionately fond of the great models of poetry and eloquence which were
                    put into his hands. At a later period, being again exposed to the rigorous
                    control of one of the. heads of the college, his spirit was once more roused; he
                    came to the determination oí provoking the anger of his master, and even
                    suffered himself to be accused of a fault of which he was innocent, in the hope
                    that he might get expelled. Persisting in this extraordinary mode of conduct, he
                    soon accomplished his object, and was sent back to his father. But far from
                    enjoying<pb break="no" facs="nls:193742983?mode=fullsize"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0705-2983-0763"/> any relaxation under the paternal roof, he now
                    found himself under a subjection still more rigorous and insupportable than that
                    from which he had managed to escape. Indignant at the yoke imposed upon him, he
                    relapsed into his habits of obstinacy, and would do nothing. After a year had
                    thus passed in sullenness, his father became sensible that other measures than
                    those of severity must be tried, and adopted the bold expedient of taking him to
                    Paris, and leaving him there, at the age of fourteen, without any restraint on
                    his actions, or even commissioning any one to superintend his conduct. The
                    experiment was hazardous in the extreme, but it was attended with complete
                    success. Young Cabanis no sooner felt himself at full liberty to do as he
                    pleased, than his love of literature revived, and he engaged with ardour in the
                    pursuit. He had formerly paid no attention to the lectures of his professors;
                    but he now, of his own accord, resumed those branches of his education in which
                    he had remained deficient, and prosecuted them with the same perseverance which
                    marked his character throughout. He devoted himself entirely to the cultivation
                    of his mind, and associated only with a few chosen companions of his own age,
                    who had a congenial taste for literature, and an equal desire of
                    improvement.</p>
                <p>Thus constantly occupied, two years passed away with a rapidity which astonished
                    him, when he received a letter from his father, offering him the place of
                    secretary to a Polish nobleman of high rank. He had now to choose between
                    accepting a situation, whi'ch, although it would totally interrupt his present
                    pursuits, might give him the power of resuming them at some future period, or
                    returning to his family, where he felt that all his exertions must be paralysed,
                    and his hopes blighted by neglect. He embraced, therefore, without hesitation,
                    the offer made to him, and, though only sixteen, committed himself into the
                    hands of strangers, in a distant country, which was represented to him as in a
                    state of barbarism. This was in 1773, the year during which that diet was
                    sitting which was to deliberate upon giving its sanction to the first partition
                    of Poland. The corrupt intrigues and compulsory measures which were practised on
                    that occasion gave him an insight into the affairs of the world peculiarly
                    revolting to a youthful and generous mind, and inspired him with a contempt for
                    mankind, and a degree of misanthropic gloom, which are generally the fruits of a
                    later experience of human depravity. He returned to Paris two years afterwards,
                    when Turgot, the friend of his father, was minister of finance. On being
                    presented to this statesman, he was received with kindness, and would soon have
                    been placed in a situation perfectly conformable to his tastes and wishes, had
                    not a court intrigue produced the sudden downfal of the minister.</p>
                <p>Thus the only fruits which he had gathered from his travels were the knowledge of
                    the German language, and a premature acquaintance with the world. He now felt
                    the necessity of making up for the time he had lost, and again applied to his
                    studies with his former ardour. His father, feeling it incumbent upon him to
                    second his efforts, secured to him the means of subsistence for two or three
                    years longer, which was all that Cabanis desired. He had contracted a friendship
                    with the poet Roucher, who possessed some celebrity. This connection rekindled
                    his taste for poetry; and the French Academy having proposed as a prize subject
                    the translation of a passage in the <hi rend="italic">Iliad,</hi> he not only
                    ventured to appear as competitor, but set about translating the entire poem. The
                    two specimens which he sent to the Academy did not obtain any public notice, but
                    they were judged of favourably by several persons of taste; and some other
                    fragments that were published among the notes to the poem <hi rend="italic">Des
                    Mois,</hi> met with general approbation. He received the approbation of those
                    critics who were the dispensers of literary fame in Paris, and was introduced at
                    once into a large circle of acquaintance, where he was everywhere greeted with
                    acclamation. He was soon, however, sensible of the emptiness of these applauses;
                    and, dissatisfied with successes that offered no prospect of solid advantage,
                    he^sunk into a state of melancholy, which, together with his excessive
                    application to study, began visibly to prcy upon his constitution. His father
                    now urged him to choose a useful profession, and he at length decided for that
                    of medicine, which, embracing such various objects of study, presented an ample
                    field for the exertions of his active mind, while it necessitated that degree of
                    bodily exercise which had become so necessary for the preservation of his
                    health. Dubreuil, whose counsels had had much influence with him in forming this
                    determination, offered to be his guide in the new and arduous career which he
                    was commencing. Cabanis continued for six years the pupil of this able master,
                    following his steps both in his hospital and private practice, and conducting
                    his studies conformably to his instructions. In 1789 he published <hi
                    rend="italic">Observations</hi><hi rend="italic">sur</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >les</hi><hi rend="italic">Hôpitaux,</hi> a work which procured him the
                    appointment of administrator of hospitals at Paris.</p>
                <p>His state of health, in the midst of his laborious professional exertions,
                    requiring occasional relaxation in the country, he fixed upon Auteuil, in the
                    immediate vicinity of Paris, as his place of residence. It was there that he
                    became acquainted with the widow of Helvetius, and ever after cherished for that
                    excellent woman the affection of a son, as she, on her part, fulfilled towards
                    him the duties of the kindest mother. He spent all his leisure hours in her
                    society, and profited by the opportunity her house afforded him of cultivating
                    the acquaintance of the most distinguished literary men of that period. He
                    continued his intercourse with Turgot; was on terms of intimacy with Condillac,
                    Thomas, and D’Alembert; and acquired the friendship of Holbach, Franklin, and
                    Jefferson. During the last visit which Voltaire made to Paris, Cabanis was
                    presented to him by Turgot, and read to him part of his translation of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Iliad,</hi> which that acute critic, though old, infirm, and
                    fatigued with his journey, listened to with great interest, and bestowed much
                    commendation on the talents of the author. Cabanis had now, however, long ceased
                    to occupy himself with that work; and, fully engaged with the studies and duties
                    of his profession, had renounced the cultivation of letters. He even bade a
                    formal adieu to poetry in his <hi rend="italic">Serment</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >dun Médecin,</hi> which appeared in 1789, and is a free imitation of the Greek
                    of Hippocrates, but is more remarkable as exhibiting the author in the light of
                    a zealous friend to liberty. Political interests were now, indeed, beginning to
                    engross the general attention; and the muses were deserted amidst the
                    contentions of parties, the din of arms, and the various anxieties and passions
                    which were called into play during this eventful period. Cabanis espoused with
                    enthusiasm the cause of the revolution, to which he was attached from principle,
                    and of which the opening prospects were so congenial to his active and ardent
                    mind. But, however hc may have shared in the intoxication which seized its early
                    partizans, it is certain that he had no participation in the criminal excesses
                    which followed, and which have left so indelible a stain upon the history of
                    those times.</p>
                <p>During the two last years of Mirabeau’s life he was intimately connected with
                    that extraordinary man, who had the singular art of pressing into his service
                    the pens of all his literary friends, whom he engaged to furnish him with their
                    ideas, in writing, on the political topics of the day, that he might afterwards
                    combine them as he chose, and adopt them as his own. Cabanis united himself with
                    this <pb break="no" facs="nls:193742996?mode=fullsize"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0705-2996-0764"/> disinterested association of labourers, and
                    contributed the <hi rend="italic">Travail</hi><hi rend="italic">sur</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">l'Education Publiqzιe</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> a tract which
                    was found among the papers of Mirabeau at his death, and was edited by the real
                    author soon afterwards in 1791. During the illness which terminated his life,
                    Mirabeau confided himself entirely to the professional skill of Cabanis; and,
                    though repeatedly and strongly urged, as his danger increased, to have further
                    medical assistance, constantly refused to have recourse to any other advice. Of
                    the progress of the malady, and the circumstances attending the death of
                    Mirabeau, Cabanis has drawn up a very detailed narrative, which, whatever proof
                    it may afford of the warmth of his friendship for his patient, is not calculated
                    to impress us with any high idea of his skill in the treatment of an acute
                    inflammatory disease.</p>
                <p>Condorcet was another distinguished character with whom Cabanis was on terms of
                    intimacy. The calamitous events of the revolution, and the relentless
                    persecution which the former was suffering from the party which had gained the
                    ascendency, tended only to unite them still more closely in the ties of
                    friendship; and Cabanis exerted every means in his power to avert his impending
                    fate. But all his efforts were unavailing; and he had only the melancholy
                    consolation of preserving the last writings of his unfortunate friend, and of
                    collecting his dying wishes relative to his wife and children. Soon after this
                    event he married Charlotte Grouchy, sister to Madame Condorcet and to General
                    Grouchy, a union which was a great source of happiness to him during the
                    remainder of his life.</p>
                <p>After the subversion of the government of the terrorists, Cabanis, on the
                    establishment of central schools, was named professor of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Hygiene,</hi> in the medical schools of the metropolis. He was chosen member of
                    the National Institute the next year, and on the following was appointed
                    clinical professor. He was afterwards member of the Council of Five Hundred, and
                    then of the Conservative Senate. The dissolution of the Directory was the result
                    of a motion which he made to that effect. But his political career wa⅛∙not of
                    long continuance. He was profoundly affected at the turn which the affairs of
                    his country were taking, so unfavourable to the cause of liberty, and so
                    dispiriting to the friends of humanity; and the latter years of his life were,
                    in consequence, deeply tinctured with melancholy. A foe to tyranny in every
                    shape, he was decidedly hostile to the policy of Bonaparte, and had constantly
                    rejected all his solicitations to accept of a place under his government.</p>
                <p>For some years before his death, his health became gradually more impaired, in
                    consequence of the exertions and anxieties he had undergone; and, in the spring
                    of 1807, he had a slight apoplectic attack, from which he soon recovered. He,
                    however, took the warning that was thus given him, and retired from the
                    laborious duties of his profession, spending the greatest part of his time at
                    the chateau of his father-in-law at Meulan, about thirty miles from Paris. Here
                    he again solaced himself with reading his favourite poets, and even had it in
                    contemplation to resume his translation of the <hi rend="italic">Iliad,</hi>
                    which had been the first effort of his youthful muse. The rest of his time was
                    devoted to kindness and beneficence, especially towards the poor, who flocked
                    from all parts to consult him on their complaints. Increasing infirmity now made
                    him sensible that his life was drawing near to a close; and he was fond of
                    conversing on the subject of his approaching end, an event which he always
                    contemplated with perfect serenity of mind. A more complete attack of his
                    disorder at length carried him off’ on the 5th of May 1808, when he had attained
                    his fifty-second year. He left a widow and a daughter to lament the loss of one
                    who united to the ornaments of a highly cultivated mind the greatest sensibility
                    and benevolence of heart.</p>
                <p>Besides the tracts already mentioned, he was author of several other works. The
                    only one among them which is purely of a literary nature is the <hi
                    rend="italic">Mélanges de Literature</hi><hi rend="italic">Allemande, ou Choix
                    de Traductions de l'Allemande,</hi> &amp;c. Paris, 8vo, 1797. It is dedicated to
                    Madame Helvetius, and consists of translations of different works of Meisner, of

                    and his <hi rend="italic">Journal</hi><hi rend="italic">de la Maladie et de la
