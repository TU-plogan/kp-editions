                <p><label type="entry">CAIRO, or <hi rend="smallcaps">Grand Cairo</hi></label>, the
                    capital of Egypt, situated in a plain at the foot of a mountain, in long. 32. 0.
                    E. lat. 30. 0. N. It was founded by Jawhar, a Moggrebin general, in the middle
                    of the tenth century. He gave his new city the name of <hi rend="italic">Al
                    Kahira,</hi> or the <hi rend="italic">Victorious.</hi> It became the residence
                    of the caliphs of Egypt, and of consequence the capital of that country, which
                    it häs ever since continued to be. It is divided into the new and old cities.
                    Old Cairo, on the eastern bank of the Nile, is now almost uninhabited. The new
                    city, which is properly Cairo, is seated in a sandy plain about two miles and a
                    half from the old city, and on the same side of the river. It is extended along
                    the mountain on which the castle is built, having been removed hither, it is
                    supposed, in order to bc under its protection. Bulac may be called the port of
                    Cairo, for it stands on the bank of the Nile, and all the grain and other
                    commoditieá destined for Cairo are landed there. Some travellers have assigned
                    to Cairo a most enormous magnitude, by taking in the old city and Bulac along
                    with the new; the real circumference of the latter, however, is not above ten
                    miles, but it is extremely populous. The first thing that strikes a traveller is
                    the narrowness of the streets, and the gloomy appearance of the houses, built of
                    mud walls, without any exterior window's. Besides, as the strccts are unpaved,
                    and always full of people, walking is very inconvenient, especially to
                    strangers. The number of the inhabitants has never been ascertained with any
                    precision. Volney thinks it may amount to 200,000; but some later ‘travellers
                    estimate it as high as 300,000 or 400,000. The houses are from one to two or
                    three stories in height, and flat at the top, where the inhabitants take the
                    air, and often sleep all night. Those of the more wealthy have a court in the
                    inside; but the poorer classes reside in very little space.</p>
                <p>There is a canal, called <hi rend="italic">hhalis,</hi> derived from the Nile,
                    which runs along the city from one end to the other, with houses on either side,
                    which makes a large street. It forms in its progress several small lakes, which
                    are called <hi rend="italic">birks</hi> in the language of the country. The
                    principal of these, which is in the great square near the castle, is five
                    hundred paces in diameter. The most elegant houses in the city are built on its
                    banks; but being filled from the inundation of the Nile, it contains water only
                    for a few months of the year, and during the others it appears covered with a
                    charming verdure. When there is water sufficient, it is always full of gilded
                    boats, barges, and barks, in which people of rank amusc themselves by sailing,
                    especially in the evenings, at which time there are curious fire-works, and a
                    variety of music.</p>
                <p>New Cairo is surrounded with stone walls, on which are handsome battlements; and
                    at the distance of every hundred paces there are very fine towers. The walls
                    were never very lofty, and are in many places gone to ruin. The foιtιfied palace
                    built by Saladin seven hundred years ago, on part of the famous mountain
                    Mokattan, is the only place of defence in Cairo; arid yet the Turks took no
                    notice of its falling, insomuch that it was becoming a heap of rubbish, till the
                    present pasha gave it a thorough repair. The principal apartment in it was a
                    magnificent hall, environed with twelve columns of granite, brought from the
                    ruins of Alexandria, of a prodigious height and thickness, which sustained an
                    open dome, under which Saladin distributed justice to his subjects; but in the
                    repairs made upon the edifice it was judged necessary to demolish this part of
                    it. From the palace the whole city of Cairo may be seen, and above thirty miles
                    along the Nile, with the fruitful plains that lie near it, as well as the
                    mosques, pyramids, villages, and gardens, with which these fields are covered.
                    The present pasha, however, no longer resides there, but has removed to a still
                    more splendid palace, which he has reared in the vicinity. It contains a
                    pavilion two hundred and fifty feet by two hundred, each wall of which is
                    adorned with colonnades of white marble. The pasha has founded a military
                    college and other institutions, with the view of introducing European arts and
                    improvements. The gates of Cairo are three, which are very magnificent. There
                    are about three hundred public mosques in the city, some of which have six
                    minarets. That of Sultan Hassan is the finest structure in modern Egypt, and is
                    extremely light and clegant. There is in the neighbourhood an extensive
                    necropolis, containing many splendid tombs, particularly one built by the pasha
                    for his family, adorned with five spacious domes. The khans or caravanserais are
                    numerous and large, with a court in the middle, like the houses of the people.
                    Some of them are several stories high, and are always full of people and
                    merchandise. Cairo is a great centre of the trade of interior Africa; and
                    caravans at short intervals depart from it for Fezzan, Darfur, and other
                    quarters. The slave market of Cairo exhibits natives brought from almost every
                    region of that great continent.</p>
                <p>Old Cairo has scarcely any thing remarkable except the granaries of Joseph; which
                    are merely a high wall, lately built, including a square spot of ground where
                    the owners of land deposit wheat, barley, and other grain, as tribute to the
                    pasha. There is likewise a tolerably handsome church, which is made use of by
                    the Copts, who are Christians, and the original inhabitants of Egypt. Over
                    against old Cairo there is an apartment built above the river, into which the
                    water is admitted, and a column, which has lines at the distance of every inch,
                    marks at every two feet as far as thirty. When the water rises to twenty-two
                    feet, it is thought to be of a sufficient height; when it rises much higher, it
                    becomes very injurious. There is much pomp and ceremony used in letting the
                    water into the khalis or canal which leads to Cairo. Joseph’s well is in the
                    fortified palace, and was made by King Mohammed about 700 years ago. It is so
                    called, because the Egyptians attribute every thing extraordinary to that
                    remarkable person. It is cut in a rock, and is two hundred and eighty feet in
                    depth. The water is drawn up to the top by means of oxen, placed on platforms at
                    proper distances, which turn about the machines that raise it. The descent is so
                    sloping, that, though there are no steps, the oxen can descend and ascend with
                    ease. The inhabitants of Cairo are a mixture of Moors, Turks, Jews, Greeks, and
                    Copts.</p>
