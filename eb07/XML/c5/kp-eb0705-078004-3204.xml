                    significant corrections to the OCR text, predominantly in cases of confusing "c"
                    and "e." Isolates 90 entries that were mistakenly included at the end of prior
                    entries in v1 and v2. Normalizes ordinal numbers. Separates metadata in
                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra
                    space around the <gi>pb</gi> tag. Where a word is hyphenated at a <gi>pb</gi>,

                <p><label type="entry">CAITHNESS</label> is the most northern county of Scotland. It
                    is bounded on the north by the Pentland Frith, which separates it from the
                    Orkney Islands; on the east and south-east by the Moray Frith; on the south and
                    southwest by Sutherlandshire; and on the west by the Northern Ocean. A chain of
                    hills, commencing on the east at the Ord, runs along the division between
                    Sutherland and it. One of these, Morven, rises to an elevation of 1929 feet. The
                    Burn of the Ord forms the true boundary between the two counties on the east
                    side; and a line drawn across the hill of Drumholłiston, on the east of the
                    river Halladałe, constitutes that on the west coast. The form of the county is
                    an irregular triangle, measuring along the eastern coast from Duncansbay-head to
                    the Ord about forty miles, and from Duncansbay-head along the northern shore to
                    Bighouse on the west, about thirty-five miles. No accurate map of the county has
                    yet been constructed; but it is supposed∙to contain about 650 square miles.
                    There are ten parishes of very unequal extent, the least being four miles long
                    and two broad; the largest twenty-seven miles by ten or twelve. The coast nearly
                    along the whole line is rocky and precipitous, with deep water to the edge of
                    the rock, and at Dunnet-head it rises to the height of 340 feet. It is
                    remarkable for a number of bold headlands. The principal of these are
                    Sandside-head on the west; Holburn-head, Dunnet-head, Duncansbay-head,
                    Noss-head, and Clythness. Dunnet-head is the most northerly land on the
                    mainland, lying in long. 3. 29. E. and lat. 58. 42. N. Near Duncansbay-head lies
                    John o’ Groat’s, commonly considered the most northern point; but it is two
                    miles farther south than Dunnet-head.</p>
                <p>There are several bays along the coast. Sandside Bay lies on the east of the head
                    of that name. It is open, and not safe for shipping in particular winds. On the
                    east of Holburn-head, and sheltered by it, lies Thurso Bay, having Scrabster
                    roadstead close to the head, affording the most secure anchorage on a stiff blue
                    clay bank sloping outwards. Dunnet Bay is much exposed to the north, and
                    dangerous for shipping, being often mistaken for the entrance to the frith; the
                    low sands lying at its bottom not being observable in a dark night till close at
                    hand. Last year a light-house was finished on Dunnet-head, by which this danger
                    is obviated. The light stands 346 feet above the sea. Riess Bay, or Sinclair’s
                    Bay, bounded on the east by Noss-head, is also an exposed bay from the
                    north-east; but in certain winds it affords good anchorage. Wick Bay, at the
                    bottom of which stands the town of that name, is small, and very unsafe with the
                    wind high from the east and south-east, a heavy sea then rolling in. The tide in
                    the Pentland Frith runs, at spring tides, at the rate of nine miles an hour;
                    and, when opposed by a strong wind, raises a very heavy sea. Within two miles of
                    the shore, off Duncansbay, lies the island of Stroma, about a mile long, round
                    which the tides form several eddies. Off the point of Mey, a few miles farther
                    west, there is an eddy of considerable strength, called the Merry Men of Mey,
                    into which boats are sometimes in danger of being drawn. The navigation of the
                    frith requires the aid of a pilot, unless the crew of the ship are well
                    acquainted with it.</p>
                <p>The county is generally level, or swelling into slight elevations, with very few
                    hills, which are chiefly on the west side. It is well watered with rivers,
                    brooks, and lochs, and seldom suffers from drought. The climate is variable. On
                    an average of eight years, the number of days of more or less rain in each month
                    is as follows: Jan. Feb. March. April. May. June. July. Aug. Sept. Oct. Nov.
                    Dec. 14 12 15 15 15 16 19 19 16 19 16 17</p>
                <p>making for the whole year 193 days.</p>
                <p>The average of days with snow is as follows :—</p>
                <p>January. February. March. April. October. November. December.</p>
                <p>7⅜ 7 7⅜ 4 2 . 5 3⅜</p>
                <p>Instances of snow in May have occasionally occurred, as in May 1831, when there
                    were four days of snow and heavy wind, which destroyed the prospect of small
                    fruit.</p>
                <p>The average of days of frost stands thus:</p>
                <p>January· February. March. April. October. November. December.</p>
                <p>8 7⅜ 4⅜ 2 1 . 4⅜ 7⅜</p>
                <p>In the summer and harvest, frost frequently occurs at night. Rain, snow, and
                    frost, frequently occur on the same day during the winter.</p>
                <p>The range of the barometer is .very extensive, sometimes two inches and more; yet
                    the climate is in general healthy. The soil is various, from black and clay loam
                    to light sandy, in general yielding abundant crops of oats and bear, of which
                    large quantities are exported. Wheat is also grown, but in small quantities, and
                    also peas and beans. The subsoil is almost throughout clay upon clay slate rock.
                    Whinstone and sandstone also occur. Dunnet and Duncansbay-heads are composed of
                    rough sandstone of a red colour. A white sandstone is found in abundance in the
                    interior of Dunnet-head, and in other places on the coast of the Pentland Frith.
                    Granite is found in mass in the Berridale Hills. A good deal of an inferior
                    limestone also occurs, and shell marl in great abundance. Traces of various
                    metallic minerals have been found. A lead vein was discovered at Skinnet, near
                    Thurso, and copper at Old Wick, near Wick, but neither was of any value.
                    Bog-iron also occurs.</p>
                <p>Great numbers of black cattle are reared for home use and sale. Many thousands
                    were annually sent south, but of late years the demand has been very dull. A
                    curious kind of traffic exists between the Caithness and Orkney people. Annually
                    a number of colts, one or two years old, are sent into the islands, which return
                    a proportional number of horses from five to eight years old. This practice has
                    existed from time immemorial.</p>
                <p>There are few trees in the county; but experience has shown that they would
                    thrive if proper care were employed to protect them when young. The trunks of
                    large trees are often found in the mosses which abound in this county, and which
                    yield the chief part of the fuel used by the people. Coals, principally English,
                    are also now much in use. Partridges, hares, rabbits, grouse, plovers, &amp;c.
                    <pb break="no" facs="nls:193743217" xml:id="kp-eb0705-3217-0781"/>abound; and
                    there are some black-cock around Berridalc and Langwell. Formerly great flocks
                    of a bird larger than the sparrow, called the snow-fowl, visited this county in
                    the winter season; but for some years past they have scarcely been seen. The
                    rocks are frequented by eagles, hawks, and a variety of sea-fowl, which breed in
                    great numbers.</p>
                <p>The rivers and lochs afford trout, salmon, and cels; and the sea yields abundance
                    of cod, haddocks, and other kinds of fish. The salmon fishery is not now so
                    successful as formerly. The herring fishery has of late years been very
                    prosperous. Wick is the principal station. On an average of eleven years ending
                    in 1830, there have been caught 100,000 barrels annually. There were 134 curers,
                    employing 736 boats, 3564 fishers, 384 coopers, 239 labourers, and 2455 women.
                    In 1830 about 153,000 barrels were taken. But the fishing of 1831 was not so
                    productive. The quantity caught at other stations along the coast may amount to
                    40,000 or 50,000 more.</p>
                <p>The population amounted at last census (1831) to 34,500, including Wick,
                    Pulteneytown, and Thurso. In 1801 it was 22,609. The people are hardy and
                    industrious. Their condition as cultivators of the ground has materially
                    improved within the last forty years. Formerly they were oppressed with the
                    exaction of personal services by the landlords. These consisted of labour on the
                    lands in the natural possession of the proprietors, ploughing, sowing, cutting,
                    and gathering in the crops; furnishing straw, fuel, fowls, eggs, &amp;c.;
                    shipping grain, and other services, which are now almost entirely abolished, and
                    money payments substituted. Still they labour under several disadvantages, the
                    principal of which are want of leases and too high rents. In general the rents,
                    especially on the coast, are high; nor could the tenants pay them, but for their
                    traffic in cattle, and the herring fishery. The improvement in agriculture has
                    been very great within the last forty years. At the beginning of that period
                    artificial or sown grasses and turnips were commodities possessed by few; now
                    both are common, and their value is duly appreciated. A regular system of
                    rotation of crops is pursued on all farms of any size; and the breed of working
                    horses is greatly improved. The real rent of the county, which has increased to
                    nearly one half within the last thirty years, exceeds L.61,000. On some estates
                    the rents arc payable partly in money, partly in meal and bear.</p>
                <p>Wick is the head burgh of the shire. It was erected into a royal burgh in 1589,
                    in favour of the Earl of Caithness. But the superiority came into the possession
                    of Sir John Sinclair, and was lately purchased by the Marquis of Stafford.
                    Including Louisburgh, it contains 2269 inhabitants, and perhaps has made more
                    rapid advances in improvement and extent of trade within the last twenty years
                    than any other place of the same size in the empire. In the foreign trade of
                    last year (1831) fifty vessels and 4072 tons of shipping were employed, while in
                    the coasting trade there have been generally about 500 vessels and 35,000 tons
                    likewise annually engaged. The chief imports are timber, hemp, iron, and tar,
                    while the exports consist chiefly of fish.</p>
                <p>The settlement of Pulteneytown, on the south side of the river of Wick, has
                    sprung up entirely from the herring fishery. The first house was built only
                    twenty-two years since, and now the town contains 2845 inhabitants, lhe ground
                    was purchased from Lord Duffus, then Sir B. Dunbar, by the British Fishery
                    Society, who derive a large income from the feu-duties, and the harbour dues of
                    a large and secure port, lately completed at an expense of L. 40,000.</p>
                <p>The town of Thurso is of great an tiquity, and was erected into a burgh of barony
                    in 1633. It has 2364 inhabitants.</p>
                <p>The antiquities of this county consist of old castles and Picts’ cairns. The
                    former are nearly all on the coast, and on bold projecting points. The ruins of
                    Castle Sinclair, anciently called Girncgo, the residence of the earls, arc
                    situated on a tongue of lofty rock on the west side of Noss-head, and within
                    Riess Bay. The castle of Kiess stands on the opposite side of the bay. The
                    castle of Old Wick, to the south of the town, is known to mariners as the Old
                    Man of Wick, and is a noted land-mark. Thp Bishop of Caithness, whose see
                    included Sutherland, had a castle at Scrabster, a short distance west of Thurso.
                    There are ruins of castles also at Forse, Latheron, and Berridalc, and in the
                    interior at Braal, Dirlet, and Loch-more, along the river Thurso. The only
                    habitable castles are those of Mey, Ackergill, and Dunbeath.</p>
                <p>The Picts’ cairns are scattered over the face of the country, generally on the
                    slopes of rising grounds. They are very numerous, and it has been remarked that
                    Biere are at least three always in sight of one another. They were probably the
                    houses of the richer inhabitants, the lower classes lodging in more perishable
                    huts of turf, as many of them still do.</p>
                <p>The names of places arc generally of Danish origin; and a number of them end in
                    <hi rend="italic">ster&gt;</hi> which signifies a station or estate. The
                    language spoken by the people is the same as that of the south of Scotland,
                    except in the parts bordering on Sutherland, where Gaelic is still in use,
                    though giving place to English.</p>
                <p>The ancient history of this county is, as might be expected, very obscure. What
                    is known of it is little more than a record of petty quarrels, strifes,
                    robberies, and bloodshed, as in other parts of Scotland in the same times.</p>
                <p>The aborigines were the Picts, who were subdued and their possessions seized by
                    the Norwegians, a kindred race, in the beginning of the tenth century. At the
                    same time they took possession of the Orkneys. Their chiefs, under the title of
                    lari or Earl, ruled Caithness and Orkney down to the beginning of the fourteenth
                    century, when the direct line ceased in the person of Magnus. For a century the
                    succession was unsettled and disputed. In 1456 the first of the family of
                    Sinclair became earl. In the end of the seventeenth century the property of the
                    earldom was alienated, and acquired by Glenorchy, afterwards Lord Breadalbane,
                    who sold it to various persons; so that the present family succeeded to nothing
                    but the title.</p>
                <p>The county formerly sent a representative to Parliament alternately with Bute.
                    But under the alteration which has just been made on the representation of
                    Scotland, it will have a representative for itself, to which indeed it is well
                    entitled from its population and rapid increase in importance.</p>
                <p>Great improvements have been made in the county since the money wisely
                    appropriated by government from the price of the forfeited estates has been
                    expended in the Highlands in making roads and bridges. By that appropriation the
                    recesses of the north have been opened up, and communication with the other end
                    of the island rendered easy; the mail-coach now travelling through tracts where
                    a Highland pony, twenty years ago, could only make his way. Valuable tracts of
                    land have in consequence been brought into a state of high cultivation, and lime
                    from Sunderland conveyed into the interior for that purpose. An impulse has been
                    given to the spirit of improvement; and so much has the benefit arising from
                    roads been valued by the inhabitants of this northern county, that the
                    proprietors and tenants have lately procured an act of parliament for assessing
                    themselves for the price of making 180 miles of additional roads. By this
                    public-spirited measure great benefits must ere long arise to <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193743230" xml:id="kp-eb0705-3230-0782"/>the district; and within a
                    short period, it is not doubted that fine fields and modern farm-steadings will
                    be seen in districts at present comparatively uncultivated and unknown.</p>
