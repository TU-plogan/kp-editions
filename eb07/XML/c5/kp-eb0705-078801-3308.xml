                <p><label type="entry">CALCUTTA</label>, one of the largest and most splendid cities
                    of Asia, the modern capital of Hindustan, and the seat of the supreme government
                    of the British in India. It is situated upon the river Hooghly, which forms the
                    western channel of the Ganges, and, though not the principal, is the only one of
                    its numerous branches which is navigable for large vessels. It stands on an
                    almost perfect level of alluvial and marshy ground, which a century ago was
                    covered with jungle and stagnant pools, and which still almost everywhere
                    betrays its unsoundness by the cracks conspicuous in the best houses. The town
                    is 100 miles from the mouth of the river, the navigation of which is difficult,
                    and often dangerous, on account of its numerous sand banks, many of which are
                    continually shifting their situation. Vessels drawing more than seventeen feet
                    water cannot, except at spring-tides, ascend with safety above Diamond Harbour,
                    where the vessels of the East India Company usually load and unload. This is
                    about sixty miles below Calcutta; and passengers are conveyed to the city in
                    smaller vessels or in boats. The country, from the mouth of the Hooghly to
                    Diamond Harbour, is dreary in the extreme; the banks of the river are high, and
                    the adjacent land on each side, which is perfectly flat, forms a complete
                    wilderness of timber and brushwood, the haunt of tigers, and of other beasts of
                    prey. Advancing up the river, the scene gradually improves; the country becomes
                    more and more cultivated; the shipping and the bustle on the river increase; and
                    the beautiful country-seats on its banks announce the approach to the capital.
                    The city, with its numerous spires and other public edifices, presents, at a
                    distance, a striking appearance; and, on landing, the magnificence of the
                    buildings commands the admiration of all strangers. The town and suburbs extend
                    along the left or eastern bank of the river above six miles, but varying much in
                    breadth at different places. In the middle of it, and very near the landing
                    place, is an immense square, each side of which extends above a quarter of a
                    mile; and the centre is occupied by a large tank or open reservoir of water for
                    the supply of the town. This square, together with the adjacent buildings and
                    those towards the south, forms what is properly termed the town of Calcutta, the
                    residence of the European inhabitants and of the natives of distinction. To the
                    south, along the bank of the river, lies the Black Town, which is occupied
                    entirely by the lower classes of inhabitants, and is rather considered as part
                    of the suburbs; and about a quarter of a mile to the north stand Fort-William
                    and the barracks, which form on this side a great ornament to the city. The
                    intermediate space, which is an extensive open plain, is termed the esplanade.
                    The citadel of Fort-William, which was begun by Lord Clive in 1757, after the
                    battle of Plasscy, is the strongest and most regular fortress in India; but the
                    works are so extensive that they would require at least 9000 or 10,000 men, with
                    600 pieces of cannon, to defend them. On the west of the esplanade stands the
                    government-house, built by the Marquis Wellesley, which is the largest and most
                    splendid building in Calcutta. It is the residence of the governor-general,
                    where he holds levees, and transacts all the government business; it also
                    contains magnificent apartments for public entertainments. The other public
                    buildings are a town-house, with public rooms, which, though handsome, are too
                    confined for the climate and for the number of the inhabitants; a court of
                    justice, the hospital, and jail, which are situated on the esplanade; two
                    English churches, the one of which is a plain building, but the other has an
                    elegant appearance; a Scottish church; also churches for the Portuguese
                    Catholics; another for those of the Greek persuasion, an Arminian church, many
                    small Hindu pagodas, Mahommedan mosques, and a Sikk temple. All these various
                    religions here enjoy the most perfect toleration.</p>
                <p>The custom-house faces the river, and forms part of the west side of the great
                    square. It is built upon the site of the old fort, which was taken in 1757 by
                    Surajah Dowlah. Near to it is the famous Black Hole, which is now converted into
                    a warehouse; and before the gate stands the monument which has been erected to
                    commemorate the unfortunate persons who perished there. It is surrounded by an
                    iron railing; but it has been struck with lightning, and has since been allowed
                    to go to decay. In front of the custom-house is the quay, which has been of
                    essential service to the numerous shipping which there load and unload. On the
                    west side of the river, and in a beautiful situation, stands the botanic garden,
                    at a bend to which it gives the name of Garden Reach. It contains a splendid
                    collection of plants from every quarter of the globe, and is laid out with great
                    taste, but more with a view to practical utility than scientific arrangement.
                    Above the garden there is an extensive plantation of teak. Horse-racing having
                    been discouraged by government, the course, which was to the south of the town,
                    is now converted into a ride; but the practice still continues at Barrackpore,
                    sixteen miles up the river, where the fashionable society of Calcutta assemble
                    to partake of the amusement. The south side of the great square is occupied by
                    the writers’ buildings, which make but an indifferent appearance. They form the
                    residence of this class of the Company’s servants who are newly arrived from
                    Europe, and who are students at the college of Fort-William. The private houses
                    in Calcutta, in the central or genteel part of the town, are built mostly after
                    the European fashion, but modified to the nature of the climate and to the
                    magnificence of eastern manners. In a line with the government-house is a <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193743321" xml:id="kp-eb0705-3321-0789"/> range of elegant
                    buildings, ornamented with large verandahs, and another, at right angles with
                    it, called Chourin-gee, formerly occupied by native huts. These houses are built
                    of brick, covered with a species of stucco called chunam. They are all separated
                    from each other, every one having attached to it a considerable piece of
                    inclosed ground, in the middle of which it is situated. The approach is by a
                    flight of steps under a large portico The architecture is Grecian, and the
                    profusion of columns, porticos, and verandahs, gives them more the air of
                    palaces than of private houses. To this part of Calcutta the Black Town, which
                    extends along the river to the north of Calcutta, forms a striking contrast. It
                    is built after the model of Indian towns, is very large, and swarming with
                    population. The streets are exceedingly narrow, crooked, and dirty, and are all
                    unpaved, with numerous ponds, reservoirs, and gardens, interspersed. A few of
                    the streets are paved with brick. The houses are built, some of brick, above two
                    stories high; but the great majority are built of bamboos and mats, only one
                    story high, and covered with thatch; all which different kinds of fabrics
                    standing intermixed present a very uncouth appearance. The houses being for the
                    most part formed of such combustible materials, fires arc common, and have often
                    proved very destructive. Within these thirty or forty years, however, this
                    quarter of the town has been greatly improved both in appearance and in the
                    salubrity of the air; the streets have been widened and properly drained, and
                    the ponds have been filled; a large surface of stagnant water has been thereby
                    removed, the exhalations from which were prejudicial to health; and the houses
                    have been rendered less combustible, by being tiled in place of thatched.</p>
                <p>Though building materials are abundant in the neighbourhood of Calcutta,
                    house-rent is not moderate. This is owing partly to the high interest of money,
                    and partly to the constant repairs which are required, from the casting of the
                    wood in this hot climate, and from the ravages of insects, particularly the
                    white ants. Though the woodwork of a house appear externally quite sound, it
                    often turns out upon examination to be completely excavated or honeycombed by
                    these insects, which assemble in incredible numbers wherever they can find an
                    entrance.</p>
                <p>The houses here which are known under the name of taverns are greatly inferior in
                    respectability to those in Europe. They are, with the exception of two or three
                    particular houses, resorted to only by the lowest company; and strangers who are
                    enticed into them are exposed to every species of imposition, and frequently to
                    total ruin. A European, on his first landing, is surrounded by numerous dangers
                    and inconveniences, which he finds it extremely difficult to escape. These are
                    so well described in the <hi rend="italic">East India Vade-Mecum,</hi> by
                    Captain Thomas Williamson, that we will extract the following passages for the
                    instruction of such of our countrymen as propose to visit those distant
                    regions.</p>
                <p>“The tavern-keeper, under the plausible pretext of aiding towards the completion
                    of the youth’s wishes, never fails to inquire whether the gentleman has any
                    friends in town, or even in the country. If affirmatively answered, ‘ mine host’
                    feels himself tolerably secure of his money; but will probably assert that the
                    friend in town is out of the way, and will not be back for some days. Should the
                    gentleman be totally destitute of friends, then comes the rich harvest.
                    Imposition following imposition swell the bill, which, if appearances warrant
                    forbearance, is kept back as long as possible, under the pleasing assurance of
                    perfect confidence; but in the end a catalogue of items is produced, which never
                    fails to alarm, if not to ruin, the unsuspecting victim!</p>
                <p>“If, unhappily, the guest should so far lower himself as to associate with the
                    ordinary company of the common drinking-room, he is irretrievably gone.
                    Quarrels, riots, and inebriety, must follow, in all probability rendering him

                    day; in general double that sum is charged; sp that a person starts at the rate
                    of L.1000 per annum at least; while, in all probability, no established or even
                    apparent provision exists whereby he may be maintained.</p>
                <p>“To state the evil without pointing out the remedy would be next to useless; but
                    when I suggest the means of avoiding those difficulties, or any portion of them,
                    attendant on arrival in a foreign land, it must be understood that I consider
                    the stranger to be possessed of pecuniary means; that is, that he can pay his
                    way. Without this he can do nothing, and must undergo all the afflictions and
                    miseries attendant upon despised poverty in every part of the globe. It may be
                    proper to point out in this place, that what might here appear to be liberal
                    calculations, would not suit the East, where every article of European
                    manufacture bears so enormous a price, where house-rent is so expensive, and
                    where it is indispensably necessary to retain so many servants. The first thing
                    to be done (setting a letter of recommendation out of the question) should be to
                    report arrival at the secretary’s office, depositing the certificate of the
                    court of directors’ license to proceed to India; without which the party is
                    considered as an alien, and scarcely considered as entitled to British
                    protection. This does not arise from ill will on the part of government or of
                    the inhabitants, but from that strict attention the politics of the country
                    imperiously demand to be paid to the several characters and descriptions of
                    persons residing within our territory.</p>
                <p>“The above relates equally to all persons in the civil or military branches; the
                    certificate granted at the India House must be produced, in order to identify
                    the party; but if it should have been lost, he himself, together with the
                    commander who received the order for taking him on board, must attendi to make
                    affidavit to that effect, before the appointment can be admitted upon the
                    registers in India.</p>
                <p>“Such as appertain to the civil service, being always strongly recommended, and
                    often finding many old acquaintances of their families on the spot, require but
                    little advice; nor does the cadet stand much in need of instruction as to the
                    manner in which he should provide himself with a home. All he has to do is to
                    wait upon the townmajor, at his office in Fort-William, when he will receive the
                    necessary order for his admission into the cadet corps at Baraset, about sixteen
                    miles from Calcutta.</p>
                <p>“He who has not these advantages must do the best his circumstances may afford;
                    he will find temperance to be not only cheap, but indispensable; for if he
                    should act so indiscreetly at the outset as to injure his health, a thousand
                    privations and a certain increase of difficulties must follow. The first point
                    must necessarily be to get under cover. This will not be found so easy as those
                    who have never quitted England may suppose. It will be after much research that
                    a small house will be had, and then only the bare walls; for no such thing is
                    known in India as a furnished bouse to be let; and lodgings are, if possible,
                    still more out of the question. Fortunately there are among the European
                    shopkeepers in Calcutta some most respectable characters,—men distinguished for
                    their urbanity, philanthropy, and generosity. Application should be instantly
                    made to one of these firms for aid and advice.</p>

                <p>The case should be candidly stated; and, in order to insure confidence, a deposit
                    of money should be made either with them or at one of the banks. The
                    consequences will be, that in a few hours some small tenement will be obtained,
                    either on hire or granted as a temporary accommodation; and the whole of the
                    articles really necessary will be provided at some one or other of the auctions
                    which daily take place within the central parts of the town.”</p>
                <p>Calcutta is the great emporium of the East. By means of the Ganges and its
                    tributary streams it has an uninterrupted water communication with the whole of
                    the north of Hindustan. There are three artificial canals by which the
                    communication is maintained with the upper country without passing through the
                    unhealthy and dangerous channel of the Sunderbunds. But this channel has never
                    yet been kept permanently open. The discovery of steam navigation has proved of
                    eminent utility on the Ganges. Steam packets now proceed up the river with
                    passengers, and effect a voyage in three weeks that used to occupy a⅛ many
                    months. Government steam vessels, some of them armed, also ply upon the river.
                    Calcutta, being so advantageously situated for commerce, trades extensively with
                    almost every country in the world, and numbers of vessels of every form and
                    description are constantly arriving in or departing from the river, which in the
                    vicinity of the town presents the busiest scene imaginable. Numerous dock-yards
                    have also been established, in which are built vessels of great burden and of
                    admirable construction. Piece goods, shawls, indigo, silk, sugar, opium, and
                    rum, are the staple commodities of export. Treasure is imported from all
                    quarters. From London, the imports consist principally of articles of
                    consumption for the European inhabitants, consisting of wine, porter, ale,
                    confectionaries, and generally of all the finer manufactures.</p>
                <p>In 1808 a bank was established at Calcutta, under the name of the Calcutta Bank.
                    Its capital amounts to fifty lacs of rupees, of which ten were subscribed by
                    government, and the remainder by individuals. There are besides three private
                    banks, and it is estimated that the paper circulation amounts to one crore of
                    rupees, or one million sterling. There are twelve insurance companies; and in
                    1825 there were published two daily newspapers, besides the Government Gazette
                    and the India Gazette twice a week, and one weekly paper. There were two native
                    weekly newspapers in Persian, and two in Bengalese, to which in 1826 another was
                    added.</p>
                <p>The institutions for education in Calcutta are numerous, of which the principal
                    are, the Madressa or Mahommedan college, founded in 1780, for the instruction of
                    the Mussulman youth in the Arabic and Persian languages, and in Mahommedan law;
                    the college of Fort William, begun in 1801, for instructing the public servants
                    of the Company in the native languages of the country, namely, the Hindustance,
                    Bengalee, Persian, and Arabic, now a flourishing and well-regulated institution,
                    in which, at the annual examinations, great proficiency is displayed by the
                    students; the Sanscrit College, for which a handsome building has been erected,
                    founded in 1821, for the instruction of the natives in the Sanscrit language and
                    Brahminical literature, and also in the English language and literature; the
                    Anglo-Indian College, established originally by respectable natives, chiefly for
                    the instruction of Hindu youths in the English language; Bishop’s College, for
                    the instruction of missionaries in the languages of the East; and a Medical
                    School for native doctors, established at Calcutta in 1822. In 1823 a committee
                    of public instruction was formed, who are authorized to exercise a
                    superintendence over all government seminaries, and to give an impulse, as well
                    as a judicious direction, to efforts made for diffusing instruction among the
                    Hindus. There are numerous missionary societies and institutions, with extensive
                    establishments for education,<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>-These are, the Calcutta Auxiliary Church Missionary

                    Distribution of Books and the Conversion of the Hindus, the Bengal Missionary
                    Society, the Baptist Missionary Society, an Auxiliary Bible Society,
                    &amp;c.</p></note> as well as various other schools and institutions, religious
                    and charitable. A free school has been established, which Bishop Heber terms a
                    noble institution, at which between 200 and 300 boys and girls are boarded,
                    besides day scholars. They are taught according to Dr Bell’s system. Some few of
                    the scholars are Arminian Christians, and there are one or two Hindus. There is
                    also the Armenian Academy and a grammar school for the instruction of the
                    Indo-British youth in classical literature. Under the patronage of a society of
                    European ladies, native schools were established in 1821, with female teachers.
                    Formerly no instance was ever known of an Indian female being instructed in
                    reading, writing, or sewing. In 1826, 600 female Hindu pupils were taught in the
                    various schools of Calcutta;<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    masters, and in which the parents of the boys pay for their education, the
                    number of pupils amounts to nearly 3000.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Asiatic Annual Register, vol. xix∙</p></note> There are two
                    schools for the education and maintenance of the children of Europeans in the
                    military service of the Company, one for the children of officers, and another
                    for those of the privates; and there are several literary and scientific
                    societies. The Asiatic Society still continues its sittings, and publishes its
                    Transactions, which contain much interesting information concerning the history,
                    literature, languages, and antiquities of Asia. The charitable institutions are
                    numerous, namely, the Bethel Union, the Seaman’s Friend Society, the Military
                    Orphan Society, the Military Widow’s Fund, Lord Clive’s Fund, the King’s
                    Military Fund, the Marine Pension Fund, the Civil Fund, the Mariner’s and

                <p>The supreme court consists of a chief justice and two puisne judges, all
                    nominated by the crown. Its jurisdiction extends to all British subjects in
                    India, and to all civil actions between natives, or between natives and
                    Europeans. Criminal cases are tried in this court by a jury consisting
                    exclusively of British subjects, as also all criminal charges against the
                    Company’s servants, and all civil actions in which the Company or any of its
                    servants are concerned; but it takes no cognizance of the land revenues. The law
                    practitioners attached to this court are fourteen attorneys and six
                    barristers.</p>
                <p>The population of Calcutta, which is stated by some to amount to 500,000, by
                    others to 700,000, is composed of persons from every quarter of the world.
                    British and other Europeans, Armenians, Persians, Chinese, Hindoos, and
                    Mahommedans, are all seen mixing in the streets of this metropolis. The
                    occupations of these various classes are nearly what might be expected in the
                    luxurious capital of a great empire, and in so great an emporium of maritime
                    commerce. Public officers, lawyers, physicians, merchants, and their families,
                    make up the bulk of the British inhabitants. The natives and foreigners of
                    respectability are mostly engaged in trade, or living upon their <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193743347" xml:id="kp-eb0705-3347-0791"/>property, and the lower
                    classes are principally composed of retail-dealers, mechanics, and servants.</p>
                <p>The most various estimates are given of the population of Calcutta; and it is
                    doubtful if there be any correct census. In 1752 the number of houses within the
                    Company’s bounds was estimated at 51,132, and the constant inhabitants at
                    409,056. In 1802 the police magistrates estimated the population at 600,000. In
                    1810 the chief judge Sir Henry Russel computed the population at between 400,000
                    and 500,000 inhabitants. In 1819 the School Society’s estimate amounted to
                    750,000; and in 1822 the following census was returned:</p>

                <p>From these different estimates it appeared to the magistrates that the resident
                    population might be estimated at 200,000, and those going and coming at 100,000;
                    and that the medium estimate of 300,000 would therefore be not far from the
                    truth.</p>
                <p>The British merchants form a most respectable class of men, and contribute
                    essentially to the prosperity of the settlement; many of them are possessed of
                    large fortunes, and live in a style of suitable splendour. The Armenians are the
                    most numerous body of foreign merchants in Calcutta. They trade extensively to
                    all parts of India and China, are uncommonly diligent and attentive to business,
                    and are considered to have the most minute intelligence from foreign ports of
                    any other body of merchants. The native bankers, agents, and money-dealers, are
                    numerous. Though formerly timorous, the Hindu now adventures in almost every
                    species of mercantile speculation; and cloths belonging to the native merchants,
                    to the amount of L.1,000,000 sterling, are generally lying for sale in the
                    warehouses of Calcutta. The native merchants of an inferior class engross nearly
                    the whole of the retail trade of Calcutta, under the titles of Banians, Sircars,
                    and Writers; and they are generally described as fond of money to excess, and
                    most unprincipled in all their dealings.</p>
                <p>The English society in Calcutta is of the best description, and numerous fêtes
                    are given during the cold season, which lasts from September to April, on a
                    splendid scale, by the governor-general and other public functionaries, as well
                    as by individuals. There are public subscription assemblies, besides select
                    evening parties under the name of conversaziones, enlivened by music, dancing,
                    cards, and other amusements. There is a theatre, supported by amateur
                    performers; and public concerts are given, which are also supported by amateur
                    talent. The usual mode of visiting is in palanquins. But many of the British
                    have carriages adapted to the climate; and the breed of horses having been
                    greatly improved, it is the universal practice to drive out between sunset and
                    dinner; and as it becomes dark, servants go out with torches and meet their
                    masters, and run before their carriages», though going at a rapid rate, for a
                    very long time. The British inhabitants of India are distinguished by their
                    hospitable dispositions, and are most liberal to all who call on them for aid.
                    It is only during the cold season that it is possible to venture abroad in the
                    heat of the day, which, in the rest of the year, is devoted to repose. The hot
                    season begins in April. Every day the heat increases until the middle of June,
                    when the periodical rains begin, which last till August. The weather then being
                    extremely close, is more oppressive and more unhealthy than before. The
                    thermometer throughout the year generally ranges between 75° and 95°, but
                    frequently rises to 100° and 110°.</p>
                <p>It was in 1690 that the English, in virtue of a firman granted by Aurungzebe,
                    founded a factory at Calcutta, which was then a village, the houses of which
                    were scattered about in clusters of ten or twelve each, and the inhabitants
                    chiefly .husbandmen; and in 1696, in consequence of the disturbed state of
                    Bengal, they were allowed to raise works of defence. To the southward of
                    Chand-paul Ghaut extended a forest; and between Kidderpoor and the forest were
                    two villages, where now stand Fort William and the esplanade. In 1717 there was
                    a small straggling village, surrounded by puddles of water, where now stand the
                    elegant houses at Chowringhee, and the town extended to Chitpore Bridge; but the
                    intervening space consisted of ground covered with jungle. In 1752 a ditch was
                    dug round a considerable part of the town, as a barrier against the inroads of
                    the Mahrattas. About this time the town was garrisoned by three hundred
                    Europeans, who were frequently employed in conveying the Company’s vessels from
                    Patna, loaded with saltpetre, piece goods, opium, and raw silk. The trade of
                    Bengal alone supplied rich cargoes for fifty or sixty ships annually, besides
                    what was carried on in small vessels to the adjacent countries. It was this
                    flourishing state of Calcutta which probably induced the nabob Surajah Dowlah to
                    attack it in the year 1756. Having had the fort of Cossimbazar delivered up to
                    him, he marched against Calcutta with all his forces, amounting to seventy
                    thousand horse and foot, with four hundred elephants, and invested the place on
                    the 15th of June. Previous to any hostilities, however, he wrote a letter to Mr
                    Drake, the governor, offering to withdraw his troops, on condition that he would
                    pay him his duty on the trade for fifteen years past, defray the expense of his
                    army, and deliver up the black merchants who were in the fort. This being
                    refused, he attacked one of the redoubts at the entrance of the town; but was
                    repulsed with great slaughter. On the 16th he attacked another advanced post,
                    but was likewise repulsed with great loss. Notwithstanding this disappointment,
                    however, the attempt was renewed on the 18th, when the troops abandoned these
                    posts and retreated into the fort; on which the nabob’s troops entered the town,
                    and plundered it for twenty-four hours. An order was then given for attacking
                    the fort; for which purpose a small breastwork was thrown up, and two
                    twelve-pounders mounted upon it, but without firing oftener than two or three
                    times an hour. The governor then called a council of war, when the captain of
                    the train informed them that there was not ammunition in the fort to serve three
                    days, in consequence of which the principal ladies were sent on board the ships
                    lying before the fort. They were followed by the governor, who declared himself
                    a quaker, and left the place to be defended by Mr Holwell, the second in
                    council. Besides the governor, four of the council, eight gentlemen of the
                    Company’s service, four officers, and a hundred soldiers, with fifty-two free
                    merchants, captains of ships, and other gentlemen, escaped on board the ships,
                    where were also fifty-nine ladies, with thirty-three of their children. The
                    whole number left in the fort was about two hundred and fifty effective men,
                    with Mr Holwell, four captains, five lieutenants, six ensigns, and five
                    serjeants; as also fourteen sea-captains, and twenty-nine gentlemen of the
                    factory. Mr Holwell then having held a council of war, divided three chests of
                    treasure among the discontented soldiers, making them large promises also, if
                    they behaved with courage and fidelity; after which he boldly stood on the
                    defence of the place, notwithstanding the immense force which opposed him. The
                    attack was very vigorous; the enemy having got possession of the houses, galled
                    the English from thence, and drove them from the bastions; but they themselves
                    were <pb break="no" facs="nls:193743360" xml:id="kp-eb0705-3360-0792"/>several
                    times dislodged by the fire from the fort, which killed an incredible number,
                    with the loss of only five English soldiers the first day. The attack, however,
                    was continued till the afternoon of the 20th, when many of the garrison being
                    killed and wounded, and their ammunition almost exhausted, a flag of truce was
                    hung out. Mr Holwell intended to avail himself of this opportunity to make his
                    escape on board the ships, but they had fallen several miles down from the fort,
                    without leaving even a single boat to facilitate the escape of those who
                    remained. In the mean time, however, the back gate was betrayed by the Dutch
                    guard; and the enemy, entering the fort, killed all they first met, and took the
                    rest prisoners.</p>
                <p>The fort was taken before six in the evening; and, in an hour after, Mr Holwell
                    had three audiences of the nabob, the last being in the durbar or council. In
                    all these the governor had the most positive assurances that no harm should
                    happen to any of the prisoners. As soon as it was dark they were collected, to
                    the number of a hundred and forty-six; and the guard, by pressing on them with
                    presented muskets, and by clubs and simitars, forced them into the Black Hole
                    prison, a dungeon about eighteen feet square, in which, out of a hundred and
                    forty-six, only twenty-three persons came out alive in the morning, and most of
                    them in a high putrid fever.</p>
                <p>The injuries which Calcutta suffered at this time, however, were soon repaired.
                    The place was retaken by Admiral Watson and Colonel Clive early in 1737; Surajah
                    Dowlah was defeated, deposed, and put to death; and Meer Jaffier, who succeeded
                    him in the nabobship, engaged to pay an immense sum for the indemnification of
                    the inhabitants. Since that time the immense acquisition of territory by the
                    British in this part of the world, and the constant state of security enjoyed by
                    this city, have raised it to its present prosperity and splendour. Fort William
                    stands in long. 88. 28. E. lat∙ 22. 33. N. (r.)</p>
