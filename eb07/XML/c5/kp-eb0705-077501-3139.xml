                <p><label type="entry">CAESAR, <hi rend="smallcaps">Julius</hi></label>, the
                    illustrious Roman general and military historian, was of the family of the
                    Julii, who pretended they were descended from Venus by Aeneas. The descendants
                    of Ascanius, sons of Aeneas and Creüsa, and surnamed Julius, lived in Alba till
                    that city was ruined by Tullus Hostilius, king of Rome, who carried them to
                    Rome, where they afterwards flourished. We do not find that they produced more
                    than two branches. The first bore the name of Tullus, the other that of Caesar.
                    The most ancient of the Caesars were those who held public employments in the
                    eleventh year of the first Punic war. After that time some of the family always
                    enjoyed public offices in the commonwealth, till the time of Caius Julius
                    Caesar, the subject of this article. He was born at Rome the 12th of the month
                    Quintilis, in the year of the city 653, and lost his father in 669. By his
                    valour and eloquence he soon acquired the highest reputation both in the field
                    and in the senate. Beloved and respected by his fellow-citizens, he enjoyed
                    successively every magisterial and military honour the republic could bestow
                    consistently with its own free constitution. But at length having subdued
                    Pompey, the great rival of his growing power, his boundless ambition effaced the
                    glory of his former actions. For, pursuing his favourite maxim, that he had
                    rather be the first man in a village than the second in Rome, he caused himself
                    to be chosen perpetual dictator; and, not -content with this unconstitutional
                    power, his faction had resolved to raise him to the imperial dignity; when the
                    friends of the civil liberties of the republic rashly assassinated him in the
                    senate-house, instead of seizing and bringing him to a legal trial for
                    usurpation. By this impolitic measure they defeated their own purpose; involved
                    the city in consternation and terror, which produced general anarchy; and paved
                    the way for the revolution which they wished to prevent, the monarchical
                    government being absolutely founded on the murder of Julius Caesar. He fell in
                    the fifty-sixth year of his age, and the forty-third before the Christian era.
                    His <hi rend="italic">Commentaries</hi> contain a history of his principal
                    voyages, battles, and victories. The London edition in 1712, in folio, is
                    preferred. See <hi rend="smallcaps">Rome.</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">Caesar,</hi>
                    in <hi rend="italic">Roman Antiquity,</hi> a title borne by all the emperors,
                    from the time of Julius Caesar till the destruction of the empire. It was also
                    used as a title of distinction for the intended or presumptive heir of the
                    empire, as <hi rend="italic">King of the łłomans</hi> was latterly used for that
                    of the German empire.</p>
                <p>This title took its rise from the surname of C. Julius Caesar, which, by a decrec
                    of the senate, all the succeeding emperors were to bear. Under his successor,
                    the appellation of <hi rend="italic">Augustus</hi> being appropriated to the
                    emperors, in compliment to the prince of that name, the title <hi rend="italic"
                    >Caesar</hi> was given to the second person in the empire, though still it
                    continued to be given to the first; and hence the difference betwixt Caesar used
                    simply, and Caesar with the addition of Imperator Augustus.</p>
                <p>The dignity of Caesar remained to the second of the empire, till Alexius Comnenus
                    having elected Nicephorus Melissenus Caesar by contract, and it being necessary
                    to confer some higher dignity on his own brother 1saacius, he created him
                    Sebastocrator, with the precedency over Melissenus; ordering, that in all
                    acclamations, Isaacius <pb break="no" facs="nls:193743152"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0705-3152-0776"/>Sebastoerator should be narñed the second, and
                    Melíssenus Caesar the third.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Caesar,</hi><hi rend="italic">Sir Julius,</hi> a learned
                    civilian, was descended by the femalc line from the Duke de Cessarini in Italy,
                    and was born near Tottenham in Middlesex in the year 1557. He was educated at
                    Oxford, and afterwards studied in the university of Paris, where, in the year
                    1581, he was created doctor of the civil law, and two years afterwards was
                    admitted to the same degree at Oxford, and also became doctor of the canon law.
                    He was advanced to many honourable employments, and for the last twenty years of
                    his life was master of the rolls. He was remarkable for his extensive bounty and
                    charity to ail persons of worth, so that he seemed to be the ahnoner-gencral of
                    the nation. He died in 1639, in the seventy-ninth year of his age. It is very
                    remarkable that the manuscripts of this lawyer were offered, by the executors of
                    some of his descendants, to a cheesemonger as waste paper; but being timely
                    inspected by Mr Samuel Paterson, this gentleman discovered their value, and had
                    the satisfaction to find his judgment confirmed by the profession, to whom they
                    were sold in lots, for upwards of L.500, in the year 1757.</p>
