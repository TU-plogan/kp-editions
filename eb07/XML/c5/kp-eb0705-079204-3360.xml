                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra

                    industrious historian of the church of Scotland, and a strenuous defender of its
                    discipline, was born in the year 1575. He was educated in the university of
                    Edinburgh, where he took the degree of A. Μ. in the year 159∣ig and having been
                    early destined for the church, he devoted much attention to the requisite<pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193743373" xml:id="kp-eb0705-3373-0793"/> studies, and
                    acquired a large fund of theological learning. Soon alter the commencement of
                    the ensuing century, he became minister of Crailing near Jedburghζ and he
                    speedily began to take a very conspicuous part in the ecclesiastical proceedings
                    of that period.</p>
                <p>The king, who seems to have considered prelacy as a convenient instrument of
                    arbitrary power, was extremely anxious to assimilate the church of Scotland to
                    the church of England. Having succeeded in obtruding episcopacy, which was a
                    very unwelcome guest, it was the next object of his solicitude to enlarge the
                    authority and jurisdiction of the bishops; and regarding the end as highly
                    desirable, he was not extremely scrupulous as to the means. His schemes were
                    however opposed by many of the clergy, and were not relished by the great body
                    of the people; nor was any individual more resolute or more consistent in his
                    opposition than Calderwood, who spent the best years of his life in contending
                    for purity of doctrine and simplicity of discipline. In the year 1608, when Law,
                    bishop of Orkney, made his appearance in the capacity of visitor of the
                    presbytery of Jedburgh, Calderwood, together with George Johnston, minister of
                    Ancram, took a formal protest against his authority, and drew up a declinature,
                    divided into various heads. Dr Abernethy, minister of Jedburgh, professed at
                    first to support them in their opposition; but his zeal having very speedily
                    abated, he was appointed perpetual moderator of the presbytery, and in due time
                    became bishop of Caithness. Calderwood and Johnston had been elected members of
                    the general assembly; but in order to exclude them from this and other
                    ecclesiastical courts, the visitor ordered them to be “put to the horn” the very
                    same night. The registration of the writ in the sheriff’s books was with great
                    difficulty prevented; but in consequence of Bishop Law’s information, the king
                    directed the privy council to punish them in an exemplary manner. By the
                    intercession of the earl of Lothian with the chancellor and the earl of Dunbar,
                    their punishment was restricted to confinement within the limits of their
                    respective parishes.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                <p>With the benefit of episcopacy the king imparted to his native country the
                    benefit of a Court of High Commission; an illegal and despotic tribunal, which,
                    though not vested with such terrific powers, bore some resemblance to the
                    Spanish inquisition. The English court was erected in the reign of Elizabeth,
                    and was intended to maintain the dignity and peace of the church, by reforming,
                    ordering, and correcting the ecclesiastical state and persons, and all manner of
                    errors, heresies, schisms, abuses, offences, contempts, and enormities: but it
                    is admitted by a writer who commonly touches despotism with a very gentle hand,
                    that under the shelter of these general expressions, “means were found in that
                    and the two succeeding reigns, to vest in the high commissioners extraordinary
                    and almost despotic powers, of fining and imprisoning; which they exerted much
                    beyond the degree of the offence itself, and frequently over offences by no
                    means of spiritual cognizance.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    in 1610, James, of his sovereign authority, issued under the great seal of
                    Scotland a commission for erecting a similar court in each of the two
                    archbishoprics of St Andrews and Glasgow. It is very justly observed by
                    Calderwood, who did not entirely escape the fangs of this new instrument of
                    persecution, that “this commission put the king in possession of that which he
                    had long time hunted for; to wit, of absolute power to use the bodies and goods
                    of his subjects at pleasure, without form or processe of the common law·”<note

                <p>James paid a visit to Scotland in the year 1617. During the sitting of the
                    parliament, which assembled on the 17th of June, the clergy held several
                    meetings in the Little Church, one or more of the bishops being always present.
                    Calderwood, whose zeal was never dormant, repaired to the church in order to
                    learn the nature of their deliberations; and on hearing Knox, bishop of the
                    Isles, make some allusion to the English convocation, he protested that such a
                    meeting should not be acknowledged as a general assembly, or any other meeting
                    equivalent to it, “or any wayes answerable to the English convocation-house,
                    where the clergie conveened in time of their parliaments.” It is by no means
                    improbable that such an innovation was secretly contemplated. Their chief
                    consultations related to the temporal emoluments of the clergy, and he attempted
                    to direct their attention to matters of greater importance than the augmentation
                    of stipends, evidently alluding to what he conceived to be the danger of the
                    church from foreign ceremonies and observances. He was assured that no
                    alteration was to be apprehended, and that the bishops had given such a promise.
                    Of their fidelity in keeping their promises, said the inflexible presbyter, we
                    have had sufficient proofs for the last sixteen years; and he was proceeding to
                    enlarge on some kindred topics, when he was interrupted by Dr Whitford and Dr
                    Hamilton, who reverted to the more interesting subject of stipends. Finding that
                    they were not disposed to listen to his suggestions, he left the meeting with
                    this expression of his indignation: “It is absurd to see men sitting in silks
                    and sattins, and to cry povertie in the kirk, when puritie is departing.” The
                    two archbishops, on being informed of what had taken place, attended the meeting
                    next day,, and solemnly declared that no innovations were intended: but this
                    declaration was so much at variance with unequivocal facts, that many of the
                    clergy felt no small degree of alarm; and a considerable number of them having
                    assembled in the music-school, resolved upon drawing up a remonstrance to his
                    majesty. Two of the Edinburgh clergy, Hewat and Struthers, were appointed to
                    prepare it; and when it was finally adjusted, Archibald Simson, minister of
                    Dalkeith, was directed to sign it as clerk of the meeting; but the names of all
                    those who attended were subscribed in a separate paper, which was delivered to
                    him as a voucher to be used according to circumstances. He presented a copy to
                    the clerk register, who refused to read it in parliament; and having been
                    summoned before the High Commission, he declined to produce the signatures, and
                    was committed as a prisoner to the castle of Edinburgh. This paper he had
                    entrusted to the master of the music-school, Patrick Henryson, who delivered it
                    to Calderwood. The minister of Crailing was therefore cited to appear at St
                    Andrews on the eighth of July, and there to exhibit the roll of names, and “to
                    answer for his mutinous and seditious assistance to the said assembly.” Hewat
                    and Simson were summoned at the same time, and they all made their appearance;
                    but their examination was deferred till the twelfth, in order that it might take
                    place in his majesty’s presence. James conducted himself in his usual manner,
                    but the stern and undaunted Calderwood was not to be overawed by any earthly
                    authority which he conceived to be unjustly exercised. The king having at length
                    whispered in the primate’s ear, "his majesty," he stated, “saith that if ye will
                    not be content to be suspend<pb break="no" facs="nls:193743386"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0705-3386-0794"/>ed spiritually, ye shall be suspended corporally.”
                    Undismayed by this declaration, he replied, “Sir, my bodie is in your majesty’s
                    hands to do with it as it pleaseth your majesty; but as long as my bodie is
                    free, I will teach, notwithstanding of their sentence.” Spotswood describes him
                    as “carrying himself unreverently, and breaking forth into speeches not becoming
                    a subject nor is it difficult to conceive that the archbishop of St Andrews and
                    the minister of Crailing may have formed a very different estimate of the
                    speeches which became a subject placed in such circumstances.</p>
                <p>Hewat, adhering to the protestation, was deprived, and confined in the town of
                    Dundee; but as he had obtained a grant of the temporalities of Crossragwell
                    abbey, he was not left without a provision. Simson, who had aggravated the
                    original offence by writing a letter in which he disparaged the English bishops,
                    likewise received sentence of deprivation, and was for several months detained
                    in prison; but on making his submission, he was at length reinstated. A similar
                    sentence was pronounced on Calderwood, who was committed to prison at St
                    Andrews, and was afterwards removed to Edinburgh. The privy council, which long
                    exercised an undefined and despotic jurisdiction, ordained him to be banished
                    from the kingdom for refusing to acknowledge the sentence of the High
                    Commission; and the whole proceedings in this case exhibit a curious example of
                    the arbitrary and iniquitous administration of that period. On giving security
                    to banish himself from the kingdom before the ensuing Michaelmas, and not to
                    return without the royal license, he was released from prison. He accompanied
                    Lord Cranstoun to Carlisle, where that nobleman presented to the king a petition
                    in his favour; but although the suit appears to have been very zealously urged,
                    it was followed by no beneficial result. The king inveighed against Calderwood,
                    and at last repelled the noble baron with his elbow. The application was however
                    renewed after<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>Spotswood’s Hist, of the Church of Scotland, p. ð34.</p></note> an interval
                    of two hours: his lordship entreated him to permit the petitioner to remain in
                    Scotland till the last day of April, on account of the danger of a winter
                    voyage, and in order to receive his stipend for the current year; but his
                    majesty was graciously pleased to declare, that it was no matter if he begged
                    his bread, and “as for the season of the year, if he drowned in the seas, he
                    might thank God that he hath escaped a worse death a princely answer, and full
                    of Christian comfort! The subsequent application of Lord Cranstoun to the privy
                    council, and to the bishops, was attended with no better success; and if they
                    had been more inclined to lenient measures, the unbending spirit of Calderwood,
                    who would neither make an unqualified confession of his supposed errors of
                    conduct, nor promise strict obedience to the new regulations in the church, left
                    very little room to hope for the remission of his sentence.</p>
                <p>He continued for a considerable time to linger in his native country; and during
                    this interval he began the publication of his anonymous works in support of the
                    presbyterian cause. In the year 1618 he printed a Latin tract on the polity of
                    the church of Scotland. The general assembly, which met at^Perth on the 25th of
                    August, gave a new impulse to his mind; and in 1619 he produced an English work,
                    in which he undertook to demonstrate the nullity of the assembly itself, and the
                    unlawfulness of its five articles, relating to kneeling at the communion, the
                    observance of festivals, confirmation, private baptism, and private communion.
                    They who hazarded the peace of the church and kingdom by such innovations as
                    these, had not sufficiently reflected on all the consequences which ensued; nor
                    are we disposed to blame the faithful presbyters for their very strenuous
                    opposition to some of the articles of Perth. Kneeling at the communion, for
                    example, may in itself be a very harmless ceremony: but this was not the
                    position of the apostles when our Saviour instituted the sacred rite; and such a
                    position was considered by many of our ancestors as too much connected with the
                    adoration of the host, and the doctrine of transubstantiation. Some of the
                    episcopalians still indulge in certain obsolete speculations as to the eucharist
                    being a feast upon a sacrifice.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    Catholics of Great Britain, p. 1G4. Lond. 1800, 8vo.</p></note> A sacrifice
                    requires a priest, a priest can only be ordained by a bishop; and without a
                    bishop, a priest, and an altar of sacrifice, they suppose that no church can
                    stand on a secure foundation. But the character and destiny of churches are not
                    to be decided by earthly judges; and we leave them in the quiet possession of
                    their mystical reveries, which nevertheless we cannot help suspecting of a very
                    intimate connexion with the spirit of popery.</p>
                <p>While Calderwood was still lurking in Scotland, an attempt was made to apprehend
                    him at Edinburgh in the house of James Cathkin, a bookseller; but the officers
                    neither found him nor any copies of his obnoxious publication relative to the
                    <hi rend="italic">Perth Assembly.</hi> Cathkin had visited London in the
                    prosecution of his business; and being immediately taken into custody, he
                    underwent two examinations, one of them in presence of his majesty, who was
                    moved with violent indignation.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Of his examination Cathkin has given a curious account,

                    publishing the book, and receiving the author into his house. In reference to
                    the people of Edinburgh, whom he had not found sufficiently submissive to the
                    royal will, James uttered the following paternal wish: “The Devill ryve ther
                    soules and bodies all in collops, and cast them in hell !” The worthy
                    bookseller, who conducted himself with manly firmness, was released from prison
                    after having been detained for eight days. Calderwood was in the mean time
                    concealed at Cranstoun, in a secret apartment allotted to him by Lady Cranstoun,
                    who rendered him many services. He afterwards removed from one place to another,
                    till the 27th of August 1619, when he embarked at Newhaven, and sailed for
                    Holland, “with his purse well filled by the wives of Edinburgh.”<note

                    enabling him to extend his acquaintance with men of learning, and to collect
                    books in his own department of study. His controversial ardour was still
                    unabated: during his residence in Holland he published various works, and, among
                    the rest, his <hi rend="italic">Altar of Damascus.</hi> At one period, his
                    enemies supposed him to be dead; and he has recorded a very extraordinary

                    gentleman beside Falkland, having wasted his patrimonie, had no other meane to
                    recover his estate, but by some unlawful shift at court. He set forth a
                    recantation under the name of a banished minister, Mr David Calderwood, who,
                    because of his long sickness before, was supposed by many to have been dead. The
                    king, as he alledged himself to some of his friends, furnished him the matter,
                    and he set the matter down in forme. This course failing, he went over to
                    Holland, and sought the said Mr David in sundrie townes, specially in
                    Amsterdame, in the moncth of November. It appeareth his purpose was to dispatch
                    the said Mr David. After lie had stayed at Amsterdame 20 dayes, and made
                    diligent inquiric, he was informed that the said Mr David was returned home
                    privatly to his own native countrey. How he cusened a distressed Englishman
                    after his returning, I passe by. After the death of King James, he set out ä

                    the bishop of Ross, being then present where he departed, to bear the charges,

                <p>From the date of this narrative, Calderwood appears to have returned to Scotland
                    in the year 1624. He was still found to be the most redoubtable champion of
                    presbytery; and after the abolition of episcopacy, he was appointed minister of
                    Pencaitland, in the county of Haddington, but the date of this appointment has
                    not been ascertained. The following statement proceeds from an episcopalian
                    writer: “David Calderwood, a man of great reading and study, but very unhappy in
                    his way of expressing himself, both which appeared in his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Altare Damascenum.</hi> He was at first very factious, and banished the kingdom
                    by King James, yet was afterwards much neglected by that violent party, who
                    judged him too moderate, though, from his book, none would imagine him guilty of
                    it.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Middleton’s

                    Baillie, in relating the proceedings of the general assembly in 1641, remarks,
                    “it was regretted by the moderator that Mr David Catherwood, who deserved so
                    well of our church, was so long neglected. He was recommended to the first
                    commodious room. Likely he shall not be in haste provided. The man is sixty-six
                    years old; his utterance is unpleasant; his carriage about the meetings of this
                    assembly and before, has made him less considerable to divers of his former
                    benefactors.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Baillie’s
                    Letters and Journals, vol. i. p. 311.</p></note> Though not a member, he had
                    repeatedly spoken with too much pertinacity. Henderson the moderator treated him
                    with great forbearance, but at length the commissioner commanded him to be
                    silent. In 1643 the assembly appointed Henderson, Calderwood, and Dickson, to
                    prepare a directory for public worship. During the remainder of his life, he
                    continued to take an active part in the affairs of the church; and as firmness
                    may be nearly allied to obstinacy, he appears to have maintained his own
                    opinions with habitual keenness. It was he that introduced the practice, which
                    is now confirmed by long usage, of dissenting from the decision of the assembly,
                    and requiring the protest to be entered in the record. In 1649, an act having
                    been introduced respecting the election of ministers, he proposed that the right
                    of electing should be vested in the presbytery, leaving to the people the power
                    of declaring their dissent, upon reasons of which it should be competent for the
                    presbytery to judge; but this suggestion was not adopted; and, according to
                    Baillie’s statement, “Calderwood entered a very sharp protestation against our
                    act, which he required to be registered. This is the first protestation we heard
                    of in our time; and had it come from any other, it had not escaped
                    censure.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Baillie, vol.

                <p>He devoted many years to the preparation of a history of the church of Scotland.
                    In 1648 the general assembly urged him to complete the design, and voted him a
                    yearly pension of eight hundred pounds.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    historical work of great extent, and of great value, not indeed as a masterly
                    composition, but as a storehouse of authentic materials for history. The
                    laborious author has incorporated many original documents which are not
                    otherwise preserved, and has recorded an immense multiplicity of facts, which
                    illustrate the civil as well as the ecclesiastical annals of the period to which
                    his work relates. An abridgment, which appears to have been prepared by

                    published after his death; but it is much to be regretted that his great work
                    still remains in manuscript. Proposals for printing it were issued many years
                    ago, but the plan did not meet with adequate encouragement; and, unless a
                    similar plan should be adopted by the Bannatyne Club, we despair of seeing it
                    carried into execution. The author’s manuscript, which lately belonged to
                    General Calderwood Durham, has been presented to the British Museum. A copy,
                    transcribed under the inspection of Wodrow, is among the archives of the church;
                    another belongs to the library of the university of Glasgow; and, as Dr M‘Crie
                    has stated, “in the Advocates Library, besides a complete copy of that work,
                    there is a folio volume of it, reaching to the end of the year 1572. It was
                    written in 1634, and has a number of interlineations and marginal alterations,
                    differing from the other copies, which, if not made by the author’s own hand,
                    were most probably done under his eye.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    Baillie, in a passage already quoted, mentions that Calderwood was sixty-six
                    years old in 1841.</p></note> at the age of seventy-five. He appears to have
                    been a man of unbending integrity, fearless in maintaining his opinions, and
                    uniformly consistent in his professions; but as human virtues are never perfect,
                    his decision of character had some tendency to deviate into that obstinacy of
                    humour from which good men are not always exempted. With his honesty and piety
                    he united no small portion of acuteness and learning. He was conversant with the
                    fathers, schoolmen, and canonists, as well as the more recent theologians; and
                    the shrewdness of his understanding enabled him to apply his learning with due
                    effect.</p>
                <p>His works are numerous; and as they were almost all published without the
                    author’s name, it is not easy to form a complete and accurate catalogue. The
                    place of printing is omitted in all the original editions, but several, if not
                    most of them, appear to have been printed in Holland. The following is a list of
                    publications which we believe may be safely ascribed to Calderwood.</p>
                <p>1. De Regimine Ecclesias’ Scoticanae brevis Relatio. 1618, 8vo.—To this tract an
                    answer was published by Archbishop Spotswood, under the title of “Refutatio

                <p>2. A Solvtion of Doctor Resolvtvs his Resolutions for Kneeling. 1619, 4to.—This
                    is an answer to a book written by David Lindsay, D.D. who became bishop of
                    Brechin, and afterwards of Edinburgh: “The Reasons of a Pastors Resolution,

                    1638, 8vo.—This is an answer to a book entitled, “The Lawfvlnes of Kneeling in

                    In his preface, Calderwood remarks of his antagonist, “he hath given so notable
                    proofe of profound knowledge in divinitie, and subtilitie in handling this
                    controversie in this worthie work of his, that the bishop of St Andros (a man as
                    voyd of learning as of good manners) hath made him a doctor.” This is not a very
                    decent manner of treating Spotswood, who was neither destitute of talents nor of
                    learning.</p>

                    and Durham, had published “A Defence of the Innocencie of the three Ceremonies
                    of the Chvrch of England; viz. the Surplice, Crosse after Baptisme, and Kneeling
                    at the Receiuing of the blessed Sacrament.” Lond. 1619, 4to. This is the second

                    the polity of the church of England; and, as Mr Peirce remarks, “the patrons of

                    A late writer, by some unaccountable inadvertency, has stated that “this book is
                    a refutation of Linwood’s Description of the Policy of the Church of England.”
                    William Lyndewode, an eminent canonist who became bishop of St David’s, could
                    certainly write no book about the protestant church of England, inasmuch as he
                    died in 1446, nearly a century before the reformation. He is the compiler of a
                    well-known work, entitled <hi rend="italic">Provinciale, seu
                    Constitutiones</hi><hi rend="italic">Angliae,</hi> to which Calderwood
                    frequently refers, among many other juridical and theological authorities. One
                    of the books which he undertakes to refute bears the title of “Paraenesis ad
