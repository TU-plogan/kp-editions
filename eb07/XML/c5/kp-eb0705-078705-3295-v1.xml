                <p><label type="entry">CALCULUS</label> primarily denotes a little stone or pebble,
                    anciently used in making computations, taking suffrages, playing at tables, and
                    the like. In after times, pieces of ivory, and counters struck of silver, gold,
                    and other matterials, were used in lieu of the calculi, but still retained the
                    ancient name. Computists were by the lawyers called <hi rend="italic"
                    >calculones,</hi> when they were either slaves or newly freed men; those of a
                    better condition were named <hi rend="italic">calculatores</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">numerarii</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> there was ordinarily one of
                    these in each family of distinction. The Roman judges anciently gave their
                    opinions by calculi, which were white for absolution, and black for
                    condemnation. Hence <hi rend="italic">calculus</hi><hi rend="italic">albus,</hi>
                    in ancient writers, denotes a favourable vote, either in the case of a person to
                    be absolved and acquitted of a charge, or elected to some dignity or post; and
                    <hi rend="italic">calculus</hi><hi rend="italic">niger</hi> had a contrary
                    signification. This usage is said to have been borrowed from the Thracians, who
                    marked their happy or prosperous days by <hi rend="italic">white,</hi> and their
                    unhappy by <hi rend="italic">black</hi> pebbles, which were put each night into
                    an urn.</p>
                <p>Besides the diversity of colour, there were some calculi also which had figures
                    or characters engraven on them, as those which were in use in taking the
                    suffrages both in the senate and in assemblies of the people. These calculi were
                    made of thin wood, polished and covered over with wax. Their form is still seen
                    in some medals of the Cassian family; and the manner of casting them into the
                    urns is represented in the medals of the Licinian family. The letters marked
                    upon these calculi were U. R. for <hi rend="italic">uti</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >rogas,</hi> and A. for <hi rend="italic">antiquo;</hi> the first of which
                    expressed an approbation of the law, the latter a rejection of it. Afterwards

                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Calculus</hi> is also used by ancient writers for a kind of
                    weight equal to two grains of cicer. Some make it equivalent to the siliqua,
                    which is equal to three grains of barley. Two calculi composed the ceratium.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Calculus,</hi> in <hi rend="italic">Mathematics,</hi> is a
                    general name given to various ways of investigating or establishing the truths
                    of that science by the aid of conventional symbols or characters which represent
                    the things treated of, also the operations to be performed on them, and the
                    relations in which they stand to one another. Thus we have the common <hi
                    rend="italic">Arithmetical</hi> Calculus, and the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Algebraic</hi> Calculus. The term is applied to a considerable number of
                    distinct mathematical theories, the principal of which are these:</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Differential</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">Calculus</hi> and the
                    <hi rend="italic">Integral</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">Calculus.</hi> The invention
                    of these is claimed for Leibnitz. They are identical with the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Fluxionary</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">Calculus,</hi> the invention of Newton.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="smallcaps">Calculus</hi><hi rend="italic">of Partial
                    Differences,</hi> which is a branch of the Differential and Integral
                    Calculus.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="smallcaps">Calculus</hi><hi rend="italic">of Variations,</hi>
                    another branch of the same theory. Its principal object is to determine when
                    mathematical quantities, subject to certain conditions, are the greatest or
                    least possible. This theory, first broached by James and John Bernoulli, was
                    perfected by Euler and La Grange, who have discussed it in their writings. There
                    is a distinct treatise on this subject by the late Mr Woodhouse of
                    Cambridge.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="smallcaps">Calculus</hi><hi rend="italic">of Exponentials,</hi> or
                    Exponential Calculus. This may include the doctrine of logarithms; but the name
                    is commonly applied to the method of finding the differentials or fluxions of
                    exponential and logarithmic quantities. John Bernoulli was the first who treated
                    of this subject as a distinct calculus. (Bernoulli <hi rend="italic">Opera,</hi>

                    gave this name to his particular view of the subject. <hi rend="italic"

                    all treat of this subject. There are also various treatises in works on the

                    is applicable to the doctrine of series, and is due to a continental
                    mathematician, Arbogast, who has composed a treatise on the subject. (Arbogast

                    branch of mathematical science was embodied in a distinct form by Euler. See his

                <p>There are some other mathematical theories which have been distinguished each as
                    a separate <hi rend="italic">Calculus,</hi> as Landen’s <hi rend="italic"

                    decision of a cause in regard to which the judges were equally divided. The
                    expression is taken from the history of Orestes, represented by AEschylus and
                    Euripides; at whose trial before the Areopagites, for the murder of his mother,
                    the votes being equally divided for and against him, Minerva interposed, and
                    gave the casting vote or calculus in his behalf.</p>
