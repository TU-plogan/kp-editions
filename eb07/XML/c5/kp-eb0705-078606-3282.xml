                    significant corrections to the OCR text, predominantly in cases of confusing "c"
                    and "e." Isolates 90 entries that were mistakenly included at the end of prior
                    entries in v1 and v2. Normalizes ordinal numbers. Separates metadata in
                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra
                    space around the <gi>pb</gi> tag. Where a word is hyphenated at a <gi>pb</gi>,
                    the end fragment is now joined to the start fragment, making a machine-readable
                    word.</change>

                <p><label type="entry">CALCEDONY</label>. The distinction between this substance and
                    agate rests upon very arbitrary grounds. Agate frequently presents a variety of
                    colours, and a multiplicity of beautiful delineations. Calcedony is generally of
                    one uniform colour, of a light brown, and sometimes nearly white. It occurs in
                    irregular masses, forming grotesque cavities in the trap rocks, particularly in
                    Iceland and the Faroe Isles, from the former of which there are specimens in the
                    Museum of Edinburgh of a very large size. These stalactites appear always to
                    have proceeded from the upper part of the cavity, which is sometimes filled up
                    to the very summit with solid matter. From a close examination of these
                    specimens, we are led to believe that the material must have been introduced
                    into the cavity either in a state of the most attenuated fluidity, or even in a
                    gaseous form. The structure can be traced down the sides of the cavity,
                    regularly surrounding every portion of the stalactite, and passing across the
                    horizontal plate which uniformly forms the base of these cavities. A slight
                    intermixture of opaleβeent matter, which renders the calcedony more white and
                    opaque, delineates this structure in the most perfect manner, and is a common
                    occurrence in Faroe.</p>
                <p>Calcedony is not confined to the trap rocks; it occurs in granite; and the most
                    beautiful specimens known were found in one of the mines of Cornwall,
                    distinguished by the name of Trevascus. It was, however, in one solitary cell
                    that these occurred. Although the mine has continued to yield calcedony of the
                    same character, nothing similar to these magnificent specimens has been produced
                    since. They can scarcely be compared to any thing which they resemble more than
                    the anatomized wing of a large bat, exhibiting the bones and arteries in the
                    most perfect manner. One of these beautiful specimens, which was in the
                    possession of the late Mr Greville, is now in the British Museum.</p>
                <p>Calcedony is used for the construction of cups and plates, and other articles of
                    taste, of which the most splendid specimens are imported into this country from
                    India. The labour which has been bestowed in the manufacture of these articles,
                    and the perfection with which it has been accomplished, is a matter of surprise
                    to all who examine them. There are some of them as thin and as delicate as
                    china. The finest stones are of course selected for this purpose. They are
                    generally clear and almost transparent, still maintaining the warm brown colour
                    which characterises the stone. They often have the appearance of having been
                    hammered, so shaded and undulated is the aspect of the mass; and to add to their
                    beauty, the fine dendritic Mocha stones are often selected. We are in ignorance
                    even of the locality where these beautiful objects are manfactured, whether in
                    Japan or China; but to this country they generally come from India, where, we
                    believe, they are found among the most precious jewels in the repositories of
                    the nabobs and princes of the East.</p>
                <p>Calcedony in Europe is confined to labours on a much smaller scale, such as
                    knife-handles, and mortars for chemical purposes; also for snuff-boxes, buttons,
                    and other minor objects. The principal manufactory is at Oberstein in the
                    Palatinate.</p>
                <p>Calcedony is semitransparent; its texture is fine and compact; the fracture is
                    scaly, resembling that of wax; it is less hard than rock crystal, but gives fire
                    with steel. No indications of regular form have ever been observed in this
                    substance; for we need not except the pale blue variety from Tresztyan in
                    Transylvania, which is decidedly a pseudomorphic formation in the form of fluor
                    spar. Calcedony frequently assumes the forms of other minerals, as well as of
                    shells in many instances; but these may be considered as accidents unconnected
                    with the history of the substance.</p>
                <p>Connected with agate and calcedony, we may at once enumerate the different
                    varieties which are still maintained by mineralogists.</p>
                <p>1. Sardonyx (quartz, agate, sardoine of the French). This variety is
                    characterised by a rich orange colour.</p>
                <p>2. Cornelian (cornaline of the French). The characteristic colour of this variety
                    is a brilliant red.</p>
                <p>3. Prase (the chrysoprase of the Germans). This variety occurs at Kosmütz in
                    Silesia. It sometimes possesses<pb break="no" facs="nls:193743295"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0705-3295-0787"/> a most brilliant green colour, and is nearly
                    transparent.</p>
                <p>4. Plasma, a semitransparent, and of a dark grass-green colour, and was used very
                    much by the ancients as a stone for engraving.</p>
                <p>5. Onyx (the band-agate of the Germans). This stone, when of favourable colours,
                    is used by artists for cutting cameos.</p>
                <p>Mineralogists have had the patience to split the agate into a variety of other
                    denominations, which are not worth enumerating.</p>
