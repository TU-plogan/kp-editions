                    used for the sealing and ratifying of covenants and alliances, which was done by
                    the contracting parties drinking a little of each other’s blood; and also for
                    appeasing <pb break="no" facs="nls:193198545" xml:id="kp-eb0704-8545-0710"/>the
                    manes of the dead, in order to which blood was offered on their tombs as part of
                    the funeral ceremony.</p>
                <p>The blood of victims was anciently the portion of the gods; and accordingly it
                    was poured or sprinkled on the altars in oblation to them. But the priests made
                    another use of blood, namely, for divination; the streaming of blood being held
                    a prodigy or omen of evil.</p>
                <p>The Roman priests were not unacquainted with the use of blood in miracles; and
                    they had their fluxes of blood from images, ready to serve a turn, as, for
                    instance, that said to have streamed from the statue of Minerva at Modena before
                    the battle at that place. But we know not whether, in this species of
                    legerdemain, their successors have not gone beyond them. How many are the
                    relations, in ecclesiastical writers, of madonnas, crucifixes, and wafers,
                    bleeding? The liquefaction of the blood of St Januarius at Naples, repeated
                    annually for so many ages, seems to transcend all the frauds of the Grecian or
                    Roman priesthood. But the chemists at last got into the secret; and Μ. Neumann
                    of Berlin performed the miracle of the liquefaction of dried blood, with all the
                    circumstances of the Neapolitan experiment.</p>
                <p>Amongst the schoolmen we find a famous dispute, under Pope Pius II. whether the
                    blood of Christ, which fell from him in the three days passion, retained or lost
                    the hypostatic union; and consequently whether it was the proper object of
                    adoration. The Dominicans maintained the former, the Franciscans the latter. But
                    the Dominican doctrine gained the ascendency, as being fitted to favour the
                    profits of the monks, who becoming somehow possessed, as they said, of a few
                    drops of this precious liquor, were certain of receiving ample offerings from
                    the deluded laity, who flocked to pay their homage to the sacred relic. Joseph
                    of Arimathea is said to have first brought into Britain two silver vessels
                    filled with the blood of Christ, which by his order was buried in his tomb. King
                    Henry III. had a crystal, containing a portion of the same blood, sent him by
                    the master of the temple of Jerusalem, attested with the seals of the patriarch;
                    which treasure the king committed to the church of St Peter’s, Westminster, and
                    obtained from the bishops an indulgence of six years and a hundred and sixteen
                    days to all who should visit it. And Matthew Paris assures us, that the object
                    of the king in summoning his nobles and prelates to celebrate the feast of St
                    Edward in St Peter’s Church was chiefly <hi rend="italic">pro veneratione sancti
                    sanguinis Christi nuper adepti,</hi> in veneration of the holy blood of Christ
                    lately acquired. Divers others of our monasteries were possessed of this
                    profitable relic; as the college of Bons-Hommes at Ashridge, and the abbey of
                    Hales, to which it was given by Henry, son of Richard, duke of Cornwall and king
                    of the Romans. This supposititious blood was resorted to by a great concourse of
                    people for devotion and adoration; till, in 1383, when the Reformation
                    commenced, it was perceived to be only honey clarified and coloured with
                    saffron, as was shown at St Paul’s cross by the bishop of Rochester. The like
                    discovery was made of the blood of Christ found among the relics in theabbey of
                    Feschamp in Normandy, pretended to have been preserved by Nicoemus when he took
                    the body from the cross, and given to that abbey by William duke of Normandy. It
                    was buried by his son Richard, and again discovered in 1171, and attended with
                    different miracles; but the cheat, which had long been winked at, was at length
                    exposed, and a relation of it is given by Speed.</p>

                    hound or dog, with long, smooth, and pendulous ears. It was a dog of great use,
                    and in .high esteem with our ancestors, being employed to recover any game that
                    had escaped wounded from the hunter, or been killed and stolen out of the
                    forest. It was remarkable for the acuteness of its smell, tracing the lost beast
                    by the blood it had spilt, from which the name is derived. This species could,
                    with the utmost certainty, discover the thief by following his footsteps, let
                    his flight be ever so rapid, and through the most secret and thickest coverts;
                    nor would it cease its pursuit till it had taken the felon. They were likewise
                    used by Wallace and Bruce during the civil wars. The poetical historians of the
                    two heroes frequently relate very curious passages on this subject, of the
                    service which these dogs rendered to their masters, and the escapes they had
                    from those of the enemy. The blood-hound was in great request on the confines of
                    England and Scotland, where the borderers were continually preying on the flocks
                    and herds of their neighbours. The true blood-hound was large, strong, muscular,
                    broad breasted, of a stern countenance, of a deep tan colour, and generally
                    marked with a black spot above each eye. Animals of this species have been used
                    in our own time in the West Indies, for hunting down the Caribbs, and other
                    equally humane purposes.</p>

                    <hi rend="italic">Colonel Blood,</hi> was a disbanded officer of Oliver
                    Cromwell’s, famous for his daring crimes and his good fortune. He was first
                    distinguished by engaging in a conspiracy to surprise the castle of Dublin;
                    which was defeated by the vigilance of the duke of Ormond, and some of his
                    accomplices were executed. Escaping to England, he meditated revenge against
                    Ormond, and actually seized him one night in his coach in St James’s Street,
                    where he might have finished his purpose if he had not studied refinements in
                    his vengeance. He bound his captive on horseback behind one of his associates,
                    resolving to hang him at Tyburn, with a paper pinned to his breast; but when
                    they had got <pb break="no" facs="nls:193198558" xml:id="kp-eb0704-8558-0711"
                    />into the fields, the duke, in his efforts for liberty, threw himself and the
                    assassin to whom he was fastened to the ground; and, while they were struggling
                    in the mire, his grace was rescued by his servants. But the authors of this
                    attempt were not then discovered. A little after, in 1671, Blood formed a design
                    of carrying off the crown and regalia from the Tower; a design to which he was
                    prompted, as well by the desperate nature of the enterprise, as by views of
                    profit. And he was very near succeeding. He had bound and wounded Edwards, the
                    keeper of the jeweloffice, and had got out of the Tower with his prey; but he
                    was overtaken and seized, together with some of his associates. One of these was
                    known to have been concerned in the attempt upon Ormond, and Blood was
                    immediately concluded to be the ringleader. When questioned, he frankly avowed
                    the enterprise, but refused to discover his accomplices. The fear of death, he
                    said, should never engage him either to deny a crime or betray a friend. All
                    these extraordinary circumstances made him the general subject of conversation;
                    and the king was moved with an idle curiosity to see and speak with a person so
                    noted for his courage and his crimes. Blood might now esteem himself secure of
                    pardon; and he wanted not address to improve the opportunity. He told Charles
                    that he had been engaged, with others, in a design to kill him with a carabine
                    above Battersea, where his majesty often went to bathe; that the cause of this
                    resolution was the severity exercised over the consciences of the godly, in
                    restraining the liberty of their religious assemblies; that when he had taken
                    his stand among the reeds, full of these bloody resolutions, he found his heart
                    checked with an awe of majesty; that he not only relented himself, but diverted
                    his associates from their purpose; that he had long ago brought himself to an
                    entire indifference about life, which he now gave up for lost, yet could he not
                    forbear warning the king of the danger which might attend his execution; that
                    his associates had bound themselves by the strictest oaths to revenge the death
                    of any of their confederacy; and that no precaution or power could secure any
                    one from the effect of their desperate resolutions. Whether these considerations
                    excited fear or admiration in the king, they confirmed his resolution of
                    granting a pardon to Blood; but he thought it a requisite point of decency first
                    to obtain the duke of Ormond’s consent. Arlington came to Ormond in the king’s
                    name, and desired that he would not prosecute Blood, for reasons which he was
                    commanded to give him. The duke replied, that his majesty’s commands were the
                    only reason that could be given; and these being sufficient, he might therefore
                    spare the rest. Charles carried his kindness to Blood still further, granting
                    him an estate of L.500 a year in Ireland, encouraging his attendance about his
                    person, and showing him great countenance; in consequence of which many applied
                    to him for promoting their pretensions at court. Whilst old Edwards, who had
                    bravely ventured his life, and had been wounded, in defending the crown and
                    regalia, was forgotten and neglected, this man, who deserved only to be stared
                    at and detested as a monster, became a kind of royal favourite. Blood enjoyed
                    his pension about ten years, till being charged with fixing an imputation of a
                    scandalous nature on the duke of Buckingham, he was thrown into prison, where he
                    died on the 24th of August 1680.</p>
