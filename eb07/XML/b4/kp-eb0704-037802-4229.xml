                <p><label type="entry">BARD</label>, a word denoting a poet by profession, who, to
                    use the language of Ossian, “sung of the battles of heroes, or the heaving
                    breasts of love.” .</p>
                <p>Anciently bards were necessary persons at every festival and at every solemnity.
                    Their songs, which, by recording the achievements of kings and heroes, animated
                    the soul of the hearer, must have been the entertainment of every warlike
                    nation. We have Hesiod’s authority, that in his time bards were as common as
                    potters or joiners, and as liable to envy. Cicero reports, that anciently at
                    Roman festivals the virtues and exploits of their great men were celebrated in
                    song. The same custom prevailed in I ’ θ <hi rend="superscript"> ru</hi> and
                    Mexico as we learn from Garcilasso and other authors. But in no part of the
                    world did the profession of bard appear with such lustre as in Gaul, in Britain,
                    and in Ireland<pb break="no" facs="nls:193194242" xml:id="kp-eb0704-4242-0379"
                    />. Wherever the Celtae or Gauls are mentioned by ancient writers, we seldom
                    fail to hear of their druids and their bards, the institution of which two
                    orders was the capital distinction of their manners and policy. The druids were
                    their philosophers and priests, the bards their poets and recorders of heroic
                    actions; and both these orders of men seem to have subsisted among them as chief
                    members of the state from time immemorial. The Celtae possessed, from very
                    remote ages, a regular system of discipline and manners, which appears to have
                    had a deep and lasting influence. Ammianus Marcellinus expressly declares, that
                    there flourished amongst them the study of the most laudable arts, introduced by
                    the bards, whose office it was to sing in heroic verse the gallant actions of
                    illustrious men; and by the druids, who lived together in colleges or societies,
                    after the Pythagorean manner, philosophizing upon the highest subjects, and
                    asserting the immortality of the human soul. Though Julius Caesar, in his
                    account of Gaul, does not expressly mention the bards, yet it is plain that,
                    under the title of druids, he comprehends that whole college or order, of which
                    the bards, who, it is probable, were the disciples of the druids, undoubtedly
                    made a part. It deserves remark, that, according to his account, the druidical
                    institution first took its rise in Britain, and passed from thence into Gaul; so
                    that they who aspired to be thorough masters of that learning were wont to
                    resort to Britain. He adds, too, that such as were to be initiated among the
                    druids were obliged to commit to memory a great number of verses, insomuch that
                    some employed twenty years in this course of education; and that they did not
                    think it lawful to record these poems in writing, but handed them down by
                    tradition from race to race.</p>
                <p>So strong was the attachment of the Celtic nations to their poetry and their
                    bards, that amidst all the changes of their government and manners, even long
                    after the order of the druids had been extinct, and the national religion
                    altered, the bards continued to flourish, not as a set of strolling songsters,
                    like the Greek <hi rend="italic">aωδoι</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >rhapsodists</hi> in Homer’s time, but as an order of men highly respected in
                    the state, and supported by a public establishment. According to the testimonies
                    of Strabo and Diodorus, they existed before the age of Augustus Caesar; and we
                    find them flourishing under that sovereign, and exercising the same functions as
                    of old, in Ireland and in the north of Scotland, almost down to our own times.
                    It is well known that, in both these countries, every <hi rend="italic"
                    >regulus</hi> or chief had his own bard, who was considered an officer of rank
                    and consequence in his little court.</p>
                <p>The bards, as well as the druids, were exempted from taxes and military services,
                    even in times of the greatest danger; and when they attended their patrons in
                    the field to record and celebrate their great actions, they had a guard assigned
                    them for their protection. At all festivals and public assemblies they were
                    seated near the person of the king or chieftain, and sometimes even above the
                    greatest nobility and chief officers of the court. Nor was the profession of the
                    bards less lucrative than it was honourable. For, besides the valuable presents
                    which they occasionally received from their patrons when they gave them uncommon
                    pleasure by their performances, they had estates in land allotted for their
                    support. Nay, <hi rend="superscript"> s</hi> θ great was the veneration which
                    the princes of these times entertained for the persons of their poets, and so
                    highly were they charmed and delighted with their tuneful strains, that they
                    sometimes pardoned even their capital crimes for a song.</p>
