                <p><label type="entry">BERWICK</label>, a county situated at the south-eastern
                    extremity of Scotland, is bounded by the German Ocean on the east; by East
                    Lothian on the north; by a part of Mid Lothian, but chiefly by Roxburghshire, on
                    the west; by the river Tweed, and that part of Roxburghshire which lies to the
                    north of the same river, on the south; and by the township of Berwick on the
                    south-east. On the south, the Tweed, in a winding course of about thirty-five
                    miles, divides it, first, from the part of Roxburghshire which lies south of the
                    river; secondly, from Northumberland; and thirdly, from North Durham. Its
                    northern extremity is situated in north latitude 55.58. 30., and its southern
                    point upon the Tweed is in 55. 36. 30. Dunse, its principal town, and situated
                    nearly in the centre of the county, is 2° 20' west of Greenwich. Its extreme
                    length is thirty-one miles and a quarter, and its extreme breadth nineteen and a
                    half miles. Its superficies is 446 square miles, or 285,440 acres, of which more
                    than one half is supposed to be arable, the remainder consisting of upland
                    pasture and unreclaimed moor.</p>
                <p>The county consists of two divisions, greatly distinguished from each other by
                    their natural characters. The first is the mountainous range of the Lammermoors,
                    extending inland from the promontory of St Ebb’s, commonly called St Abb’s, Head
                    on the east, to the confines of the county on the west; the second is the lower
                    country, extending from the foot of the Lammermoor Hills on the north, to the
                    Tweed and the boundaries of the county on the south. This is termed the <hi
                    rend="italic">Merse,</hi> from its ancient name, the March or Border. The
                    Lammermoor comprehends within it the valley of the Leader, termed Lauderdale,
                    and generally regarded as a distinct division of the county.</p>
                <p>Of the elevated tract of the Lammermoors, the northern part is in East Lothian,
                    where it is more rugged and precipitous than towards its southern slope. The
                    whole range is bleak and unfertile. The summit-level may be held to be upwards
                    of 1000 feet above the sea, rising at one point, Criblaw, on the north-west, to
                    the height of 1615 feet. On the south the mountains generally sink into the
                    lower grounds of the Merse, by an easy declivity. Here they are cultivated, and
                    interspersed tracts of ara-fie<pb break="no" facs="nls:193197089"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0704-7089-0598"/> land extend throughout the range. But, generally
                    speaking, the tract is barren, and productive, for the most part, only of heath
                    and the coarser herbage. Its soil and climate are unpropitious to vegetation in
                    a greater degree than its elevation alone would lead one to expect. In this
                    respect it differs from the hills around Cheviot on the southern side of the
                    Tweed, which, at the same or a higher altitude, are greatly more rich and
                    verdant. This arises from the different nature of the mountain rocks of these
                    two chains, but may be partially produced by the difference of their aspect and
                    exposure. In Lammetmoor the gradual rise of the mountains, and their continuity,
                    afford little natural shelter. In the Cheviots, the mountains; springing
                    separately from their bases in a conical form, protect each other in every
                    direction. The sheep pastured in this extensive district are partly the Cheviot,
                    but chiefly the black-faced mountain sheep, common in the other highlands of
                    Scotland.</p>
                <p>The Merse, the other great division of the county, rises gradually from the
                    valley of the Tweed to the foot of these mountains. Though presenting from an
                    eminence the appearance of an unbroken plane inclining towards the south and
                    east, and surrounded on other sides by the high grounds, it yet possesses much
                    diversity of surface, forming in some places considerable swells, and in others
                    valleys through which the rivers and streamlets of the country find their way to
                    a lower level. At some parts the elevations are considerable, as at Dunse Law,
                    contiguous to the Lammermoor range, and at Home-Castle, situated on an elevation
                    of trap-rock, at the western part of the plain of the Merse, 898 feet above the
                    level of the sea. This castle, which forms a beautiful object to the surrounding
                    country, is merely a slight modern structure, built upon the ruins of the
                    ancient edifice, which, on the refusal of the governor to surrender, was
                    destroyed by a detachment of the army of Oliver Cromwell. The whole of the
                    tract, from this point eastward to the sea, as well as the low land to the
                    westward, is admirably cultivated, subdivided by innumerable hedges, and
                    everywhere ornamented by plantations, pleasure-grounds, and country seats, and,
                    above all, by excellent farm-houses; presenting an appearance of industry and
                    rural prosperity nowhere surpassed, and forming a striking contrast to the
                    wretchedness and habits of plunder by which, till the union of the British
                    crown, the inhabitants of this, as of all the border districts, had never ceased
                    to be distinguished.</p>
                <p>The rivers of the county are, the Tweed, which skirts it for about 27 miles, and
                    falls into the sea at Berwick; the Whitadder and the Blackadder, both taking
                    their rise in different parts of the Lammermoor Hills, and, after uniting,
                    falling into the Tweed; the Eye, running into the sea at Eyemouth; the Leader,
                    which gives its name to Lauderdale; of smaller note the Dye, the Leet, and, for
                    a short part of its course, before it enters Roxburghshire, the Eden.</p>
                <p>The salmon-fishery of the river Tweed is very valuable, and has been the subject
                    of many royal grants. Within the limits of the township of Berwick, it becomes
                    mostly the property of that corporation. The fish, which are caught in vast
                    numbers, chiefly near the mouth, are taken to Berwick, where they are packed in
                    ice and shipped for the London market.</p>
                <p>The geological state of the county, with relation to its minerals, does not
                    present peculiar interest. Thin seams of coal have been found traversing the
                    sandstone of the lower country; but none of a thickness to be worked has yet
                    been discovered, except in the parish of Mordington, near the sea, where it is
                    said seams of workable thickness exist. T ns valuable mineral is brought by a
                    distant land-carriage fiom the mines south of the Tweed, and from the Lothians.
                    Limestone is found in various places, but cannot be worked with advantage, owing
                    to the want of coal; and the immense quantity of it used for the purposes of
                    agriculture is therefore brought by a costly land-carriage from the adjoining
                    counties. Clay-marl, found chiefly along the banks of the Whitadder and
                    Blackadder, was once extensively employed as a manure; but it has for many years
                    given place to lime. Gypsum exists in small quantities on the banks of the
                    Whitadder. Shell-marl is found in different places, and is worked to a
                    considerable extent in the parish of Merton. Sandstone of different kinds occurs
                    throughout the greater part of the county. That at Dryburgh, on the Tweed, is of
                    fine grain, and is supposed to have furnished the stone of that beautiful
                    structure, Melrose Abbey. Slate, but not of good quality, has been found and
                    worked near Lauder. A species of breccia, or coarse pudding-stone, occurs in
                    some places. The outer pier of the harbour of Eyemouth is builζ without cement,
                    of stone of this kind, taken from an adjoining promontory, and has withstood for
                    a long period the storms of the German Ocean, without apparent waste. Copper has
                    been found in some places. At Ordwell, on the Whitadder, attempts were made to
                    work the ore many years ago. Other attempts have been recently made in different
                    places, but they have been unsuccessful.</p>
                <p>Berwickshire has been long noted for the excellence of its agriculture. This is
                    chiefly distinguished by the judicious combination of pasturage with tillage,
                    usually termed the convertible husbandry, under which system a considerable
                    portion of each farm is kept in grass, and the land is changed from tillage to
                    pasturage in regular succession. Great attention has been paid to the breeding
                    of stock. The short-horned breed of cattle is introduced into all the lower
                    district, and in many cases into the higher. The sheep of the lower country are
                    the new Leicester breed, and have been brought to great perfection by the
                    example of many eminent breeders. Farms are generally large, a common size being
                    from 400 to 500 acres. The farm-houses and out-buildings are generally
                    substantial and convenient.</p>
                <p>The towns are few and inconsiderable. Berwick, from which the county takes its
                    name, forms no part of it, though it is from it that the principal exports of
                    the county take place. The chief town with respect to population is Dunse. The
                    other towns are Eyemouth, Coldstream, Greenlaw, Lauder, and some others of no
                    note. Eyemouth is the only shipping port. The county town, though otherwise
                    inconsiderable, is Greenlaw.</p>
                <p>The valued rent of Berwickshire is L.I78,366. 8s. 6|įd. Scots; and the real rent,
                    as assessed to the propertytax for the year ending April 1811, was, for the
                    lands L.231,973. 2s. 7d., and for the houses L.8152. 17s. 6d. sterling. About a
                    third part of the valued rent is held under entail. In 1795 the rental was
                    estimated at L.l 12,000, so that it had more than doubled in sixteen years. It
                    is universally paid in money, and the farms are held on leases for a term of
                    years; here, as in every other part of Scotland, nineteen years being the most
                    common period.</p>
                <p>The manufactures of the district are inconsiderable, the principal being that of
                    paper. There are, indeed, bleachfields, breweries, corn-mills, and similar small
                    establishments, but these are chiefly for the home supply. The principal export
                    of the county is raw produce; and the imports are coal, lime, timber, iron, and
                    other commodities for the consumption of the inhabitants. The grain is chiefly
                    exported to the London market from Berwick. The cattle and sheep are driven
                    partly to Edinburgh, but chiefly to Morpeth and other markets of the south.
                    Besides the salmon-fishery before referred to, there is a seafishery, of which
                    the principal stations are Evemouth and Coldingham.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:193197102" xml:id="kp-eb0704-7102-0599"/>
                <p>The antiquities of Berwickshire consist in the remains of rude military works,
                    tumuli, and cairns; in the traces of military stations of a later age,
                    distinguished from those of the early inhabitants by the square instead of the
                    circular form; and in the ruins of many towns and castles, erected during ages
                    of unhappy feuds,—all of which time and the progress of cultivation are fast
                    obliterating. Of the religious houses, once so numerous, few remain. One of the
                    most famous of these, the priory of Coldingham, was burnt by the earl of
                    Hertford, in his barbarous inroad into Scotland in the year 1545. The abbey of
                    Dryburgh shared the same fate, and by the same hands, though its ruins yet
                    remain to delight the eye of the traveller. The deep glen called the Pease, in
                    the north-east angle of the county, on the road from Edinburgh to Berwick, has
                    been celebrated in history as one of the natural defences of Scotland. <hi
                    rend="subscript"> ¼</hi> The bridge thrown over it consists of four arches; and
                    its romantic situation, and the great height above the stream below, used to be
                    an object of some curiosity. But the modern road now conducts the traveller at a
                    little distance from it.</p>
                <p>Berwickshire is divided into thirty-three parishes, two of which, however, are
                    annexed to parishes in the adjoining counties; these are Home, annexed to
                    Stitchel in Roxburghshire, and a part of the parish of Oldhamstocks in East
                    Lothian. Regular assessments for the poor have long been established, and in
                    some of the districts have become very heavy.</p>
                <p>By the returns made to Dr Webster in 1755, the population was 24,946. The
                    following table exhibits the returns for 1811, 1821, and 1831.</p>

                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Berwick, North,</hi> a town and parish of Scotland,’ in the
                    county of Haddington, situated on the coast of the Frith of Forth, with a small
                    harbour, but little or no trade. The town was constituted a royal burgh by James
                    VI. The population of the parish is 1727, of which about 700 reside in the town.
                    It is distant from Haddington nine miles, and from Edinburgh twenty-two
                    east.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Berwick-upon-Tweed</hi> is situated on the north side of the
                    river Tweed, about half a mile from its mouth. It is a borough possessing, with
                    its liberties, which extend about three miles, many of the characteristics of a
                    “town and county,” but it is not, as is often erroneously stated, a town and
                    county of itself, neither is it within any county. Berwick being the threshold
                    of the Scottish kingdom in entering from England, it repeatedly suffered in the
                    wars between the two hostile nations, particularly at that disastrous era when
                    Edward I. trampled upon Scottish liberty. It was in the castle of this town that
                    that ambitious monarch, as lord paramount, put Baliol in possession of the crown
                    of Scotland. Previously to its conquest by King Edward I. it was the chief or
                    county town of Berwickshire, but it is now part of the kingdom of England. By a
                    charter granted by King James I. the town and its liberties, which are
                    incorporated, enjoy many valuable privileges of a peculiar nature. The justices
                    of the peace are elected by the corporation, not by the crown. They hold courts
                    for the trial of all manner of offenders, and have the power of inflicting
                    capital punishment; and the English judges of assize have no jurisdiction there.
                    The civil courts, for the recovery of debts, damages, and such like, are also
                    unlimited and supreme, subject however to the revision of the courts of
                    Westminster Hall. The corporation, consisting of above 1000 freemen, of whom
                    about a half reside in the borough, are the owners of a considerable proportion
                    of the lands and tenements within the liberties, which produce an annual revenue
                    of about L.12,000, part of which is expended Jn supporting the public
                    institutions of the town, includ- <hi rend="superscript"> ln</hi> g several
                    excellent schools, and the remainder divided amongst the burgesses. The town is
                    surrounded by walls, ſhe town-hall is an elegant structure, with a stately spire
                    150 feet high, in which there are eight bells. The parish church is a spacious
                    and commodious building. It has no steeple, having been built in the time of the
                    puritans. The bridge over the Tweed contains fifteen arches, and measures 1164
                    feet in length, but it is only seventeen feet in width. The barracks, for
                    infantry, form a handsome quadrangle, and are capable of accommodating upwards
                    of 600 men. The town cannot boast of any manufactories of the least importance,
                    and it has recently lost one of its main sources of income, an immense
                    exportation of pork and eggs to London, which is now supplied by Ireland and the
                    continent. The trade of Berwick is at present principally confined to the
                    exportation of corn and salmon. The Tweed is a navigable river as high as the
                    bridge, but the entrance is narrowed by sand banks, to obviate which a stone
                    pier, about half a mile in length, terminated by a light-house, has been
                    recently constructed. The quays and warehouses are commodious. There are two
                    weekly markets on Wednesday and Saturday; and an annual fair on the Friday in
                    Trinity week, for horses, cattle, and sheep. The castle, which once gave dignity
                    and afforded protection to the town, is a mass of ruins. Berwick sends two
                    members to parliament. It contains 463 houses. The population, according to the
                    census of 1831, consists of 3937 males, 4983 females; total 8920. It is 336
                    miles N. W. from London, and 56 S. E. from Edinburgh. Long. 2. 3. W. Lat. 55.
