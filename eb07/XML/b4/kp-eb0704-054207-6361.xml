                    said to have been the founder of the ancient Babylonish empire, and, in
                    conjunction with Arbaces the Mede, to have put an end to the empire of the
                    Assyrians by the defeat and death of Sardanapalus. This prince is variously
                    represented as a crafty, mean-spirited knave, and as a hero of enterprise and
                    renown. Arbaces, his colleague and friend, he is said to have circumvented in
                    the most shameful manner. Having been privately informed by a eunuch that
                    immense treasure had been buried in the conflagration at Nineveh, and being
                    aware that Arbaces knew nothing of the circumstance, his avarice suggested to
                    him the following artifice for obtaining possession of all that the flames had
                    left tmdestroyed. He alleged that, during the war, he had vowed to Belus that,
                    in the event of success, and the palace of the Assyrian monarch being consumed
                    by fire, he would collect the ashes, remove them to Babylon, and there heap them
                    up in a mound near the temple of the god, as a perpetual monument of the
                    subversion of the Assyrian empire; and he now craved permission of his colleague
                    to perform his pretended vow. The trick succeeded to his wish. Arbaces not only
                    granted his request, but appointed him king of Babylon, with an exemption from
                    all tribute; and Belesis carried a prodigious treasure with him to Babylon. But
                    the secret having been discovered, he was called to an account for it, tried by
                    the other chiefs who had assisted in the war, and, on confessing the crime, was
                    condemned to lose his head. Arbaces, however, being a munificent and generous
                    prince, freely forgave him, left him in possession of the treasure, and also
                    confirmed him in the government of Babylon, saying, that the good he had done
                    ought to serve as a veil to cover his crime; and thus he became at once a prince
                    of great wealth and dominion.</p>
                <p>But fortune begot folly, and under the successor of Arbaces, Nanybrus, as he was
                    now called, sunk into a degree of effeminacy altogether unworthy of the
                    conqueror of Sardanapalus; and this again, by a natural enough transition, led
                    him to the commission of cruelty. Understanding that a certain robust Mede,
                    called Parsondas, held him in the utmost contempt, and had solicited the king of
                    the Medes to divest him of his dominions, he offered a great reward to the man
                    who should take Parsondas and bring him captive to Babylon. This was effected by
                    stratagem. Parsondas was seized while asleep, bound, and carried before
                    Nanybrus, who bitterly reproached the captive for endeavouring to estrange the
                    king of the Medes from him, and by that means place himself on the throne of
                    Babylon. Parsondas did not deny the charge, but with great intrepidity owned
                    that he thought himself more worthy of a crown than such an indolent and
                    effeminate prince as that before whom he stood. Nanybrus, highly provoked at the
                    liberty taken by the prisoner, swore by the god Belus that Parsondas himself
                    should in a short time reproach none with effeminacy. Accordingly, he ordered
                    the eunuch who had the charge of his music women to shave, paint, and dress him
                    after the manner of those females, and, in short, by all possible means to
                    transform him mtθ a woman. His orders were obeyed to the letter.</p>
                <p>In the mean time, the king of the Medes having in vain sought after his favourite
                    servant, and offered great rewards for information concerning him, concluded
                    that he had been destroyed by some wild beast in the chase. But at the end of
                    seven years the Mede was informed o his state and condition by a eunuch, who,
                    having been cruelly scourged by order of Nanybrus, fled into Media . the
                    instigation of Parsondas, and there disclosed the who &lt; <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193196374" xml:id="kp-eb0704-6374-0543"/>truth to the king. Upon this,
                    the latter immediately dispatched an officer to demand Parsondas. But Nanybrus
                    pretended to know nothing of any such person; upon which another officer was
                    sent by the Mcde, with a peremptory arder to seize on Nanybrus himself if he
                    persisted in the denial, to bind him with his girdle, and lead him to immediate
                    execution. This order had the desired effect. The Baby-onian owned what he had
                    before denied; and Parsondas vas at length set at liberty. But so great a change
                    had aken place in his appearance, that on presenting himself jefore the king of
                    the Medes the latter could scarcely recognise his old servant. The only favour
                    which Parsondas ιow begged of the king for all his past services, was, that ıe
                    would avenge on the Babylonian the base and highly njurious treatment of his
                    servant and petitioner. The Mede accordingly marched to Babylon; and
                    notwithstanding the remonstrances of Nanybrus, who urged that Parsondas had
                    endeavoured to deprive him both of his kingdom and his life, the monarch
                    declared that in ten days time would be passed on him the sentence which he
                    deserved, for presuming to act as judge in his own cause, instead af appealing
                    to his sovereign. But Nanybrus having in the mean time gained Mitraphernes, the
                    Mede’s favourite eunuch, the king was by him prevailed on only to sentence the
                    Babylonian to pay a pecuniary fine; which made Parsondas curse the man who first
                    found out gold, for the sake of which he was doomed to live the sport and
                    derision of an effeminate Babylonian, and to die unavenged.</p>
