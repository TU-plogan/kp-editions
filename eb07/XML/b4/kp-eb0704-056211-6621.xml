                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra

                    History,</hi> an order of monks who profess to follow the rules of St Benedict.
                    The Benedictines, who of all the regular clergy are alone entitled to the
                    appellation of <hi rend="italic">monks,</hi> wear a loose black gown with large
                    wide sleeves, and a capuche or cowl on their heads, ending in a point behind. In
                    the canon law they are styled <hi rend="italic">black friars,</hi> from the
                    colour of their habit-</p>
                <p>The rules of St Benedict, as observed by the English monks before the dissolution
                    of the monasteries, were as follows: The monks of this order were obliged to
                    perform, seven times in twenty-four hours, their devotions, the whole circle of
                    which had reference to the passion and death of Christ; they always went two and
                    two together; every day in Lent they fasted till six in the evening, and abated
                    of their usual time of sleeping and eating, but they were not allowed to
                    practise any voluntary austerity without leave of their superior; they never
                    conversed in their refectory at meals, but were obliged to attend to the reading
                    of the Scriptures; and they all slept in the same dormitory, but not two in a
                    bed, and they lay in their clothes. For sma faults they were shut out from
                    meals, for greater they were debarred religious commerce and excluded from tn

                    were excluded from the monasteries. Every monk had two coats, two cowls, a
                    table-book, a knife, a needle, and a handkerchief; and the furniture of their
                    cells was a mat, a blanket, a rug, and a pillow.</p>
                <p>The time when this order came into England is well known; for to it the English
                    owe their conversion from idolatry. In the year 596 Pope Gregory sent hither
                    Augustin, prior of the monastery of St Andrew at Rome, with several other
                    Benedictine monks. Augustin became archbishop of Canterbury, and the
                    Benedictines founded several monasteries in England, as also the metropolitan
                    church of Canterbury, and all the cathedrals that were afterwards erected.</p>
                <p>Pope John XXII., who died in 1334, found, after an exact inquiry, that, since the
                    first rise of the order, it had produced 24 popes, near 200 cardinals, 7000
                    archbishops, 15,000 bishops, 15,000 abbots, above 4000 saints, and upwards of
                    37,000 monasteries. There have been likewise of this order 20 emperors and 10
                    empresses, 47 kings and above 50 queens, 20 sons of emperors and 48 sons of
                    kings, above 100 princesses, daughters of kings and emperors, besides dukes,
                    marquises, earls, countesses, &amp;c. innumerable. The order has produced a vast
                    number of eminent writers and other learned men. Rabanus set up the school of
                    Germany; Alcuinus founded the university of Paris; Dionysius Exiguus perfected
                    the ecclesiastical computation; Guido invented the scale of music, Sylvester the
                    organ; and they boast of having produced Ansel-mus, Ildephonsus, Venerable Bede,
                    and many others of equal or superior name. There are nuns likewise who follow
                    the rule of St Benedict.</p>
