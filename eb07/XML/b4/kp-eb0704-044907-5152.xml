                <p><label type="entry">BATNEARS, or <hi rend="smallcaps">Batties</hi></label>, a
                    people of the northern part of Hindostan, inhabiting a country which extends
                    about 200 miles in length and 100 in breadth, and of which the capital is
                    Batncar, situated, according to some authorities 170, and according to others
                    219 miles west-north-west of Delhi. This country comprehends part of the
                    province of Delhi, Lahore, and Ajmeer.</p>
                <p>The Batties present many peculiarities in manners and customs, distinguishing
                    them from the other people of Hindostan. They seem to consist of three different
                    races; the chief are Rajpoot Mahommedans; the common people Jauts, who have
                    adopted the same religion; and the cultivators of the soil are called Ryots, a
                    very peaceable and inoffensive class. But in general they are characterized as
                    shepherds; and although principally restricted to the territory whence their
                    name is derived, various tribes of them are to be found in the Punjab, and they
                    are also scattered over the high grounds to the east of the Indus. But great
                    obscurity prevails in every thing regarding them.</p>
                <p>The Batties are Mahommedans, and highly venerate the memory of a certain saint,
                    Scheik Fereed, who flourished in the fifteenth century; and it is said that,
                    however adverse to their natural disposition, should any one, in invoking his
                    name, claim their protection, it is never withheld. Yet their customs, in other
                    respects, are at variance with those of the Mahommedans, particularly in the
                    females appearing, without any reserve, unveiled in public, and in their
                    associating promiscuously with the men, as in other countries. The wives of the
                    Rajpoot chiefs form an exception; and it is reported among these Rajpoots, that
                    their ancestors migrated some centuries ago from the district of Jessulmere,
                    and, after various vicissitudes, settled in the Batnear country. Most of the
                    inhabitants under their rule were originally Jauts, dwelling on the western bank
                    of the river Sutledge, in the twenty-ninth degree of north latitude, and who
                    have not been known long in the portion of the peninsula now occupied by them.
                    Having embraced the Mahommedan faith, they were invited by an ancestor of the
                    rajah of the Batties, about a century ago, to cross the river and settle in his
                    country, where their posterity still reside. The Jauts constitute the lower
                    orders of the people, and are treated with great moderation by their
                    superiors.</p>
                <p>The whole territory, extending as above described, is apparently under the
                    dominion of a supreme prince or rajah, whose authority is acknowledged by
                    inferior chiefs or rajahs; for the term rajah, in strictness, applies to none
                    <pb break="no" facs="nls:193195165" xml:id="kp-eb0704-5165-0450"/> but those
                    invested with a paramount rule. This potentate can bring 20,000 or 30,000 men
                    into the field, but they are quite undisciplined, and despise the necessary
                    principle of subordination. His revenue chiefly arises from the plundering of
                    his troops, for their wars are directed more to predatory purposes than to open
                    contest; and the rajah, instead of repressing the ravages of this immense
                    banditti, willingly participates in the spoils. When strangers observed to him
                    that the soil and agriculture of his country were sufficient to enable his
                    subjects to enjoy plenty, he replied, that the number of Rajpoots in his service
                    was so considerable, compared with the mass of the people, that, should he
                    attempt to restrain the depredations of the latter, the subversion of his own
                    authority might ensue, because it would be interfering with old and established
                    customs. The rajah who made this remark was in every respect a good and humane
                    character.</p>
                <p>But the people over whom he rules are by no means entitled to the same repute;
                    they are of a cruel, savage, and ferocious disposition; they entertain an utter
                    abhorrence of the usages of civilized life; they arc thieves from their earliest
                    infancy, and, during their predatory incursions into the neighbouring districts,
                    do not scruple, though unresisted, to add murder to robbery. This systematic
                    plundering produces a revenue of above L.120,000 per annum to their princes; at
                    least that is the conjectural amount, for there are no data whereon to found
                    exact calculations.</p>
                <p>Many of the Batties appear to be entirely nomadic, changing their residence from
                    place to place, as subsistence fails. Their exports are horses, camels,
                    bullocks, buffaloes, and ghee; and they sell some surplus grain above what is
                    necessary for their own consumption; but their traffic is very inconsiderable,
                    and what they do carry on is with the petty merchants of Behadra, Nohur, and
                    other towns, through the means of the disciples of the !Scheik Fereed, their
                    favourite saint. A large portion of the country is unproductive; but along the
                    banks of the river Cuggur, from Batnear to the town of Futtahbad, the soil is
                    uncommonly rich, and well adapted for cultivation. The inundations of this river
                    fertilize its banks, and the subsidence of the waters leaves them to <hi
                    rend="italic">a</hi> great distance prepared for plentiful crops of wheat, rice,
                    and barley, amply rewarding the labours of the husbandman. It is the scarcity of
                    water which occasions the barrenness of the ground; nevertheless, more is raised
                    than the inhabitants can consume. Their horses are numerous; but it is computed
                    that they lose a fourth of them annually by the sting or bite of a winged
                    insect, the injured part degenerating into an incurable cancerous sore.</p>
                <p>We are unacquainted with any river of note in this district, excepting the
                    Cuggur, which is lost in the sands to the westward. According to the tradition
                    of the natives, it changed its course in consequence of its original bed having
                    been choked up by immense quantities of earth forced down from the
                    mountains.</p>
                <p>The capital of the Batties is Batnear, which lies in a situation almost
                    inaccessible to an enemy; for no water is to be procured within twelve miles,
                    but what supplies the inhabitants; however, it was taken in 1398 by Timour, and
                    more recently by General Thomas. Their other principal towns are Arroa,
                    Futtahbad, Sirsa, and Ramgah; and there are many forts, which, though
                    defenceless against the skill of European troops, are impregnable to the
                    irregular marauders of Hindostan. Numbers of the Batties have latterly emigrated
                    from their native country, to establish themselves in the western parts of the
                    dominions of Oude; and several families of them are to be met with in Rohilcund.
                    They are practised travellers, and well trained to emigration by the laborious
                    journeys undertaken in crossing the great desert to the west of their
                    territories. These expeditions are frequently made in large parties, for the
                    purpose of a predatory incursion on some peaceable country more remote; and they
                    exemplify both skill and determination in attaining their object. Camels
                    previously laden with provisions are dispatched to different stations in the
                    desert, which is about 130 miles in breadth, and their loads deposited there.
                    The most intelligent of the party about to follow are selected as guides, and
                    receive the most implicit obedience from their companions during the journey,
                    which closes at the frontier of the hostile country, or rather that against
                    which their hostility is directed. The guides, by long experience, become expert
                    without compass or land-mark, and seldom fail to conduct the party to the
                    appointed station where the provisions are deposited, and thence across the
                    remainder of the desert in safety. But should they accidentally miss the points
                    of rendezvous, or those where alone their necessities can be relieved, they are
                    exposed to inevitable destruction; and any of their party heedlessly straying
                    from the rest become the victims of the accumulated evils of hunger, thirst, and
                    fatigue. The adventurers steer their course by the sun in the day-time, and by
                    the polar star at night; and by similar aids they are enabled to retrace the way
                    they have travelled. Should provisions fail, a bullock is killed, roasted, and
                    partitioned on the spot, and, after a hasty meal, the journey is resumed.</p>
                <p>The history of the Batties has attracted the notice of few European authors. They
                    seem to carry on frequent wars with neighbouring states, and are the most
                    formidable enemies that oppose the rajah of Beykaneer. The latter invaded their
                    territories in the beginning of the present century, but without success, which
                    is not surprising, considering the comparative smallness of the force which he
                    can bring into the field, and the nature of the country. Temporary advantages
                    were, notwithstanding, obtained over the Batties, and the Beykaneer rajah
                    erected a fortress in Batinda, which, if not within their territory, is on its
                    immediate confines. This contributed to overawe them for a time, and repressed
                    their incursions into his own dominions; as, independently of the garrison, he
                    stationed a large body of cavalry in the fort, whose frequent sallies and
                    captures of cattle annoyed the Batties so much that they contemplated a total
                    emigration from their own country. Buta military adventurer, George Thomas, an
                    Irishman by birth, who, endowed with singular talents and intrepidity, had
                    founded for himself an independent state in the north-west of India, was then at
                    war with the province of Beykaneer. Having reached its frontiers, the Batties
                    solicited his alliance, and, to induce him to espouse their cause the more
                    readily, offered him 40,000 rupees, if he would reduce the obnoxious fort. It
                    appears that the Beykalleer forces were now masters of Batnear, the capital,
                    whither General Thomas, who had accepted the proposals of the Batties, marched
                    to dislodge them. He found a numerous garrison, and, having brought up his
                    artillery, began to batter the place, preparatory to an assault. This, however,
                    the enemy avoided by capitulation, and they were allowed to evacuate the city
                    with the honours of war, while the Batties immediately took possession of it. In
                    further prosecution of the war, several actions ensued, and various fortresses
                    were taken; but it would appear, that one of the Battie chiefs, at variance with
                    General Thomas, commenced hostilities against him, about the period now alluded
                    to; and, in this new warfare with his late allies, his forces were so much
                    reduced by repeated encounters, that, being scarcely able to stand an
                    engagement, he fortified his camps. The Batties, after frequent attacks,
                    withdrew their troops by night, whereupon General Thomas tookan burnt Futtahbad
                    and other places, and might have occupied<pb break="no" facs="nls:193195178"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0704-5178-0451"/> the whole country, but a neighbouring chief
                    having concluded an alliance with the Batties, and sent 1000 cavalry to their
                    aid, General Thomas retreated to Jyjur, a town within his own territory.</p>
