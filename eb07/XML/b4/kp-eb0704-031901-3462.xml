                    It is one of the most ancient species of composition, and still constitutes a
                    great portion of the literature of the more uncivilized tribes of mankind.
                    Giovanni Finati, who supplies us with much information respecting the manners
                    and customs of the East, has recorded the following anecdote of
                    ballad-literature among the Benysackr Arabs, whom he found encamped near the
                    shores of the Dead Sea. Their chief, Ibn Fays, he states, “had strangers with
                    him from Damascus, and feasted his guests so plentifully, that the wooden dish
                    out of which we all fed had four iron handles to it, and required three persons
                    to lift it and set it before us. Afterwards, a great earthen pan of grease was
                    lighted as a lamp for the company, and Ibn Fays himself, and his brother, sung a
                    sort of slow plaintive ballad to an instrument with one string, the purport of
                    which was the tragic account of a battle against a neighbouring tribe, in which
                    their own father perished·”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    be the author, as well as the reciter, of the ballad which thus regaled his
                    guests.</p>
                <p>Most of the nations of modern Europe have considerable collections of the ballads
                    which delighted their forefathers; and in some countries the political influence
                    of such compositions has been found to be very powerful. “Of these,” says Dr
                    Aikin, “the most copious source is party; and there has seldom been an occasion
                    of political contest in countries permitting such freedoms, in which appeal has
                    not been made to the popular feelings by means of comic and satirical ballads,
                    often with great effect. The share that <hi rend="italic">Lilliburlero</hi> had
                    in producing the Revolution in this country has been noticed by grave
                    historians. In the war of the Fronde in France, ballads were a weapon as much
                    employed as muskets, and those written for and against Cardinal Mazarin filled
                    several volumes. The French give to these compositions the appropriate title of
                    <hi rend="italic">Vaudeville,</hi> implying their fitness to walk the streets;
                    and indeed street-poetry iñ general belongs to the ballad class.”<note

                    collections of their early ballads; but the affinity of our own nation and
                    tongue with those of the northern tribes, renders their literary reliques an
                    object of more particular interest. The various tribes of Scandinavians have
                    generally been distinguished for their love of poetry. Many ancient reliques of
                    Islandic poetry are still preserved, and are regarded as very curious specimens
                    of the literature of the different ages to which they belong; nor are the
                    kindred nations of Sweden and Denmark without their early and recent poets, some
                    of whom have attained to high reputation. Of the ballad-poetry of these northern
                    nations, many remnants have descended to our times; and ample collections of
                    Danish, Swedish, and even Feroese ballads have recently been published by
                    respectable editors, “The songs mentioned by Tacitus in his account of the
                    Germans,” says Mr Jamieson, “those collected by the order of Charlemagne, and
                    those which the Goths brought with them out of the East, are now not to be
                    found; yet it is more than probable that much more of them is preserved, in
                    however altered a form, than we are aware of; in the elder northern and Teutonic
                    romances, the Danish and Swedish, Scottish and English popular ballads, and
                    those which are sung by old women and nurses, and hawked about at fairs, in
                    Germany.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Illustrations

                    expressed his conviction, that many of the traditionary ballads still current in
                    this kingdom have been preserved in the north of England and the lowlands of
                    Scotland, ever since the arrival of the Cimbri in Britain.<note anchored="true"

                    may at all events be considered as the productions of a remote period; but it is
                    not to be supposed that they have been transmitted from one generation to
                    another without innumerable transformations. A great proportion of them have
                    doubtless been preserved by oral tradition; and they seem in general to have
                    undergone such changes as brought them nearer to the current speech of each
                    successive generation; for, without this progressive adaptation, the lapse of a
                    few centuries would have rendered them unintelligible to the great body of the
                    people; nor is it usual for any combination of words to be retained in the
                    memory without being understood. Thus, for example, we have reason to believe
                    that the ballad of Sir Patrick Spence derives its origin from a very early age;
                    but the variations to which it must gradually have been subjected, may easily be
                    inferred from a comparison of the different copies which are now to be
                    found.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic"

                    when most of the original words have been changed. The close affinity between
                    the old Danish and the old Scotish and English ballads has been noticed by
                    various writers, by Pinkerton, Jamieson, Nyerup, Geijer, and Grimm:<note

                    and contrivance of the poems; while some of the Danish and Scotish ballads
                    exhibit a remarkable coincidence in their particular stories. Whether these
                    effects <pb break="no" facs="nls:193193475" xml:id="kp-eb0704-3475-0320"/>are to
                    be imputed to so remote a cause as the emigration of the ancient Scandinavians,
                    may however admit of much doubt and hesitation. Fiction moves from one region to
                    another with very elastic steps, and in many instances it is impossible to trace
                    her progress.</p>
                <p>The earliest collector of Danish ballads was Anders Sorensön Vedel, chaplain to
                    the king of Denmark, and an intimate friend of the celebrated astronomer Tyge
                    Brahe. His publication bears the title of an hundred select Danish ballads, <hi
                    rend="italic">or Et hundrede vduaalde Danske Viser.</hi> Ribe, 1591, 8vo. It is
                    now a very rare book, even in Denmark; but a copious account of it is given by
                    Nyerup, in the last volume of the more recent collection of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Danske Viser.</hi> After an interval of more than a century, another clergyman,
                    Peder Syv, reprinted this collection of Vedel, and added an equal number of
                    ballads. Kiöbenhavn, 1695, 8vo. But the most extensive collection appeared under
                    the following title: <hi rend="italic">Udvalgte Danske Viser fra
                    AIiddelalderen;</hi> efter A. S. Vedels og P. Syvs trykte Udgaver, og efter

                    Kiöbenhavn, 1812-14, 5 Bind. 8vo. This work is accompanied with notes and
                    illustrations, and appears to us to possess no inconsiderable value. A similar
                    collection of Swedish ballads was published by Geijer and Afzelius: <hi
                    rend="italic">Svenska Folk-Visor frŭm Forntiden</hi><hi rend="italic subscript">

                    Stockholm, 1814-16, 3 del. 8vo. These volumes are accompanied with music,
                    printed in a quarto form. Of Feroese ballads there is a recent collection: <hi

                    med en Indledning af P. Ľ. Müller, Dr. og Prof, i Theol. Randers, 1822, 8vo. Dr
                    Müller, the author of the introduction, is a learned and able writer, well known
                    as the author of more important works.</p>
                <p>Debes mentions that, at their weddings, and at Christmas, the Feroese w ere
                    accustomed to “recreate themselves with a plain dance, holding one another by
                    the hand, and singing some old champion’s ballad.”<note anchored="true"

                    is removed to a considerable distance from the Islandic as well as the Danish.
                    The plan of publishing a Feroese dictionary was formed about half a century ago;
                    and the English prospectus printed upon that occasion furnishes so curious and
