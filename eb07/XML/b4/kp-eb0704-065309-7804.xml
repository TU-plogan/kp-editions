                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra

                <p><label type="entry">BISSAGOS</label>, a group of small, low, fertile islands,
                    situated at or near the mouth of the Rio Grande, in Western Africa. The entire
                    number of these islands is very great, but there are only sixteen of any
                    considerable magnitude. These arc, Bissao, Bulama, Tale, Bussi, Man terre,
                    Canabae, Galincis, Arcas, Formosa, Carache, Corbelle, Genthera, Cavallo, Mel,
                    Casegu, and Cove. The first five are mere alluvial islands, separated by
                    river-branches from the continent, of which they properly form part. The others
                    lie twenty or thirty miles out at sea, extending in a northwesterly direction
                    towards the Gambia. Among the many smaller islands may be mentioned Bourbon,
                    Sarcicri, Poc-lon, Papango, and Los Poarcos. Along the exterior side of these
                    islands, where they face the ocean, extend numerous banks, which render the
                    navigation very dangerous, and require vessels to make constant and careful
                    soundings.</p>
                <p>The Bissagos islands arc generally level and fertile, particularly those closely
                    adjoining the continent; as Bissao, the largest, and Bulama, immediately at the
                    mouth of the Rio Grande. They produce abundantly millet, rice, and fruits, and
                    are well stocked with a peculiar breed of oxen, having a hump on the back, and
                    remarkable for size and strength. The inhabitants are tall and robust, yet
                    fierce, turbulent, and warlike. This character applies to the Papels, who occupy
                    Bissao and the adjoining continent, and still more to the Bissagos or Bijugas,
                    who possess most of the remaining islands. They have almost entirely driven out
                    the Biafaras, a mild and industrious race, who have been obliged to seek refuge
                    on the continent along the banks of the Rio Grande. In 1792 some mercantile
                    adventurers in England formed the Bulama association, with the view of forming a
                    settlement on the island of that name. The fertility, and happy situation at the
                    mouth of a great river, appeared to offer flattering prospects; a considerable
                    sum of money was quickly subscribed, and on the 11th April three vessels with
                    275 colonists sailed for Africa, under the command of Mr Dalrymple. They sailed
                    to Bulama, which happened then to be wholly uninhabited; the Bissagos having
                    driven out the Biafaras, its former population, without themselves forming any
                    permanent settlement. The expedition was quietly taking possession of the
                    island, when the Bissagos from Canabae, considering this occupation as much too
                    unceremonious, attacked the party, and killed and carried off several of their
                    number. Mr Dalrymple then retired to Bissao, where he met a hospitable
                    reception, and then opened a communication with the king of Canabae, who was
                    induced for a very moderate consideration to cede to the king of Great Britain,
                    in perpetuity, the dominion of the island of Bulama. A settlement was then
                    effected without delay; but the colonists, hastily assembled, and consisting in
                    a great measure of loose and desperate characters, were found very unfit to
                    encounter the hardships and difficulties of a new establishment. Finding that,
                    instead of being placed in a situation of ease and luxury, they were obliged to
                    begin by clearing, sowing, and planting a soil, fertile indeed, but nearly
                    uncultivated, they lost courage, and mostly returned home in the vessel which
                    brought them to Bulama. Captain Beaver was left with little more than twenty
                    men, when he made the most extraordinary and meritorious efforts to maintain his
                    ground amid multiplied disadvantages. His little party were reduced by sickness
                    to only <pb break="no" facs="nls:193197817" xml:id="kp-eb0704-7817-0654"/>ten
                    effectives, when the king of Canabac declared “they were his chickens,” and
                    resolved to resume by force possession of Bulama. He was gallantly beaten off;
                    but the difficulties and distresses of the colony continuing to increase,
                    without any prospect of a successful issue, Beaver took the first opportunity of
                    conveying the remnant of his colony to Sierra Leone. An expenditure of L. 10,000
                    was thus incurred to no purpose; nor has any subsequent attempt been made to
                    colonize either these islands or any part of the adjoining coast.</p>
