                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra
                    space around the <gi>pb</gi> tag. Where a word is hyphenated at a <gi>pb</gi>,

                    Philip</hi></label>, an extraordinaryinstance of the early and rapid expansion
                    of the mental faculties. This surprising genius was the son of Francis
                    Baratière, minister of the French church at Schwobach, near Nuremberg, where he
                    was born on the 10th January 1721. The French was his mother tongue, together
                    with some words of High Dutch; but in consequence of his father insensibly
                    talking Latin to him, it became as familiar to him as his native idiom; so that,
                    without knowing the rules of grammar, he, at four years of age, talked French to
                    his mother, Latin to his father, High Dutch to the maid or neighbouring
                    children, and all this without mixing or confounding the respective languages.
                    About the middle of his fifth year he acquired Greek in like manner; so that in
                    fifteen months he perfectly understood all the Greek books in the Old and New
                    Testament, which he readily translated into Latin. When he was five years and
                    eight months old, he entered upon Hebrew, and in three years became so expert in
                    the Hebrew text, that from a Bible without points he could give the sense of the
                    original in Latin or French, or translate extempore the Latin or French versions
                    into Hebrew, almost word for word; he also acquired by heart all the Hebrew
                    psalms. He composed at this time a dictionary of rare and difficult Hebrew
                    words, with critical and philological observations; and, about his tenth year,
                    amused himself for twelve months in reading the rabbinical writers. With these
                    he intermixed the study of the Chaldaic, Syriac, and Arabic; and acquired a
                    taste for divinity and ecclesiastical antiquity, by studying the Greek fathers,
                    and the councils of the first four ages of the church. In the midst of these
                    occupations a pair of globes having come into his possession, he was able in
                    eight or ten days’ time to resolve all the problems on them; and in about three
                    months (January 1735) devised his project for the discovery of the longitude,
                    which he communicated to the Royal Society of London and the Royal Academy of
                    Sciences at Berlin. In J <hi rend="superscript"> un</hi> θ 1731 he was
                    matriculated in the university of Altorf; ana at the close of the year 1732 he
                    was presented by his father at the meeting of the reformed churches of t&gt; <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 1</hi> θ circle of Franconia, which, astonished at his
                    wonderful talents, admitted him to assist in the deliberations of the synod; and
                    in order to preserve the memory of so singular <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193193982" xml:id="kp-eb0704-3982-0359"/>an event, it was ordered to
                    be registered in their acts. In 1734 the margrave of Brandenburg-Anspach granted
                    this voun <hi rend="superscript"> σ</hi> scholar the use of whatever books he
                    wanted from the Anspach library, together with a pension of fifty florins, which
                    he enjoyed for three years; and his father receiving a call from the French
                    church at Stettin in Pomerania, young Baratière was, on the journey, admitted
                    master of arts, with universal applause, at the university of Halle. While at
                    Berlin he was honoured with several conversations with the king of Prussia, and
                    received into the Royal Academy. Towards the close of his life he acquired a
                    taste for the study of medals, inscriptions, and antiquities, which he relieved
                    with metaphysical inquiries, and investigations in experimental philosophy. He
                    wrote several essays and dissertations; made astronomical remarks and laborious
                    calculations; prepared materials for a history of the heresies of the
                    anti-trinitarians, and of the Thirty Years’ War in Germany; and, lastly, wrote a
                    treatise, which appeared in 1740, on the succession of the bishops of Rome. The
                    final work he engaged in, and for which he had accumulated large materials, was
                    <hi rend="italic">Inquiries concerning Egyptian Antiquities.</hi> But the
                    substance of this blazing meteor was now almost exhausted. He had always been
                    weak and sickly, and he died on the 5th October 1740, aged nineteen years, eight
                    months, and sixteen days. He published eleven different pieces, and left
                    twenty-nine manuscripts on various subjects, the contents of which may be seen
                    in his life, written by Μ. Formey, professor of philosophy at Berlin.</p>
