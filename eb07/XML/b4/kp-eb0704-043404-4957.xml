                    derived from the Greek <hi rend="italic">βαwαξ∣ς, meretrix,</hi> but with more
                    reason from the British <hi rend="italic">bastaerd, nothus, spurius,</hi> or
                    from the German <hi rend="italic">bastart,</hi> composed of <hi rend="italic"

                    >steort,</hi> an upstart, <hi rend="italic">homo novus),</hi> one whose father
                    and mother were not lawfully married previous to his or her birth, or, as it has
                    sometimes been loosely expressed, one born out of lawful wedlock.</p>
                <p>The civil and canon laws do notallow a child to remain a bastard if the parents
                    afterwards intermarry; and this is also the law of Scotland, in which the
                    principle of legitimation by subsequent marriage has been often and solemnly
                    recognised. But herein they differ most materially from the English law; which,
                    though not so strict as to require that a child shall be begotten, yet makes it
                    an indispensable condition that it shall be born after lawful wedlock.
                    Blackstone thinks that the reason of the English law is in this respect much
                    superior to that of the Roman or of the derivative systems, if the principal end
                    and design of establishing the contract of marriage, taken in a civil light, be
                    considered; but this opinion, however natural in an English lawyer, does not
                    seem to be borne out by considerations either of principle or of expediency. For
                    although the learned commentator may be perfectly correct in his estimate of the
                    motives which actuated the parliament of Merton when they refused to enact that
                    children born in bastardy should be legitimated by the subsequent marriage of
                    their parents; yet the question still remains whether such an enactment would
                    not have been highly beneficial on grounds of public policy, as well as for the
                    protection of private morals, and whether the experience since acquired has not
                    decided in its favour; points concerning which lawyers, in Scotland at least,
                    have long ceased to entertain any doubt.</p>
                <p>But be this as it may, one thing is certain, that all children born before
                    matrimony are bastards by our law; and so are all children born so long after
                    the death of the husband, that by the usual course of gestation, they could not
                    be begotten by him. But this being a matter of some uncertainty, the law is not
                    exact as to a few days; and although the child is born some time after the usual
                    period of forty weeks, this only affords presumption, not proof, of
                    illegitimacy.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>According
                    to information furnished by the late celebrated anatomist Dr John Hunter, it
                    appears, líí, That the usual period of gestation is nine calendar months, or
                    from 270 to 280 days; but there is very commonly a difference of one, two, or
                    three weeks. 2dZy, That a child may be born alive at any time three months after
                    conception, but none are born with powers of being reared or attaining manhood
                    before seven calendar months or thereby. 3dZy, That he, Dr Hunter, had known a
                    woman bear a living child, in ≡ perfectly natural way, fourteen days beyond the
                    completion of nine calendar months; and he believed that two women had each been
                    delivered of a living child, in a natural way, above ten calendar months from
                    the hour of conception. It is owing to these natural irregularities that the law
                    has been obliged to admit of considerable latitude in the application of the
                    ordinary rule.</p></note> But if a man dies, and his widow soon after marries
                    again, and a child is born within such a time as that by the course of nature it
                    might have been the child of either husband; in this case he is said to be more
                    than ordiñarily legitimate, for when he arrives at years of discretion, he may
                    choose which of the fathers he pleases. To prevent this, among other
                    inconveniences, however, the civil law ordained that no widow should marry <hi
                    rend="italic">intra annum luctus;</hi> a rule which obtained as early as the
                    reign of Augustus, if not of father Romulus himself; and the same constitution
                    was probably handed down to our early ancestors from the Romans, during their
                    stay in this island, since we find it established under both the Saxon and the
                    Danish governments.</p>
                <p>But as bastards may be born before the coverture or marriage state is begun, or
                    after it is determined, so also children born during wedlock may in some
                    circumstances be bastards; as if the husband be out of the kingdom of England,
                    or, as the law loosely phrases it, <hi rend="italic">extra quatuor maria,</hi>
                    for above nine months, so that no access to his wife can be presumed, her issue
                    during that period is to be accounted bastard. But generally during the
                    coverture, access of the husband is presumed, unless the contrary be shown;
                    which is such a negative as can only be proved by showing him to be elsewhere;
                    for the general rule is, <hi rend="italic">ρr(esu∙ miturpro lequimatione.</hi>
                    In a divorce <hi rend="italic">a mensa et toro,</hi> if ^ <hi rend="superscript"
                    > ιe</hi><pb break="no" facs="nls:193194970" xml:id="kp-eb0704-4970-0435"/>wife
                    has children they are bastards, because the law presumes the husband and wife
                    conformable to the sentence of separation, unless access be proved; but in a
                    voluntary separation by agreement, the law supposes access, unless the negative
                    be shown. If a man or woman marry a second wife or husband, the first being
                    living, and have issue by such second wife or husband, the issue is spurious.
                    Again, if a man has issue a son by a woman before marriage, and afterwards
                    marries the same woman and has issue a second son born after the marriage; the
                    first of these, who would be legitimated <hi rend="italic">per subsequens
                    matrimonium</hi> in Scotland, is termed in England a <hi rend="italic">bastard
                    eigne,</hi> and, by the common law of that country, is as incapable of
                    inheriting as if his father and mother had never married; the second, by a
                    species of legal Hibernicism, is denominated a <hi rend="italic">mulier</hi> or
                    <hi rend="italic">mulier puisne,</hi> and succeeds to the exclusion of the
                    bastard eigne. Again, if there be an apparent impossibility of procreation on
                    the part of the husband, as if he be only eight years old, or the like, then the
                    issue of the wife is bastard. Likewise, in case of divorce in the spiritual
                    court <hi rend="italic">a vinculo matrimonii,</hi> all the issue born during the
                    coverture is bastard; because such divorce is always upon some cause that
                    rendered the marriage unlawful and null from the beginning.</p>
                <p>The duty of parents to their bastard children consists principally in maintaining
                    them. For although bastards are not looked upon as children to any civil
                    purpose, yet the ties of nature, of which maintenance is one, are not so easily
                    dissolved; and these hold good even in other respects, as, for example, that a
                    man shall not marry his bastard sister or daughter. The provisions of the law of
                    England on this head are numerous; but those of most importance maybe very
                    briefly enumerated. Two justices of the peace may make an order on the mother or
                    reputed father of a bastard, to maintain the infant by weekly payments or
                    otherwise; and if the party on whom the order is made disobey, he or she may be
                    committed to jail until they give security to perform it. The reputed father of
                    a bastard is chargeable with the expenses incident to the birth, and of his own
                    apprehension, and of the order of filiation; and although no legal relationship
                    subsists between the putative father and the bastard,· the former is so far
                    considered its natural guardian, as to be entitled to the custody of it for its
                    maintenan.ceand education.</p>
                <p>The rights of a bastard are very few, being only such as he can acquire; for
                    civilly he can <hi rend="italic">inherit</hi> nothing, being looked upon as the
                    son of nobody, and sometimes called <hi rend="italic">filius nullius,</hi>
                    sometimes <hi rend="italic">filius populi.</hi> Yet he may gain a surname by
                    reputation though he has none by inheritance, and may even be made legitimate
                    and capable of inheriting by the transcendent power of an act of parliament. All
                    other children have their primary settlement in their father’s parish; but a
                    bastard has his in the parish where he was born, unless such birth has been
                    procured by fraud, or happened under an order of removal, in a State of
                    vagrancy, in the house of correction, or under Certificate; for in law he has no
                    father. The incapacities attaching to a bastard consist principally in this,
                    that he cannot be heir to any one; for being <hi rend="italic">nullius
                    filius,</hi> he is therefore of kin to nobody, and has no ancestor from whom an
                    inheritable blood can be derived. Therefore, if there be no other claimant upon
                    an inheritance than such illegitimate child, it escheats to the lord. And as
                    bastards cannot be heirs themselves, so neither can they have any heirs but
                    those of their own bodies. For as all collateral kindred consists in being
                    derived from the same common ancestor, and as a bastard has no legal ancestor,
                    he can have no collateral kindred, and consequently no legal heirs, ¶xcept such
                    as claim by a lineal descent from himself. And hence, if a bastard purchase
                    land, and die seised thereof without issue, and intestate, the land escheats to
                    the lord of the fee. Originally a bastard was deemed incapable of holy orders,
                    and disqualified by the fact of his birth from holding any dignity in the
                    church; but this doctrine is now obsolete, and in all other respects there is no
                    distinction between a bastard and another man.</p>
                <p>These are the principal incapacities attaching to bastardy in England. By the law
                    of Scotland a bastard is not only excluded from his father’s succession, because
                    the law knows no father who is not marked out by marriage; and from all
                    heritable succession, whether by the father or mother, because he cannot be
                    pronounced lawful heir by the inquest in terms of the brief; but also from the
                    movable succession of his mother, because he is not her lawful child, and
                    legitimacy is implied in all succession deferred by the law. But a bastard,
                    although he cannot succeed <hi rend="italic">jure sanguinis,</hi> may succeed by
                    destination, where he is specially called to the succession by entail or
                    testament. In Scotland, as in England, a bastard can have no legal heirs except
                    those of his own body; and hence, failing his lawful issue, the king succeeds to
                    him as last heir. In Scotland bastards may be legitimated in two ways; either by
                    the subsequent intermarriage of the mother of the child with the father, as
                    already mentioned; or by letters of legitimation from the sovereign. With
                    respect to the last, however, it is to be observed, that letters of
                    legitimation, be their clauses ever so strong, cannot enable the bastard to
                    succeed to his natural father; for the king cannot, by any prerogative, cut off
                    the private right of third parties. But, by a special clause in the letters of
                    legitimation, he may renounce his right to the bastard’s succession, failing
                    descendants, in favour of him who would have been the bastard’s heir had he been
                    born in lawful wedlock, such renunciation encroaching upon no right competent to
                    any third party.</p>
                <p>By the statute of 18 Elizabeth, c. 3, two justices may take order for the
                    punishment of the mother and reputed father of a bastard; but what that
                    punishment shall be is not therein ascertained, although, according to the
                    contemporary exposition, a corporal punishment was intended. By statute 7 Jac.
                    I. c. 4, a specific punishment, namely, commitment to the house of correction,
                    was inflicted on the woman only. But in neither case could the penalty be
                    inflicted, except the bastard became chargeable to the parish; for otherwise the
                    maintenance of the child was considered a sufficient punishment. By the
                    last-mentioned statute, however, the justices may commit the mother to the house
                    of correction, there to be punished and set to work for one year, and, in case
                    of a second offence, till she find sureties never to offend again; a condition
                    with which, in most cases, it would be no easy matter for the offending party to
                    comply.</p>
                <p>By 43 Geo. III. c. 58, which repealed the statute 21 Jac. I. c. 27, it was
                    enacted that any person administering any deadly poison or other noxious and
                    destructive substance, with intent to cause or procure the miscarriage of a
                    woman quick with child, shall be guilty of felony without benefit of clergy;
                    that the causing or procuring of abortion in the case of women not quick with
                    child, or at least not proved to be so, shall be punishable with fine,
                    imprisonment, the pillory, whipping, or transportation for fourteen years; that
                    the trials of women charged with the murder of their bastard children shall
                    proceed and be governed by the like rules of evidence and presumption as in
                    other cases of murder; and that if the jury acquit the woman of the murder, they
                    may nevertheless find that, by secret burying or otherwise, she had endeavoured
                    to conceal the birth of her child, in which case she may be imprisoned for two
                    years. It was further provided that this act should extend to Ireland. The <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193194983" xml:id="kp-eb0704-4983-0436"/> Scottish act of
                    William and Mary, session 2, parliament 1, which provided that any woman
                    concealing her pregnancy during the whole space, and not calling for help at the
                    birth, the child being found dead or missing, should be held as the murderer of
                    the child, was repealed by the 49 Geo. III. c. 14. But in the second section of
                    the same statute it was enacted, that any woman in Scotland concealing her
                    pregnancy during the whole time, and not calling for help at the birth, if the
                    child were found dead or missing, should be imprisoned in the common jail for a
                    period not exceeding two years. If a man, however, procure a woman with child to
                    destroy her infant when born, and a child be born, and the woman, in consequence
                    of such procurement, kill her infant, this is murder in the mother, and the
                    procurer is accessory, or art and part, in the commission of the crime.</p>
