                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra
                    space around the <gi>pb</gi> tag. Where a word is hyphenated at a <gi>pb</gi>,

                <p><label type="entry">BATH</label>, a city in the county of Somerset, and one of
                    the most beautiful places in this kingdom, or indeed in Europe. It stands on the
                    river Frome, 105 miles from London. A great part of the city is but little above
                    th <hi rend="subscript"> e</hi> level of the stream, but the north part
                    gradually rises in rows of streets and crescents, one above the other, to the
                    height of near 300 feet. The whole is built of freestone raised on the spot,
                    which gives an appearance of elegance to the houses. The warm springs are of
                    great celebrity, and much frequented by visitors, both for health and for
                    pleasure. They are few in number, and differ but little from each other in their
                    medicinal properties. The temperature of the coolest is 97°, of the warmest 117°
                    of Fahrenheit. The city is well supplied with those amusements and relaxations
                    which are requisite for the description of society that assembles here. There is
                    a theatre, two sets of public rooms for balls and concerts, a great number of
                    public libraries, and beautiful promenades. Besides the cathedral, and several
                    parish churches and chapels, there are places of worship for every denomination
                    of Christians. The markets are well supplied with every necessary and luxury,
                    and at a very moderate rate. The houses, whether for lodging, boarding, or both,
                    are clean and admirably conducted; and in no place can persons enjoy so much
                    comfort at the same expense. The police is well regulated by the corporation,
                    and the several hospitals are well managed for the patients. The city returns
                    two members to parliament, who are chosen by the corporation. The patronage has
                    been commonly divided between the marquis of Bath and the marquis of Camden. The
                    abbey church or cathedral is a fine specimen of ancient Gothic architecture. The
                    diocese, combined with Wells, extends over the county of Somerset, and contains
                    388 parishes. The river Frome is navigable to Bristol; and the Thames and Severn
                    are united by a canal, called the Kennet and Avon, which passes from Bath to
                    Newbury. The population of Bath amounted in 1801 to 32,200, in 1811 to 34,412,
                    and in 1821 to 36,811.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">_ Knights of the</hi><hi rend="italic smallcaps"> Bath,</hi> a
                    military order in England, concerning the origin of which antiquaries differ in
                    their accounts. The earliest intimation we have of the order is in the reign of
                    Henry IV., when we find a degree of knighthood under the express denomination of
                    <hi rend="italic">the Bath.</hi> On the day of his coronation in the tower of
                    London, that king conferred the insignia of the order upon forty-six esquires,
                    who had watched all the night before, and had bathed themselves. And from his
                    time it was customary for our kings to confer this dignity on the occasion of
                    their own coronations or those of their queens; on the birth or marriage of
                    royal issue, and their first advancement to honours; upon the eve of intended
                    expeditions against foreign enemies; at the installations of knights of the
                    garter; and when some grand anniversary festivals were celebrated. The last
                    knights of the bath so made were in 1661, at the coronation of King Charles II.;
                    after which the order was neglected until the year 1725, when George I. was
                    pleased to revive it, and to command a book of statutes to be framed for the
                    government of the order. By this code the number of knights was fixed at
                    thirty-eight, namely, the sovereign and thirty-seven knights-companions. But, in
                    the reign of his late majesty, George IV., the statutes of the order were
                    relaxed; and, under the denominations of companions and grand crosses, a great
                    additional number of persons, chiefly military men, who had distinguished
                    themselves in actual service, have been admitted within the pale of the
                    order.</p>
                <p>The apparel of a knight of the bath is a red surcoat, lined and edged with white,
                    and girt with a white girdle, but without any ornament; the mantle, of the same
                    colour and lining, is fastened about the neck with a lace of white silk, to
                    which is attached a pair of white gloves, with tassels of silk and gold at the
                    end; and on the left shoulder <pb break="no" facs="nls:193195048"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0704-5048-0441"/>it is adorned with the ensign of the order,
                    consisting of three imperial crowns <hi rend="italic">or,</hi> surrounded with
                    the ancient motto, <hi rend="italic">Tria juncta in uno,</hi> wrought upon a
                    circle <hi rend="italic">gules,</hi> with a glory or rays issuing from the
                    centre, and under it the lace of white silk worn by the knights of the bath. Red
                    breeches and stockings, and white hats, surmounted with plumes of white
                    feathers, complete the knightly apparel. The chapel of Henry VII. is the chapel
                    of the order, and every knight’s banner, with plates of his armsand style, is
                    placed over his respective stall, in the same manner as those of the knights of
                    the garter in St George’s chapel, Windsor; and the knights arc allowed
                    supporters to their arms.</p>
