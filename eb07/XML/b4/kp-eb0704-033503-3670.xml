                <p><label type="entry">BAMBARRA</label>, an extensive and important country of
                    interior Africa, with which the journeys of Park, who was perhaps the first
                    European that reached it, have made us tolerably acquainted. It is situated
                    between the 1st and 5th degrees of east longitude, and the 12th and 15th of
                    north latitude. It has on the west the countries of Manding, Kaarta, and
                    Ludamar; on the north Beeroo; on the east Masina and Jinbala, which separate it
                    from Timbuctoo; on the south Baedoo, Maniana, and the high region of Kong. It
                    consists of a spacious and fertile plain watered by the Niger, having on the
                    south the chain of mountains which here traverses the interior of the continent,
                    and on the north the African desert.</p>
                <p>In consequence of this situation the climate over the greater part of Bambarra is
                    intensely hot. On the borders of the northern desert it is absolutely scorching.
                    In the sandy tracts, during the middle of the day, the ground is often too hot
                    for the foot to tread upon; and Mr Park, as he lay in his tent, felt sensible
                    pain in applying his hand to the current of air as it entered through the
                    crevices. In the southern districts, which are copiously watered, the air,
                    especially in the mornings and evenings, is much more temperate. In the
                    beginning of June a strong south-west wind begins to blow, accompanied with
                    violent storms and tornadoes, which produce the most pernicious effects on the
                    health, especially of Europeans. This forms the commencement of the rainy
                    season, which continues with violence for three months, during which the country
                    is deluged; all the streams, formerly shallow and almost dried up, now swell and
                    overflow their banks; and the country situated along the Niger and its
                    tributaries is generally inundated. In August the rain ceases, the waters
                    disappear, and the soil is found to be highly improved and fertilized by this
                    alluvion.</p>
                <p>The rich plain, thus copiously watered, is fitted for producing in abundance all
                    the richest tropical products. Cultivation also is by no means deficient, though
                    not brought to the same perfection as in the improved districts of Europe; yet
                    the vicinity of the great towns reminded Mr Park of the finest tracts of
                    England. The imperfect diffusion of culture is proved by the circumstance, that
                    there is no private property in land, nor is any price attached to it. It is
                    judged to belong either to the king or the village; and any individual who
                    wishes an additional quantity may obtain it on application, subject only to a
                    penalty if he fails to bring it under cultivation. The grains chiefly reared are
                    Indian corn, rice, and millet. The plough is unknown; the hoe being, as in other
                    parts of native Africa, the only instrument used in turning up the ground. The
                    pine-apple, orange, banana, and other fine fruits peculiar to tropical
                    countries, though partially introduced on the coast, have not found their way
                    into this interior kingdom. Several peculiar and valuable trees and shrubs,
                    however, are produced on its plains. Among these is the shea-toulou, or tree
                    producing vegetable butter. It very much resembles the American oak; and the
                    valuable substance consists in the kernel of a nut, somewhat resembling a
                    Spanish olive. The butter, in Mr Park’s opinion, is firmer, whiter, and of
                    richer flavour than that made from cow’s milk, and has the advantage of being
                    easily preserved during the whole year without salt. In the neighbourhood of
                    Sego it grows in peculiar abundance, and forms a subject of export to the
                    surrounding countries. The lotus, a celebrated and classical shrub, whose
                    berries, on being pounded and dried, are formed into cakes resembling the best
                    gingerbread, grows along the northern border of Bambarra; to which may be added
                    the kolla or gooroo nut, the agreeable bitter taste of which is universally
                    relished by the negroes. Cotton and indigo, as the materials, the one for
                    weaving, the other for dyeing their cloths, are cultivated with diligence and
                    success. Tobacco is cultivated; but neither the sugarcane, the coffee, nor the
                    cocoa-tree, appears to be even known in this part of Africa.</p>
                <p>The staple manufacture in Bambarra, and, indeed, generally in central Africa, is
                    that of cotton stuffs dyed with their fine indigo. The process is exceedingly
                    simple; the juice of the indigo leaves is extracted by pounding, mixed in a lye
                    of wood ashes, and the cloth is then steeped in the vat. By this process a
                    beautiful and durable colour is produced. The natives have also the art of
                    tanning the leather of sheep and goats, and staining it with red and yellow
                    colours. They possess, besides, the art of smelting iron, and forming it into
                    spears, hoes, and other warlike and useful instruments; but they have in vain
                    attempted the fabrication of fire-arms. They fashion the gold which abounds in
                    the neighbouring districts into bracelets, necklaces, and other ornaments, with
                    a variety of taste and an elegance of fancy which would excite admiration in the
                    best European workmen.</p>
                <p>The commerce of Bambarra is carried on partly along the Niger, partly by inland
                    caravans proceeding in different directions. The Niger becomes navigable at
                    Bammakoo, the very point where it enters Bambarra, and continues to be so during
                    its whole course through that kingdom. The trade is considerable, and numerous
                    boats are seen passing and repassing. These boats are of a singular
                    construction, consisting of the trunks of two large trees hollowed out, and
                    joined together lengthwise, without decks or masts. They are disproportionably
                    long and narrow, though very capacious, since Mr Park saw in one of them four
                    horses and a great many passengers crossing a ferry. The most extensive traffic,
                    however, here, as in all the countries of interior Africa, is carried on by
                    land-caravans. The chief object of import is salt, a necessary of life of which
                    Bambarra, like all the tracts situated on the interior rivers, is entirely
                    destitute; but it is procured from large pits in the interior of the desert.
                    There are imported, also, considerable quantities of European goods, arms,
                    cloths, toys, and ornaments. These are brought partly from the coast, partly
                    from Barbary by way of Timbuctoo, partly by the direct route from Aroan to
                    Sansanding. The exports consist of gold, not <pb break="no" facs="nls:193193683"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0704-3683-0336"/>produced within the kingdom itself, but in the
                    high districts to the south, and found in the sands of the rivulets which fall
                    into the Niger, whence, by mere agitation in water, it is separated in the form
                    of dust. The other great staple consists in slaves, for which, till lately, the
                    European settlements on the coast afforded so very extensive a market. The
                    slaves from Bambarra, belonging to a more civilized and industrious race than
                    the Inhabitants of the turbulent little states into which Africa is generally
                    divided, are subjected to less restraint, and bear a higher value in the market.
                    This unjust and calamitous traffic, which excited and prolonged African wars,
                    has been greatly diminished since the prohibition by England of her own trade,
                    and since she obtained permission from the other powers to put a stop generally
                    to that carried on north of the line. Doubtless, however, there is still an
                    extensive contraband.</p>
                <p>Bambarra is the point where the two great races of interior Africa, the Moors and
                    negroes, meet and mix with each other. The great inroad by which the former have
                    occupied so large a proportion of this continent, is bounded generally, though
                    not uniformly or completely, by the Niger. The nations to the north and east of
                    Bambarra are mostly Moors, to the south and west negroes. Within the country
                    itself the negro is still the ruling power; though in many of the large eastern
                    towns the Moors are the most numerous, and have the almost entire municipal
                    jurisdiction. They are generally superior to the natives in intelligence, and,
                    as in the rest of Africa, are a stirring, trafficking, bigoted, turbulent race.
                    Their fanatical enmity to Christians probably causes them present themselves to
                    our travellers under a more unamiable aspect than they would otherwise exhibit.
                    They are possessed of some knowledge of letters, of which the native tribes are
                    altogether destitute; and by imparting these first elements of knowledge, they
                    extend both their faith and their influence. They make a much less laudable use
                    of the credit thus acquired, by composing saphies or charms, to which the
                    credulous negroes attach the most extraordinary virtues, purchasing at a high
                    price this delusive mode of protection. The negroes, on the other hand, are a
                    race generally harmless, thoughtless, voluptuous, but kind and open-hearted.
                    Their hospitality was in several instances signally displayed towards Mr Park,
                    and “to suffer the king’s stranger to depart hungry, was considered an heinous
                    offence.” They possess a good deal of agricultural industry, practise some fine
                    manufactures, and have even a talent for extemporary poetry; but their
                    intellectual culture on the whole ranks very low. Polygamy is generally
                    established, though only the chiefs and very opulent individuals can or do carry
                    if to a great extent. Domestic slavery is also general, but under a mild form;
                    the master and slave living almost as equals, and sometimes eating at the same
                    table.</p>
                <p>Sego, or Sego-see-korro, the capital of Bambarra, is a large town, containing
                    about 30,000 inhabitants. It is divided by the Niger into two nearly equal
                    parts; and the opposite parts are each divided into two quarters, which being
                    respectively surrounded by a mud-wall, have the appearance almost of separate
                    towns. Although the houses be only of clay with flat roofs, yet those of the
                    higher ranks have two stories, with their roofs whitewashed, while Moorish
                    mosques, with their minarets, rise in different quarters. The city, on the
                    whole, with its highly-cultivated vicinity, presented a scene such as Mr Park
                    little expected to find in the heart of Africa. The communication between the
                    two towns was by a ferry. The chief seat of Bambarran trade is San san ding,
                    which presented also a scene of busy and orderly traffic, very different from
                    what was expected in the interior of Africa.</p>
                <p>The different commodities were well arranged, not indeed 1 in shops or
                    warehouses, but in a spacious public market, shaded by mats from the heat of the
                    sun. In one were the cloths of Houssa, of superior quality to those manufactured
                    in this country: in others indigo, the universal dye; antimony, the great
                    African cosmetic; and beads, the favourite ornament. A separate market, however,
                    was appropriated for salt, the main staple of African trade. The great
                    commercial town of Jennè, farther down the river, was at the time of Park’s
                    visit under the jurisdiction of Bambarra; but according to Caillé the connection
                    has since been dissolved.</p>
