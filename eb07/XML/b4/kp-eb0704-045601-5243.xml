                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra

                <p><label type="entry">BAUHIN, <hi rend="smallcaps">John</hi></label>, a
                    distinguished botanist, was born at Lyons in the year 1541. He was the son of an
                    eminent physician, who quitted France, his native country, on account of
                    religion, and settled at Basel. In early life he travelled with Gesner, the
                    celebrated naturalist, and collected plants in the Alps, in France, and in
                    Italy, for the purpose of the great botanical work which he afterwards
                    accomplished. He first practised medicine at Basel, where he was also elected
                    professor of rhetoric in 1566. He then resided for some time at Yverdun, and was
                    afterwards invited to be physician to the duke of Wirtemberg at Montbelliard; a
                    situation in which he spent the remaining forty years of his life. He devoted
                    his time chiefly to botany, on which he bestowed great labour, comparing
                    authors, ancient and modern, with one another, and with nature, and collecting
                    information from all quarters. He likewise prosecuted other branches of natural
                    history, and published an account of <hi rend="italic">Medicinal Waters
                    throughout Europe,</hi> especially in the duchy of Wirtemberg; together with a
                    particular account of the mineral spring of Boll, and the natural history of the
                    place. His great work on plants was not completed at his death, which happened
                    in 1613. A society at Yverdun published in 1619 the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Prodromus;</hi> but it was not till 1650 and 1651 that the work itself
                    appeared, in three vols. folio, entitled <hi rend="italic">Historia Plantarum
                    nova et absolutissima, cum Auctorum consensu et dissensu circa eas.</hi> This
                    performance, with all its defects, has been pronounced by Haller to be without
                    an equal. The plants are numerous, generally well described and discriminated;
                    and many new species are added. It is still considered a standard work; and the
                    names of John Bauhin and his brother rank high among the founders and first
                    promoters of botanical science.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Bauhin,</hi><hi rend="italic">Gaspard,</hi> brother of the
                    former, was born in 1560. He was early devoted to physic, and pursued his
                    studies at Padua, Montpellier, and some of the celebrated schools in Germany. In
                    his journeys he collected a number of plants which had escaped his brother’s
                    notice. Returning to Basel in 1580, he was admitted to the degree of doctor, and
                    gave private lectures in botany and anatomy. In 1582 he was appointed to the
                    Greek professorship in that university, and in 1588 to the anatomical and
                    botanical chairs. He was at last made city physician, professor of the practice
                    of medicine, rector of the university, and dean of his faculty; and, thus
                    distinguished and honoured, he acquired great reputation. He became eminent as a
                    botanist, and was aided in his researches by the contributions of his disciples
                    and friends in various parts of Europe. Haller gives him the character of being
                    assiduous and laborious in collecting plants, by which means he surpassed his
                    brother in the number of them, as he also did in the accuracy of his figures;
                    but he possessed less acuteness of judgment in distinguishing varieties, and in
                    detecting the same species under different names. He published several works
                    relative to botany, of which the most valuable is his <hi rend="italic">Pinax
                    Theatri Dotanicn, seu index in Theophrasti, Dioscoridis, Plinii, et botanicoum
                    qui a se-culo scripserunt opera, plantarum fere sex millium nomina, eum
                    synonymiis et differentiis. Opus XIV. annorum,</hi> 4to. The confusion that
                    began to arise at this time from the number of botanical writers who described
                    the same plant under different names, rendered such a task as this highly
                    necessary; and though there are many defects in the execution, the <hi
                    rend="italic">Pinax</hi> of Bauhin is still a useful key to all the writers
                    before his time. Another great work which he planned was a <hi rend="italic"
                    >Theatrum Dotanicum</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> i</hi> meant to be
                    comprised in twelve parts folio, of which he finished three, but only one was
                    published. He also gave a very copious catalogue of the plants growing in the
                    environs of Baseland he edited the works of Matthiolus with considerable’
                    additions. Gaspard likewise wrote some works on anatomy which he studied under
                    Hieronymus ab Aquapendente and pursued with vigour during his youth. His
                    principal work on this subject is <hi rend="italic">Theatrum Anatomicum
                    infiniii</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> s</hi><hi rend="italic">l</hi><hi
                    rend="italic subscript"> 0c</hi><hi rend="italic">ι</hi><hi rend="italic
                    subscript"> s</hi><hi rend="italic">auctum,</hi> 4to, Frankf. 1621; which is a
                    kind of <hi rend="italic">pinax</hi> of anatomical facts and opinions. He also
                    published a collection of anatomical plates. He died in 1624.</p>
