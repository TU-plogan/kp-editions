                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra

                <p><label type="entry">BERWICK, <hi rend="smallcaps">the Duke of</hi></label>, was
                    natural son of James II. by Mrs Arabella Churchill, sister to the great Duke of
                    Marlborough. He followed the fate of his father, and, after the revolution of
                    1688, went to France, where he was recommended to the court by his superior
                    merit. He was created marshal of France, knight of the Holy Ghost, duke and peer
                    of France, grandee of Spain, and commander in chief of the French armies; nor
                    were these honours and employments greater than his services merited. He lived
                    in an age when the prince of Orange and many other great generals commanded
                    against him; yet his reputation as a warrior of the highest class suffered no
                    abatement from this rivalry, while the victory of Almanza, which secured Spain
                    to the Bourbon dynasty, stamped his character as a great and successful
                    commander. His courage was cool, steady, and equal; and he was eminently
                    remarkable for entire self-possession in all circumstances, even the most
                    critical ;—watchful, cautious, and persevering; ever ready to take advantage of
                    a fault or an oversight committed by an antagonist, yet, throughout his whole
                    career, frugal of the blood of his soldiers, and anxious that it should not, on
                    any occasion, be wantonly or unnecessarily shed. The system of discipline he
                    maintained was rigid; and although the wants of the soldier were scrupulously
                    attended to, no commander ever punished with greater severity his excesses.</p>
                <p>The Duke of Berwick was much blamed by the more zealous and violent adherents of
                    the Stuart family, for not being sufficiently attached to the Jacobite party,
                    which was that of his own family. But on a cool examination of his actions, it
                    will appear that his behaviour in this particular was, like the rest of his
                    conduct, equally sensible and just. When he accepted of employments, received
                    honours and dignities, and became a naturalized Frenchman, he thought <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 1</hi> t his duty, as an honest man, to become a Frenchman
                    in reality, and a true subject of the monarch who gave him bread; and to be or
                    not to be in the interest of the Stuart family, according to the will and
                    pleasure of the sovereign whom lie served, and the interest of France, his
                    adopted country. But when commanded by his king to promote the views of that
                    family, he acted with the greatest sincerity, and took the most sensible and
                    effectual methods to serve his unhappy house. This the following anecdote, if
                    true,—and it has some appearance of probability on its side,—clearly evinces.
                    After the signing of the treaty of Utrecht, the Duke of Marlborough, having been
                    censured by the British parliament on account of some army contracts for bread
                    and forage, retired into France; and it has been asserted that his grace was
                    then brought over to the interest of the Stuart family; for it is now certain
                    that Queen Anne had at one time serious intentions of taking measures for
                    settling the succession on her brother after her own death; and several
                    circumstances made people connect the known wishes of the queen with the fact
                    above mentioned. And if the Duke of Berwick had been, directly or indirectly,
                    instrumental in gaining over his uncle to that interest, he would have more
                    effectually served it than that body of rash and unhappy gentlemen who were
                    taken prisoners at Preston in 1715, had it in their power to do. In a word, the
                    Duke of Berwick was, without being a bigot, a moral and religious man; and he
                    showed by his life and actions that morality and religion are very compatible
                    and consistent with the life of a statesman and a great general, and that if
                    they were oftener united in these two professions, it would be much happier for
                    the rest of mankind. E1e was killed by a cannon-ball at the siege of Philipsburg
                    in 1738.</p>
