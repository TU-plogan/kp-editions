                <p><label type="entry">BONNET, <hi rend="smallcaps">Charles</hi></label>, an eminent
                    naturalist, was born at Geneva on the 13th March 1720, of a French family who
                    had been forced on account of religious principles to leave their native
                    country. As he was an only son, his father paid great attention to his
                    education; and finding that he made little progress at the public schools, both
                    from a dislike to the dry study of grammar, and from deafness, with which he was
                    very early afflicted, employed a domestic tutor, under whom his progress was
                    rapid and satisfactory. At the early age of sixteen his attention was so deeply
                    engaged by the perusal and study of <hi rend="italic">Le Spectacle de la
                    Nature</hi> of Pluche, that it seems to have given a bias and direction to his
                    future studies. The history and the habits of the ant-lion, <hi rend="italic"
                    >formica leo,</hi> particularly attracted his attention, and led him to make his
                    first observations on natural history. He discovered the haunts of this curious
                    insect, watched and studied its manners and habits, and added many observations
                    to those of Pluche and Reaumur. Reaumur’s memoir on insects happening to fall
                    accidentally in his way, he perused it with great eagerness; and this perusal
                    probably decided his taste for natural history. To the observations and
                    experiments of that naturalist, Bonnet added many new facts which he had
                    discovered, the detail of which he communicated to Reaumur; who was not less
                    surprised than pleased to find so much sagacity and acuteness of research
                    exhibited in the investigations of a young man of eighteen.</p>
                <p>Bonnet had been destined by his father for the profession of the law; but it was
                    with no small reluctance that he entered on the studies necessary to qualify
                    himself for that profession. The bias of his mind leaned too strongly to natural
                    history, to permit him to occupy his attention with other pursuits. The study of
                    some of the elementary books on law was therefore submitted to merely as a task.
                    In the years 1738 and 1739 he sent to Reaumur many interesting observations on
                    different species of caterpillars; and in 1740 he communicated a paper to the
                    Academy of Sciences respecting the propagation or multiplication of <hi
                    rend="italic">aphides,</hi> or tree-lice, without actual conjunction. This
                    question had been left unsettled by Reaumur. It was now determined by decisive
                    experiments; and his paper on the subject obtained for him the honour of being
                    admitted a corresponding member of the Academy. His experiments on the
                    generation of these insects were conducted with such closeness of attention, and
                    such minuteness of research, as to injure his eyesight to such a degree that he
                    never afterwards wholly recovered it. In the year 1741 he instituted a set of
                    experiments on the effects that follow the division of worms; and he found that
                    many species possessed in some degree the same reproductive power as the
                    polypus. In the following year his investigations and experiments were directed
                    to the peculiarities in the mode of respiration of caterpillars and butterflies;
                    and he proved that this function was performed by means of pores, to which the
                    name of <hi rend="italic">stigmata</hi> has been given. It was about the same
                    time that he made some curious discoveries respecting the <hi rend="italic"
                    >toenia,</hi> or tape-worm. In the year 1743, when he was raised to the rank of
                    doctor of laws, he procured a ready dispensation from the further prosecution of
                    studies which had never been agreeable to him, and which being no longer
                    absolutely necessary, he relinquished for ever. In consequence of a memoir on
                    insects which he commu-nιcated<pb break="no" facs="nls:193199338?mode=fullsize"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0704-9338-0771"/> to the Royal Society of London, the same year, he
                    was admitted a member of that body. Next year he published, in onc work, his
                    observations on aphides and worms, under the title of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Insectology.</hi> To this work he prefixed a preface, in which he exhibits a
                    philosophical sketch of his ideas concerning the system of the development of
                    germs, and the scale of organized beings. This work was in general well received
                    by the public, but by some of the journals it was taxed with a want of delicacy,
                    which, it was alleged, appeared in his descriptions of the mode of propagation
                    of tree-lice.</p>
                <p>The constant labours to which Bonnet had subjected himself in all his inquiries
                    began to produce very serious consequences to his health. His eyes particularly
                    began to be affected with severe pains, and his general health visibly declined.
                    This not only obliged him to lay aside the use of the microscope, but also to
                    forego for a time all reading and writing. But like a true philosopher, he bore
                    his afflictions with patience. He was not idle; for although he was interdicted
                    from all observation, his mind was fully occupied in reflection. After some time
                    of relaxation from his usual pursuits, he was at last restored to tolerable
                    health; but he never could employ his eyes with the same freedom as formerly.
                    About the year 1746 he undertook a course of experiments on the vegetation of
                    plants in moss and other substances; and in the following year his researches
                    were directed to the functions of the leaves of plants, with the view of
                    ascertaining the different action of the different sides of the leaves. Another
                    question in vegetation offered itself to his consideration. This was the ascent
                    of the sap ;—and to determine whether it rose by the bark or wood, he employed
                    coloured injections. This investigation, with some observations which he made on
                    vegetable monsters, was the foundation of one of his most interesting and
                    original works, entitled “Inquiries into the use of the Leaves of Plants,” which
                    was first published at Leyden in 1754, 4to. A supplement was added to it in the
                    year 1779.</p>
                <p>Observation and experiment had been the first passion of Bonnet; yet these now
                    began to give way to speculation; and his inquiries in natural history, in the
                    course of which he had so much studied the nature and generation of the lowest
                    part of the scale of beings, led him to consider the faculties and destination
                    of the highest. Malebranche and Leibnitz had laid the foundation of his
                    metaphysical ideas. He engaged deeply in all the discussions connected with the
                    history of the human mind; and the first fruit of his meditations was a kind of
                    abridgment of the materials he had collected, under the title of an “Essay on
                    Pschylogy,” published in London in 1754, but without his name, nor did he
                    acknowledge it till nearly thirty years afterwards. This work contains, in a
                    concise form, the fundamental principles of his philosophy. It traces the origin
                    and progress of the human mind, from the first germ of life to the development
                    of all its faculties, the mutual dependence of which it points out, as deduced
                    from actual observation. It enters into the difficult subject of human liberty,
                    and endeavours to reconcile it with the divine prescience, and the philosophical
                    principle, that every effect must have an adequate cause. From the essential
                    properties of the activity of the soul, and the effects of habit upon it, the
                    whole art of education and government is deduced; and a system of the former is
                    laid down, materially different from the methods generally established. The
                    freedom with which he discussed some of these delicate points, and the fear of
                    being involved in personal controversy, were the motives which induced the
                    author to remain so long concealed. The work met with some censure, yet its
                    success was brilliant.</p>
                <p>The next work of Bonnet was a development of part of the subject of the
                    preceding, namely, the origin and progress of the mental faculties. After a
                    labour of five years on the subject, he produced his “Analytical Essay on the
                    Faculties of the Soul,” which was first printed at Copenhagen in 1760, in
                    quarto, at the expense of the king of Denmark. In this work, like that of the
                    Abbé Condillac, he supposes a statue organized like the human body, which he by
                    degrees animates, and shows how its ideas would arise from impressions on the
                    organs of sense. The Analytical Essay was well received by philosophers, though
                    among some it subjected him to a charge of materialism. To these he made no
                    reply, but contented himself with proceeding in those efforts for the service of
                    religion and morals, to which the best part of his life had been devoted. His
                    retired and studious habits, together with his deafness and other bodily
                    infirmities, prevented him from joining in the assemblies of the young and gay,
                    at the same time that they rendered domestic comforts more essential to him. In
                    1756, he married a lady of the respectable family of De la Rive, and with her he
                    passed thirtyseven years in that perfect union which results from mutual
                    tenderness directed by good sense and virtue. The celebrated Saussure was the
                    nephew of Madame Bonnet; and it was no small pleasure to her husband to witness
                    the early display of genius and knowledge in that extraordinary young man.</p>
                <p>The next work of our author was properly the physical part of his great system.
                    It appeared at Amsterdam in 1762, under the title of “Considerations on
                    Organized Bodies,” in 2 vols. 8vo. Its principal objects were, to give in an
                    abridged form all the most interesting and well-ascertained facts respecting the
                    origin, development, and reproduction of organized bodies; to refute the
                    different systems founded upon <hi rend="italic">epigenesis;</hi> and to explain
                    and defend the system of germs. This publication, though well received by
                    philosophers in general, was, from some suspicion of its principles, prohibited
                    in France; but a remonstrance from the author to M. de Malesherbes, then
                    licenser of the press, caused the interdict to be removed, after a new
                    examination. His <hi rend="superscript"> ii</hi> Contemplation of Nature,” which
                    appeared at Amsterdam in 1764 and 1765, in 2 vols. 8vo, was a work rather meant
                    for popular use, in which the principal facts relative to the different orders
                    of created beings are displayed in a manner both instructive and entertaining,
                    and set off by the charms of an eloquent style; with a continual reference to
                    final causes, and proofs of wisdom and benevolence in the Creator. It has been
                    translated into most of the European languages, and enriched with notes by
                    several hands, as well as by the author himself in a new edition.</p>
                <p>The concluding work of Bonnet was his <hi rend="italic">Paliηgenesie
                    Philosophique,</hi> printed at Geneva in 1769 and 1770, in 2 vols. 8vo. In this
                    he treats on the past and future state of living beings, and supports the idea
                    of the survival of all animals, and the perfecting of their faculties in a
                    future state. Attached to this work is “An Inquiry into the Evidences of the
                    Christian Revelation, and the Doctrines of Christianity,” which, with a treatise
                    “On the Existence of God,” was published separately at Geneva in 1770 and 1771.
                    It was likewise translated into German, and dedicated by the translator to a
                    celebrated Jew, with a challenge to him either to refute it or to acknowledge
                    his conviction of the truth. Bonnet, who had an invincible repugnance for
                    controversy, no sooner heard of this step than he wrote to the Jew, assuring him
                    that he had no share in it; and the two philosophers mutually agreed to forbear
                    any discussion of a topic in regard to which their opinions were totally
                    different, and likely never to coincide. The temper of Bonnet was, indeed, the
                    reverse <pb break="no" facs="nls:193199351?mode=fullsize"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0704-9351-0772"/> of that which disposes to contention; and
                    tranquillity was the great object of his life. He readily corrected his own
                    errors; and never but once entered into a defence of himself. This was on
                    occasion of a charge of plagiarism brought against him as having borrowed from
                    Leibnitz his hypothesis on the resurrection. He had, in the earlier part of
                    life, made an anonymous attack, in the <hi rend="italic">Mercure de France,</hi>
                    upon Rousseau’s discourse on the origin of inequality among men, to which that
                    writer made a reply; but the controversy proceeded no further.</p>
                <p>After having in some measure relinquished speculative philosophy, he resumed his
                    attention to natural history, and, in 1773, published, in Rozier’s Journal, a
                    memoir on the method of preserving insects and fishes in cabinets. In 1774 he
                    communicated to the same journal a memoir on the loves of plants, originating in
                    the discovery of a kind of cleft or mouth in the pistil of a lily. Some
                    experiments on the reproduction of the heads of snails, and of the limbs and
                    organs of the water salamander, furnished matter for other memoirs. He also made
                    observations on the Surinam toad, on bees, on the blue colour acquired by
                    mushrooms from exposure to the air, and on various other subjects in natural
                    history, which agreeably and usefully occupied his leisure. His reputation was
                    now fully established. There was scarcely an eminent learned society in Europe
                    which did not associate him as a member; and these honours were crowned in 1783
                    by his election into the small and very select number of foreign associates of
                    the Academy of Sciences at Paris. His literary correspondents were numerous.
                    Amongst these were the distinguished names of Reaumur, Du Hamel, De Geer,
                    Haller, Van Swieten, Spallanzani, and Merian. Although attached by inclination
                    to scientific pursuits in retirement, he did not on that account entirely
                    withdraw from public duties. He entered into the great council of the republic
                    in 1752, and kept his seat in it till 1768; having frequently distinguished
                    himself by the manly eloquence with which he supported wise and moderate
                    measures, and his constant zeal in the cause of morals and religion, on which he
                    thought the prosperity of the state essentially founded. The last twenty-five
                    years of his life he passed entirely in the country, in a simple and uniform
                    mode of life, happy in an easy competence, and in a small circle of friends. It
                    appears that he was for some time engaged in the education of youth, an
                    employment for which he was peculiarly fitted, and in which he secured the
                    warmest attachment on the part of his pupils. The publication of his works,
                    corrected and revised, in a general collection, occupied nearly eight years of
                    his life, which greatly injured his health, from the intense application which
                    he bestowed upon it. This appeared at Neufchâtel in 1797, in 8 vols. 4to, and 18
                    vols. 8vo; and, besides the works already mentioned, it contains a number of
                    smaller pieces, both in natural history and metaphysics. They are all written in
                    French. It was not till about 1788 that his constitution, feeble as it was,
                    visibly gave way. The symptoms of a dropsy in the chest then began to make their
                    appearance; and these, with some intervals, gradually increased upon him,
                    occasioning a variety of suffering, which he bore with exemplary patience and
                    serenity. He died on the 20th May 1793, at the age of seventy-three. Public
                    honours were rendered to his remains by his fellow-citizens, and his funeral
                    oration was pronounced by his learned friend and kinsman Μ. de -Saussure. "</p>
