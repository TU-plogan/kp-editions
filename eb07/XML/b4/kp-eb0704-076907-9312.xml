                <p><label type="entry">BONNER, <hi rend="smallcaps">Edmund</hi></label>, bishop of
                    London, was born at Hanley in Worcestershire about the end of the fifteenth or
                    beginning of the sixteenth century, and generally supposed to be the natural son
                    of one Savage, a priest, who was the natural son of Sir John Savage of Clifton
                    in the same county. Strype, however, says he was positively assured that Bonner
                    was the legitimate offspring of a poor man, who lived in a cottage long
                    afterwards known by the name of Bonner’s Place. About the year 1512 he entered
                    as a student of Broadgate Hall in Oxford; and in 1519 was admitted as bachelor
                    of the canon and the civil law. About the same time he took orders, and obtained
                    some preferment in the diocese of Worcester. In 1525 he was created doctor of
                    the canon law. Having now acquired the reputation of a shrewd politician and
                    civilian, he was soon distinguished by Cardinal Wolsey, who appointed him
                    commissary for the faculties, and heaped upon him a variety of church
                    preferments. He possessed at the same time the livings of Blaydon and
                    Cherry-Burton in Yorkshire, Ripple in Worcestershire, East Dereham in Norfolk, a
                    prebend of St Paul’s, and the archdeaconry of Leicester. Bonner was with the
                    cardinal at Caw-wood when he was arrested on a charge of high treason. After the
                    <pb break="no" facs="nls:193199325" xml:id="kp-eb0704-9325-0770"/> death of that
                    minister, he soon found means to insinuate himself into the favour of Henry
                    VIII., who made him one of his chaplains, and employed him in several embassies
                    abroad, particularly to the pope. In 1532 he was sent to Rome with Sir Edward
                    Kame, to answer for the king, whom his holiness had cited to appear in person or
                    by proxy. In 1533 he was again dispatched to Pope Clement VII. then at
                    Marseilles, to intimate King Henry’s appeal to a future general council, from
                    the sentence which had been pronounced against his divorce. On this occasion he
                    threatened the pope with so much resolution, that his holiness talked of having
                    him burnt alive or thrown into a cauldron of melted lead; intimations which
                    Bonner judged it prudent not to contemn, and, accordingly, he suddenly decamped
                    without the ceremony of taking leave. His holiness did not foresee that the man
                    whom, in his ang¢r, he had thus menaced with the flames, was destined to burn
                    heretics in England, and to operate by fire in support of the very faith which,
                    under Henry, he had lent his aid to overthrow. In 1538, being then ambassador at
                    the court of France, he was nominated bishop of Hereford; but, before
                    consecration, he was translated to the see of London, and enthroned in April
                    1540. Henry VIII. died in 1547, at which time Bonner was ambassador at the court
                    of the emperor Charles V. During this reign he was constantly zealous in his
                    opposition to the pope; and, in compliance with the king, he favoured the
                    Reformation. Henry VIII. was not a man to be trifled with, and exacted a rigid
                    compliance with all his whims and caprices; but on the accession of young
                    Edward, Bonner refused to take the oath of supremacy, and was committed to the
                    Fleet, where he remained until he thought fit to promise obedience to the laws.
                    After his release he continued to comply with the Reformation, but with such
                    manifest neglect and reluctance, that he was twice reprimanded by the privy
                    council, and in 1549 was, after a long trial, committed to the Marshalsea, and
                    deprived of his bishopric. The succeeding reign, however, gave him ample
                    opportunity of revenge. Mary was scarcely seated on the throne when Bonner was
                    restored to his bishopric, and soon afterwards appointed vicegerent and
                    president of the convocation. From this time he became the chief instrument of
                    persecuting cruelty, and is said to have condemned no less than two hundred
                    Protestants to the flames in the space of three years. Nor was this vindictive
                    and persecuting priest less remarkable for his impudence than his cruelty. On
                    the accession of Elizabeth he appeared with the rest of the bishops, at
                    Highgate, to congratulate her on the occasion. But having, in the second year of
                    her reign, refused to take the oath of allegiance and supremacy, he was again
                    deprived, and committed to the Marshalsea, where he died in 1569, after a
                    confinement of ten years’ duration. There cannot be a stronger instance of the
                    comparative lenity of the Protestant church, than its suffering a man like this,
                    devoid of mercy or compassion, and who had pronounced so many cruel and odious
                    sentences, to die a natural death. The character of Bonner was remarkable for
                    obstinacy and inflexibility in every thing save principle; yet, even in this
                    respect, it exhibits some striking contrasts. In the early part of his career he
                    took care to accommodate his principles to his convenience and ambition; in the
                    latter, after his return to Catholicism, he remained stedfast in his adherence
                    to the ancient faith, and, when disgraced, bore his deprivation and imprisonment
                    with calmness and resignation. He was constitutionally merciless and austere;
                    fitted by nature for a persecutor of all opinions adverse to his own; and
                    equally capable of employing in favour of Protestantism the same burning zeal
                    which he displayed against it. But he was a determined enemy to all laxity of
                    conduct in the ministers of religion, and took the most energetic measures for
                    reforming the manners of his clergy, over whom he exercised the most rigorous
                    superintendence. The pieces ascribed to him are, 1. Letters to Lord Cromwell; 2.
                    <hi rend="italic">Responsum et Exhortatio in laudem Sacerdotii,</hi> 1553; 3.
                    The Thirty-seven Articles of his Visits; 4. An Exposition of the Symbol, and of
                    the Seven Sacraments, in thirteen homilies, 1554, 4to; and some other writings
                    on passing subjects.</p>
