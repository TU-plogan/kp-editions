                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra

                <p><label type="entry">BETEL</label>, a substance compounded of different
                    ingredients, which is chewed in the East in the same way as tobacco is used in
                    other parts of the world, but to much greater extent. All individuals, without
                    exception of age or sex, begin at an early age to accustom themselves to betel,
                    and it gradually becomes an article of such necessity, that those acquainted
                    with the usages of the eastern nations affirm they would more readily dispense
                    with their ordinary quantity of food than with it. Europeans also, who have
                    resided long in Ceylon or India, contract the same habit, and enjoy chewing of
                    betel equally with the natives. Betel, or <hi rend="italic">pawn</hi> as it is
                    denominated in Bengal, consists of part of the fruit of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >areca</hi> palm, wrapped in the leaves of a kind of pepper plant called <hi
                    rend="italic">betel,</hi> smeared with a little shell lime; and its name
                    betel-nut is thence derived. The areca palm is a tree growing to forty or fifty
                    feet in height, with a straight round stem six or eight inches in diameter,
                    covered with a smooth ash-coloured bark, marked with parallel rings. All the
                    leaves, which are only six or seven in number, spring from the top, and are six
                    feet in length, declining downwards from a stalk of considerable length. The
                    fruit or nut is covered with a green shell or skin, thin, brittle, and of the
                    consistence of paper; it is of an oval shape, about the size of a small egg, and
                    resembles a nutmeg despoiled of its husk. When ripe, it appears in clusters of a
                    reddish colour, forming a beautiful contrast with the vivid green of its leaves,
                    and then falls off to sow itself in the ground. The betel plant is a species of
                    vine, bearing a leaf somewhat resembling ivy. It is called <hi rend="italic"
                    >piper betel</hi> by botanists, and is of the same genus as the <hi
                    rend="italic">piper nigrum</hi> of Linnaeus. Its culture, which is carefully
                    attended to, is managed in the same manner. Poles are planted in the earth,
                    around which the betel twines itself, and as it runs up, the poles acquire
                    greater height also. It is a creeping plant, seeking support from stronger
                    vegetables, but it is said not to be destructive of them, like some other plants
                    of a similar nature. Particular regard is paid to the cultivation of areca and
                    betel throughout the countries of which they are natives. Several years ago it
                    was found, on enumeration, that the number of trees, probably meaning the areca
                    only, in Prince of Wales’s Island, amounted to 342,110. The lime used with the
                    nut is called <hi rend="italic">chunam,</hi> and is obtained from the
                    calcination of shells, which produces the finest kind. But the fresh nut must be
                    avoided; it then contains a white viscous matter, insipid to the taste, and
                    occasioning delirium, like ebriety from wine, but losing this property when
                    dried; and it is employed either boiled or raw. The latter undergoes no change ,
                    the former is cut in slices, boiled with a small quantity of <hi rend="italic"
                    >terra japonica,</hi> and then dried. Betel is compounded, therefore, of these
                    three substances, with some additions or variations, according to the customs of
                    the place where consumed; such as cardamums, and coarse pounded tobacco, by
                    persons of more depraved taste. The union of the three ingredients is supposed
                    to correct the effects which each would produce singly; the nut improves the
                    bitterness of the leaf, and the lime prevents any injury to the stomach. When
                    combined, the first consequences are, reddening the saliva, giving a bright hue
                    to the lips, and, in progress of time, rendering the teeth quite black. The
                    saliva, however, will not be tinged if the chunam be omitted; and its pernicious
                    operation on the enamel of the teeth may be averted by rubbing them with a
                    preparation whereby they are coated with a black substance that does not readily
                    yield to any dentifrice, and preserves them from corrosion. Its medicinal
                    effects are the dispelling of nausea, exciting an appetite, and strengthening
                    the stomach. It possesses nutritious and enlivening qualities, which render it
                    particularly acceptable to its consumers. The <hi rend="italic">terra
                    japonica,</hi> above alluded to, is not a universal ingredient; it is used only
                    in certain <pb break="no" facs="nls:193197141" xml:id="kp-eb0704-7141-0602"
                    />countries, and is generally supposed to be a preparation from the areca nut
                    itself. It consists of two varieties, the one very astringent, the other less
                    so, and rather sweet, which is preferred by the betel-eaters. To obtain the
                    former, the nuts are taken from the tree, and boiled some hours in an iron
                    vessel; they are then removed, and the water remaining is inspissated by
                    continual boiling. The nuts being dried, undergo a second boiling, and, having
                    been taken out, the water is also inspissated, whereby the best <hi
                    rend="italic">terra japonica</hi> is obtained. The nuts are then dried, cut in
                    two equal parts, and sold. Or it is obtained by inspissated decoctions of the
                    wood of the keira tree, or <hi rend="italic">mimosa catechu.</hi> A great
                    quantity of this substance is made in the Mysore, and some of inferior quality
                    in Bengal. Probably it is something of this same kind that is prepared in
                    Sumatra, under the name of <hi rend="italic">catacamber,</hi> and chewed along
                    with betel to give it an additional flavour.</p>
                <p>Betel is not only used as an article of luxury, but as a kind of ceremonial which
                    regulates the intercourse of the more polished classes of the East. When any
                    person of consideration waits on another, after the first salutations, betel is
                    presented as a token of politeness: to omit it, on the one part, would be
                    considered neglect, and its rejection would be judged an affront on the other.
                    No one of inferior rank addresses a dignified individual without the previous
                    precaution of chewing betel; two people seldom meet without exchanging it; and
                    it is always offered on the ceremonious interviews of public missionaries. In
                    some countries it is not uncommon for the guest who receives the betel from his
                    host, to pass it between his thumb and fore-finger, and apply his own chunam,
                    which never gives offence, and is thought to have originated in guarding a
                    stranger against the insidious conveyance of poison, formerly too frequently
                    practised in destroying persons who were obnoxious. Philtres or amatory charms
                    are still conveyed along with the chunam, and are conceived to consist of some
                    powerful stimulants. Mahommedans abstain from this indulgence during the fast of
                    Ramadan, though possibly not in every country, as it would be too great a
                    privation; and the use of it is so interwoven with the existence of the natives
                    of the warmer climates, that females of the higher ranks are said to pass their
                    lives in doing little else than chewing betel. When the Cingalese retire to rest
                    at night, they fill their mouths with it, and retain it there until they awake.
                    According to Knox, who passed many years in captivity on the island of Ceylon,
                    most people going abroad carry a small box of gold or silver, containing the
                    ingredients for compounding betel; and the poor keep a constant supply about
                    them in purses of coloured straw, securely lodged in a fold of their garments.
                    The stand or box containing it is often the subject of elegant workmanship; it
                    consists of silver, gold, or tortoise-shell, and forms a piece of ornamental
                    furniture in the houses of the wealthy. It is sufficiently valuable to
                    constitute a present between sovereigns.</p>
                <p>Extensive gardens for cultivating betel are formed in different parts of India.
                    The soil most favourable for the palm is a black mould on a substratum of
                    limestone, or intermixed with calcareous nodules. Here it is planted in rows,
                    and carefully manured and watered during several years. It begins to bear from
                    the eighth or tenth to the fifteenth year, and remains in perfection for thirty
                    years, soon after which it either dies or is cut down. Some, however, continue
                    producing fruit from the fiftieth to the seventieth, or even the hundredth year;
                    but the produce gradually declines both in quantity and quality. It appears that
                    a very fertile tree produces at an average 857 nuts, and an ordinary one 600;
                    but this does not hold everywhere, as there are trees affording no more than
                    200. The betel-leaf is either cultivated in separate gardens, where a red stony
                    soil on the side of a rising ground is preferred, and plantains or bamboos
                    planted along with the vines, which are arranged in trenches to support them as
                    they grow; or when an areca plantation is formed, and the palms are fifteen
                    years old, cuttings of the vine are planted near the roots, and trained up to
                    the trees. In twelve or eighteen months the leaves of the vine are fit for sale,
                    and in three years they are full-sized; but in another year they die, when all
                    must be removed, and young plants immediately substituted for them. W'e do not
                    know whether their duration is ever longer; but in the southern parts of Canara
                    in India, the gardens require renewal every four years, and in eighteen or
                    twenty the soil is considered to be exhausted. These gardens are always
                    surrounded by a hedge; sometimes the cultivators are annoyed with the
                    depredations of squirrels and elephants. The crop of the areca is produced
                    during three months; and the nuts being pulled, arc cut into seven or eight
                    pieces each, and piled up in a heap; then equal quantities of it and <hi
                    rend="italic">terrajaponica,</hi> with a hundred leaves of betel-leaf, are beat
                    together with water, and the juice strained into a pot. This is mixed with a
                    decoction of the bark of the <hi rend="italic">mimosa indica</hi> and water, and
                    the nuts from the whole heap are successively boiled in it. They are then
                    exposed to be dried in the sun.</p>
                <p>Betel is a very considerable article of traffic in India and China, and, indeed,
                    throughout Asia. In the British settlements of Bombay, Madras, and Bengal, the
                    value of the imports amounted in a single year to L.138,836; and if the
                    quantities consumed throughout the East are taken into view, it will appear
                    surprising how they can be obtained. But, owing to the constant and extensive
                    demand, the plants affording the necessary ingredients are carefully cultivated;
                    and multitudes are employed and subsisted in the production of this eastern
                    luxury, <hi rend="smallcaps">(n. n.)</hi></p>
