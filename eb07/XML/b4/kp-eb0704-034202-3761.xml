                    significant corrections to the OCR text, predominantly in cases of confusing "c"
                    and "e." Isolates 90 entries that were mistakenly included at the end of prior
                    entries in v1 and v2. Normalizes ordinal numbers. Separates metadata in
                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra
                    space around the <gi>pb</gi> tag. Where a word is hyphenated at a <gi>pb</gi>,

                <p><label type="entry">BANDELLO</label>, a celebrated Italian novelist, was born at
                    Castelnuovo, in the neighbourhood of Tortona, about 1480. In his youth he
                    studied both at Rome and at Paris; and his education being completed, he went to
                    reside at Mantua. There he remained for several years much esteemed by Pirro
                    Gonzaga, who intrusted him with the education of his daughter, the celebrated
                    Lucrezia Gonzaga. The incidents in the lives of the literary men who flourished
                    in Italy during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries have in many respects a
                    strong similarity. Like most of his literary contemporaries, Bandello passed
                    from one petty court to another, and was frequently employed in political
                    missions by the patron whom he served at the time. At this period the small
                    states of Italy were divided between the French and Spanish interests. Bandello
                    had chiefly attached himself to those princes of Lombardy who favoured the
                    French party; and, in consequence, when the decisive battle of Pavia put the
                    Spaniards in possession of Milan, where Bandello at that time resided, his
                    paternal mansion was burned, and the property of his family confiscated. He fled
                    in disguise from Milan and after wandering from town to town, he placed himself
                    under the protection of Cesar Fregoso, a celebrated captain of that age, who had
                    recently quitted the Venetian for the French service. With this general Bandello
                    resided in Piedmont, till a truce was concluded, when he accompanied his patron
                    to France. After the death of Cesar he continued to live with his widow and
                    family at Agen, to the bishoprick of which he was raised by Francis I. in 1550,
                    and continued to reside in the vicinity of that town till his death, which
                    happened about 1562.</p>
                <p>During his residence at Agen, Bandello revised and added to the novels which he
                    had written in Italy during his youth, and which some of his friends had
                    recovered from the hands of the Spanish soldiers who burned his house at Milan.
                    His <hi rend="italic">Tales</hi> were first published at Lucca in 1554, 4to. In
                    the complete editions of Bandello, the work is divided into four parts; the
                    first, second, and third parts containing fifty-nine stories, and the fourth
                    comprehending twenty-eight. The whole are dedicated to Ippolita Sforza, though
                    she died before their publication, because it was at her desire that the work
                    was originally undertaken. Besides this general dedication, each novel is
                    addressed to some <hi rend="italic">Valoroso Signore,</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >Chiar⅛- sima Signora;</hi> and in these introductions the novelist generally
                    explains how he came to a knowledge of the event he is about to relate. He
                    usually declares that he heard it told in company, details the conversation by
                    Which it was introduced, and pretends to report it, as far as his memory serves,
                    in the exact words of his authority.</p>
                <p>Bandello is chiefly indebted for his celebrity to these novels, which belong to a
                    class of composition that enjoyed for many centuries the utmost popularity in
                    Italy. The tales of the French Trouveurs, having passed into Italy towards the
                    close of the thirteenth century, were first imitated in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Cento Novelle Antiche;</hi> which also contains stories formed from episodes in
                    the romances of chivalry, the ancient chronicles of Italy, and jests or
                    repartees preserved by oral tradition. Boccaccio, whose ŵ- <hi rend="italic"
                    >cameron</hi> appeared shortly after, identified this species of composition
                    with the history of Italian literature and the progress of the Italian language.
                    That celebrated writer was followed by Sacchetti, Ser Giovanni, Centhio, and a
                    numerous tribe of imitators, of whom Bandello is by much the best known and most
                    celebrated, at least in this country. His popularity, however, has not been so
                    great in Italy, which may probably be attributed to the negligence and impurity
                    of his style; a fault of which the author himself appears to have been
                    conscious, as he repeatedly apologizes for his defects in elegance of diction.
                    <hi rend="italic">Io non sonο Toscano, ?zè bene intendo la proprieta di quella
                    lingua; anzi mi confesso Lombardo.</hi> Napioni, in his eulogy of Bandello,
                    confesses that he is not remarkable for that harmony of periods, and delightful
                    <hi rend="italic">ncíiveté</hi> of expression, for which Boccaccio and others of
                    his predecessors were so distinguished; but he adds, that none of the Italian
                    novelists is so interesting for the development and illustration of minute
                    historical facts, which would in vain be sought for in the historiée of the
                    revolutions of the Italian states. Some of the novels of Bandello, however, it
                    must be admitted, are little edifying; and it is curious that one of his
                    stories, which is perhaps the most obscene in the whole series of Italian
                    novels, should be declared, in the introduction, to have been related by the
                    celebrated Na-vagero to the princess of Mantua and duchess of Urbino. Besides,
                    notwithstanding the repeated assertions of Bandello, that all his stories have
                    some foundation in fact, and the light which his eulogists suppose that they
                    throw on the history of the Italian republics, it cannot be <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193193774" xml:id="kp-eb0704-3774-0343"/>denied that the greater
                    proportion of them are derived from the Fabliaux of the French Trouveurs, and
                    the works of preceding Italian novelists, with an alteration of the names, and
                    some slight variations in theincidents. But while Bandello has thus copied
                    largely from preced-in°∙ fablers, none of their works has suggested more to
                    others, or is more curious for illustrating the genealogy of fiction, and the
                    transmission of fabulous incident from the novelist to the dramatic poet. Many
                    of the tales of Bandello were translated by Belleforest in his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Histoires Tragiques,</hi> whence they found their way into Paynter’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Palace of Pleasure,</hi> and other works of a similar description
                    which appeared in England during the reign of Queen Elizabeth. In this manner
                    they furnished the plots of many tragedies and comedies to the most numerous and
                    noble race of the English dramatic poets. That part of Shakspeare’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Much Ado about Nothing</hi> which relates to Don John, Claudio,
                    and Hero, is taken, with little variation in the incidents, from the
                    twenty-second tale of the first part of Bandello; and <hi rend="italic">The
                    Twelfth Night</hi> is borrowed from the thirty-sixth of the second part.
                    Massinger has been indebted for his <hi rend="italic">Picture,</hi> which is,
                    perhaps, the most agreeable and fanciful of his dramas, to the twenty-first of
                    the first part; while Beaumont and Fletcher have derived from the same source
                    their comedy of the <hi rend="italic">Maid in the Mill,</hi> and the <hi
                    rend="italic">Triumph of Death,</hi> which is the third of their “Four Plays in
                    One.” The thirty-fifth of the second part of Bandello is the same story as the
                    plot of Horace Walpole’s <hi rend="italic">Mysterious Mother,</hi> and the
                    thirtieth tale of the Queen of Navarre. As the works of Bandello and the Queen
                    of Navarre were printed nearly at the same period, it is not probable that they
                    copied from each other; and it may be presumed, that some current tradition
                    furnished both with the horrible incident they relate. Mr Walpole, however,
                    disclaims having had any knowledge of the tale of the Queen of Navarre or
                    Bandello at the time he wrote this drama. Its plot, he says, was suggested by a
                    story he heard when very young, of a lady, who, under uncommon agonies of mind,
                    had waited on Arehbishop Tillotson, and besought his counsel in what manner she
                    should act under the fatal circumstances that had occurred.</p>
                <p>Besides his <hi rend="italic">Tales,</hi> Bandello is author of a poem in eleven
                    cantos, which was his first work, and is now very scarce, entitled <hi
                    rend="italic">Delle Lodi della Signora Lucrezia Gonzaga,</hi> printed at Agen,
                    1545, in 8vo. He also wrote a complimentary poem, in three eantos, on the birth
                    of a son of his patron, Cesar Fregoso. Both these productions are written
                    without taste or spirit; but it is said that some good verses, composed by
                    Bandello, on different subjects, are still preserved in manuscript in the
                    library o, the academy of Turin. ' <hi rend="smallcaps">(q.)</hi></p>
