                    in order to hold fruit, earth, or other substances. The ancient Britons were
                    noted for their ingenuity in making baskets, which they exported in large
                    quantities. These baskets were of very elegant workmanship, and bore a high
                    price; and they are mentioned by Juvenal among the extravagantly expensive
                    furniture of the Roman tables in his time.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    mankind, in an uncivilized condition, are restricted to operations on materials
                    which undergo slight and imperceptible changes; and implements are fabricated
                    from substances almost in their natural state. The process of interweaving
                    twigs, reeds, or leaves, is seen among the rudest nations of the world; and
                    there is known even an inferior specimen of art among the natives of Van
                    Diemen’s Land, consisting of a bunch of rushes tied together at either end,
                    which, spread out in the middle, forms a basket. But the sudden alteration of
                    shape obviously renders this construction less convenient; whence the same and
                    other tribes make a basket of leaves interwoven, and that so skilfully executed,
                    that it retains either milk or water. A bundle of rushes spread out may be
                    compared to the warp of a web, and the application of others across it to the
                    woof, also an early discovery; for basket-making is literally a web of the
                    coarsest materials. By experience these materials are refined and ornamented;
                    and, in the most improved stages of manufacture, neat and useful implements and
                    utensils are produced. Scarcely any nation has been entirely ignorant of the
                    art; and our ancestors in this island made baskets which, as we have already
                    stated, were carried to Rome either for use or ornament.</p>
                <p>Basket-making, however, has by no means been confined to the fabrication of those
                    simple and useful utensils from which its name is derived. Of old, the shields
                    of soldiers were fashioned of wicker-work, either plain or covered with hides;
                    and the like has been witnessed among modern savages. In Britain, the wicker
                    boats of the natives, covered with the skins of animals, attracted the notice of
                    the Romans; and Herodotus mentions boats of this kind on the Tigris and
                    Euphrates. But there was this difference, that the former seem to have been of
                    the ordinary figure of a boat, whereas the latter were round and covered with
                    bitumen. Boats of this shape, about seven feet in diameter, are used at the
                    present day on these rivers; and boats of analogous construction are employed in
                    crossing the rivers of India which have not a rapid current. At Hurrial, a town
                    on the western side of Hindostan, the river Toombudra is not fordable from June
                    to October; during which interval, round basket-boats are used to transport
                    people, goods, and cattle, to the opposite sides. They are of all sizes, from
                    three to fifteen feet in diameter, but shallow, not being above three feet in
                    depth; yet some are capable of carrying thirty men. They are of very simple
                    construction: A number of pieces of split bamboo, twenty for example, are laid
                    on the ground, crossing each other near the centre, and there fastened with
                    thongs; the ends of the bamboos are then elevated by several persons, and fixed
                    asunder at due distance by means of stakes, in which position they are bound by
                    other long slips of bamboo. The latter are introduced alternately over and under
                    the pieces first crossed, and tied at the intersections to preserve the shape.
                    This being completed, beginning from the bottom to the centre, the parts above
                    the intended height or depth of the basket-boat are cut off, and it is liberated
                    from the stakes reversed, and covered with halfdressed hides sewed together with
                    thongs. Nothing can be more expeditious or more simple than the fabrication and
                    materials of these vessels, if they merit that name. One may be made by six men
                    in as many hours. Only two substances, almost always accessible, are used,—
                    hides and bamboo. They are navigated either by paddles where the water is deep,
                    or are pushed over a shallow bottom with long poles; and the passengers within
                    are safely transported, being kept dry by planks and pieces of wood at the
                    bottom. The basket-boats on the river Krishna, in the same country, are about
                    twelve feet in diameter and four feet deep. Whole armies are thus enabled to
                    continue their march, and even heavy artillery has been conveyed in this manner
                    across rivers. Sometimes the boats are towed by bullocks fastened to them, and
                    goaded on in the proper direction. We may also observe, that in different parts
                    of the world, whole houses, cottages, fences, and gates, are formed of basket or
                    wicker work. On the Continent, a two-horse carriage, called a Holstein waggon,
                    of very considerable size; and fit to carry several persons, is composed solely
                    of basket-work. The same is done in Britain with regard to the bodies of gigs;
                    and an appendage of the stage-coaches is literally designed <hi rend="italic"
                    >the basket;</hi> besides a vast variety of works on a smaller scale.</p>
                <p>In respect to the materials employed, besides those specified as belonging to the
                    ruder nations, there are many which are equally the product of nature and art.
                    Twigs, branches, straw, and whalebone, are all of the number. The natives of
                    some parts of South America make baskets simply of rushes, so closely interwoven
                    as to hold water; and thousands of them are annually sold in the Spanish
                    provinces. The Caffres and Hottentots are alike skilful with the roots of
                    plants. Thus it does not belong to Europeans to rival an uncivilized tribe in
                    the exercise of a simple art. But of all materials, osiers or willows are in
                    most general use.</p>
                <p>Osiers employed for basket-making are either taken entire, cut from the root,
                    split asunder, or stripped of their bark, according to the work to be produced;
                    but in the latter case they are previously soaked in water. The stripping is
                    performed by drawing the willows through an iron-edged implement called brakes,
                    which removes the bark, and the willows are then cleaned, as far as necessary,
                    by manual operation with a sharp knife. Next they are exposed to the sun and
                    air, and afterwards placed in a dry situation. But it is not the less necessary
                    to preserve willows with their bark in the same manner; for nothing can be more
                    injurious than the humidity inherent in die plant; and previous to use they must
                    be soaked some days in water also. The barked or white osier is then divided
                    into bundles or faggots according to size; the larger being reserved to form the
                    strong work in the skeleton of the basket, and the smaller for weaving the
                    bottom and sides. Should the latter be applied to ordinary work, <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193194892" xml:id="kp-eb0704-4892-0429"/>they are taken whole; but for
                    implements of slight and finer texture, each osier is divided into splits and
                    skains; which names denote the different degrees of size to which they are
                    reduced. Splits are osiers cleft into four parts, by means of a particular
                    implement employed for that purpose, consisting of two edge tools placed at
                    right angles, whereby the rod is longitudinally divided down the pith. These are
                    next drawn through an implement resembling the common spoke-shave, keeping the
                    grain of the split next the wood or stock of the shave, while the pith is
                    presented to the edge of the iron, which is set in an oblique direction to the
                    wood: and in order to bring the split into a shape still more regular, it is
                    passed through another implement called an upright, consisting of a flat piece
                    of steel, each end of which is fashioned into a cutting edge, like that of an
                    ordinary chisel. The flat is bent round, so that the two edges approach ćach
                    other at a greater or less interval by means of regulating screws, and the whole
                    is fixed into a handle. By passing the splits between the two edges they are
                    reduced to skains, the thickness of which is determined by the interval between
                    the edges of the tool. All the implements required by a basket-maker are few and
                    simple: they consist, besides the preceding, of knives, bodkins and drills for
                    boring, leads for keeping the work steady while in process, and, where it is of
                    small dimensions, a heavy piece of iron called a beater, vrhich is employed to
                    beat the basket close as it is augmented. Thus a basket-maker has this great
                    advantage over many other artificers, that he can establish himself in his
                    profession at the most inconsiderable expense either for tools or materials.</p>
                <p>An ordinary basket is made by preparing the requisite number of osiers, and
                    preserving their length considerably greater than that of the finished work.
                    They are ranged in pairs on the floor parallel to each other, at small
                    intervals, in the direction of the longer diameter of the basket; and this may
                    be called the woof; for, as we have said, basket work is literally a web. These
                    parallel rods are then crossed at right angles by two of the largest osiers,
                    with the thick ends towards the workman, who places his foot upon them; and
                    weaving each alternately over and under the parallel pieces first laid dowm,
                    they are by that means confined in their places. The whole now forms what is
                    technically called the slat or slate, which is the foundation or the basket.
                    Next, the long end of one of the two rods is taken and woven under and over the
                    pairs of short ends all round the bottom, until the whole be woven in. The same
                    is done with the other rod, and then additional long osiers are also woven in,
                    until the bottom be of sufficient size, and the ¼Oof be occupied by them. Thus
                    the bottom or foundation on which the superstructure is to be raised is
                    finished; and this latter part is accomplished by sharpen- <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ln</hi> S the large ends of as many long and stout osiers as
                    way be necessary to form the ribs or skeleton. These are forced or plaited
                    between the rods of the bottom from die edge towards the centre, and are turned
                    up in the direction of the sides; then other rods are woven in and out between
                    each of them, until the basket is raised to the intended height, or, more
                    correctly speaking, the depth it is to receive. The edge or brim is finished by
                    turning own the perpendicular ends of the ribs, now' protruding and standing up
                    over each other, whereby the whole is rmly and compactly united. A handle is
                    adapted to the " <hi rend="superscript"> 0</hi> ∣ by forcing two or three
                    osiers, sharpened at the end, <hi rend="superscript"> a</hi>. <hi

                    pleases d&gt;e taste of the artist.</p>
                <p>This is the most simple kind of basket, from which others differ only in finer
                    materials and nicer execution; but in these there is considerable scope for
                    taste and fancy, and implements are produced of extreme neatness and ingenuity
                    in construction. Some are formed of twigs or straw entire; others of sections,
                    split of various thickness, coloured, plaited, or plain; and baskets of endless
                    variety in size, figure, and texture, are fabricated, according to the artist’s
                    inclination. The skains are frequently smoked and dyed either of dull or
                    brilliant colours, and, by intermixing them judiciously, a very good effect is
                    produced.</p>
                <p>From the simplicity of this manufacture a great many individuals, independent of
                    professed basket-makers, are occupied in it; and, fortunately, it affords
                    employment to the blind in the several asylums established for their reception.
                    Not that persons suffering privation of sight are incapable of more ingenious
                    and delicate mechanical exercises, but the facility of teaching and acquiring
                    the principles of basket-making being alike obvious, is one of the strongest
                    recommendations in its favour. At Liverpool, where there is an asylum of this
                    description, the art is practised with success; and in the city of Edinburgh a
                    number of the blind find employment of the same kind in the asylum established
                    there.</p>
                <p>The best materials for basket-making have been principally imported into Great
                    Britain from France and Holland; but the duration of the late war induced the
                    inhabitants of this country to endeavour to obtain a supply at home. Cultivation
                    of the osier was imperfectly understood in England, and in Scotland it scarcely
                    received any attention whatever; whence, as a suitable encouragement, that
                    patriotic society, whose notice is specially directed to the improvement of arts
                    and manufactures, offered premiums to those cultivators who should raise the
                    greatest quantity, not being less than 6000 plants on an acre.</p>
                <p>It became an object with such cultivators to ascertain, not only the quantity
                    that could be obtained, but the quality of the produce, which was of the greater
                    consequence, as many plants, passing under the general name of osiers, and even
                    possessing their external characters, are ill adapted for the work intended. But
                    considerable light has been thrown on the subject by Mr Philipps of Ely, who was
                    early rewarded by a premium on account of the utility of his observations. He
                    remarks that the osier is a species of salix, of which there are many varieties;
                    and that these may be comprehended under two classes, the first containing nine
                    or ten species. None, however, excepting one, the gray or brindled osier, is of
                    use. This, in common with the others, has a light coloured leaf, but is
                    distinguished by the bark being streaked with red or blood colour; and it is of
                    late introduction into Britain, having been first planted in the isle of Ely,
                    where the observer’s experiments seem to have been chiefly made. It grows
                    vigorously, is very hardy and tough, and bleaches well. All the others of the
                    same class prefer a wet soil, where they grow quickly and large, flourishing
                    even in the most barren kind of peat; but they are coarse and spongy, have a
                    thick pith, and arc extremely perishable. Nevertheless they are sometimes used
                    for coarser workmanship, and are profitable to those who live in the vicinity of
                    places where there is a great demand for osiers, and cheap conveyance. During
                    the interruption of continental intercourse they were much resorted to by
                    basket-makers; but their inferiority has brought the English baskets into
                    disrepute in foreign markets. The second class, according to Mr Philipps,
                    contains four or five different species. One of these, the Welsh willow, is very
                    tough and durable, but not of a favourable colour. There are two varieties, red
                    and white, the former of which is preferred, and forms part of every plantation,
                    from its particular utility in tying up the bundles<pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193194905" xml:id="kp-eb0704-4905-0430"/> of willows after they have
                    been barked or whitened. The bitterness of this plant is such as to be a
                    protection from the depredations of cattle. Besides these there are the west
                    country Spaniard, the new willow, the French, and the red Kent willow. The first
                    has been superseded by others of superior quality; but experience proves that an
                    acre will carry 2000 plants more of them than of some which are in higher
                    repute. But the best of all is esteemed the French willow, especially as being
                    most adapted for smaller and finer work in baskets, fans, hats, and other light
                    articles. It is rather of slow growth, but extremely taper, pliant,
                    close-grained, tough, and durable. Great quantities of it are always imported
                    from the Continent, its culture being more neglected here than that of the
                    others; however, it must be distinguished from a species resembling it, which is
                    characterized by the brittleness of the leaves, which snap like glass when drawn
                    through the fingers. Plantations of the French willow have been strongly
                    recommended as forming a useful commodity, and being always in demand. Having
                    attained the requisite maturity, all willows are cut down and made up into
                    bunches in iron hoops thirty-six or forty inches in diameter, for the
                    manufacturers, and arc sold either in this way or in loads, the price being
                    subject to fluctuation according to the scarcity or abundance of the
                    commodity.</p>
                <p>- In regard to the cultivation of osiers very different opinions prevail;
                    originating, it is probable, from too limited experiments, combined with the
                    diversity of soil and climate. Mr Philipps, whose opinions are entitled to
                    attention, conceives that autumn, and not spring, is the most proper season for
                    planting willows; the stagnation of the juices he considers the true criterion
                    whereby to regulate the period, but not on account of the set so much as on
                    account of the trunk; for if the shoot be severed when the sap is in
                    circulation, the parent plant bleeds to death. The osiers which he planted in
                    the first week of October he found to have struck roots about Christmas, though
                    there was no external sign of vegetation. In prosecuting this subject, Mr
                    Philipps observes, that he made a plantation in autumn, and filled up part of
                    the ground which was vacant, in the following month of March, with additional
                    sets. The latter were the further advanced in May, but in June the autumn plants
                    had the advantage, and continued growing well, while many of the others died. In
                    summer, he remarks, “when the fibres have been formed before the winter, or when
                    a tendency to form them has been observed by the swelling of the bark, and
                    particularly at the eye, the plant is enabled to charge itself with a sufficient
                    portion of the juices to answer the demand of spring.” Therefore he concludes
                    that the proper rule is to plant as early in autumn as the shoots may be cut,
                    without injuring the parent stock. The cultivator lays out the ground in beds or
                    burrows eighteen feet broad, digging ditches nine feet wide on each side. The
                    upper surface of the ditches, to the depth of fourteen inches, is thrown on the
                    beds, and the remainder of what is excavated from them is used for turf or fuel.
                    The beds, now consisting of about two feet and a half thick of solid earth above
                    the surface of the substratum of peat, are planted in the following autumn, and
                    produce good crops.</p>
                <p>Experiments have been made by various cultivators respecting the suitableness of
                    different soils, after having borne different kinds of grain. Mr Sheriff has
                    related a profitable mode of culture practised by him in Scotland, and also made
                    some judicious observations on the subject in general. He remarks, that the
                    finest and most valuable twigs can be procured only from land cured of chilling,
                    weeping springs; and if the soil is not of considerable thickness, it must be
                    rendered so by manure. Moderate moisture is favourable to the production of fine
                    twigs, but water constantly stagnant is ruinous. He proposes to make the cuts or
                    shoots from fifteen to seventeen inches in length, and to allow four or five
                    inches to remain above ground, to be cut down by the surface of the soil, when
                    the heads of the stocks shall, in a series of years, have become too bushy. By
                    this operation, the vigour of the plant is renewed in the most decided manner.
                    Mr Sheriff forgets, however, that, in the time he mentions, a much greater
                    protrusion from the earth will have taken place by the simple vegetation of the
                    plant than is necessary to leave room for cutting off the head. It is necessary,
                    in his opinion, to trim and dress the stocks from decayed wood, and to retain
                    only as many buds on each as the plant may be expected to bring to perfection in
                    length and strength of shoot. Thus the superabundant stumps of old wood are cut
                    down, and the weakest shoots extirpated, in November and December, or March and
                    April; and seldom more than two buds should be left on those selected to stand
                    and produce the next summer’s growth. He considers the leading errors of those
                    who have attempted the cultivation of osiers to consist in employing improper
                    soil, peat-earth, perhaps, or poor bogs; and also in defective preparation of
                    the soil, though suitable in other respects. Failure may, besides, arise from
                    planting bad or useless species of osiers; putting too few cuts in the ground;
                    neglecting their subsequent culture, particularly during the first spring and
                    summer after plantation; and allowing the shoots to be cut down after Christmas,
                    and before the middle of March, which renders the stocks liable to be much
                    weakened by hard frosts succeeding heavy, rains, immediately after the twigs
                    have been cut, and before the wounds from the knife have healed. By pursuing a
                    system analogous to what is here exposed, he calculates the profits of an acre
                    of osiers at about L.18. 10s.; and he mentions that he contracted to receive a
                    sum between L.220 and L.250 for the produce of twelve statute acres and a half.
                    It does not appear, however, that this was an annual crop, and it is rather to
                    be inferred that willows of several years’ growth formed part of it. Mr
                    Sheriff’s experiments and observations were rewarded with the gold medal of the
                    Society for the Encouragement of Arts and Manufactures. Another cultivator, Mr
                    Wade, calculated his profits on fourteen acres, which were planted with 12,000
                    sets each, at intervals of twenty-six inches by ten, &gt; as amounting to L.10
                    per acre.</p>
                <p>Among the experiments on the quality of soil may be. instanced a plantation made
                    in spring, of large cuttings, eighteen inches long, thrust so far into the earth
                    as to leave four or five inches protruding. Part of the ground had been in wheat
                    after summer fallow, and part, which was also planted, had been sown with grass
                    seeds. The plants made a more vigorous shoot in spring than at any subsequent
                    period, and of the whole but few failed. Those which succeeded the wheat
                    produced the best osiers, and those which were planted among the grass seeds the
                    worst. Both stood on a strong clay soil; and from the difference seen here, it
                    has been concluded, that, as the cleanest ground produced the best crop, summer
                    fallowing would be advantageous. Another example is given, where, of 350 sets
                    planted in garden ground, the soil of which was clay, 341 succeeded, producing,
                    in the first year apparently, a bundle thirty-eight inches in circumference, and
                    some of the osiers above ten feet long. They were plantet in the latter end of
                    March, and arranged in rows, between which was sown a crop of beans. Both the
                    interval separating the plants and their age are arbitrary, as is also the
                    extent of the plantation, and we may likewise add the quality of the soil; for
                    experiments have not been made on a sufficient scale to determine the fact. The
                    most su-ŋcrficial<pb break="no" facs="nls:193194918"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0704-4918-0431"/> observer cannot fail to have remarked the
                    comparative slenderness of all plants crowded together, and the superior
                    strength of those apart from each other. The sets of osiers, for several
                    reasons, should be inserted in re° ’ ular rows. Their age does not appear
                    important, and nowhere is a more vigorous crop produced than from the root of
                    the oldest tree deprived of its trunk. In general, previous preparation of the
                    ground is profitable; and plantations may thence be formed, which are to be
                    annually cut down for baskets and such light utensils; but the shoot is allowed
                    to grow two, or even four years, if strong rods are required for larger and
                    coarser workmanship. The rapidity and certainty with which this plant vegetates
                    preserves it in a manner under absolute control, and peculiarly adapts it for a
                    variety of mechanical purposes. Many cultivators recommend deep insertion of the
                    shoot into the ground; but here there is a limitation; for if it be too deeply
                    inserted, the vegetation will be less vigorous. At the same time, the powerful
                    tendency to vegetation in a willow is rather an exception to ordinary rules; and
                    although the lower part be injured, roots may spring nearer the surface. But it
                    is not to be overlooked, that if a tree be transplanted into too deep a pit, the
                    root, instead of striking out new fibres, remains inactive, and the tree withers
                    and decays; or if seeds be deposited too deeply in the earth, no vegetation will
                    ensue; whereas, even those on the surface will put forth a radicle, and
                    establish themselves there. In the former ease, they either lose the germinative
                    faculty, or are destroyed; but, if a tree be transplanted into a shallow pit,
                    the root w ill spread, and the whole will exhibit a luxuriant vegetation. These
                    are facts which demand greater attention than they usually receive; and the
                    depth at which the shoots of osiers are inserted should be carefully observed.
                    Nevertheless we must repeat, that it does appear that deep insertion is not as
                    noxious to them as to other plants.</p>
                <p>It is commonly understood that willows flourish nowhere but with abundance of
                    water. Undoubtedly, adequate humidity is very essential; but this general
                    position is quite erroneous, as experiment and observation daily testify.
                    Willows growing in water have almost invariably a sickly aspect; few strong cr
                    healthy scions spring from them; and their vegetation is never so vigorous as
                    when they are at some distance from it. Every plant has a predilection for a
                    particular place, where the conditions of its aliment and vegetation coneur. The
                    willow requires a considerable degree of humidity, though it will also be seen
                    vigorous on drier soils; but the vicinity of water is an essential quality in
                    selecting a suitable spot for a plantation. The purposes to which the plants are
                    to be applied must be considered, and the circumstances of their growth so
                    regulated, that they may become suitable for the object in view. There is little
                    doubt that, with due notice and consideration, this plant may receive great
                    amelioration by culture.</p>
                <p>All plantations must be well fenced against cattle, as the willow, both shoot and
                    leaf, is with them a favourite kind of food; and as some particular caterpillars
                    infest the plant at certain seasons of the year, stripping it totally bare and
                    injuring its vegetation, care should also be taken to remove them as effectually
                    as possible. <hi rend="smallcaps">(n. n.)</hi><hi rend="italic smallcaps">
