                <p><label type="entry">BELFAST</label>, a sea-port town of Ireland, in the county of
                    Antrim, situated at the efflux of the river Lagan into Carrickfergus Bay, which
                    is a spacious estuary, containing a superficial area of twenty-four square
                    miles. Although at present conspicuous for commercial and political importance,
                    it is generally supposed to be of very modern origin; and this is so far
                    correct, that there is no town in the kingdom which has advanced to eminence
                    with equal rapidity, or which has been so little distinguished in the ancient,
                    and so much in the modern history of Ireland. At present Belfast must certainly
                    rank as the third town in Ireland for the extent of its commerce, as well as for
                    the wealth of its inhabitants. It is well built, chiefly of brick; and the
                    streets are broad, straight, and well paved and lighted. It has various public
                    buildings deserving notice; among which are two episcopalian churches, both very
                    elegant structures, six churches for Presbyterians, two for ieceders, one for
                    Evangelicals, one for Covenanters, one for Quakers, three for Methodists, and
                    two for Roman Catholics, who are in number about 4000. The other public
                    buildings are, a linen-hall; an exchange, near which is a good assembly-room; a
                    theatre, commercial buildings, and barracks for 800 men. A house of correction
                    was built in 1817. The charitable institutions are, two hospitals, a house of
                    industry for the blind, and one for the abolition of mendicity, established in
                    1809. The Belfast incorporated charitable society has a poor-house and
                    infirmary, and a large and commodious building in which aged poor are
                    maintained, as also poor children, who are clothed and educated. The funds for
                    the support of these institutions are derived from bequests and annual
                    contributions. Besides these, there is a public dispensary, a school of industry
                    for the blind, and a number of charity schools. There are also several
                    commercial institutions, such as insurance omces, banks, &amp;c.; and among the
                    literary institutions <hi rend="superscript"> ma</hi> y be mentioned the
                    seminary called the New College, which was founded in 1810 on an extensive
                    scale, and contains endowments for professors in natural philosophy, <hi
                    rend="superscript"> i</hi> ∏oral philosophy, logic and belles lettres, Hebrew,
                    Greek, Latin, and mathematics, and also schools for the more elementary branches
                    of education. The funds were derived in the first instance from liberal private
                    contributions; but subsequently aid was obtained from government. This town is
                    conveniently situated for commerce. The river Lagan, in entering Carrickfergus
                    Bay, forms, as already stated, a spacious estuary, in which there is safe
                    anchorage. The trade of the port is also connected with the extensive lake
                    called Lough Neagh, by means of a canal which is navigable for lighters. Great
                    part of the productions of the neighbouring counties is here consumed or
                    shipped, Belfast being considered the chief emporium of the north of Ireland for
                    every article both of foreign and domestic produce; and in some branches of
                    manufacture it is considered equal, if not superior, both to Cork and Dublin. A
                    considerable trade is carried on with the West Indies, America, and other parts
                    of the world. The chief exports are linen and cotton manufactures, butter, beef,
                    pork, grain, and oatmeal. The vessels belonging to the port amount to 201, and
                    their tonnage to 23,193. Two convenient docks have been constructed for
                    repairing them; and vessels drawing thirteen feet of water can approach the
                    wharfs at flood tide. The trade of this place has rapidly improved, as is shown
                    by the amount of the custom-house duties, which in 1800 were only L.62,668, but
                    in the course of. sixteen years increased to L.349,417; and their amount has
                    since been progressively advancing. Belfast has manufactories of flax-spinning,
                    cotton, and linen, though cotton seems to be gaining the ascendency over linen.
                    There are also manufactories of glass, vitriol, and pottery, and of cast-iron
                    and paper. Two bridges are built over the river, one at the east end of the
                    town, an old bridge 2500 feet long, and consisting of twenty-one arches; and
                    another built in 1814, about half a mile up the river, on the south of the town,
                    which connects the counties of Antrim and Down. Belfast sends one member to the
                    imperial parliament. The government of the town is vested by charter in the
                    Marquis of Donegal, who is lord of the castle, in the constable of the castle,
                    the sovereign or mayor, and twelve burgesses. The population of Belfast amounted
                    in 1758 to 8549, in 1782 to 13,105, and in 1798 to 18,320. By the population
                    return of 1821 it was 45,000, and by that of 1831, 53,287. It is eighty Irish
                    miles north of Dublin. Long. 5. 54. W. Lat. 54. 35. N.</p>
