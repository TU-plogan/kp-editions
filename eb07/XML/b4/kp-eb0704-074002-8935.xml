                    lord viscount, a great statesman, an indifferent philosopher, and an admirable
                    writer, was descended from an ancient and noble family, and born about the year
                    1672. He had a regular and liberal education, and, by the time he left the
                    university, was considered as a person of uncommon qualifications; but with
                    great parts, he had,'as usually happens, strong passions, and these hurried him
                    into many indiscretions and follies. Contrary to the inclinations of his family,
                    he cultivated tory connections, and gained such an influence in the house of
                    commons, that, in 1704, he was appointed secretary of war and of the marines. He
                    was so closely united in all political measures with Mr Harley, that when the
                    latter was removed from the seals in 1707, Mr St John resigned his employment;
                    and in 1710, when Mr Harley was made chancellor of the exchequer, the post of
                    secretary of state was given to Mr St John. In 1712 he was created Baron St John
                    of Lediard-Tregoze in Wiltshire, and Viscount Bolingbroke. But being overlooked
                    in the bestowal of vacant ribbons of the order of the garter, he resented the
                    affront, renounced the friendship of Harley then earl of Oxford, and made his
                    court to the whigs. Nevertheless on the accession of George I. the seals were
                    taken from him; and being informed that a resolution was taken to pursue him to
                    the scaffold, for his conduct regarding the treaty of Utrecht, he withdrew into
                    France. Here he accepted an invitation to enter into the Pretender’s service,
                    and received the seals as bis secretary; but he was as unfortunate in his new
                    connections as in those which he had renounced; for the year 1715 had scarcely
                    expired, when, at the same time that he was attainted of high treason at home,
                    the seals and papers of his foreign secretary’s office were taken from him; and
                    this was followed by an accusation from the Pretender and his party, of neglect,
                    incapacity, and treachery. Such a complication of distressful events threw him
                    into a state of reflection that produced a <hi rend="italic">consolatio
                    philosophica,</hi> in the manner of Seneca and of Boethius, which he wrote the
                    same year under the title of <hi rend="italic">Heflections upon Exile;</hi> and
                    the following year he drew up a vindication of his conduct with respect to the
                    tories, in the form of <hi rend="italic">A Letter to Sir William Wyndham.</hi>
                    About this time he espoused as his second wife a niece of the famous Madame
                    Maintenon, and widow of the Marquis de Villette, with whom he received a very
                    large fortune. In 1723, the king was prevailed on to grant him a free pardon,
                    and he returned in consequence to England; but he was by no means satisfied with
                    being a mere titular lord, and remaining excluded from the house of peers. This
                    stigma operated to fix his hatred of Sir Robert Walpole, to whose secret enmity
                    he attributed his not receiving the full extent of the kings clemency. Hence he
                    distinguished himself by a multitude of political writings, chiefly directed
                    against that minister, till the year 1735; when, being thoroughly convinced that
                    the door was finally shut against him, he returned once more to France. In this
                    foreign retreat he began his <hi rend="italic">Letters on the Study and Use of
                    History,</hi> for the use of the grandson of the celebrated Lord Clarendon, to
                    whom they are addressed. Upon the death of his father, who lived to be extremely
                    old, he settled at Battersea, the ancient seat of his family, where he passed
                    the remainder of his life in philosophical retirement, uniting, as we are told
                    by his admirers, the wit of Horace with the dignity of Pliny and the wisdom of
                    Socrates. Pope and Swift, the one the greatest poet, the other the greatest wit
                    of the time, were completely devoted to him; and it is well known that the
                    former received from him the materials <pb break="no" facs="nls:193198948"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0704-8948-0741"/>for his <hi rend="italic">Essay on Man.</hi> He
                    died in 1751, and left the care and benefit of his MSS. to Mr Mallet, who
                    published them, together with his formerly printed works, in 5 vols. 4to∙ They
                    are also printed in 9 vols. 8vo.</p>
