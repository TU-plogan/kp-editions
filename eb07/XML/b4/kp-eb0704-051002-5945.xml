                <p><label type="entry">BECKMANN, <hi rend="smallcaps">John</hi></label>, during
                    nearly forty-five years professor at Göttingen, was born at Hoye, in the
                    electorate of Hanover, in 1739. His father, who was receiver of taxes, and
                    postmaster in that town, occupied himself in •the cultivation of a small piece
                    of land, and appears to have inspired his son with a taste for agriculture.
                    However, all the honour of his education belongs to his mother, who, having
                    become a widow when young Beckmann was scarcely seven years old, sent him, in
                    his fifteenth year, to the school at Stade, placing him under the care of
                    Gchlen. Being intended for the clerical function, he repaired in 1759 to
                    Göttingen, to finish his studies there; but, whether the advice of Hollmann, who
                    testified much kindness towards him, produced a change in his plans, or that the
                    instructions of the mathematicians, Kaestner and Tobias Mayer, had greater
                    attractions for him than theology, he abandoned the career on which he had
                    entered, in order to devote himself entirely to the natural sciences, and
                    principally to the application of these sciences to economical purposes. His
                    first studies were not without their use to him; he derived from them a
                    methodical habit of mind, and a considerable knowledge of languages, which, in
                    the sequel, assisted him greatly in the pursuits to which he owed his celebrity.
                    In 1762, having lost his mother, and with her his former means of subsistence,
                    he accepted the offer of Busching, who invited him to come and fill the
                    situation of Professor of Natural Philosophy in the Lutheran Academy at St
                    Petersburg, of which this celebrated geographer had' at that time the direction;
                    but Busching quitting the institution shortly after, and dissensions having
                    arisen among the superintendents, Beckmann gave up his place, and made a journey
                    through Sweden to acquire a detailed knowledge of the mines of this country, and
                    of the manner of working them. Linnaeus having received him hospitably at Upsal,
                    he prolonged his stay there, and availed himself of the friendship as well as
                    the instructions of this great naturalist. In 1766, the governors of the
                    university of Göttingen appointed him, on the recommendation of Busching,
                    professor to this celebrated establishment, of which he became one of the
                    principal ornaments. His mind, entirely directed to the practical uses of human
                    knowledge, had early conceived the idea of an academical classification of the
                    arts and different branches of economy, both political and domestic, which had
                    hitherto been left to routine and accident. He composed, to serve him as a guide
                    in this course of instruction, <hi rend="italic">Treatises on Rural Economy, on
                    Policy, on Finance, on Commerce,</hi> and other departments of practical
                    knowledge; which, though since carried to a higher degree of perfection, owed to
                    Beckmann their primary elements and their first scientific form. H⅛ <hi
                    rend="italic">Lectures,</hi> which had at the time the recommendation of
                    novelty, were attended by the flower of the studious youth whom the most
                    civilized nations of Europe sent to the university of Göttingen; and it may be
                    added, that the most distinguished statesmen and public functionaries of Germany
                    were among his auditors. He was in the habit of accompanying them himself into
                    the workshops, to give them a knowledge of the different processes and
                    handicrafts of which he had explained to them the theory. He never relinquished
                    his public lectures; but his private studies took insensibly a direction
                    altogether historical, the motives for which it will not, perhaps, be
                    uninteresting to point out.</p>
                <p>It is considered at Göttingen, that a professor cannot be excused from explaining
                    the progress of the science which he teaches, in all the civilized nations of
                    Europeat the same time. Any one who, two years after the appearance of a work of
                    importance in his department, published in any country of Europe whatsoever,
                    should not have read and analyzed it in order to refute or else enrich his own
                    observations from it, would not regard himself as a worthy successor to the
                    chair of Haller, of Mosheim, of Gesner, and Michaelis. Beckmann, in particular,
                    having studied at Göttingen at a time when the example of these great men
                    dictated the law and gave the tone there, was determined to advance in a line
                    with his age, and not to be ignorant of any of the steps which were making by
                    the numerous and extensive sciences which furnished the foundation and the
                    subjects of practical principles. But these steps were the steps of a giant; and
                    whatever might be his ardour or his love of study, how could he be supposed to
                    read and judge of all the important works which appeared from the year 1770, on
                    chemistry theoretical and practical, on physics, natural history, and
                    mathematics? His disappointment ended in chagrin, and excited in him a degree of
                    anger against the new ideas, methods of reasoning, and materials, which changed
                    the face, enlarged the limits, and facilitated the study of these sciences. His
                    course of lectures, turning only on practical matters, suffered little from this
                    circumstance; but feeling that his writings would be accused of remaining behind
                    the progress of the sciences which were the subject of them, he directed the
                    researches with which he wished to occupy the attention of the public to the
                    history of arts and trades, and employed, in the illustration of this subject,
                    the materials to which he had access in the Göttingen library, assisted by
                    general information, a mind peculiarly fitted for this kind of study, and
                    indefatigable industry. It is to these labours that we owe the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Notices</hi> of Beckmann on the history of discoveries in the most common arts
                    of life; for instance, the history of watch-making, of distillation, of
                    almanacs, of insurance, of the lighting of streets, of the original country and
                    migrations of the fruits and flowers in our gardens, of the common materials for
                    dyeing, of bellows, of fire-arms, of mills, of grinding corn, of carriages, of
                    different parts of our dress, of different household utensils, of a multitude of
                    machines and mechanical contrivances employedin common trades; and of most of
                    the products of industry, such as the gathering of saffron, the preparation of
                    alum, the printing-press, of fulling-mills, of book-keeping, of the digging of
                    turf, of gazettes and newspapers, of stamped paper, of the pearl fishery, of
                    pavings, of chimneys, of collections of natural curiosities, of mile-stones, of
                    pharmacy, of quarantine, of painted paper, of ruffles, of milking, of
                    pawn-brokers, of looking-glasses and glass in general, of soap, of musical
                    glasses, of watchmen, of ices to be eaten, of the anatomy of plants, of
                    exchange, of pens for writing, of instruments of husbandry, of fireworks, of the
                    working of pewter, of tn <hi rend="superscript"> e</hi><pb break="no"

                    indigo, of the gilding of weathercocks, of furs, of steel, of gardening, of
                    crayons, of knives and forks, of corks, of sal-ammonic, of hops, of weaving, of
                    lotteries, of hospitals for orphans and foundlings, of infirmaries, of
                    lazarettoes, of fighting-cocks, of saltpetre, of gunpowder, of aquafortis,
                    &amp;c. &amp;c. We should form to ourselves a very false idea of these <hi
                    rend="italic">Notices</hi> if we expected to find in them only some general
                    account of these arts, and of the different manner of practising them used in
                    different times and places. Beckmann traces their first germ from the most
                    remote periods of antiquity; he follows their development through the obscurity
                    of the middle ages, and exhibits their latest improvements amongst the civilized
                    nations of modern Europe, with a patience and a depth of learning which can only
                    be equalled by the sagacity and the variety of knowledge displayed in his
                    researches. We have thought it would be interesting to the reader to see a list
                    of the most remarkable among these notices, in the order in which they were
                    published. They make five volumes in octavo, published at Leipsic from 1783 to
                    1805, and furnish the most invaluable materials to the individual, or society of
                    men of letters, who may hereafter venture to undertake the general history of
                    the origin and progress of the mechanical arts, which are so important a branch
                    in that of civilization. It is almost needless to add, that the most exact
                    references to original authorities accompany each article, and give it a new
                    value in the eyes of those who are unwilling to take things upon trust, or maybe
                    desirous to push still further the inquiries of the author.</p>
                <p>The same merits belong to his <hi rend="italic">History of the earliest Voyages
                    made in modern times;</hi> a highly interesting collection, which occupied the
                    last years of his life, and which he left at the eighth number. Another result
                    of the literary application and industry of Beckmann was a return to the studies
                    of humanity, to which we are indebted for editions of the work <hi rend="italic"
                    >De Mirabilibus Auscultationibus,</hi> attributed to Aristotle (1786); of the
                    <hi rend="italic">Wonderful Histories</hi> of Antigonus Carystius (1791); and of
                    Marbo-dius’s <hi rend="italic">Treatise on Stones</hi> (1799) ;—editions which
                    required the rare union of physical knowledge and natural sagacity with
                    philological learning. The Royal Society of Göttingen had, in the year 1772,
                    admitted him one of its members; and, from that period to 1783, Beckmann
                    supplied their proceedings with interesting memoirs, among which are the
                    following: <hi rend="italic">On the Reduction of Fossils to their Original
                    Substances; On the History of Alum; On the Sap of Madder; On the Froth of the
                    Sea, from which the Heads are formed for the Nicoian Fistulae; On the History of

                    rend="italic">Commentar.</hi> tom. L~v.</p></note> But from this period he
                    desisted all at once (rom partaking the labours of this learned body, probably
                    boni the same motives that we have assigned above for the change in the objects
                    of his own particular studies. He was, besides, modest to an extreme degree; and
                    his natural timidity did not find any thing to counteract it m the traditional
                    jealousy of reputation, which the example of his predecessors, who had founded
                    the glory of Göt-ţ <hi rend="superscript"> ln</hi> gen, had transmitted to a
                    generation more confident of its powers, and more vain of its merit, but still
                    restrained by habits difficult to lay aside, when the respect for great
                    authorities had originally sanctioned them. His candour, his sincerity, his
                    fidelity in friendship, his affability to his scholars, have been celebrated
                    with one accord by his coadjutors and his auditors. Schlaetzer, whom he had
                    known rom his youth in Russia, was the one among his colleagues with whom he
                    maintained the most uninterrupted intimacy. He was better qualified than almost
                    any one else to appreciate the researches of Beckmann, as he had himself
                    insisted with so much force on the necessity of introducing into history a view
                    of the influence exercised on social institutions by the efforts of industry,
                    and by the birth or maturity of the most common arts. Beckmann died on the 3d of
                    February 1811, after having been admitted into almost all the learned societies
                    of Germany and the north, and after having impressed a tendency to pursuits of
                    practical utility on the minds of a multitude of distinguished young men who had
                    attended his lectures, and whom his celebrity drew to Göttingen during the
                    forty-five years of his professorship. A portrait of him will be found at the
                    head of the twelfth volume of the <hi rend="italic">Economical
                    Encyclopoedia</hi> of Krunitz, and it has been engraved separately by Raid,
                    Schwenterley, and Grape. Beckmann married the daughter of Hohmann, his tutor and
                    friend; she survived him only a few weeks, and they left a son and daughter
                    grown up. His eulogium was pronounced by his colleague, the illustrious Heyne,
                    and was published at Göttingen, with this title, <hi rend="italic">Memoria Joan.
