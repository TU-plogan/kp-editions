                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra
                    space around the <gi>pb</gi> tag. Where a word is hyphenated at a <gi>pb</gi>,

                    rend="smallcaps">ZE, Etienne,</hi> a writer eminently distinguished by his
                    knowledge of history, ecclesiastical antiquities, and the canon law, was born at
                    Tulle on the 24th of December 1630, being the descendant of a family which had
                    long adhered to the legal profession. He received his elementary education at
                    the place of his nativity, and afterwards prosecuted his studies in the
                    university' of Toulouse, where he obtained an exhibition in the College of St
                    Martial. Having finished his course of philosophy, he commenced his attendance
                    in the schools of law; but although he attained to great proficiency in certain
                    departments of jurisprudence, he felt no inclination for the ordinary
                    occupations of a lawyer, and never followed the profession of an advocate. He
                    possessed a natural alacrity of mind, and was capable of the most intense
                    literary exertion; and his life being prolonged beyond the ordinary limits, he
                    successively' engaged in many undertakings of great research and of great
                    utility. Before he quitted the university, he appeared in the character of an
                    author. His earliest inquiries related to different subjects of ecclesiastical
                    antiquities; and the reputation which he thus acquired recommended him to the
                    notice of Μ. de Montchal, archbishop of Toulouse, who granted him access to his
                    library. This prelate was succeeded by Μ. de Marca, who soon became archbishop
                    of Paris, and who was profoundly skilled in those branches of knowledge which
                    Baluze so long continued to cultivate. In 1656 the archbishop invited him to the
                    metropolis. Here he improved in the good graces of his patron, and even
                    participated in his learned researches. From an individual of so much influence
                    at court, he might naturally have hoped for a competent share of preferment; but
                    before his hopes were realized, the prelate died on the 29th of June 1662.</p>
                <p>He speedily found another favourer of his studies in Μ. le Tellier, afterwards
                    chancellor of France, who, with the view of engaging him in the service of his
                    son the Abbé le Tellier, the future archbishop of Reims, conferred upon him many
                    benefits, of which he retained a grateful remembrance. But, from various causes,
                    the proposed arrangement never took place; and he was next connected with the
                    establishment of Μ. de Lamothe-Houdancourt, archbishop of Auch. In 1667 Μ.
                    Colbert offered him the situation of keeper of his library, one of the most
                    magnificent private collections in Europe; and its value, both in manuscripts
                    and in printed books, was greatly augmented by the judgment and zeal of the
                    learned librarian. Having retained, his office for some time after the death of
                    Colbert, he resigned it in the year 1700: the library had then descended to the
                    archbishop of Rouen, and he had ceased to find his situation agreeable. He
                    appears to have occupied apartments connected with the library; and we are
                    informed that he now retired to a house belonging to the Scotish College.</p>
                <p>In the year 1668, the Abbé Faget published some works of his relation Μ. de
                    Marca; and, in the life prefixed, he took occasion to state, that when the
                    prelate was at the point of death, he enjoined Baluze to place all his pap rs in
                    the hands of his son the president. He had in reality committed his manuscripts
                    to the care of Baluze himself, who was therefore greatly offended at this
                    statement, and vented his spleen in different letters. The abbé replied in the
                    same strain, and afterwards inserted their angry correspondence in his
                    collection of Dissertations. Thí heat which Baluze displayed upon this occasion
                    excited the more surprise, as his disposition was habitually gentle. Of his
                    animosity against Faget he has left a further rŗ cord in his life of De Marca,
                    prefixed to the treatise <hi rend="smallcaps">a⅛</hi><hi rend="italic">Concordia
                    Sacerdotii et Imperii,</hi></p>
                <p>In 1670 he was appointed professor of the canon law in the Royal College. The
                    canon law had long been taught <pb break="no" facs="nls:193193644"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0704-3644-0333"/>in the university of Paris, and there indeed it
                    was long tau&lt; <hi rend="superscript"> τ</hi> ht to the enti <hi
                    rend="superscript"> re</hi> exclusion of the civil law; but this was°a new chair
                    which the king was pleased to erect in his favour; and of his high
                    qualifications for such a professorship he has left the most unequivocal proofs.
                    Nor was this die only preferment which his learning procured him. He was
                    appointed a canon of the cathedral of Reims; and in the privilege appended to
                    his edition of Marius Mercator, printed in the year 1684, he is designated
                    “Estienne Baluze, prieur de Beauvais.” It may therefore be inferred that he
                    enjoyed a considerable pension from that abbey; nor were such arrangements
                    uncommon at that period of the history of France. He is described as “simple
                    tonsure ;” an expression which denotes that he was not a priest or a deacon, but
                    had only been initiated into one of the lowest of the seven holy orders. In
                    order to recompense Μ. Martin, who had been the tutor of Colbert’s children,
                    that minister had procured him a pension of 2000 livres, payable out of the
                    bishopric of Auxerre; but the conscientious ecclesiastic represented to his
                    patron that he had rendered no services to the diocese of Auxerre, and therefore
                    could accept of no share of its revenues, more especially as a compensation for
                    services which were not of a spiritual, but of a temporal nature. One half of
                    this pension was then bestowed upon Baluze, whose scruples do not appear to have
                    been equally powerful. In 1683 he had published a volume of councils, and it was
                    his original intention to extend the collection to several volumes; but some of
                    the materials which he had prepared could not be much relished at Rome; and as
                    his pension required the sanction of that most corrupt of all courts, he thought
                    it expedient to abandon his design. Of the acts of the council of Basel he had
                    proposed to print a very ample collection; and this was indeed the part of his
                    plan for which the whole had chiefly been undertaken. After an interval of ten
                    years, he published his lives of the popes of Avignon; a work of curious
                    research, which procured him a pension from the crown, and afterwards the office
                    of director of the Royal College, where he succeeded the Abbé Gallois in the
                    year 1700. But the favour of a court is at all times and in all places held by a
                    very precarious tenure. Baluze, who had attached himself to Cardinal de
                    Bouillon, and had been employed in writing the history of his family, was
                    involved in the disgrace which attended this illustrious prelate. He had traced
                    the cardinal’s lineage to the ancient dukes of Guienne and counts of Auvergne;
                    and when his patron had retired to a foreign country, the tyranny of Louis XIV.
                    endeavoured to mortify him in the person of his family-historian, who was
                    charged with abetting the cardinal’s pretensions to independence. A <hi
                    rend="italic">lettre de cachet</hi> removed him from Paris: his place of exile
                    was repeatedly changed, and his residence successively restricted to Rouen,
                    Blois, Tours, and Orleans; nor could he obtain his recall till the year 1713,
                    after the peace of Utrecht: but although he was at length permitted to revisit
                    Paris, he never recovered his two offices of director and professor of the Royal
                    College. Such proceedings as these, which were very far from being uncommon, are
                    sufficiently characteristic of the old despotism of France.</p>
                <p>Although this persecution commenced when he had nearly attained the age of
                    eighty, it did not quench his literary ardour; for,during his exile, he employed
                    himselfin preparing an edition of the works of St Cyprian, which was published
                    after his death. His constitution had never been vigorous, but the sobriety and
                    regularity of his habits enabled him to reach a mature and healthy old age; and,
                    accordas to the expression of Niceron, he lived with pleasure and died with
                    resignation.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi

                    of his age; and his remains were interred in the church of St Sulpice. A person
                    who had lived so long in the midst of learned dust, without either wife or
                    children to blow it aside, could not well be without his share of peculiarities.
                    He was not entirely exempted from caprice, and his testament exhibited this
                    caprice in no very amiable light; his relations and domestics were almost
                    totally forgotten, and the bulk of his pro∣- perty was bequeathed to a woman who
                    appears to have had no claim upon him. Some scholars, who have collected
                    libraries with much labour and at great expense, are inclined to cherish an
                    anxious wish that they should be preserved entire; but, on the contrary, he was
                    desirous that his library should be sold in detail, lest any one individual
                    should be put in possession of those literary treasures which he himself had
                    gradually amassed. This collection consisted of 10,799 articles, including more
                    than 1500 manuscripts, together with 115 printed books which he had interspersed
                    with annotations. The manuscripts were added to the Royal Library.</p>
                <p>Baluze was a man of great learning and research in those departments to which he
                    had devoted his chief attention; and his publications have in an eminent degree
                    elucidated various branches of law, history, and antiquities. His merits are
                    perhaps more conspicuous as an editor than as an author. He was particularly
                    conversant with ancient manuscripts; and being likewise possessed of much
                    erudition and critical skill, he has published valuable editions of many ancient
                    monuments. If his labours had not extended beyond the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Capitularia Regum Francorum,</hi> his name would always have been mentioned
                    with respect by lawyers and historians; but some of his other publications
                    greatly illustrate the history of the middle ages; nor must we forget the light
                    which they reflect upon the history of the canon law, and upon the writings of
                    the Latin fathers.</p>
                <p>Of the principal works which he pubnshed in a separate form we shall subjoin a

                    edition, consisting of four books, had been published in 1641, when the author
                    was president of the parliament of Pau. The edition of 1663 contains four
                    additional books; and the two subsequent editions received further augmentations
                    from Baluze. The life of the author had been published in a separate form, under
                    the title of “Stephani Baluzii Tutelensis, Canonioi Remensis, Epistola ad

                    are discussed with a considerable degree of freedom by the very distinguished

                    Baluze. The text and the notes were soon afterwards republished by another

                    2 tom. fol. This edition is splendidly printed. Of Baluze’s preface a
                    translation was published by L’Es-calopier de Nouras, under the title of <hi

                    Baluzius, who having found this treatise, not only communicated it to the world,
                    but enriched it with his learned notes; by which he has added a new essay, to
                    the manv that have already appeared, of his great sincerity, his profound
