                    significant corrections to the OCR text, predominantly in cases of confusing "c"
                    and "e." Isolates 90 entries that were mistakenly included at the end of prior
                    entries in v1 and v2. Normalizes ordinal numbers. Separates metadata in
                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra
                    space around the <gi>pb</gi> tag. Where a word is hyphenated at a <gi>pb</gi>,

                <p><label type="entry">BOOTAN</label>. This extensive region is situated between
                    Bengal and Thibet, and principally between the twenty-sixth and twenty-eighth
                    degrees of north latitude, though its limits are far from being exactly defined.
                    It is supposed to be 200 miles from east to west, and 90 from north to south. To
                    the north it is separated from Thibet by the eastern ridges of the Himalaya
                    range, to the south by the province of Bengal, to the east by an unexplored
                    region north of Assam, and to the west by a country subject .to the
                    Nepaulese.</p>
                <p>Bootan is a very mountainous and rugged country. Its mountains form part of the
                    great Himalaya chain, and they abound in the most picturesque and sublime
                    scenery. “The prospects,” says Turner, “between abrupt and lofty prominences
                    were inconceivably grand; hills clothed to their very summits with trees, dark
                    and deep glens, and the high tops of mountains lost in the clouds, constituted
                    altogether a scene of extraordinary magnificence and sublimity.” In many parts
                    the road, winding round the hills, becomes a narrow ledge, and hangs over depths
                    which no eye can reach; and were not the horror of the scene in some degree
                    softened by the trees and climbing plants which line the precipices, it would be
                    impossible to advance on such a perilous path. The rivers that find a passage
                    between mountains which hide their heads in the clouds are frequently
                    precipitated in tremendous cataracts over frightful precipices, or into dark and
                    unfathomable glens, where their imprisoned waters roar and foam like the surges
                    of a tempestuous sea, until they <pb break="no" facs="nls:193199624"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0704-9624-0793"/>issue out into the plains. Turner mentions one
                    stream ' which issues from the high grounds in a collected body; but descends
                    from so great a height, that before it reaches the thick shade below, it is
                    nearly dissipated, and appears like the steam arising from boiling water. In so
                    mountainous a country, abounding in torrents, bridges are frequent, and a
                    traveller has to pass one or more in every day’s journey. They are of various
                    construction, generally of timber, at other times of iron chains, on the same
                    plan as the chain bridges in this country. Bamboos frequently afford the
                    material of their construction. Turner mentions one consisting of two ropes made
                    of twisted creepers, stretched parallel to each other across the river, and
                    encircled with a hoop, on which the traveller sits down, and seizing one rope in
                    each hand, he slides himself along, and crosses an abyss on which it is
                    impossible to look without shuddering. The same traveller crossed another bridge
                    made entirely of fir, without one particle of iron about it. When the width of
                    the river admits, the timber is laid horizontally from rock to rock. Over
                    broader streams, a triple or quadruple row of timbers, one row projecting over
                    the other, and inserted into the rock, sustains two sloping sides, which are
                    united by a horizontal platform of nearly equal length. The centre is in this
                    manner raised very much above the current, and the whole bridge forms the figure
                    of nearly three sides of an octagon. Piers are seldom used, on account of the
                    extreme rapidity of the rivers, and the unequal height of the opposite shores.
                    Turner mentions that the widest river in Bootan has an iron bridge, consisting
                    of a number of chains, which support a matted platform; and two chains are
                    stretched above, parallel with the sides, to allow of a matted border, which is
                    absolutely necessary to the safety of the passenger, who is never quite at his
                    ease till he has landed from this swinging unsteady footing. Only one horse is
                    permitted to go over this bridge at a time. Bridges for foot passengers are
                    frequently formed of two parallel chains, round which creepers are loosely
                    twisted, sinking very much in the middle, where suitable planks are placed, and
                    form a very good footing.</p>
                <p>At the foot of the mountains between Bootan and Bengal a plain extends for about
                    thirty miles, covered with the most luxuriant vegetation, but of the most
                    noxious atmosphere, occasioned by the exhalations from the multitude of springs
                    that descend from the mountains, and which are collected and confined by these
                    almost impervious woods. No traveller ever passed through this unhealthy
                    atmosphere with impunity. A British force was sent on an expedition in 1772
                    against the country of Bootan, when the greater part of the troops perished in
                    crossing this unhealthy tract. The jungles of high grass or of wood by which it
                    is covered abound in tigers, wild buffaloes, elephants, rhinoceroses, and
                    bears.</p>
                <p>The climate, from the inequality of the ground, affords every degree of variation
                    from summer heat to the freezing point. At the time the inhabitants of Punakha
                    (the winter residence of the rajah), are afraid of exposing themselves to an
                    almost vertical sun, those of Ghassa experience all the rigour of winter, and
                    are chilled by perpetual snows; and both these places are within sight of each
                    other. On the elevated mountain heights it is cold and moist, and here the
                    clouds are intercepted and descend in rains. The rains, however, in the vicinity
                    of Tassisudon, the capital, are moderate. There are frequent showers, but
                    nothing that can be compared to the tropical rains of Bengal. Owing to the great
                    elevation and steepness of the mountains, dreadful tempests of winds arise among
                    the hollows, which are often attended with fatal effects. A considerable
                    village, situated on the brow of a lofty hill, was nearly destroyed by one of
                    these tempests. In one night a hurricane swept nine houses down the steep, with
                    their unfortunate inmates; and though search was afterwards made, not the
                    slightest traces of them were ever found. Three houses still remain, and their
                    tenants, unawed by the dismal fate of their neighbours, still retain their
                    situations. At Wandipore, a town still farther in the interior, a perpetual
                    hurricane prevails; and, as a proof of the violence and steadiness of the wind,
                    the trees have their branches all pointed towards the east, on which side the
                    branches grow with vigour, and are full of luxuriant foliage, while on the other
                    side they are perfectly denuded and bare. This singular effect results from the
                    peculiar conformation of the hills, which throws a constant current of wind with
                    great fury across the corner where the trees have been planted.</p>
                <p>The people are industrious, and devote themselves to agriculture. In the vicinity
                    of the cottages, which are interspersed throughout the mountains, the land is
                    cleared for cultivation, and produces thriving crops of barley and wheat, and a
                    small grain from which they make a fermented liquor to drink. It is the practice
                    of the husbandmen to level the ground which they cultivate on the sides of the
                    hills, by cutting it in shelves, and forming beds of such a size as the slope
                    will admit; and these beds being bordered with a low mound of earth, the water
                    may be retained on them or let off at will. In irrigating their fields the
                    farmers of Bootan make use of the hollow trunks of trees, by which they conduct
                    water across the chasms of the mountains. They are generally good husbandmen,
                    and display much industry in the management of their grounds. Their corn fields
                    are neatly dressed; though the credit of this is due more to the women than the
                    men, as by far the greatest share of the labour falls upon them. They plant,
                    they weed, and they reap and thresh out the corn. They are exposed, in a variety
                    of laborious offices, to the inclemency of the weather; while the men, living in
                    idleness, enjoy the fruits of their toils.</p>
                <p>Fruits are very abundant, namely, lemons, limes, citrons, oranges, and walnuts,
                    which are exquisite; excellent pomegranates, peaches, and apricos; apples,
                    pears, &amp;c. which are harsh, and of a disagreeable flavour. Strawberries,
                    raspberries, and blackberries are found growing wild in the woods. Large turnips
                    of an excellent quality are also produced. They are free from fibres, and
                    remarkably sweet. The climate is generally well adapted to the production both
                    of European and Asiatic fruits and vegetables. Potatoes have been introduced;
                    but, either from ignorance or idleness, the inhabitants have failed in the
                    cultivation of this valuable root. The forests abound with a variety of stately
                    trees, and the fir is often found eight or ten feet in circumference. The other
                    trees seen in the woods are the beech, the ash, birch, maple, cypress, yew, and
                    pine. There are no oak trees. Among these mountains, in the vicinity of
                    Murichom, grows the cinnamon tree. Some of the roots and branches were examined
                    by Mr Turner in the course of his journey to Thibet; but the plant being neither
                    in blossom nor bearing fruit, it was impossible to decide whether it was the
                    true cinnamon or an inferior kind of cassia. The leaf, however, corresponded
                    with the description given of the true cinnamon by Linnaeus. In approaching the
                    summits of the highest mountains, the stately trees of the forest disappear, and
                    are succeeded by that hardy and dwarfish species of vegetation which is peculiar
                    to mountainous tracts.</p>
                <p>Wild animals are extremely rare in Bootan; and Turner mentions, as an
                    extraordinary circumstance, that he one day saw a multitude of monkeys playing
                    their gambols by the road side. They are of a large and handsome kind, with
                    black faces surrounded by a streak of white hair, and having very long slender
                    limbs. They are held sacred by <pb break="no" facs="nls:193199637"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0704-9637-0794"/>the Booteans as well as by the Hindoos. The horse,
                    a certain species of which is indigenous to Bootan, and is used as a domestic
                    animal, is called tangun, from Tangustan, the general appellation of that
                    assemblage of mountains which constitutes the territory of Bootan. It is
                    peculiar to this tract, not being found in any of the neighbouring countries of
                    Assam, Nepaul, Thibet, or Bengal, and unites in an eminent degree the two
                    qualities of strength and beauty, being remarkable for symmetry and just
                    proportions. The Tangun horse is usually about thirteen hands high,
                    short-bodied, clean-limbed, and deep in the chest, yet extremelyactive. Being
                    constantly accustomed to struggle against acclivities, there is a surprising
                    energy and vigour in all his movements; and this indomitable spirit is supposed
                    by Europeans to proceed from a headstrong and ungovernable temper, while in
                    reality it is only an excess of eagerness in the performance of any allotted
                    task. The colour of this horse usually inclines to pyebald, and those of one
                    colour are rarely to be found. Though the larger animals are scarce, the country
                    is in some parts infested by insects. A venomous fly annoys the inhabitants of
                    Muri-chnm and its vicinity. It differs from the mosquito both in form and size,
                    but fixes itself in the same manner, and draws blood with its proboscis. It
                    leaves behind a small blister, full of black contaminated blood, which enlarges
                    and inflames, and becomes extremely troublesome. Most of the inhabitants are so
                    marked by wounds from this fly, that such parts as are exposed to the air are
                    covered with scurf; and being sometimes attended with tumours, acquire a very
                    diseased appearance. ⅛</p>
                <p>The inhabitants of this elevated tract are of active habits and of a Herculean
                    make, many of them being six feet’ high, and are entirely different from the
                    feeble and timid natives of Bengal. A general resemblance of features pervades
                    the whole race of these hardy mountaineers. They are fairer than their Bengal
                    neighbours, and have generally broader faces, with high cheek-bones. They have
                    invariably black hair, which it is their fashion to cut close to the head. The
                    cye, which is a remarkable feature in their face, is small and black, with long
                    pointed corners, as if stretched and extended by artificial means. Their
                    eye-lashes are so thin as to be scarcely perceptible. Their face is rather flat,
                    narrowing from the cheek-bones to the chin, and broadest below the eyes,—a
                    physiognomy which somewhat resembles that of the Tartars, though it is far more
                    strongly marked among the Chinese. They have very small beards, and they
                    generally reach an advanced age before they have the appearance of any; and in
                    this also they resemble the Tartars. They are greatly affected with those
                    glandnlar swellings in the throat to which the inhabitants of mountain districts
                    are frequently liable, and which prevail among the natives of the Alps, and in
                    Styria, Carinthia, the Ukraine, and the Tyrol. These swellings extend below the
                    chin from ear to ear, and sometimes grow to such an enormous size as to hang
                    from the throat down upon the breast.</p>
                <p>The Booteans are not a warlike people, and in the brief contest which took place
                    in 1772 with the British, though they displayed great personal courage, they
                    were unable to withstand the effects of musketry and cannon. Their military
                    accoutrements are extremely cumbrous. As a defence against the weapons of-their
                    opponents,' they cover their bodies with a prodigious deal of clothing, wearing
                    under the common mantle a blanket or thick quilted jacket. On the arm is carried
                    a large corner shield of painted cane, and a long straight sword is worn across
                    the body. To these is added a bow, six feet long, made of bamboo, remarkable for
                    its elasticity and strength. The arrow is headed by a flattened barb of pointed
                    iron, the sides of which are sometimes grooved to admit the lodgment of poison,
                    with which deadly substance it is frequently charged. The plant which affords
                    this poison is described as growing to the height of three, or four feet, with ä
                    hollow stalk. The juice is inspissated, and laid as a paste on their arrows; but
                    it has not all the effect intended, as the wound thus inflicted seldom proves
                    fatal. Some of them are armed with matchlocks, which are in general badly made,
                    and in wretched order. In the management of the sword and shield they are very
                    dexterous, and are excellent archers. They have no cannon.</p>
                <p>The Booteans have made no great advances in the arts and improvements of life,
                    though in the construction of public works, such as bridges, aqueducts, &amp;c.
                    they display both perseverance and ingenuity. The nature of the bridges which
                    they construct has been already described. The aqueducts which they contrive arc
                    for the purpose of diffusing the water that issues from the mountain springs
                    over the valleys, which are thus irrigated and rendered fit for agriculture.
                    These conduits, although composed of the hollowed trunks of large trees, forced
                    in the soil which covers the rock, or sustained by beams inserted in it, convey
                    the waters across deep dells and along the sides of precipices, and exhibit in a
                    very favourable view the ingenuity and industry of the people, especially when
                    it is considered that, being surrounded and shut up on every side by impervious
                    mountains, they are left to their own resources, and cannot borrow aid from the
                    inventions of more improved nations. Their houses arc in general of one story,
                    and not commodious. They have no fireplaces; and when the cold forces them to
                    have recourse to a fire, one is kindled in the middle of the room on a large
                    flat stone; and the inmates, ranging themselves round it, are enveloped in
                    volumes of pure smoke, which has no other exit but the windows, and never fails
                    by its pungency to annoy all who are present.</p>
                <p>The Booteans are social and cheerful in their rammers. The women and the men mix
                    freely together; and they are frequently seen sitting under the cavities of the
                    rocks or other sheltered places, chatting together in great good humour, and
                    occasionally indulging in obstreperous laughter. They generally exhibit a
                    picture of rosy health; the women in particular, with their jet black hair, and
                    clear, brisk, black eyes, possess a ruddiness which, according to Turner, the
                    most florid English rustic would in vain attempt to rival. Yet they are far from
                    being cleanly in their habits; nor are their manners and amusements of a refined
                    cast. A bull fight is a favourite exhibition, for which purpose they train the
                    largest and fiercest animals of the species that can be procured. They are led
                    to the ground well secured with strong ropes fastened to them, struggling
                    violently as if impatient of restraint, and rolling their prominent eyes with
                    fury as if instructed in the fierce purpose for which they are brought together.
                    Being released for the conflict, they do not rush instantly together, but
                    advance cautiously, eyeing each other askance, until being within a short
                    distance, they rush together with a dreadful concussion; and the contest
                    continues until one or other is overpowered by the superior strength of his
                    antagonist, when they are separated.</p>
                <p>The temperature, from the elevation of the country, is so cold that the
                    inhabitants require warm covering; and hence their clothing consists of thick
                    woollen cloths. Their mode of living is simple; their food consisting of fruits,
                    vegetables, and roots. Tea is as comnion a refreshment as in China, but the mode
                    of preparation is extremely different. It is not merely an infusion which is
                    here used. The tea itself is beat up with water, flour, butter, salt, and other
                    ingredients, which are all mixed together. This is a regale not much suited to a
                    European palate, yet it is said by those who have visited the country to become
                    more <pb break="no" facs="nls:193199650" xml:id="kp-eb0704-9650-0795"
                    />acceptable by habit, and by a little practice even to be esteemed a luxury.
                    Having finished the cup, they lick it in order to make it clean, when it is
                    wrapt up, to be preserved, in a piece of scarlet silk. They extract a spirit
                    from rice, wheat, barley, or other kinds of grain, which they call chong, and
                    which is prepared by the infusion of a mass of grain when in a state of
                    fermentation. It is a slightly acid and spirituous liquor, and is a most
                    grateful beverage, especially when warm, and when fatigue and heat induce
                    intemperate thirst. From this preparation of fermented grain an ardent spirit is
                    obtained by distillation, here termed arra, which is fiery and powerfully
                    inebriating.</p>
                <p>The Booteans have scarcely any manufactures. They have a class of workmen who are
                    employed in forgingbrazen gods, and various other ornaments disposed about
                    religious buildings. They also manufacture paper from the bark of a tree which
                    grows on the mountains in the interior, and which is of so strong a texture that
                    it is capable of being woven, when cut by way of ornament, into the texture of
                    silks and satins.</p>
                <p>We know little of the commerce of Bootan. The general policy of the people seems
                    to resemble that of the Chinese in excluding strangers from their dominions. It
                    is certain that a decided aversion to all intercourse with the natives of
                    Hindostan has always prevailed among the natives on its northern frontier. The
                    district of Ringpore in Bengal is no doubt annually visited by a caravan from
                    Bootan, which brings with it oranges, walnuts, and the coarse woollen
                    manufactures of the country, with the horses which carry them, for sale; and it
                    returns after a month’s stay with the cotton cloths, salt, and other articles,
                    the produce of Bengal. But the inhabitants of the latter country have never been
                    allowed the same privilege of free access to Bootan. The people evince an
                    extreme jealousy of strangers, from a dread that, if once admitted into the
                    country, and knowing all its paths, they might attempt its conquest. The
                    presents sent by the ruler of Bootan to the Bengal presidency in 1772 consisted
                    of sheets of gilt leather stamped with the black eagle of the Russian armorial,
                    talents of gold and silver, bulses of gold dust, bags of genuine musk, narrow
                    woollen cloths of Thibet manufacture, and Chinese silk. The chests which
                    contained them were of good workmanship, and joined together by dove-tail
                    work.</p>
                <p>The supreme ruler of Bootan is called the Deb Raja. He resides at Tassisudon, and
                    possesses unlimited sway over his subjects, who show him unbounded veneration,
                    prostrating themselves nine times in his presence, after the eastern fashion. He
                    appears, however, to exercise his authority with mildness and moderation; and
                    the conversation which he had with the British embassy was replete with moral
                    and religious maxims, and with sentiments of enlightened humanity. The people
                    follow the religion of Buddha; and the priests form a distinct class, who are
                    called gylongs, and are bound by the most rigid vows of celibacy. They are
                    dispersed throughout the country in monasteries, and other buildings
                    appropriated to their use. About 1500 of them inhabit the palace at Tassisudon.
                    They are entirely exempted from labour, and their sole occupation consists in
                    performing the duties of their faith; and, along with chastity, they are
                    enjoined to observe temperance and sobriety. This establishment is recruited by
                    voluntary members; yet a custom prevails, by which every family which has more
                    than four boys is bound to contribute one of them to the priestly order. At the
                    age of ten they commence their noviciate, which continues until twenty. They
                    enjoy great distinction, and from them are selected the public functionaries of
                    the state. It is their practice to assemble at day-break in their chapels for
                    the performance of their orisons, which are chanted to the clamorous noise of
                    numerous instruments; and the same thing takes place at noon, and also in the
                    evening, when the day is closed with prayer. They are then inclosed within the
                    gates of their residence, as well for the sake of tranquillity and safety, as to
                    prevent a violation of their rigid rules of chastity.</p>
                <p>The principal towns of Bootan are Tassisudon the capital, Poonakha, Wandipore,
                    Ghassa, and Murichom. Our knowledge of the country is very imperfect, and
                    reaches very little beyond the line traversed by Europeans. We have no data for
                    forming any estimate of the population, which, from the remotely-scattered towns
                    and villages, we may conjecture to be very scanty.</p>
                <p>The Deb Raja has always manifested the strongest inclination to extend his
                    territories by encroaching on those of his neighbours; and as they are not
                    divided by any distinctly marked boundary line from those of the East India
                    Company, the respective dominions of the two powers being, on the contrary,
                    intermixed in the most irregular manner, it is extremely difficult to detect
                    encroachments. In 1772, as already mentioned, he suddenly invaded the
                    principality of Cooch Bahar, and, meeting with little opposition, took
                    possession of the country. But the vigorous advance of Captain Jones with two
                    battalions of native infantry, and the capture by storm of the fortress of
                    Delamcotta, struck terror into the Raja, and compelled him to sue for peace.
                    Since this period the same persevering desire has always been displayed by the
                    Bootcans to encroach on the British possessions along the whole frontier line
                    from the Sutlcdge to the Brahmaputra; and though in many instances their crafty
                    policy has been thwarted, it has frequently proved successful. The Bidy-agong
                    zemindary, which was bound to furnish 400 elephants annually to the British
                    government, was taken possession of by the troops of the Deb Raja while the
                    attention of the British presidency was directed to other objects; and it was
                    finally determined afterwards, when the circumstance was brought under the
                    consideration of the British authorities in India, to relinquish all claim to
                    these lands, which were judged to be of trivial importance. In 1815 a native
                    agent was deputed to Lassa by the Bengal government to fix some questions
                    concerning the boundaries; but his progress was stopt at Bootan, where he
                    remained above a year; and on his return he gave in a report of his journey,
                    which, however, contained no satisfactory information on the state of the
                    country which he visited. In 1816 the advance of the Chinese forces towards
                    Nepaul occasioned great alarm to the temporal ruler of Bootan, between whom and
                    the spiritual ruler on the Dharma there existed a serious difference, which, it
                    was supposed, would terminate in the deposition of the former. In the event of a
                    civil war between the two claimants of the supreme power, one of them would
                    probably seek the friendship of the British, and the other of the Chinese, who
                    will probably succeed in establishing their authority in Bootan, as they have
                    already done in Thibet. <hi rend="smallcaps">(f.)</hi></p>
