                <p><label type="entry">BALTIC SEA</label>. The denomination of the Baltic, applied
                    to the inland sea which forms the subject of this article, is first found in the
                    work of Adam of Bremen, who was canon of that city at the close of the eleventh
                    century, entitled <hi rend="italic">Chorographia Scandinaviae.</hi> The
                    etymology of this name has given rise to many conjectures. The Swedes derive it
                    from the Scandinavian word <hi rend="italic">baelt,</hi> a girdle, because its
                    waters encircle the land; the Prussians, from the Sclavonian or Lettonian word
                    <hi rend="italic">halt,</hi> white, from its being frozen part of the year, or
                    from <hi rend="italic">Baltus,</hi> one of their kings; while by others it is
                    derived from <hi rend="italic">Baltea.,</hi> the name of an island mentioned by
                    Pytheas, a merchant of Marseilles, who, in the second or third century before
                    the Christian era, is supposed to have sailed as far north as this sea. In the
                    countries which bound it, its ancient name was <hi rend="italic">Variatzhoiè
                    More,</hi> or the Sea of Variaghi; by the modern Russians it is called <hi
                    rend="italic">Baltishoe More;</hi> and by the Swedes, Danes, and Germans, the
                    <hi rend="italic">East Sea.</hi></p>
                <p>I. The Baltic is entered from the British or Northern Ocean by the Skager-Rack,
                    Cattegat, Sound, andGreatand Little Belts. The Skager-Rack extends from the Naze
                    of Norway and the north-west point of Jutland, to the Gulf of Gottenburg and
                    north point of Jutland, or Scagen Point, better known to English seamen by the
                    name of the Scaw. The narrowest part of the Skager-Rack is 19 leagues. The
                    Cattegat extends from Gottenburg and the Scagen Point to the Sound and Belts.
                    The greatest depth of the Cattegat is 35 fathoms; but it decreases as it
                    approaches the Sound. The Sound is the channel between the coast of Sweden and
                    the island of Zealand. A mass of rocks on the Swedish shore distinguishes its
                    entrance from the Cattegat; its termination is between Falsterbo in Sweden and
                    Cape Stevens in Zealand. Its narrowest part is between Elsineur and Helsingborg,
                    where, measured on the ice, it is 2840 yards. Between Copenhagen and Landscrona
                    it is between six and seven leagues across. Its greatest depth, where narrowest,
                    is 19 fathoms. Towards the Danish shore, at the entrance of the Sound from the
                    Cattegat, its depth is 16 fathoms; but near Copenhagen it is not more than four
                    fathoms. Close to the Swedish shore there is a gradual accumulation of sand. The
                    Great Belt, between the islands of Zealand and Funen, is between seven and eight
                    leagues wide at its broadest place, between Corsoer in Zealand, and Nyborg in
                    Funen. The little island Sprogoe lies nearly in the middle of it. The coasts are
                    in general low and sandy; and the greatest depth is about 22 fathoms. The Little
                    Belt, between Funen and the coast of Jutland, is in its greatest breadth about
                    seven miles, and, where narrowest, about three quarters of a mile. In general
                    the shores are little elevated. Its greatest depth is 27 fathoms.</p>
                <p>The Baltic extends 240 leagues from Torneo to the Island of Wollin, on the coast
                    of Pomerania. Its northern extra <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> mity is situate
                    in the latitude of 65° 5P,and its southern extremity is in 53° 30'. It runs
                    first in an easterly direction as far asMemel, a length of 300 miles, with a
                    mean breadth <pb break="no" facs="nls:193193540" xml:id="kp-eb0704-3540-0325"
                    />of 140.&gt; It then sweeps northwards to the Aland Isles, a leu th of 350
                    miles, with a mean breadth of 70. Its northern portion forms the Gulf of
                    Bothnia, which is 150 leagues in length, with an extreme breadth of 162 miles.
                    The archipelago of Aland lies at its entrance from the Baltic and forms three
                    channels between the coast of Sweden and the islands composing the archipelago.
                    The breadth of the channel is between eight and nine leagues. This is called the
                    Sea of Aland by the Swedes. The space between Mand and the coast of Finland is
                    filled with numerous slands, among which are two channels. The lower part of the
                    gulf from Aland to L <hi rend="superscript"> τ</hi> meo is called by the Swedes
                    the Sea of Bothnia. Between Umeo and Wasa the channel is narrowed by a number of
                    rocky islands, forming a strait eight or nine leagues wide, from which the gulf
                    widens very considerably, and to its head is called by the Swedes the Gulf of
                    Bothnia. Its greatest ascertained depth is 50 fathoms. On the east the Baltic
                    forms the Gulf of Finland, which is 80 leagues long and from 11 to 22 broad. Its
                    entrance is between Spinthamer Point in Esthonia, and Hangoe Head in Finland.
                    Its greatest depth is 60 fathoms, which, in some places, decreases to five
                    fathoms. A vast number of rocky islands and reefs, many of them level with the
                    water, renders the navigation of this sea extremely dangerous.</p>
                <p>The general depth of the Baltic is 60 fathoms; but to, wards its south-east
                    extremity, and nearly in the middle, are two spots, with 110 and 115 fathoms of
                    water. From the east mouth of the Sound to Bornholm, the depth varies from 9 to
                    30 fathoms; from thence to Stockholm it is from 15 to 50; a little south of
                    Lindo it is 60; and among the Aland Islands it is from 60 to 110.</p>
                <p>It was long a generally received opinion that the wa. ters of the Baltic were
                    considerably more elevated than those of the German Ocean, and that they were
                    gradually diminishing. This seems to have rested entirely on the fact of a
                    constant current setting out of the Baltic; and to this it is ascribed by
                    Vice-Admiral Nordenancker, who was president of the Swedish Academy in 1792. In
                    a paper published in their <hi rend="italic">Transactions,</hi> he maintains
                    that, from observations made at different periods, the height of the waters of
                    the Baltic was diminishing at the rate of about four and a half lines annually.
                    Celsius, a learned Swede, who flourished towards the middle of last century,
                    advances the same hypothesis; and, from observations made on the coasts of the
                    Baltic, he estimated the diminution at 45 inches in every hundred years. This
                    hypothesis was supported by Linnaeus, who founded on it a theory of the earth;
                    but the chief facts brought forward in support of it, namely, marks on several
                    rocks in the Gulf of Bothnia, and the remains of vessels found at considerable
                    distances from the present shores, by no means warrant it. Μ. Otto, in his
                    physical observations on this sea, has suggested another theory to account for
                    its apparent decrease. He supposes that, instead of really subsiding, it may be
                    only shifting its position, and gaining in one quarter what it loses in another;
                    and this he ascribes to the large and rapid rivers, which carry along with them
                    an immense quantity of earth and sand, by which the beds at their mouths are
                    raised, and their banks extended towards the sea. But recent observations, made
                    at the locks of the canal of Holstein, prove that the levels of the Baltic and
                    the ocean are at present generally the same; and that the trifling differences
                    which may be occasionally observed are owing to accidental and temporary causes.
                    Hence we may infer that the constant current setting out of the Baltic is solely
                    owing to the abundance of the waters which it receives from its rivers.</p>
                <p>It is generally believed that there are no tides in the Baltic. This, however, is
                    not strictly correct. There are sensible tides in the Skager-Racκ; but these
                    begin to diminish in the Cattegat, are very trifling in the Sound and Belts, and
                    in the Baltic, properly so called, are scarcely, if at all, perceptible. There
                    are, however, irregular variations in the level of the waters of the Baltic,
                    which bear some resemblance to tides. These elevations generally occur in
                    autumn, when the weather threatens rain; and they last sometimes a few days,
                    sometimes several weeks. The maximum rise is three feet and a half, and the low
                    shores are occasionally inundated. They also render the freshwater lakes which
                    communicate with the sea brackish. In the Gulf of Bothnia, the fall of the
                    waters is usually succeeded by north winds; whereas, near Stockholm, these winds
                    usually follow the elevation. M. Kraft, formerly professor of experimental
                    philosophy in the lmpe ial Academy of Sciences at Petersburg, in his treatise on
                    the inundations of the Neva at the autumnal equinox, observes, that three or
                    four days before or after the full or new moon, a violent north-west wind drives
                    the waters of the Northern Ocean, during the influx of the tide, into the
                    Baltic, and is accompanied or immediately succeeded by a south wind in that sea
                    and the Gulf of Finland. By Schultens, a learned Swede, who paid particular
                    attention to the physical geography of the Baltic, the irregular elevations of
                    this sea are attributed to the state of the atmosphere. He had observed that
                    when the waters were about to rise the barometer fell, and that when they were
                    about to fall it rose. Hence he inferred that the unequal pressure of the
                    atmosphere on different portions of the water deranged the level of the waters.
                    The difference between the greatest and the least rise of the barometer in the
                    northern parts of Europe is two and a half inches, which answers to three and a
                    half feet of water, or the difference of the elevation of the waters at their
                    extremes.</p>
                <p>In the Sound there are superior and inferior currents. These were first observed
                    by some Englishmen, who, be-&lt; ing in a boat in the middle of the channel,
                    found that they drifted towards the Cattegat; but having let down∙ a loaded
                    bucket to the depth of four or five fathoms, the boat became stationary; and
                    when the bucket was sunk deeper, the boat drifted against the superficial
                    current. The general currents of the Baltic are strong, and evidently occasioned
                    by the vast number of rivers and streams that pour their waters into it, many of
                    which, especially towards the north, rise thrice in the course of the year. At
                    the northern extremity of the island of Bornholm, a violent agitation of the
                    waters, or kind of whirlpool, called by the Swedes <hi rend="italic"
                    >malt-quern,</hi> or the grinding-mill, is occasioned by the current rushing
                    over a circular cluster of sunken rocks. The waves of the Baltic are short and
                    broken, in consequence of sudden changes of wind, irregular depths, and strong
                    currents.</p>
                <p>The waters of this sea are not nearly so salt as those of the ocean; and when the
                    wind blows strong from the north, they become so fresh as to be fit for drinking
                    or cooking meat. The degree of their saltness varies in different parts, and
                    even in the same parts, according to the season or wind. According to Bergman,
                    in his <hi rend="italic">Physical Geography,</hi> the waters near the south
                    coast of Norway, at the entrance of the Skager-Rack, contain from -⅛th to J, th
                    part of their weight of salt; in the Cattegat ¶gth; in the Baltic ∙⅛∙th; and in
                    the Gulf of Bothnia from -⅛th to y <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> θth. The
                    south-west and west winds augment t ιe saltness, by introducing the waters of
                    the ocean. In the summer it requires 300 tons of the water of the Gulf of
                    Bothnia to produce one ton of salt, but in the winter only 50 tons. This
                    difference is caused by congelation, and by less fresh water flowing into t.</p>

                <p>There is great difference in the temperature in different parts of the Baltic.
                    The general temperature of the Gulf of Bothnia in July is from 48° to 56°, but
                    it is sometimes heated to 70°; the medium of the thermometer throughout the year
                    at Uleoborg is 29°, and at Stockholm 42J <hi rend="superscript"> 0</hi>. Near
                    the land in the Gulf of Bothnia, the temperature of the atmosphere in the month
                    of July was observed to be 68°, while the temperature of the surface of the
                    water was 65°; and in October the temperatures of both were respectively 39° and
                    46°. In the Sound, the temperature of the atmosphere in the month of August was
                    70°; on the surface of the water 68°; and at three fathoms 66°. On the 10th of
                    October 1813 Dr Thomson found the temperature of the Sound to be 54°. The
                    Skager-Rack and Gulf of Norway are open to navigation all the winter, whereas
                    several portions of the Baltic are covered with ice in a very moderate degree of
                    cold; and generally the bays and channels are encumbered with ice at the latter
                    end of December. The waters towards the heads of the Gulfs of Bothnia and
                    Finland are first frozen; and the ice being conveyed by the currents to the
                    south, the masses of it are, by the increasing cold, united into vast fields,
                    which become stationary on the west towards Stockholm, and in the east towards
                    the islands of Dagoe and Oesel. In the southern parts of the sea the ice begins
                    to break up in April, but the Gulfs of Bothnia and Finland often continue closed
                    till May. The rigour of the climate in the Baltic is supposed to be considerably
                    diminished by the clearing of the forests and the progress of cultivation; at
                    least more intense and long-continued colds, as well as greater extent and
                    solidity of ice, are recorded during th <hi rend="subscript"> e</hi> fourteenth
                    and fifteenth centuries, than what have happened latterly.</p>
                <p>The winds are extremely variable in the Baltic, but they blow most commonly from
                    the east in the spring, and from the west in autumn; calms are seldom
                    experienced, except in the middle of summer.</p>
                <p>II. There is historical evidence that the herring fishery was a branch of
                    national industry in the Sound as early as the year 1168;<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>‘ “In the year 1238 the inhabitants of Gothia
                    (Sweden) and Frise were prevented, by their fear of the Tartars, from sending,
                    as usual, tlicir ships to the herring fishing on the coast of England; and as
                    there was no exportation, 40 or 50 of these fish were sold for a shilling.
                    (Matthew Pans, p. 396.) It is whimsical enough that the orders of Mogul Khan,
                    who reigned on the borders of China, should have lowered the price of herrings
                    in the English market.” (Gibbon’s <hi rend="italic">Roman Empire,</hi> vol. xi.
                    p. 422.)</p></note> and in 1389 Philip de Mezieres says that such vast shoals of
                    herrings crowded into the Sound, that 40,000 boats, with from six to ten men
                    each, were employed in the fishery, besides 900 large vessels, in which the
                    herrings were salted. In the Gulfs of Flensborg and Slie, besides what are
                    consumed fresh, about 1000 tons salted are annually exported to Copenhagen and
                    Germany; and, according to the registers of the custom-house at Dalborg, on the
                    south shore of the Gulf of Limfiord, this city exported yearly, from 1720 to
                    1730, above 23,000 tons, but from 1754 to 1765 the exportation had fallen to
                    about 8000 tons. In the year 1748 the herring first appeared in shoals in the
                    Gulf of Gottenburg; at first they arrived in August and September, but gradually
                    later, and at present not till November or December. In 1752, there were 1000
                    tons taken; in 1753, 2000 tons; in 1761, 100,000 tons: from 1790 to 1796, nearly
                    2,000,000 tons were salted, and it was estimated that from 50,000 to 100,000
                    tons were consumed fresh.</p>
                <p>Pilchards abound in the Gulfs of Bothnia and Finland, into the bays of which they
                    arrive in shoals in spring and autumn. The pilehard fishery is one of the most
                    important branches of industry to the inhabitants on both sides of the Gulf of
                    Bothnia. As soon as the ice breaks up, upwards of 200 families, with their
                    children and servants, transport themselves to the rocks and islets that line
                    the coast, where they remain fishing till the and of autumn. The annual produce
                    of all the pilchard fisheries is estimated at 300,000 tons at least, which are
                    entirely consumed in the Baltic.</p>
                <p>Salmon ascend the rivers from April to June, according as they are free from ice.
                    On the south they abound most in the Oder, Vistula, Diina, and Narrowa; on the
                    north, in the Motala, Dalecarlia, Uleo, Kemi, Torneo, and Keymen. Salmon trout
                    is taken in some bays of the Baltic. In the middle of the river Kemi is a small
                    island, where an annual salmon fair is held. The salmon fisheries of Sweden are
                    very considerable, both in the Cattegat and the Gulf of Bothnia: from 20,000 to
                    25,000 tons are salted annually.</p>
                <p>Whales very rarely enter the Baltic. The common porpoise is the only one of the
                    lesser species of cetaceous animals that lives habitually in this sea; and at
                    Middlefart, in Funen, is a company, which enjoys the exclusive privilege of
                    taking it. There are two varieties of the common seal, both of which are hunted
                    for their oil in March and April, by the peasants of the isle of Gottland, and
                    of the islands in the Gulfs of Bothnia and Finland.</p>
                <p>III. The coast of the Baltic, including under that appellation the Skager-Rack,
                    the Cattegat, the Sound, and the <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> Belts, as well
                    as Baltic Proper, may be regarded as commencing on the north side at the Naze of
                    Norway. This is the extremity of a rocky peninsula joined to the main by a
                    narrow isthmus; it is surrounded by rocks, of which those named the Bishop and
                    Clerks, five miles to the south of the Naze, are most dangerous to
                    navigators.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:193193566" xml:id="kp-eb0704-3566-0327"/>
                <p>From the Naze to the east, the shore is formed of elevated barren and dreary
                    rocks. The pincipal rivers of Norway which fall into the Skager-Rack and
                    Cattegat are die Glommen, the Laugen, the Louen, the Drammen, the Mandal, and
                    the Nid. At the distance of five miles from die Naze is the town of Mandal,
                    situated on the river of that name: from this place is exported a considerable
                    quantity of smoked and salted salmon, esteemed the best in Norway. About 15
                    miles to the east of this is Christiansand, which has a good roadstead, besides
                    the advantage of the little river Torvedal, to the east of the town; it exports
                    timber, salt, fish, and iron. Next comes Aren-αal, the most secure and capacious
                    harbour in Norway, formed by the Sound between the Island of Fleekeroe and die
                    Main. On the river Louen is the town of Laurwig, which exports a great deal of
                    iron from the founderies in its neighbourhood. The Gulf of Christiana lies some
                    leagues to the east of it. This gulf runs up into the land 20 leagues, and
                    divides into several branches: the entrance to it is indicated by the island of
                    Faerdar, on which there is a light. The town of Christiana stands at the top of
                    the gulf: its port admits the largest vessels, there being from 30 to 40 feet
                    water close to the quay; and its exports, which consist of fir planks and
                    rafters, pitch, tar, soap, iron, copper, and alum, generally amount to L.
                    100,000 annually, the timber constituting four fifths. There are several little
                    villages on the gulf, where vessels load with timber. To the east of it is a
                    deep inlet, called Swine-sund, which separates Norway and Sweden; it consists of
                    two basins, the outer of which communicates with the inner by a very narrow
                    strait. On the inner basin, and at the mouth of a small river, is Frederieshall,
                    the commerce of which consists principally in the export of planks, sawed by
                    thirty-six mills on the river.</p>
                <p>The Swedish shores of the Skager-Rack and Cattegat are high, with a most rugged
                    and dreary appearance, particularly near Marstrand, where the shore is lined
                    with steep rocks projecting into the sea. The coast of Sehonen forms a striking
                    contrast to the shores of the Skager-Rack and Cattegat, being nearly level and
                    free from rocks. The Swedish coast from theshingar to the Gulf of Bothnia is
                    lined with islands and rocks, and broken into a great number of gulfs and bays.
                    Both shores of the Gulf of Bothnia are rugged and broken; that of Sweden, in
                    particular, forms a sort of alpine ridge. The first river in Sweden, towards its
                    western limit, is the Gotha, which flows into the Cattegat by two branches
                    surrounding the island of Hysingen. This river, and the Motala, which falls into
                    the Bay of Browick at Nordkoeping, are the only rivers of consequence in the
                    southern provinces of Sweden. Between the provinces of Soedermanland and Upland
                    is the lake Maelar, which communicates with the Baltic at Stockholm by two
                    currents called the north and south; its elevation is six feet above the level
                    of the Baltic. The river Dahl, or great river of Daleearlia, the Umeo, Torneo,
                    and several others, which rise in the mountains of Lapland and Norway, fall into
                    the Gulf of Bothnia: the northernmost are subject to three inundations annually;
                    the first in March or April, when the snow on the low ground melts; the second
                    towards the end of May, when the snow melts on the more elevated grounds; and
                    the last towards the end of summer, when the thaw has reached the high lands and
                    dissolved the glaciers. The first commercial, port of Sweden of any note is
                    Uddevalla, a staple town; its exports are iron, planks, and herrings. The town
                    of Marstrand, on an island of the same name, succeeds: it is also a staple
                    place, and its inhabitants are engaged in the herring-fishery, and in supplying
                    provisions to the vessels which run in for shelter, and which exceed 3Ü0
                    annually. The Paternosters are dangerous rocks some miles north of Marstrand. On
                    the southern branch of the Gotha, some leagues from the sea, is the city of
                    Gottenburg; the port is seldom closed by the ice, and is capable of receiving
                    the largest ships; the harbour is about one fourth of a mile in breadth, and is
                    formed by two chains of rocks.</p>
                <p>Before the entrance of the Gotha is the island of Win-goe, with a very high
                    light-house. The south point of the Bay of Skelder is formed of a mass of rocks
                    lying at the entrance of the Sound, named Kullen; this mass projects far into
                    the sea, and on the highest point, 200 feet above the sea, is a fire-tower. On
                    the Swedish shore of the Sound are several villages of little consequence.
                    Helsingborg, which is the usual place from which people cross to Elsineur, is
                    the only one deserving of notice. Four leagues to the southward is Landserona, a
                    small and ill-sheltered port, with 20 feet water; it is a staple town. The next
                    port is Malmoe, which has a considerable trade, although its harbour is not
                    capable of receiving vessels of any great burden. To the south are Skanor and
                    Falsterbo, on the peninsular point which forms the entrance of the Sound from
                    the Baltie. dose to the latter is a firetower, to direct vessels clear of a
                    large reef which runs off from the point. The first Swedish ports on the Baltie
                    of any consequence are Christianstadt and Carlshamn. The former is situated on
                    the Helge, which falls into a gulf that separates the provinces of Sehonen and
                    Bleekin-gen; the latter has 40 trading vessels engaged in foreign voyages. The
                    pincipal export of Carlshamn is potash, which is esteemed of superior quality.
                    They are both staple towns. The principal part of the town of Carlserona is
                    built on the island of Trosoe, the rest of it on several rocky islets joined to
                    the main by bridges. It is a staple town, and has about 40 vessels employed in
                    foreign trade: the port is capable of admitting 100 sail of the line: on one of
                    the islands is a dock for four sail of the line. Carlscrona is the pincipal
                    station of the Swedish navy. The Strait of Calmar, which is from two to three
                    leagues broad, separates the mainland from the island of Oeland. Near the middle
                    of the strait stands the town of Calmar, which, though not a staple place, has a
                    considerable trade, and vessels from 100 to 300 tons, belonging to it. North of
                    Calmar are several small towns on the coast, one of which, Westerwie, has some
                    ship-building. In East Gothland, the province which lies to the north of Smaland
                    on the Baltie, are two considerable gulfs, Sloetbacken and Browick. On the river
                    Motala, which falls into the latter, stands the staple town of Nordkoeping, from
                    which are exported considerable quantities of iron, iron cannon, and copper,
                    though its port can only receive vessels of light burden. From 300 to 400 enter
                    it annually; and 30 or 40 trading vessels belong to it. North of the entrance of
                    a sound which communicates with Lake Maelar by a canal, is Landsort Island,
                    where there is a light, and whence ships take pilots for Stockholm.</p>
                <p>Stockholm is built on seven or eight islands and peninsulas, at the entrance of
                    Lake Maelar: the channel is 12 leagues in length, very winding, and terminates
                    in a basin capable of holding 1000 ships. The largest island, on which the city
                    stands, forms two channels, through which the waters of the lake rush out with
                    great impetuosity.</p>
                <p>The only ports of any consequence in the province of Upland, are Grislehamn,
                    opposite the islands of Aland, where travellers embark or take sledge for Abo;
                    and Oere-grund, on an island in the channel of Aland, from which the iron from
                    the founderies of Danemora is exported. Formerly it was sent chiefly to England,
                    where it was converted into steel. From Gefle, a staple town on both sides of a
                    river of the same name, are exported considerable quantities of iron, planks,
                    tar, and potash; its imports are <pb break="no" facs="nls:193193579"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0704-3579-0328"/>corn and salt. The smaller islands in the Baltic
                    belonging to Sweden have already been noticed. Besides these there are Huen,
                    Oeland, and Gottland. Huen lies in the Sound, four miles from Landscrona, three
                    from the nearest point of Sweden, and four from the nearest point of Zealand: it
                    is about six miles in circumference. CEland is separated from the coast of East
                    Gothland by the Strait of Calmar: the east coast of the island is bold and
                    clear, but the west is dangerous for mariners. Between Oeland and a group of
                    rocks is the southern channel into the Strait of Calmar. Nearly in the middle of
                    the strait is a rock, almost perpendicular, 240 feet high, surrounded by reefs.
                    Gottland, which is 18 leagues from the nearest point of Sweden, and about the
                    same distance from Courland, is 20 leagues in length, and seven at its greatest
                    breadth. Its shore in some places is nearly perpendicular, in other places it
                    ascends gradually. Wisby, the capital, is built on the west coast; at present
                    its port is capable of receiving only a few small vessels. Slitehamn, on the
                    east of the island, is one of the best ports in the Baltic, and is defended by
                    the fort of Carlsbelt.</p>
                <p>The coasts, rivers, gulfs, and principal commercial ports of the south and east
                    of the Baltic, are next to be described; and, beginning at the entrance from the
                    German Ocean, those of Denmark first present themselves. The north point of
                    Jutland, in the Scaw, is surrounded by a reef several leagues in extent, and on
                    its extremity is a light-house, 64 feet above the level of the sea. The north
                    and east coasts of this peninsula are generally low; the northern extremity is
                    composed of sands, which are often conveyed by whirlwinds to a great distance,
                    and do considerable damage. In order to fix them, a variety of plants,
                    particularly the <hi rend="italic">Elymus arenarius,</hi> sea lime-grass, are
                    sown. The east coasts of Sleswick and Holstein descend gently to the sea. On all
                    these coasts there are numerous gulfs and bays; the first towards the north is
                    the Limfiord, which nearly divides the peninsula of Jutland, being separated
                    from the German Ocean only by a sandy isthmus three or four miles broad; another
                    arm of it advances southward to the town of Wyborg, a length of about 80 or 90
                    miles; its entrance is two miles wide, but afterwards it becomes greatly wider;
                    sands that very sensibly increase, and masses of granite, obstruct its entrance.
                    In Jutland there are also the Gulfs of Manager and Randers, and several bays. In
                    Sleswick, on the Baltic side, are the Gulfs of Colding, Flensborg, Slie, which
                    resembles a great river, and Ekernefiord; in Holstein are the Gulfs of Kiel,
                    which separates this province from Sleswick, and of Lubec, and the Bay of
                    Colberg. The Guden is the chief river in Jutland, which falls into the Baltic,
                    at the Gulf of Randers, after a course of 40 miles.</p>
                <p>From the Scaw to the entrance of the Gulf of Limfiord there are only small towns,
                    chiefly inhabited by fishermen and pilots. On the north shore of the entrance of
                    Limfiord is the fort of Hals, where vessels of too great depth to ascend higher
                    discharge their cargoes; and on the south shore, four leagues and a half from
                    the sea, is Aalborg, the chief town of Jutland. It possesses considerable
                    commerce, its exports consisting of corn, cattle, and fish; and it has 60 or 70
                    trading vessels belonging to it. Frederica, which stands on a promontory at the
                    entrance of the Little Belt, has an inconvenient and badly-sheltered port: the
                    merchant-vessels passing through the Little Belt pay toll here. Colding, at the
                    head of the gulf of the same name, which separates Jutland and Sleswick, is a
                    commercial town, and has a port of two miles in circuit, and of depth sufficient
                    for the largest vessels. The trade of Sleswick, which stands at the head of the
                    Gulf of Slic, has much declined: the entrance to its port being filled up with
                    sand, a canal has been cut into it.</p>
                <p>Of the Danish islands, Zealand is the principal; it <hi rend="subscript"> s</hi>
                    length is 24 leagues, its breadth varies from 20 to 14; ⅛ <hi rend="subscript">
                    e</hi> Gulf of Isefiord, divided into two branches, penetrates the north side of
                    it, at the entrance to which there is only nine feet water, but it deepens
                    within to seven fathoms. The most remarkable river in Zealand is the Nesaa,
                    which nearly traverses it, and enters the Baltic. Elsineur, on the narrowest
                    part of the Sound, has only a roadstead: here the duties of the Sound are paid.
                    The origin of these duties may be traced to the middle ages, when they were
                    established by the sovereigns of Denmark for the support of light-houses and the
                    protection of the navigation of the Baltic from pirates. These duties vary from
                    450,000 to 600,000 rix-dollars annually. The mails and passageboats cross the
                    Sound from Elsineur to Helsingborg.</p>
                <p>Copenhagen is built partly on the mainland, and partly on the island of Amak,
                    which is separated from it by a narrow channel, crossed by two bridges. The port
                    between Amak and the main is one of the best in the Baltic, both by nature and
                    art. Within are basins capable of containing 500 sail, but the entrance admits
                    but one ship at a time. There are two royal dock-yards constructed on islands,
                    where every ship has her particular magazine: the dry-dock is constructed of
                    wood, and requires 20 hours to pump it dry, which is done by horses. Copenhagen
                    is a free port, and for a long time was the only one in Denmark which enjoyed
                    the privilege of importing the produce of Iceland, Greenland, India, China, and
                    America; and, even yet, the principal returns from these countries are made to
                    it.</p>
                <p>Macen island is separated from the south-east end of Zealand by Ulfsund, a narrow
                    strait. It is about five leagues long and from one to three broad. It exports
                    15,000 tons of corn. Samsoe, midway between Zealand and Jutland, is near five
                    leagues long, and is formed of two peninsulas, the largest of which is five
                    miles broad. The other islands belonging to the government of Zealand are of
                    little consequence. Saltholm, in the Sound, may however be particularized; it is
                    four miles long and two broad; almost covered by the sea in winter, but in
                    summer affords good pasturage, and from it are exported to the capital, marble,
                    freestone, and lime.</p>
                <p>Funen, the second of the Danish islands in extent, is 16 leagues long and 11
                    broad. The Gulf of Odenzee runs considerably into it on the north-east. At the
                    head of the gulf stands the town of Odenzee, the capital. From twenty to thirty
                    trading vessels belong to it. At Nyborg, on the Great Belt, a duty is paid by
                    all merchant-vessels passing through; it is also the usual crossing place to
                    Zealand, and has a good port, with about as many vessels belonging to it as
                    Odenzee. The island of Funen exports corn; and in the year 1799 there belonged
                    to it fifty-seven vessels above 20 tons, amounting to 2522 tons, with 109 men.
                    From Rudkoeping, the only town on Langland, an island between Funen and Zealand,
                    corn, salted meat, hides, honey, and wax are exported.</p>
                <p>Laaland, the third of the Danish islands in size, is 11 leagues long and from six
                    to eight broad. Considerable portions of its coast are so low as to be inundated
                    during the irregular elevations of the sea. The feathers of aquatic birds and
                    corn are its principal exports. From this island Falster is separated by
                    Guldborg Sound, and from Macen by Grensund. It is eight leagues long and from
                    one to four broad. It exports corn and fruit. In the year 1799 there were in the
                    bailiwick of Laaland and Falster fourteen vessels, of 460 tons and 40 men. In
                    the government of Jutland are the islands of Lessoe and Anholt, in the Cattegat;
                    the latter is surrounded by dangerous banks.</p>
                <p>Bornholm is an island about seven leagues and a half from the coast of Sweden,
                    and upwards of 17 from the <pb break="no" facs="nls:193193592"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0704-3592-0329"/>island of Rugen. It is eight leagues long and five
                    and a half broad. Its shores are composed of steep rocks, surrounded by
                    dangerous reefs. The principal imports are coffee, sugar, and tobacco; the
                    principal exports are salted cod, corn, poultry, clay for the porcelain
                    manufactory of Copenhagen, and freestone for its public buildings. The centre of
                    commerce is at Ronne, near the middle of the west side of the island. In 1800
                    this place employed 60 vessels and 130 boats, chiefly in the fisheries.</p>
                <p>The first shore on the south of the Baltic is that -of Holstein, the principal
                    port-town of which is Kiel, a place of considerable commerce. The territory of
                    Lubec succeeds. The city of Lubec is situated on the Trave, five leagues from
                    its mouth. Its commerce is chiefly transit, and on commission, drawing from
                    Russia, Sweden, and Denmark their raw commodities, and supplying them with
                    wines, silks, cloth, hardware, and colonial goods. It admits vessels of from 150
                    to 200 tons. In 1802 it had from 70 to 80 merchant-vessels, and the aame year
                    1368 entered and 1234 cleared out. Travemunde, at the mouth of the Trave, about
                    nine miles from Lubec, is the port where vessels destined to and from Lubec take
                    their station. The Trave, near Lubec, is joined by the Wakenitz, which, issuing
                    from the Lake of Ratzeburg, thus facilitates the water communication between
                    Lubec and the interior. ∙</p>
                <p>On passing the Trave, the duchy of Mecklenburg is entered. Wismar, a bay within
                    the isle of Poel, and Rostock, on the left bank of the Warnaw, three leagues
                    from its mouth, are the principal commercial places in Mecklenburg. The exports
                    from the latter are corn, hemp, flax, hops, wax, butter, honey, cattle, apples,
                    and feathers.</p>
                <p>The coast of Pomerania exhibits the effects of the constant action of the waters
                    of the Baltic. On the west, the peninsula of Dars and the island of Zingst form
                    the basin called <hi rend="italic">Des Dars,</hi> which has six feet depth. The
                    Strait of Gellen, farther east, separates the island of Rugen from the main.
                    This strait varies in breadth from fourteen miles to one and a quarter, and the
                    eastern entrance, called the Bodden, is navigable for the largest vessels; but
                    in the narrows there is only from three to four fathoms; and the sand
                    accumulates so fast here as to require a toll on all vessels passing through it,
                    to defray the expense of clearing it.</p>
                <p>The Gulf of Dantzic lies beyond the eastern limits of Pomerania, the western
                    extremity of which, called the Gulf of Putzic, is formed by a curved tongue of
                    land. On the coast of Prussia are the two remarkable basins called the
                    Fresch-Haff and Curish-Haff. The waters of both are fresh, being supplied from
                    the rivers of Poland; and each communicates with the Baltic by a single strait.
                    The Fresch-Haff, which, besides three branches of the Vistula, receives the
                    rivers Elbing, Passarge, and Pregel, is 16 or 17 leagues long and from one to
                    five broad, lhe communication of this basin with the Baltic has changed several
                    times, and the present passage, near Pillau, was formed by a great storm in
                    1500; its depth is from 13 to 16 feet. The tongue of land called the
                    Fresch-Nehrung, which separates it from the Baltic, commences near Dantzic, and
                    runs east about 19 leagues; its breadth varies from one to three leagues. The
                    Curish-Haff, or Sea of the Cures, a people of Courland, is 19 leagues long and
                    from one to three broad. Its depth is very irregular, and there are many sand
                    banks in it. Near the upper end there is little current, but in the other parts
                    the currents are very rapid. It communicates with the Baltic by a channel near
                    Memel, 3200 feet wide and from 11 to 13 feet deep. The spit of land which
                    separates it from the Baltic, called the Curish-Nehrung, is about 80 miles long,
                    in some places three miles broad, but in other places it is so very narrow that
                    the waves of the Baltic wash over it into the basin. Its surface, which is
                    principally sand, continually changes by the fury of the winds. From its ancient
                    name, Mendoniemi, or Promontory of Pines, it was probably covered with those
                    trees. It is inhabited only by fishermen and pilots, whose dwellings are not
                    unfrequently overwhelmed by the sand. It is frequented by immense numbers of
                    crows and hawks; the former of which supply food to the inhabitants, and the
                    tithe of them forms part of the revenue of the pastor.</p>
                <p>The whole coast of Prussia and Courland is low, sandy, and covered with pebbles;
                    the latter, however, has calcareous cliffs, which seem to run under water to the
                    island of Gottland. The Gulf of Livonia or Riga has Domes-ness for its southern
                    limit, between which and the Swa-verort is the entrance, eight leagues wide; but
                    from Domes-ness a sand bank runs off, and a reef from Swa-verort. The coast of
                    Livonia, and the islands off it, are in general higher than those of Courland,
                    and are composed of sand, gravel, and calcareous strata. Entering the Gulf of
                    Finland, on the south side is the bay of Rog-gerswic, inclosed by islands. The
                    whole of the coast of Finland is naked, stony, lined with rocks and islets, and
                    nearly bare of vegetation.</p>
                <p>The principal rivers of Prussia that flow into the Baltic are the Oder and the
                    Vistula. The Oder, after dividing into four principal branches near the
                    frontiers of Pomerania, again flows into one stream near Stettin, and falls into
                    the Gros-Haff. Between the Oder and the Vistula several lesser rivers discharge
                    themselves, and being generally navigable, form ports at their mouths. Three of
                    the branches of the Vistula fall into the Fresch-Haff; and the fourth, which
                    alone retains its original name, enters the Gulf of Dantzic at Weixelmunde. The
                    Pregel, which is deeper than the Fresch-Haff, into which it falls, is navigated
                    by vessels of considerable burden. The Elbing issues from Lake Dramsen, and, as
                    has been already noticed, falls into the Fresch-Haff. The Niemen, below Tilsit,
                    separates into two branches, one running to the south-west and the other to the
                    north-west; thus both subdivide, and fall into the Curish-Haff near Memel. The
                    Dange, which gives a port to Memel, has a short course, but is wide and
                    deep.</p>
                <p>Stralsund is the first commercial port on the Pomeranian shore of the Baltic. Its
                    harbour is inclosed by jetties, but the access is dangerous and difficult, on
                    account of sand banks. It has a considerable export trade in brandy, starch, and
                    linens. Stettin, on the Oder, succeeds. Vessels of moderate burden go up to it,
                    but large ones discharge at Swinemunde, on the channel into the Gros-Haff, which
                    separates the islands of Usedom and Wollin. Between the years 1787 and 1796 the
                    annual exports were 3714 tons. The imports consist of manufactured goods from
                    England; salt, wines, and fruits from France, &amp;c.; and linseed from Russia.
                    About 160 vessels, manned by 1000 seamen, belong to it. From Politz, near the
                    mouth of the Oder, are exported several thousand bushels of hops, chiefly to
                    Sweden.</p>
                <p>The principal islands off the coast of Pomerania are Rugen, Usedom, Ruden, and
                    Wollin. Rugen is separated from the mainland by the Strait of Gellen. It is of a
                    very irregular shape, and consists of the island proper and three peninsulas. It
                    is supposed to contain 142,000 acres. Two of the peninsulas terminate in
                    promontories, composed of chalky cliffs, one of which is 430 feet high. There is
                    no port on the island; but from the roads are exported herrings, cattle, corn,
                    and salted geese. The coasts are very dangerous, scarcely a year passing in
                    which some vessels are not stranded; and several ancient regulations are still
                    in force respecting the assistance which <pb break="no" facs="nls:193193605"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0704-3605-0330"/>the inhabitants are bound to give in case of
                    shipwrecks. The islands of Usedom, Ruden, and Wollin, are formed by the alluvion
                    of the Peene and the Oder; they are very low, and in general sandy.</p>
                <p>Dantzic is the principal commercial place in Prussian Poland. It is situated on
                    the western branch of the Vistula, five miles from its mouth, and at the
                    confluence of the rivulets Motlau and Radaune. These form its port, to which
                    there is an entrance by a canal giving a new channel to the Vistula, the old one
                    being choked up. Dantzic has long justly been considered one of the granaries of
                    Europe. Its annual exports of corn average about 700,000 tons. Its other exports
                    are timber, beer, brandy, horse-hair, hogs’ bristles, feathers, wool, amber,
                    honey, wax, linens, masts of ships, eork-wood, hemp and flax, potash, salt, tar,
                    skins, fruits, &amp;c. Its imports are English manufactures and London porter,
                    herrings, fruits, lead, coffee, tea, sugar, indigo, wines, &amp;c.</p>
                <p>Pillau, whence there is a considerable export of timber, stands on a peninsula
                    washed by the Fresch-Haff on one side, and by the Baltic on the other. From
                    Königsberg, on an island at the mouth of the Pregel, are exported nearly the
                    same articles as from Dantzic, in between 600 and 700 vessels annually. From
                    Elbing, at the. mouth of the river of the same name, corn, starch, linseed oil,
                    soap, cordage, sail cloth, saltpetre, potash, and timber, are exported in
                    between 300 and 400 vessels annually. The port of Memel, formerly the mouth of
                    the river Dange, is liable to be encumbered with mud; its chief exports are ship
                    timber, masts, linseed of a superior quality, hemp, flax, hides, and tallow.</p>
                <p>The first Russian river of consequence that falls into the Baltic is the Western
                    Dwina. It is navigable from its source to within a few miles of Riga, where
                    ridges of rocks form fourteen falls. These, however, do not prevent the floating
                    down of immense quantities of timber. It is frozen from the end of November to
                    the beginning of April. It separates Courland from Livonia, and, after a course
                    of 180 leagues, falls into the Gulf of Livonia before Riga. The Narrowa, which
                    is the only oμtlet of Lakes Peipus and Plaskoff, falls into the Gulf of Finland
                    at Narva, but its navigation is obstructed half a league above that town by a
                    fall. The Neva, which issues from Lake Ladoga, disembogues itself by several
                    branches at Petersburg, above which it is from 150 to 200 fathoms broad. It is
                    shallow, and is frozen from the end of October to the end of April. The
                    principal rivers in Finland are the Wuoxen, which falls into Lake Ladoga; the
                    Kymene, which discharges itself into the Gulf of Finland; and the Kumo, Uleo,
                    Kemi, and Torneo, which fall into the Gulf of Bothnia, at the towns of their
                    respective names. In Courland, Russia has only two ports of any commercial
                    consequence, Liebau and Windau. From the former, on a river of the same name,
                    111 vessels cleared out, and 113 entered it, in the year 1800; and the value of
                    its exports amounted to 1,065,700 rubles, and of its imports to 620,000. Riga
                    and Pernau are the principal ports in Livonia. Riga is one of the most
                    commercial cities of the Baltic, and the second of Russia in this respect. Its
                    port can only receive small vessels, large ones being obliged to lie in the
                    roads. The exports consist of corn, hemp, flax, ship timber, pitch, potash,
                    hides, tallow, iron, &amp;c. The imports are woollen and cotton goods, hardware,
                    wines, oils, spirits, and colonial produce.</p>
                <p>Though the entrance to Revel is through dangerous shoals, and the town stands on
                    a river which affords little or no intercourse with the interior, yet its
                    commerce is considerable. Its exports and imports are nearly the same as
                    Riga.</p>
                <p>Petersburg is built on both sides of the Neva, and on several islands. The mouth
                    of the river being choked by sand, there are only from Seven to eleven feet of
                    water over it, according as the wind blows from the east or west. With easterly
                    winds the river often falls three or four feet below its general level, whereas
                    westerly winds sometimes raise it from ten to fifteen feet. Loaded ships of any
                    considerable burden cannot, therefore, approach within four miles of the city.
                    The principal exports are iron, hemp, flax, cordage, tallow, hides, linseed oil,
                    hemp and flax seed, planks and rafters, leather, soap, candles, wax and honey,
                    fish, caviar, tobacco, rhubarb, tea, isinglass, feathers, linen, and furs. The
                    principal imports are English cotton manufactures, French wines, colours,
                    coffee, sugar, drugs, &amp;c.</p>
                <p>Cronstadt, the principal station of the Russian fleet, is built on a little
                    island on the Gulf of Petersburg, four leagues below the city, the same distance
                    from Ingria, and nine leagues from Finland. The channel to the capital lies
                    between this place and the coast of Ingria. Its navigable breadth is three
                    quarters of a mile, its depth four fathoms. The channel between Cronstadt and
                    the coast of Finland has only five feet of water. Cronstadt has three havens,
                    two for ships of war and one for merchant vessels. The dry docks, which
                    communicate with the sea by a canal, require nine days to empty them. The
                    principal man of war’s port has space for thirty sail of the line.</p>
                <p>The first commercial port in Finland is Wyborg, built on a peninsula in a gulf of
                    the same name. It exports corn, butter, tallow, fish, fish oil, salted
                    provisions, timber, tar, and hops. Helsingfors, the best port in Finland for
                    large ships, is on a bay; and opposite to it is Sveaborg, the Gibraltar of the
                    north. It occupies seven islands, and has two basins for repairing ships of the
                    line and smaller vessels. At the entrance of the Gulf of Bothnia, on a
                    peninsula, stands Abo. Vessels drawing nine or ten feet go up to the town. While
                    it belonged to Sweden it was a staple town, with some trade to the
                    Mediterranean, France, and Holland, whither it exported iron, nails, copper,
                    deals, rafters, pitch and tar, salted provisions, hides, furs, coarse linens,
                    and firewood, to Stockholm and Copenhagen. From Abo there is no commercial place
                    of consequence till we come to Gamla Carlby, which, in 1794, had fourteen ships
                    of 1530 tons, thirteen of which were employed in foreign trade. Its exports that
                    year were 1800 barrels of tar, 1500 of pitch, between 3000 and 4000 deals, 2000
                    lbs. of butter, 273 cwt. of tallow, and 900 barrels of corn. Brahested, a staple
                    town while Finland belonged to Sweden, possesses commerce nearly of the same
                    kind and to the same amount as Gamla Carlby. It lies in a bay between two
                    peninsulas. Uleoborg, the chief town of East Bothnia, on the Uleo, exports
                    annually a considerable quantity of pitch and tar, butter, tallow, salmon, pike,
                    herrings, and deals. On the islands at the mouth of the river are two building
                    places, from which five or six ships are launched annually. Torneo is situate on
                    a peninsula, and had formerly a good harbour, but the accumulation of sand has
                    almost ruined it. The exports, besides the general articles from the other ports
                    of Finland, are salted and smoked rein-deer flesh, and the furs of the
                    rein-deer, fox, wolf, and ermine, procured from the Laplanders, who visit the
                    town once a year.</p>
                <p>The Russian islands at the northern extremity of the Gulf of Livonia, Oesel and
                    Dagoe, and the numerous islands and rocks in the Gulf of Finland, require no
                    particular notice. The archipelago of Aland, which was ceded to Russia along
                    with Swedish Finland in 1809, is composed of one considerable and above eighty
                    lesser islands and rocks. They are in general elevated, rising on rocky peaks,
                    with numerous caverns. The principal island is nearly round, and twenty leagues
                    in circumference. There is no town <pb break="no" facs="nls:193193618"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0704-3618-0331"/>on any of them. Besides fire-wood, 12,000 loads of
                    which are sent annually to Finland and Sweden, the inhabitants export salted
                    beef, seal skins and oil, tallow, hides, pilchards, and butter, chiefly to
                    Stockholm.</p>
                <p>IV. The commerce of the Baltic is considerably facilitated and increased by means
                    of different canals, which form a communication with different parts of it, with
                    it and other seas, and with the interior of the countries, the shores of which
                    it washes.</p>
                <p>The ancient Scandinavian chronicles mention a natural water communication between
                    the Baltic and the German Ocean through the Danish peninsula, by means of the
                    Gulf of Kiel, the river Lewensau, the lake Flemhud, and the river Eyder. When
                    the communication ceased to be practicable, an attempt to renew it was made in
                    the middle of the seventeenth century by the duke of Holstein Gottorp. It did
                    not however succeed, in consequence of the opposition of the king of Denmark.
                    The union of Holstein and Denmark taking place in 1773, the proposed canal was
                    begun in 1777, and finished in 1784. It enters from die Baltic by the Gulf of
                    Kiel, near the mouth of the Lewensau, the waters of which serve to supply it;
                    then joins the northern extremity of Lake Flemhud, unites with the Upper Eyder,
                    passes by Rendsburg, and falls into the German Ocean at Tonningen. The
                    perpendicular fall towards the Baltic is twenty-five feet six inches, and that
                    towards the ocean twenty-three. To Lake Flemhud, which is the highest point,
                    vessels are drawn by horses, and elevated by three locks of nearly ten feet fall
                    each; three other locks lower them to the Eyder; and from Rendsburg to Tonningen
                    vessels use their sails. The whole length of the navigation from sea to sea is
                    about 105 miles, of which the canal forms 20|: its breadth is 100 feet at top,
                    54 at bottom, and the least depth 10 feet, so that it can admit vessels of about
                    140 tons burden. Upwards of 2000 pass it annually. The Baltic and the German
                    Ocean are also united by means of the canal of Stecknitz. This canal unites the
                    rivulet of that name which falls into the Trave with the Devenau, a rivulet that
                    runs into the Elbe at Lauenburg. This navigation is fit only for flat-bottomed
                    ⅛oats, and is very tedious.</p>
                <p>The Baltic has communication with the interior of Germany by the canals of
                    Muhlrose and Finow. The first unites the Oder above Frankfort with the Spree,
                    one of the tributary streams of the Elbe. The canal of Finow joins the river of
                    this name, which falls into the Oder, with the Havel, another branch of the
                    Elbe. By means of these and some lesser canals a long navigation through
                    Silesia, Brandenburg, Lower Saxony, and Pomerania, is maintained. There is also
                    an artificial navigation which unites the Vistula and the Oder: this is the
                    canal of Bromberg, which joins the Brahe, <hi rend="italic">a</hi> tributary of
                    the Vistula, with the Netze, which falls into the Warthe, and the latter into
                    the Oder. The Niemen, in conjunction with the Dnieper, affords a communication
                    between the Baltic and the Black Sea; the canal of Pinsk uniting the former
                    river near its head with the Priapetz, which falls into the Dnieper. These seas
                    are also united by means of the Dwina and Dnieper. The boats employed in this
                    navigation ascend the Dwina to the I lla, which they also ascend as far as the
                    Lake Bieloe, out of which it flows. By crossing this lake they reach the river
                    Essena, which they ascend to Lake Beresina. Here they enter a canal four leagues
                    in length, which conveys them into Lake Plawia. From this lake flows the river
                    Sargutsch, which joins the river Beresina, and this latter falls into the
                    Dnieper; but the cataracts in this river, about 250 miles above its estuary,
                    greatly impede the intercourse which might otherwise be established by these two
                    navigations between the Baltic and the Black Sea.</p>
                <p>The Baltic and Caspian Sea are united by the canals of Ladoga and Vyschnei
                    Volotschok. The canal of Ladoga, so called, not because it enters that lake, but
                    as winding along its margin, extends from the river Volchof to the Neva. In the
                    original navigation the boats passed from the canal of Ladoga up the Volchof to
                    Lake Ilmen, and from this lake entered the river Masta; but in consequence of
                    the fatal accidents that happened on the rapids of this river, one of which is
                    six or seven leagues long, a canal was cut directly upon the Volchof to the
                    Masta above the rapids. The old route is here only followed at a certain season,
                    and by boats of a peculiar construction. Ascending the Masta, the boats enter
                    the Lake Mstinskoja, and thence the river Shlina, from which, by means of a
                    canal with a lock, they enter the Sna, and by another lock the canal of Vyschnei
                    Volotschok. This is a league in length, and from it ∙a lock lowers the boats
                    into the Twerza, which they descend to the Wolga. In order to facilitate the
                    ascending navigation from Petersburg, which is rendered tedious by the rapidity
                    of the Volchof and the Masta, a canal has been cut, combining the Tichwin, which
                    falls into the Ladoga, and the Somina, which falls into the Molaga, a tributary
                    of the Wolga. In spring the vessels may draw two and a half feet water, but in
                    summer only twenty-six inches. In autumn the navigation from Vyschnei Volotschok
                    to Petersburg is performed in rather more than a month, in summer in three
                    weeks, and in spring in a fortnight.</p>
                <p>By these canals a navigation is established nearly the whole way from Petersburg
                    to the frontiers of China, there being an interruption only in two places, both
                    not more than sixty miles. The distance from Petersburg is between 1600 and 1700
                    leagues; but the rivers being navigable only in the fine season, it requires
                    three years to complete the passage. The extent of the commerce is about one and
                    a half million of rubles annually.</p>
                <p>The Baltic and the Caspian are also connected by the canal of Maria. The boats
                    ascend the Neva, cross the Lake Ladoga, and enter the Swir, which they ascend to
                    Lake Onega. From this lake they ascend the Wytegra, which is united by the canal
                    of Maria to the Kowska. By ascending this they arrive at Lake Bieloe, and
                    crossing it enter the river Tchesna, which they descend to the Wolga. A canal
                    has long been projected to form a communication between the Baltic and the White
                    Sea; but though it was begun more than fifty years ago, there is only a small
                    portion of it executed.</p>
                <p>Ever since the time of Gustavus Vasa, the Swedes have been anxious to form an
                    inland navigation between Stockholm and the Cattegat, principally in order to
                    avoid the payment of the duties of the Sound, and Danish privateers in case of
                    war. This navigation presented no very formidable difficulties. The Gotha flows
                    out of Lake Venar; this is at no great distance from Lake Hielmar; and this
                    again is still nearer Lake Maelar, which communicates with the Baltic at
                    Stockholm. Hence it appears that the plan of forming an internal water
                    communication between Gottenburg and the capital may be divided into three
                    principal parts; the junction of the Hielmar and the Maelar, of the Hielmar and
                    the Venar, and the rendering the Gotha navigable from the Venar to Gottenburg.
                    The Hielmar is seventy-three feet higher than the Maelar, which is six feet
                    above the Baltic. These two lakes were united in the reigns of Christina,
                    Charles XI., and Charles XII., by the small river Ulvison and the canal of
                    Arboga. Nine locks are necessary to establish this communication. The obstacles
                    that opposed the navigation of the Gotha from Lake Venar were principally just
                    at its first issuing from that lake, at the four cataracts, twenty leagues above
                    Gottenburg, called by the general name of Trollhaeta; the fall of Akerström,
                    about a mile below these cataracts, and <pb break="no" facs="nls:193193631"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0704-3631-0332"/>a bed of rocks at Edit, considerably nearer
                    Gottenburg. The first impediment was removed in the reigns of Charles XL and
                    XII. by the Carlsgraf Canal. Attempts were made to remove the second by carrying
                    a canal along the channel of the river; but these not succeeding, it was
                    resolved to cut the canal through the solid rock which forms its banks. This
                    work was begun in 1793, and completed in seven years. The canal commences below
                    the first fall of Trollhaeta (for this fall, by the former plan, had been nearly
                    turned into still water), and is carried nearly a league before it again joins
                    the river; its breadth is twenty-two feet and its depth six and a half, and it
                    has eight locks and a large reservoir. A communication between Lake Maelar and
                    the Lake Sodra Barken, on the borders of Dalecarlia, is effected by means of the
                    canal of Strachms-holm, several small lakes, a river, and several locks, some of
                    which have a fall of thirty-eight feet. A communication between Lake Maelar and
                    the Baltic, considerably to the south of the exit of that lake, and much shorter
                    than by it, is afforded by means of a canal that joins Lake Maelar with the
                    Sound, at the head of which stands the town of Soeder Telje.</p>
