                    contain such an account of the discovery and construction of this most valuable
                    instrument, as can be drawn from the popular treatises of natural philosophy in
                    the English language. But, unfortunately, the compilers of elementary works have
                    seldom taken the trouble to remount to the original sources of information, and
                    have frequently, by substituting their own fancies, or servilely copying the
                    mistakes of others, contrived to disfigure egregiously the relation of facts,
                    and the history of the progress of invention. We purpose, therefore, as far as
                    our limits will admit, to discuss the subject with more careful research; but,
                    passing rather lightly over the description of the different kinds of barometers
                    and other practical details, to dwell more especially on the successive steps
                    which led to the fine discovery of atmospheric pressure and its application to
                    physical science.</p>
                <p>The opinions entertained by the ancients concerning physical subjects appear at
                    best only splendid visions. They speculated boldly in cosmological theories, but
                    were easily satisfied with those conclusions which merely soothe the fancy. Many
                    of the philosophical notions adopted in remote ages have, however, left a
                    durable impression in the structure of language, and still continue to exercise
                    a visible influence in moulding the current sentiments of mankind. The early
                    sages of Greece distinguished matter into the four primary elements, of <hi
                    rend="italic">earth, water, air,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">fire,</hi> which, by
                    their various combinations, were supposed to produce the animated spectacle of
                    the universe. With these elements were associated corresponding qualities, in a
                    binary conjunction; <hi rend="italic">hot</hi> and <hi rend="italic">cold,
                    dry</hi> and <hi rend="italic">moist. Earth</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >water</hi> were considered as ponderous and inert; but <hi rend="italic"
                    >air</hi> andere, endued with elastic virtue, were imagined to possess lightness
                    and activity. <hi rend="italic">Fire,</hi> though extracted from all bodies by
                    the operations of nature or of art, was yet conceived to be derived, by
                    invisible emanation, from that diffuse lambent fluid which, under the name of
                    <hi rend="italic">Aether,</hi> occupied the highest heavens, and furnished the
                    substance and nutriment of the celestial bodies. While the earthy matter would,
                    therefore, naturally settle towards the centre, and the aqueous fluids roll
                    along the surface of the solid globe, the air and fire soared aloft; the former
                    occupying the whole of the region below the moon, and the latter streaming
                    through the boundless extent of space. This <hi rend="italic">sublunary</hi>
                    scene is exposed to incessant change, calamity, and decay; but above it was
                    supposed to reign a perpetual calm, the seat of bliss, and of divine and
                    imperishable essence.</p>
                <p>Aristotle and some other philosophers, viewing <hi rend="italic">cether</hi> as
                    altogether distinct from <hi rend="italic">culinary fire,</hi> were disposed to
                    consider it as a <hi rend="italic">fifth</hi> element, of a pure, divine, and
                    incorruptible nature; an opinion which afterwards gave occasion to the famous
                    <hi rend="italic">Quinta Essentia,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Quintessence</hi>
                    of the schoolmen. The alchemists, who sprung up nearly about the same benighted
                    period, in adopting these notions, modified them to suit their own peculiar
                    views. To the elements commonly received, they joined the active auxiliaries of
                    <hi rend="italic">mercury</hi> and <hi rend="italic">sulphur.</hi> For <hi
                    rend="italic">quintessence</hi> they substituted <hi rend="italic">spirit</hi>
                    and <hi rend="italic">elixir;</hi> the former, drawn off by the application of
                    fire, being conceived to represent the animating principle of each body; while
                    the latter, extracted by the combined action of heat and moisture, was supposed
                    to exhibit its concentrated and most select qualities. .</p>
                <p>Some of the ancient cosmologists imagined a vacuum beyond the shining expanse of
                    aether, destined to receive the exhalations from this nether world. Others
                    denied] the existence of a separate void, but admitted small vacuities
                    interspersed through bodies. Aristotle, however,] maintained the necessity of a
                    plenum, asserting thatourt idea of space or extension is inseparable from that
                    of-body. To this principle he ascribed the suspension of water in a tube, when
                    the finger is applied to shut the upper end. Yet the very contempt in which that
                    philosopher, from a consciousness of his own superiority, was accustomed to hold
                    the received opinions, might have led him to take juster views. He rejected the
                    notion that air has levity inherent in its nature; nor would he admit the more
                    plausible idea, that a fluid so easily moved must possess the quality of perfect
                    indifference, and be neither light nor heavy. Aristotle not only maintained that
                    air is ponderous, but did not scruple to appeal to direct experiment in support
                    of this assertion. À bladder, he says, will be found to gain some weight, on
                    being blown or filled with air. But this was evidently a mere random assertion,
                    betraying his ignorance of the constitution of fluids. A bag filled with air,
                    and suspended in a like medium, it is obvious, from the laws of hydrostatics,
                    must weigh exactly the same as before. If it be alleged that, in blowing up the
                    bladder, a portion of air would be introduced immediately from the lungs, and
                    containing therefore a small admixture of carbonic acid gas, which is
                    specifically heavier than the common atmospheric fluid; the additional weight,
                    amounting scarcely perhaps to a grain, would be too minute to be detected by any
                    of the jewellers’ balances constructed in ancient Greece.</p>
                <p>The mutual opposition of the leading philosophical sects of antiquity had, in
                    general, most fatally discouraged the application of mathematical reasoning to
                    the system of the material world. The Academicians, or the disciples of Plato,
                    who cultivated geometry with ardour and brilliant success, were disposed to
                    regard that science as a pure intellectual contemplation; and resigning
                    themselves to the illusion of their lofty dreams, they turned with disdain from
                    the investigation of individual facts and all the vulgar realities of life. The
                    mind of Aristotle was of a more sober and practical cast; acute, profound, and
                    discriminating, it ranged with incredible industry over an immense field of
                    inquiry. That judicious philosopher recommended a careful and constant appeal to
                    external observation, as the only sure ground on which to erect the structure of
                    physics; but unfortunately his scholars neglected too much the study of
                    mathematics, the most powerful instrument for conducting physical research. The
                    precepts of Aristotle, though excellent in some respects, were hence in the
                    sequel unproductive of any genuine fruit. On the contrary, the weight of his
                    opinions, during a long course of ages, repressed the efforts of human
                    genius.</p>
                <p>It must be gratefully acknowledged, that the alchemists, styled also <hi
                    rend="italic">philosophers by fire,</hi> were the first among the moderns who
                    dared to explore new paths of science. Their projects were, indeed, highly
                    chimerical, but ⅛ey had the merit at least of setting the example of
                    investigating the properties of matter by actual experiment. They likewise
                    formed associations among individuals for the more effectual prosecution of such
                    researches. H <hi rend="superscript"> e</hi> ξ <hi rend="superscript"> c</hi> '

                    the cultivation of letters, wore a more attractive garb. Baptista Porta, a
                    Neapolitan nobleman, who flourished about the latter part of the sixteenth
                    century, was particularly distinguished by his zeal in promoting such pursuits.
                    Having <hi rend="superscript"> 5</hi> spent many years in travelling over Europe
                    to gain information respecting natural objects, he invited a few individuals of
                    a congenial taste to assemble at stated times in his house, and assist him in
                    making new experiments. These meetings, however, gave umbrage to the watchful
                    jealousy of the clergy, and they were soon suppressed by a mandate from the
                    court of Rome. But the example was imitated in other parts of Italy, where the
                    papal authority enjoyed less respect; and academies for the promotion of natural
                    science were successfully instituted under the patronage of different princes,
                    especially those of the illustrious house of Medici.</p>
                <p>In this ferment of inquiry, Galileo arose, a man fitted alike by the gifts of
                    nature and the lights of education to be the founder of experimental science.
                    His elegant genius was invigorated by the study of the Greek geometry; and he
                    conceived the happy and prolific idea of employing that refined instrument to
                    explore facts and combine the results. Archimedes, indeed, among the ancients,
                    had anticipated this road of discovery, having most successfully applied the
                    powers of geometrical analysis to the investigation of some parts of mechanics
                    and hydrostatics. But his was a solitary instance, unheeded by succeeding ages.
                    The ingenuity of Galileo prepared a complete revolution in science. By means of
                    a few simple but striking experiments performed on the lagoons of Venice, he
                    established the laws of motion, which he now transferred from the surface of our
                    globe, to direct the revolutions of the heavenly bodies. The publication of his
                    <hi rend="italic">Dialogues,</hi> which unfold the right process of induction,
                    and are not less distinguished by fineness of conception than beauty of diction,
                    forms a new era in the annals of philosophy. He was the first who attempted to
                    ascertain the weight of air by actual experiment; and considering the nicety of
                    the operation, and the rudeness of the instruments constructed at that period,
                    he made a very tolerable approach to the truth. It had been known for many ages
                    that air is capable of being highly condensed; and Ctesebius of Alexandria had
                    invented an engine, which, by the force of the sudden expansion of this
                    compressed fluid, hurled missile weapons. This was afterwards improved into the
                    wind or air-gun, which seems to have been not uncommon in Europe as early as the
                    fifteenth century, though soon afterwards generally superseded in practice by
                    the introduction of fire-arms. Galileo, being led by a different path from that
                    pursued at present, set himself to examine the weight which air acquires by
                    condensation. Having fitted a large copper ball with a valve, he injected air
                    into its cavity by means of a syringe, and then suspended it to a balance. The
                    additional increase of weight being thus found, he opened the valve under an
                    inverted glass receiver full of water, and measured, by the displacement of this
                    liquid, the surplus quantity of air which had been injected into the copper
                    vessel.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>From this
                    remarkable experiment it is easy to perceive that Galileo was really the
                    inventor of our pneumatic apparatus, though his title has been so long
                    overlooked by chemists.</p></note> He thence concluded that air is 400 times
                    lighter than water, being about the double of the true estimate; an error
                    probably arising from some imperfection of the valve that confined the air
                    within the ball.</p>
                <p>After he had, by such researches, acquired celebrity in the scientific world,
                    Galileo accepted an invitation, with à very handsome appointment, from Cosmo de’
                    Medici; and devoting himself intensely to astronomical observations, aided by
                    the telescope, which, from an obscure hint, he had recently constructed, yet
                    occasionally unbending his mind with elegant recreation, he spent almost the
                    whole of the evening of his life at the villa of Arectri, near Florence, in a
                    style of comfort and even splendour. But, while occupied with those delightful
                    pursuits, exploring the planetary phases, and discovering new worlds, he was for
                    a moment recalled to his early studies by an incident destined to form an epoch
                    in the history of physical science. Some artisans, in the service of the grand
                    duke, having been employed to construct a lifting or sucking pump for a very
                    deep well, found, with equal surprise and vexation, that, in spite of all the
                    pains they had taken in fitting the piston and valves, the water could by no
                    effort be made to rise higher in the barrel than eighteen palms, or thirty-two
                    feet. In this dilemma they applied to Galileo for an explication of the cause of
                    a failure then so unexpected and perplexing. But the philosopher was not yet
                    prepared to encounter such a discordant fact. The Aristotelian tenet of the
                    impossibility of the existence of a void, was, at this period, universally
                    received as an unquestionable truth. It had become a favourite axiom of the
                    schoolmen, deceiving themselves, as Leibnitz did afterwards in proposing his
                    principle of <hi rend="italic">sufficient reason,</hi> by the glimmer of a
                    metaphorical expression, the <hi rend="italic">fuga vacui,</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">natures horror of a void.</hi> To create a vacuum, they gravely
                    maintained, would require the hand of Omnipotence, transcending the utmost power
                    of men or even devils. But Galileo, though borne along by the current of
                    opinion, saw the necessity of at least modifying the general principle. Without
                    questioning nature’s abhorrence of a vacuum, he supposed the influence of this
                    horror to be confined within certain limits, not exceeding the pressure of a
                    column of water eighteen palms in height. This was evidently evading, rather
                    than meeting, the difficulty proposed for his solution. Yet, in the last of his
                    Dialogues, he actually mentions an experiment to ascertain this power, or <hi
                    rend="italic">virtu,</hi> as he calls it, of a vacuum. A piston with a valve,
                    exactly fitted into a smooth hollow cylinder, was rammed quite to the end, and
                    this carefully shut up; then placing the cylinder in an upright but inverted
                    position, successive weights were appended to the rod, till it was drawn from
                    the close end, and pulled down. It may seem strange that the Tuscan philosopher,
                    after advancing so far, should have stopt on the verge of a great discovery. He
                    had already weighed the air, and it was only another small step thence to infer
                    the effect of its incumbent mass. But the atmosphere was still believed to reach
                    to the moon, and the pressure of columns of such enormous altitude seemed to
                    mock all calculation, and overwhelm the imagination.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>This narrative, which marks so well the slow
                    and timid steps whereby men, even of the highest intellectual endowments,
                    usually advance in the search after truth, is drawn from the writings of Galileo
                    himself. The carelessness of some authors in mis-stating facts, and imputing
                    unworthy motives to those patriarchs of science who could not open their eyes
                    all at once to the bright effulgence of day, deserves severe reprehension. We
                    may remark, in passing, that Μ. Biot, who ranks among the first mathematicians
                    and philosophers in France, has not scrupled, in an elaborate compilation on
                    physics, to allege that Galileo merely joked with the artisans who asked him the
                    reason of the failure of their pump; that he had an idea of the true
                    explication, but chose to keep his secret, and siffer it to die with him. Such
                    conduct would certainly have been a reproach to Galileo’s acknowledged
                    candour.</p></note> Yet, on reconsidering the subject, Galileo began to suspect
                    the solidity of the explication which he had given; but it was now too late for
                    <pb break="no" facs="nls:193194333" xml:id="kp-eb0704-4333-0386"/> him, in his
                    advanced age, loaded with bodily infirmities, and dispirited by clerical
                    persecution, to attempt any further innovation in science. Recommending it
                    earnestly to his friend and pupil Torricelli to resume the investigation, this
                    illustrious precursor of Newton expired in 1642, the very year in which the
                    English philosopher was born. His uniform kindness and urbanity rendered him
                    extremely beloved; and his disciples, particularly Torricelli, Viviani, and
                    Ricci, venerating his memory, caught the same taste, and. followed similar
                    pursuits.</p>
                <p>Torricelli now conceived the happy idea of exhibiting the action of a pump on a
                    contracted scale, by means of a column of mercury, which is nearly fourteen
                    timesheavier than water. This experiment he first communicated to his friend
                    Viviani, who performed it with success in 1643; and he afterwards repeated and
                    varied it himself. The method which he adopted brought very neatly under one
                    view all the circumstances affecting the question. Having selected a tube about
                    a quarter of an inch wide, and four feet long, he sealed one of the ends
                    hermetically, or closed it under the flame of a lamp; he then filled the cavity
                    of the tube with mercury, and apjalying his finger to the open end, he inverted
                    it in a basin likewise containing mercury, though covered with a portion of
                    water. The mercury instantly sunk to nearly thirty inches above the lower
                    surface; but on raising the tube, till its orifice communicated with the layer
                    of water, the mercury ran all out, and the water now sprung up to the top, and
                    occupied the whole of the cavity. It was thus proved, that the water and mercury
                    are each supported by the same equipoise, which Torricelli, after some
                    hesitation, at last concluded to be the pressure of the external atmosphere. He
                    next converted the mercurial column into a form adapted for observation, by
                    bending the lower end of the tube, and constructing, what has since received the
                    name of the <hi rend="italic">syphon barometer.</hi> (See fig. 1. Plate CVI.)
                    Thus provided with a commodious instrument, he soon detected the variation of
                    atmospheric pressure, which depends on the change of weather. These important
                    results were published in the year 1645; but Torricelli did not live to enjoy
                    the fame of his great discovery, for this most promising genius was snatched
                    away by a putrid fever in the flower of his age.</p>
                <p>The report of Torricelli’s first experiments having been carried to France before
                    he had ventured to draw his capital conclusion, set philosophers to speculate on
                    the cause of such an unexpected fact. Descartes, with his usual rapidity and
                    boldness of conception, did not hesitate, in his correspondence with Mersenne,
                    to refer the suspension of the mercury in the tube at once to the pressure of
                    the external atmosphere. But this inference appears not very consistent with his
                    system, which assumed the existence of an absolute plenum, and only supplied the
                    place of a void by the diffusion of subtile abraded particles of matter. He
                    suspected, besides, the accuracy of Galileo’s estimate of the weight of the air,
                    which he thought could be scarcely appreciable by experiment.</p>
                <p>But, in the same country, the subject was now pursued with deliberate caution,
                    and through all its details, by another genius of the highest order; one of the
                    finest and most original that France has ever produced. Pascal had shown
                    premature and extraordinary talents, which were encouraged by his father, a man
                    of learning, who lived in habits of intimacy with the literati of Paris. The
                    young philosopher happened to be residing at Rouen, in∖1646, when he was
                    informed of the famous Italian experiment. Having access, fortunately, to a
                    glass-house, he resolved immediately to repeat the observations on a large
                    scale. He had already suspected the justness of the principle, that “nature
                    abhors a vacuum,” and thought that the condensation and rarefaction of the air
                    point to a different, or at least a modified conclusion. With a view to clear up
                    this subject, Pascal performed a number of satisfactory experiments, of which we
                    shall cite a few of the more striking, nearly in his own language, tinctured
                    evidently with the prevailing opinions of the age :—1. Having fitted a piston to
                    an open glass tube, and rammed it quite down, he applied his finger close to the
                    lower end, and plunged the whole under water; then drawing back the piston,
                    which was done with ease, the finger felt strongly and rather painfully <hi
                    rend="italic">attracted,</hi> while an <hi rend="italic">apparent vacuity</hi>
                    was formed above it, and continued to enlarge; but instantly on removing the
                    finger, the water, <hi rend="italic">contrary to its nature,</hi> darted up and
                    filled the whole of the cavity. 2. A glass tube, about fifty feet long, sealed
                    hermetically at one end, and filled with water, or rather red wine, as a more
                    visible fluid, was inverted perpendicularly in a basin of the same. The liquid
                    immediately subsided, leaving a vacant space of thirty-five feet; but on
                    gradually reclining the tube, the liquid rose again, and continued to mount,
                    till it struck a sharp blow against the top of the glass. 3. A syphon, having
                    one leg fifty-five feet high, and the other only fifty, being filled with water,
                    and planted in two basins containing the same, such that the shorter branch had
                    a perpendicular position, the water sunk in both to the same level, without
                    being <hi rend="italic">attracted,</hi> as usual in syphons, to the longer
                    branch: but, on leaning the syphon back, the columns rose till they united at
                    the top, and then the water began to flow towards the lower basin. The same
                    experiment was also performed with mercury, the syphon having one leg ten feet,
                    and the other only nine feet and a half in length, the mercury being found to
                    divide itself into two columns, which continued suspended at an altitude of
                    about thirty inches. 4. Having nicely fitted a piston to a long glass syringe,
                    and pushed it down to the end, he immersed this in a basin of mercury, and held
                    the tube in a vertical position; on gently drawing up the piston, the mercury
                    closely followed it to the height of twenty-nine inches, but then stopt, leaving
                    the piston to form above it an apparent vacuity. In this state, also, the
                    syringe weighed exactly the same, whatever was the magnitude of the vacant
                    space.</p>
                <p>From these and other similar experiments, Pascal led his inductive process, with
                    a degree of caution that might seem to border on timidity. He inferred that all
                    bodies have a <hi rend="italic">reluctance</hi> to a visible separation, or that
                    nature abhors an apparent void; that this reluctance is exactly the same for a
                    small as for a great vacuity; and that the force is limited, and exceeds not the
                    pressure of a column of water thirty-three feet in height. He next ventured one
                    step farther, and concluded, that this apparent vacuity was not filled by air
                    lodged in the pores of the glass, or derived from external filtration; that it
                    contained no subtile matter secreted from the atmosphere, and was not occupied
                    by mercurial vapours or spiritous exhalations; in short, that a real and
                    absolute vacuum had been formed.</p>
                <p>Pascal, then only twenty-four years of age, proposed to write a treatise on the
                    subject of those inquiries; but thought proper, in the mean rime, to publish a
                    short abstract of it, which appeared in 1647, and involved him in a wretched
                    controversy. Father Noel, rector of the Jesuits’ College at Paris, keenly
                    attacked it, armed with all the miserable sophisms of the schools, and the
                    absurd dogmas of the Romish church. He contended, that the space above the
                    mercurial column was corporeal, because it was visible and admitted light; that
                    a void being <hi rend="superscript"> a</hi> mere non-entity, cannot have
                    different degrees of magnitude; that the separation produced in the experiments
                    was violent and unnatural; and he presupposed that the atmosphere, like blood,
                    containing a mixture of the seve- <pb break="no" facs="nls:193194346"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0704-4346-0387"/>.ι∙al elements, the fire and the finer part of the
                    air were detached from it, and violently forced through the pores of the glass,
                    to occupy the deserted space. To enforce these puerile arguments, the reverend
                    prelate did not scruple to employ the poisoned weapon which his order has often
                    wielded with deadly effect, namely, hinting an oblique charge of heresy. This
                    rude attack only roused Pascal, and disposed him boldly to throw off the fetters
                    of inveterate opinion. He began to perceive that “<hi rend="italic"
                    >abhorrence”</hi> cannot, in strict logic, be applied to nature, which is a mere
                    personification, and incapable of passion; and was inclined, by degrees, to
                    adopt the clear disembarrassed explication of Torricelli, referring the
                    suspension of the mercurial column to the pressure of the external atmosphere.
                    In stating this conclusion, he makes some remarks which would deserve the
                    serious attention of philosophers in the present age. “When the weakness of men
                    is unable to find out the true causes of phenomena, they are apt to employ their
                    subtilty in substituting imaginary ones, which they express by specious names
                    that fill the ear, without satisfying the judgment. It is thus that the sympathy
                    and antipathy of natural bodies are asserted to be the efficient and unequivocal
                    causes of several effects, as if inanimate substances -were really capable of
                    sympathy and antipathy. The same thing may be said of the antiperistasis, and
                    various other chimerical causes, which afford only a vain relief to the avidity
                    of men to know hidden truths, and which, far from discovering them, only serve
                    to conceal the ignorance of those who invent such explications, and nourish it
                    in their followers.” These remarks, equally judicious and profound, are the more
                    striking, since Lord Bacon, while he proposed to reform and new-model the whole
                    structure of human learning, yet complied with the taste of his age in retaining
                    much of the jargon and barbarous distinctions of the schools.</p>
                <p>But Pascal did not rest satisfied with mere reasoning, however strictly
                    conducted; and he soon devised an experiment which should palpably mark, under
                    different circumstances, the varying effects of atmospheric pressure. It
                    occurred to him, that, if the mercury in the Torricellian tube were really
                    supported by the counterpoising weight of the atmosphere, it would be affected
                    by the mass of superincumbent fluid, and must therefore partially subside in the
                    higher elevations. He was impatient to have his conjecture tried in a favourable
                    situation; and, in November 1647, he wrote a letter communicating those views to
                    his brother-in-law, Perier, who held an office of considerable trust in the
                    province, and commonly resided at Clermont in Auvergne, in the immediate
                    vicinity of the Puy de Dôme, a lofty conical mountain, which rose, according to
                    estimation, above the altitude of 500 toises. Various avocations, however,
                    prevented that intelligent person from complying with his instructions till the
                    following year. Early in the morriing of the 19th September 1648, a few curious
                    friends joined him in the garden of a monastery, situated near the lowest part
                    of the city of Clermont, where he had brought a quantity of mercury, and two
                    glass tubes hermetically sealed at the top. These he filled and inverted, as
                    usual, and found the mercury to stand m both at the same height, namely, 26
                    inches and 3⅜ lines, or 28 English inches. Leaving one of the tubes behind,’ m
                    the custody of the subprior, he proceeded with the other to the summit of the
                    mountain, and repeated the experiment, when his party were surprised and
                    delighted to see the mercury sink more than three inches under the former mark,
                    and remain suspended at the height of 23 inches and 2 lines, or 24∙7 English
                    inches. In his descent rom the mountain, he observed, at two several stations,
                    hat the mercury successively rose; and, on his return to the monastery, he found
                    it stood exactly at the same point as at first. Encouraged by the success of
                    this memorable experiment, Perier repeated it on the highest tower of Clermont,
                    and noted a difference of two lines at an elevation of twenty toises. Pascal, on
                    his part, as soon as the intelligence reached him at Paris, where he then
                    chanced to be, made similar observations on the top of a high house, and in the
                    belfry of the church of St Jacques des Boucheries, near the border of the Seine;
                    and so much was he satisfied with the results, that he proposed already the
                    application of the barometer for measuring the relative altitudes of distant
                    places on-the surface of the globe.</p>
                <p>The investigation of the existence and effects of atmospheric pressure was now
                    completed, and it threw a sudden blaze over the whole contexture of physical
                    science. The fame of the experiments performed in Italy and in France, quickly
                    spread over Europe. Yet such is the force of habit and early prejudice, that,
                    after the first moments of surprise and confusion, few of the learned at this
                    period had the courage to open their eyes to the light which had so unexpectedly
                    burst upon them; but, secretly cherishing their inveterate notions, they sought
                    to comfort themselves by starting a variety of captious objections. Father
                    Mersenne, though a man of some abilities, conceived that suction was occasioned
                    by certain hooked particles dispersed through the atmosphere, which laid hold of
                    any fluid in contact with them, and drew it towards the general mass. Father
                    Linus, plunging still deeper in mysticism and absurdity, gravely proposed the
                    <hi rend="italic">funicular hypothesis,</hi> which attributes the suspension of
                    the mercurial column to the agency of certain small invisible threads. But
                    others of the clergy attacked Pascal with envenomed bitterness. The Jesuits of
                    the college of Montserrand scrupled not, in their public theses, to pervert his
                    expressions, and even contest the originality of his experiments. The
                    philosopher was justly incensed at their base conduct; and those repeated
                    provocations served, no doubt, to give a keener edge to his wit, when he
                    afterwards directed it with such overwhelming force against that insidious and
                    formidable order of priesthood. He composed in 1653, though they were not
                    published till after his death, two short treatises, <hi rend="italic">On the
                    Equilibrium of Liquors,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">On the Weight of the Mass of
                    Air,</hi> remarkable for their neatness, perspicuity, and lucid order. The laws
                    of the equilibrium of fluids are there beautifully deduced from a single
                    principle, which suggests a variety of original views and admirable remarks. In
                    those tracts he likewise gives a description of the Hydraulic Press, a most
                    useful and powerful machine, which has lately been revived in this country, and
                    by some considered as a new invention.</p>
                <p>A similar discovery, which was made about the same time in Germany, came
                    seasonably to support the triumph of innovation. Otto Gürické, a wealthy
                    magistrate of Magdeburg, who amused his leisure by constructing pieces of
                    mechanism, and instituting curious physical inquiries, finding that the belief
                    in the impossibility of a vacuum, with other scholastic tenets, was on the
                    gradual decline, had the boldness to conceive that the forming of a void was a
                    task perhaps within the reach of human ingenuity. Fired with the idea of
                    accomplishing what for ages had been deemed unattainable, he directed all his
                    efforts to compass that end. In his first trials he failed, as might be
                    expected; but, by perseverance, he was enabled to surmount every obstacle.
                    Having filled a wooden cask with water, he attempted to extract this again, by
                    means of a small sucking pump, introduced at the bottom of the cask, and worked
                    vigorously by three stout men; a hissing noise was heard like that of boiling
                    <pb break="no" facs="nls:193194359" xml:id="kp-eb0704-4359-0388"/> water, the
                    air entered from above through the interstices of the wood, and the water flowed
                    out. The more effectually to exclude the air, he next took a smaller cask, with
                    a suckcr attached to it, and placed it within a larger one, having filled up the
                    space between them with water. On working the pump as before, the water was
                    forced through the pores of the wood into the inner cask, but none was extracted
                    by the action of the piston. Foiled in these attempts with wooden casks, he had
                    recourse to a copper ball, to the under part of which he screwed an inclining
                    sucker; and, with this apparatus, he at last succeeded in extracting the air. He
                    continued the operation, till no further portion of air was perceived to issue
                    from the vent. On opening the cock again, the air rushed into the cavity of the
                    ball with violence; and the same effect took place, with scarcely any diminution
                    of power, after an interval of a day or two. The construction of the machine was
                    afterwards rendered more perfect, by substituting a large inclined metal sucker,
                    with its joints secured by immersion in water.</p>
                <p>Such was the origin of that most valuable addition to philosophical apparatus,
                    the air-pump, which long retained its earliest rude and simple form on the
                    Continent. By help of this new and powerful instrument, Gürické was enabled to
                    perform some interesting and very important experiments. One of these, which
                    demonstrates in a very striking way the pressure of the atmosphere, has since
                    been deservedly styled the Magdeburg Experiment. It was performed with two
                    hollow copper hemispheres, closely fitted together, and the air exhausted from
                    their cavity. This singular experiment Gürické had the honour of exhibiting, in
                    the year 1654, before the princes of the empire and the foreign ministers,
                    assembled at the diet of Ratisbon. The force of two teams, each consisting of a
                    dozen of horses, made to pull in opposite directions, was found insufficient to
                    separate the hemispheres. It was now that the burgomaster of Magdeburg heard,
                    for the first time, of Torricelli’s great discovery, and the intelligence must
                    have appeared quite delightful to him, who, by a path so different, had yet
                    arrived at a similar conclusion.</p>
                <p>After his return from this splendid assembly, Gürické pursued at home various
                    pneumatical researches. He showed the diminished pressure of the atmosphere at
                    an elevation above the surface, by means of a hollow ball fitted with a
                    stop-cock; having carried this to a height, a portion of the contained air
                    rushed out on turning the cock; but when it was brought down again and opened,
                    the same measure of air apparently flowed into its cavity. He actually weighed
                    the air by ascertaining, with the help of a nice balance, the loss which a large
                    bottle sustained on being exhausted, and found that the air is 970 times lighter
                    than water; a very near approximation, if allowance be made for the residuum of
                    air still left in the bottle. He was the first who proposed the <hi

                    hermetically sealed, and freely suspended in the air, to indicate by its
                    different buoyancy the changes which take place in the gravity of the external
                    fluid.</p>

                    barometer, constructed by Mr Adie. It consists of a fine drawn tube of tin, of

                    wide tube hermetically sealed, containing a toy, of the shape of a man. The
                    whole being filled with water, and set in a basin in the ground, the column of
                    liquid settled to the proper altitude, and left the toy floating on its surface;
                    but all the lower part of the tube being concealed under the wainscoting, the
                    little imao∙e, or weather-mannikin, as he was called, made its appearance only
                    when raised up into view in fine weather. This whimsical contrivance, which

                    >semper vivum,</hi> excited among the populace vasts admiration; and the worthy
                    magistrate was in consequence shrewdly suspected by his townsmen of being too
                    familiar with the powers of darkness.</p>
                <p>Before the taste for experimental science was imported from the Continent into
                    England, the great struggle fori the security of public rights had called forth
                    the national! energy, and its triumphant success had infused among' all classes
                    of men a spirit of boldness and enterprise most favourable to the reception of
                    the new philosophy. The parliamentary commissioners, by removing the more
                    violent and bigoted members of the universities, contributed, on the whole, to
                    encourage a more liberal tone of thinking in those opulent seminaries. Near the
                    close of the civil war, and during the vigorous administration of Cromwell, the
                    philosophy by experiment found some proselytes at last in the cloisters of
                    Oxford, where the mass of antiquated opinions had lain so long embalmed and
                    protected by religious awe. A small association was there formed, for combining
                    together the efforts of individuals in the prosecution of such inquiries; and
                    the fruits of this mutual compact were afterwards visible in the composition of
                    various philosophical works. But the Restoration, by which the nation, in a
                    burst of inconsiderate loyalty, surrendered the privileges which it had
                    purchased with torrents of blood, threw the government of the universities again
                    into the hands of men decidedly hostile to the very shadow of improvement.
                    Experimental science withdrew to a more congenial soil, and sought shelter and
                    support in the wider scope of the capital. The college, founded by the
                    munificence of Sir Thomas Gresham, for the benefit of the citizens of London,
                    though now unfortunately sunk in absolute neglect, had the merit of being the
                    first to extend its protection to the pursuits of inductive philosophy. It
                    produced a succession of professors, eminent in mathematical learning, which is
                    so closely allied with experimental research. A more extensive association was
                    accordingly formed in London, which regularly met at the apartments within the
                    Exchange, and was afterw ards, at the suggestion of Oldenburg, the resident from
                    the city of Hamburg, and in imitation of the foreign academies, constituted by
                    charter into the Royal Society-Such was the humble beginning of that illustrious
                    body, and such all the countenance it received from a needy and profligate
                    government. The institution, however, proved at first eminently useful, by its
                    influence in directing public opinion, and the shelter it afforded to
                    experimental philosophy against the jealousy and declared hostility of the
                    clerical and scholastic seminaries. The union of rank, or wealth, or talent,
                    though still very limited in its range, bestowed a degree of lustre on the
                    infant society, that was quite necessary for its defence against the attacks of
                    ignorance and the undermining of bigotry. _</p>
                <p>One of the most active members of the Royal Society was the honourable Mr Boyle,
                    who having become acquainted with experimental researches in the course o <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193194372" xml:id="kp-eb0704-4372-0389"/> -,his travels,
                    devoted, after his return home, his time and his fortune to such calm but
                    engaging pursuits. In this occupation be derived the most essential aid from Dr
                    Hooke, whom he had the discernment to engage as his assistant,—the most skilful
                    mechanician, and one of the best practical philosophers, of the age. The same
                    ingenious person was likewise employed as operator to the society, and undertook
                    to produce at each meeting some new experiments for the instruction and
                    entertainment of the members. One of the favourite subjects was to exhibit the
                    properties of the atmosphere. Hooke, at the instance of Boyle, had given a more
                    convenient form to the air-pump, and had materially improved its construction,
                    especially by the application of oil to the joints and valves. With this
                    improved machine, a more perfect vacuum was procured than Gürické had obtained;
                    and the English philosophers were thus enabled to perform a variety of delicate
                    and interesting experiments, which extended the influence of the original
                    discovery.</p>
                <p>In those early meetings, too, of the Royal Society, the suspension of the mercury
                    in the Torricellian tube had still the attraction of novelty. The famous Italian
                    experiment, as it was called, was frequently repeated and varied in the presence
                    of a few of the more assiduous members, who, though delighted with the
                    exhibition, still continued to argue and to doubt concerning the cause of the
                    phenomenon. These doubts acquired new force from a singular experiment which the
                    celebrated Huygens some years afterwards communicated, during a visit he made to
                    London. Having filled a glass tube eighty inches long with mercury, and
                    carefully expelled whatever air was lurking about the sides, he gently inverted
                    it, as usual, in a basin; when the mercury notwithstanding remained still
                    hanging from the top of the tube, and did not subside to the proper height till
                    it was struck with a slight blow. This anomalous fact appeared then extremely
                    puzzling. The experiment, indeed, requires great nicety and address on the part
                    of the operator, and evidently depends on a concurrence of circumstances which
                    have not yet been sufficiently explained. There can, at present, exist no doubt
                    that this extraordinary suspension of the mercury is occasioned by its obstinate
                    adhesion to the inside of the tube, which, in the process of purging the air,
                    becomes probably lined with a very thin film of mercurial oxyd. But Huygens, who
                    had embraced the leading principles of the Cartesian philosophy, was inclined to
                    draw a very different conclusion. He thought that the fact proved the existence
                    of another fluid besides the atmosphere, and one possessed of such extreme
                    subtilty and power, as to be capable of permeating the grosser bodies. In
                    ordinary cases, this fine ethereal substance might be supposed to escape through
                    the pores of the glass, and leave the mercurial column to the pressure merely of
                    the atmosphere. Such was the unfortunate introduction of that ideal being—an
                    aether—into experimental science, which it has continued to infest with
                    mysticism, and to dazzle with a false glare. Similar notions are perpetually
                    renewed by a certain class of superficial inquirers, and have exercised a
                    visible and most pernicious influence in retarding the progress of sound
                    philosophy.</p>
                <p>- It was soon perceived that the syphon barometer of Torricelli has a
                    disadvantageous form. Both branches of the tube being assumed to be of the same
                    width, the mercury must evidently sink as much in the one as it will rise in the
                    other; so that the variations in the height of the column are thus reduced to
                    half the true quantity. A small basin, or semicircular wooden box, to hold the
                    surplus mercury, was therefore attached to the frame of the instrument; and this
                    construction, with very little change, was adopted, during the course of a
                    century, by the makers of the ordinary barometer. But the syphon barome-i ter
                    itself was afterwards materially improved by having its lower branch blown into
                    a wide bulb for holding the charge of mercury. (See fig. 2, Plate CVI.) This
                    form of the barometer is not quite accurate, owing to the smallness and unequal
                    shape of the round bulb; but being very convenient for carriage, it has grown
                    into general use, at least for the cheaper and more common sort of
                    instruments.</p>
                <p>As soon as the barometer came to be regarded as a weather-glass, ingenuity was
                    set at work to devise the means of enlarging its scale of variations. Descartes
                    first proposed a simple method for effecting that object, by combining a
                    mercurial with a water barometer; which arrangement, though subject to
                    imperfection, has led to many of the subsequent improvements. (Sec fig. 4.) He
                    directed two short barometric tubes to be cemented, the one into the bottom, and
                    the other to the neck of a phial; or, still better, that the tubes should be
                    joined, by the flame of a lamp, to the opposite ends of a wide and regular
                    cylinder. The lower tube, and a portion of the cylinder, were then to be filled
                    with mercury, and above it was to be introduced pure water, reaching to the top
                    of the upper tube, and there sealed close. When this compound tube was inverted
                    in a basin of mercury, it is evident that the columns both of mercury and of
                    water would sink, till their joint pressure became just equal to the
                    superincumbent weight of the external atmosphere. But the variation of this
                    weight would afterwards be indicated chiefly by the large motion of the water;
                    since the mercurial column, spreading out above into a broad surface, must, in
                    any case, experience a very slight difference of altitude. Thus, suppose the
                    cylinder to have eight times the diameter of the upper tube, or a section
                    sixty-four times greater, mercury being 13∙6 times denser than water: for each
                    inch of increase of altitude which the ordinary mercurial column gains, the top
                    of the water would be raised in the tube 11'4 inches, its own rise being 11∙18
                    inches, and that of the wide mercurial cylinder only Ί8 of an inch, yet equal in
                    pressure to 2∙4 inches of water. But Descartes, generally satisfied with mere
                    theory and speculation, did not live to see his construction of the barometer
                    carried into effect; and Chanut, the French resident at Stockholm, to whom he
                    had imparted his views, met with such difficulty in the execution of the
                    project, that, after some fruitless attempts, he abandoned it altogether.</p>
                <p>Huygens was more fortunate, and succeeded, by dint of perseverance and skill, in
                    constructing the Cartesian barometer. But he had the mortification to find that,
                    in spite of all the pains he could take, the water, after it was relieved from
                    the pressure of the atmosphere by the sealing up of the tube, constantly
                    discharged a portion of air, which collected at the top, and by its elasticity
                    depressed the compound column below its due altitude. Convinced that this source
                    of imperfection is irremediable, he sought to rectify the construction of the
                    instrument, and produced his <hi rend="italic">Double Barometer;</hi> a form of
                    combination frequently used, especially when the object is rather to make the
                    variations very sensible than to obtain delicate results. (See fig. 5.) He
                    joined a barometric tube of the usual length, by the flame of a blow-pipe, to
                    two wide cylinders, the one sealed at the top, and the other annexed likewise
                    hermetically to a tall and narrow tube, open at its extremity; he then bent the
                    thicker tube a little above the lower cylinder, and brought the two branches to
                    be parallel. The instrument being thus formed, he filled the first branch with
                    mercury, and introduced above, in the second branch, some liquid of comparative
                    lightness. Alcohol would, in this respect, answer extremely well, if it were not
                    so lia- <pb break="no" facs="nls:193194385" xml:id="kp-eb0704-4385-0390"/>∙∙ ble
                    to waste by evaporation. An alkaline lye, or the de-liquiate salt of tartar,
                    which also readily admits of being coloured, was therefore, on the whole,
                    preferred.</p>
                <p>The principle of this construction is evidently the same as in that of Descartes;
                    but the vacuum lying contiguous to the mercury itself, can have no admixture of
                    disengaged air or of aqueous vapour. Since the cylinders are made very much
                    wider than the bore of the annexed tube, the variation of pressure will be
                    produced almost entirely by the change of altitude which the alkaline liquor
                    undergoes, the mercury suffering only a very minute alteration of ascent or
                    descent. The divisions of the ordinary scale will be about tenfold enlarged, if
                    a section of each cylinder should exceed twenty times that of the tube in which
                    the liquor plays.</p>
                <p>A barometer of this construction has decided advantages with respect to the
                    extent of its variations, but still it is not exempt from considerable defects.
                    The moisture on· the inner surface of the cylindrical reservoir increases the
                    adhesion of the mercury, and retards its movements. But a much greater source of
                    error proceeds from the influence of heat in extending the volume of liquor
                    contained in that reservoir, and rising into the narrow stem. This instrument,
                    therefore, to a certain extent, blends the indications of the barometer with
                    those of the thermometer, which are essentially different, and can seldom
                    accord.</p>
                <p>About the same period Dr Hooke likewise proposed a double barometer, of a similar
                    construction. He afterwards resumed the subject, and with a view to correct the
                    defect of the former arrangement, he produced, in 1685, an instrument of a more
                    complex form, but very ingeniously conceived. (See fig. 6.) To the upper end of
                    the open stem he joined a third cylinder of the same dimensions as the two
                    former, but tapering away to a fine orifice at the top. The principal tube being
                    filled as usual with mercury, extending to occupy the bottoms of both the
                    connected cylinders, he introduced a liquor immediately over the mercury in the
                    second cylinder, rising partly into the stem; above this, again, he poured
                    another liquor specifically lighter and differently coloured, filling up the
                    rest of the stem, and mounting into the third cylinder. By this artificial and
                    delicate combination, the mercury is left perfectly stationary, and all the
                    movements corresponding to the atmospheric pressure are performed by the
                    counterpoising liquors, and marked by their line of mutual separation. Since the
                    stem or narrow tube remains constantly full, the variation of its pressure must
                    depend on the different proportions of its length occupied by the two fluids. If
                    the weight of external atmosphere shoul d, for instance, increase, the denser
                    liquor will rise, and consequently cause the lighter liquor to contract its
                    column. The action of this compound barometer, being thus produced merely by the
                    difference of the gravity of the two fluids, might, therefore, be augmented
                    indefinitely. Suppose the liquid resting on the mercury to be pure water, and
                    the superincumbent liquid to be olive oil, which is about one twelfth part
                    lighter; the scale would be enlarged no less than 163 times, or an alteration of
                    one tenth in the altitude of the common mercurial column would be marked by a
                    motion through 12 × 1∙36 inches, or 16∙3 inches. But such a vast enlargement of
                    the scale is far greater than would ever be desirable in practice. It were
                    better, therefore, to introduce next the mercury some fluid which is denser than
                    water. If oil of sassafras were combined with oil of oranges, the divisions of
                    the scale would be augmented only sixty-eight times, and consequently the whole
                    range might not exceed ten or twelve feet. 1hose oils, however, would move
                    rather sluggishly, especially in cold weather, and might, from their incessant
                    shiftings, during a lengthened period, become insen sibly mixed. On the other
                    hand, fluids of distinct characters are seldom free from chemical action; they
                    expand differently with heat, and by coating with other traces the inside of the
                    tube, they are the more apt to retard the motion of the column. In general, the
                    advantage of any very great augmentation of the scale is counterbalanced, as the
                    fluids then work by irregular starts; and the instrument loses in delicacy
                    whatever it has gained in extent of action.</p>
                <p>Another method of augmenting the variations of the barometer was invented by the
                    same fertile genius, which has the advantage of uniting great simplicity with
                    tolerable accuracy. (See fig. 7.) Resuming the syphon barometer, he made a small
                    float of iron or glass to rest on the exterior surface of the mercury, and
                    suspended by a slender thread passed round a small wheel or cylindrical axis
                    that carried an index. Though the varieties of the height of the mercurial
                    column are, in a tube of this form, reduced to half the ordinary measure, yet,
                    from the great length of the index compared with the diameter of its axis, the
                    divisions on the circumference of the circle in which it travels are much
                    amplified. The little machinery being concealed within the frame of the
                    instrument, the index only is brought into view, protected by a circular plate
                    of glass. Thus fitted up, the whole forms rather a handsome piece of furniture.
                    The <hi rend="italic">Wheel Barometer,</hi> as it is called, has long maintained
                    its reputation among ordinary observers.</p>
                <p>A very simple method of enlarging the divisions of the barometer is commonly
                    ascribed to Sir Samuel Moreland, the same speculative adventurer who invented,
                    or rather introduced from abroad, the <hi rend="italic">Speaking Trumpet.</hi>
                    (See fig. 8.) It consisted in merely bending the upper part of the tube into a
                    very oblique position. By this deflexion, however, the scale which depends on
                    the perpendicular altitude cannot be augmented beyond three or four times
                    without incurring evident risk of inaccuracy. The instrument is called the <hi
                    rend="italic">Inclined</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Diagonal Barometer.</hi> The
                    form has been sometimes varied by the fancy of artists, who, repeating the
                    inclination of the tube, have occasionally given the upper part a zig-zag
                    appearance.</p>
                <p>The most ingenious barometer, filled with mercury only, and yet admitting a scale
                    of any extent, was invented by Cassini and by John Bernoulli, who first gave the
                    description of it in 1710. (See fig. 9.) A wide cylinder is annexed to the top
                    of the main tube, at the bottom of which there is joined at the right angles
                    another long and narrow tube. The mercury, in ascending or descending within the
                    wide cylinder, must, therefore, run along this horizontal tube. If that cylinder
                    have a diameter only four times greater than the bore of the tube, the scale of
                    variation will be augmented sixteen times. This instrument is, from its shape,
                    called the <hi rend="italic">Square Barometer.</hi> It is not found in practice
                    to answer so well as the theory might lead us to suppose. The mercury creeps
                    along the horizontal tube with difficulty, and by desultory advances; and these
                    irregularities increase when, from its motion and exposure, it becomes covered
                    with dust and partial oxidation.</p>
                <p>The simplest of all the barometers with an enlarged &lt; scale, and at the same
                    time one of the most ingenious, is the <hi rend="italic">Conical</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">Pendant Barometer,</hi> invented and described in 1695 by
                    Amontons, a French philosopher, who, being afflicted with total deafness in
                    consequence of a fever in his infancy, had devoted himself to mechanical
                    contrivances. (See fig. 3, Plate CVI.) This instrument consists merely of a
                    tube, four feet or more in length, with a bore narrower than ordinary, and
                    tapering regularly to the top. The width at the bottom must hardly exceed three
                    twentieth parts of an inch, while near the <pb break="no" facs="nls:193194398"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0704-4398-0391"/>..top it may be contracted to about one tenth. A
                    column of about thirty-one inches of mercury being introduced, the tube is
                    gently inverted and held perpendicular; the cohesion of such a narrow column is
                    sufficient to prevent it from dividing and admitting air unless it be shaken;
                    but, overpowering the atmospheric pressure, it descends till it has contracted
                    into the equiponderant altitude, by passing into a wider part of the tube. To
                    obtain equal divisions on the scale, it is necessary that the tube should have a
                    uniform taper. The most accurate construction of a barometer of this kind is,
                    therefore, attained by joining together two tubes that have even but unequal
                    bores, the longer and narrower one being uppermost. If the width of the upper
                    tube were supposed to be to that of the under one as two to three, the scale
                    would be enlarged three times, since, by descending three inches from the top,
                    and consequently two at the bottom, the column would suffer a contraction of one
                    inch in height.</p>
                <p>This species of barometer is thus recommended by its simplicity and its ample
                    range. But the bore of the tube being indispensably narrow, the mercury moves
                    with difficulty, and resists the impression of minute changes of external
                    action. When the conical-shaped tube is retained, the instrument is liable to
                    some inaccuracy from the influence of the cohesion of the mercury, which varies
                    with the diameter of the column in different parts of the tube.</p>
                <p>Amontons likewise proposed another form of barometer, in which the mercurial
                    column is subdivided among several short connected branches. (See fig. 10.)
                    Suppose the instrument were to have only the third part of the usual height, the
                    first, third, and fifth branches, enlarged above and below into very short
                    cylinders, are filled with mercury; and the second, fourth, and sixth branches,
                    which may have their bores narrower, are occupied with some light fluid, or
                    simply with air. If the external pressure should suffer any diminution, the
                    three mercurial columns wfliich produce the counterpoise will each descend and
                    push up the last fluid of the series by their combined effects. It is evident
                    that, by multiplying those branches, the barometer will have its altitude
                    proportionally reduced. But this construction, though specious in theory, is
                    found to have no practical advantages. The instrument is, from its complication,
                    very difficult to construct; its motions are sluggish, owing to the multiplicity
                    of tubes and the conjunction of fluids, and they are subject to derangements
                    from the variable influence of temperature. It has therefore been generally
                    abandoned.</p>
                <p>These different forms of the instrument have been variously modified, and often
                    brought forward with claims of novelty. We may notice, how ever, the <hi
                    rend="italic">Sectoral Barometer</hi> proposed by Magellan, in which the mercury
                    is always made to rise to the same high point of the tube, by drawing this less
                    or more aside from the vertical position. The arc thus described will indicate
                    the deviation from the perpendicular, and consequently the actual descent of the
                    mercury. But the difference between the vertical and the oblique line is not
                    measured by the inclination merely, it is proportioned to the versed sine of
                    this angle, or nearly to the square of the arc. The advantage of this mode of
                    observing is, therefore, best perceived in small variations of the mercurial
                    column. In the hands of a skilful observer, the best and most accurate
                    barometer, after all, is that of the original construction, with a tube lather
                    wide, and a broad cistern. To apply minute divisions is decidedly preferable to
                    any enlargement of the scale. The measuring of such divisions has been since <hi
                    rend="superscript"> r</hi> θ∏dered extremely easy by the adaptation of the
                    differ-onhal scale; a most valuable contrivance, proposed by <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ern</hi> ier early in the seventeenth century, but strangely
                    neglected long afterwards. This delicate appendage being once adopted, it became
                    the more desirable to improve the sensibility and regulate the correctness of
                    the indications of the barometer.</p>
                <p>The first object was carefully to cleanse the mercury, and to expel any portions
                    of air or moisture adhering to the inside of the tube. The influence of aqueous
                    vapour in depressing the mercurial column had been observed by Huy <hi
                    rend="superscript"> r</hi> gens; but other more evaporable fluids were
                    afterwards found to occasion, by their presence, a still greater derangement.
                    Homberg having, about the year 1705, washed a tube with alcohol to remove the
                    impurities from its internal surface, remarked that the mercury introduced into
                    it stood an inch and half lower than usual, a depression which this ingenious
                    chemist was disposed to attribute to the elasticity of the spiritous exhalations
                    collected above the mercurial column; though other academicians, and Amontons
                    among the rest, misled by their Cartesian prejudices, sought to ascribe the
                    effect to the different sized pores of the glass. These anomalies were removed
                    by heating or rather boiling the mercury in the tube till it was completely
                    purged of air and moisture, and brought into close contact with the inside of
                    the tube. But a new fact occurred which long puzzled the mechanical
                    philosophers. The tube of a barometer, which had been filled with more than
                    usual care, was observed to exhibit a luminous appearance when moved or slightly
                    agitated in the dark. This curious phenomenon gave occasion to multiplied and
                    prolonged controversies; it was attributed to the subtile matter of Descartes,
                    or ascribed to a native phosphorescence, or a latent fire inherent in the
                    mercury. Our countryman Hauksbee, in the year 1708, gave the first rational
                    explanation of the fact, by referring it to electricity, which he had just begun
                    to cultivate as a distinct science. It resembles exactly, indeed, the experiment
                    of the exhausted flask, in which an electrical current flashes with a diffuse
                    lambent flame, like the <hi rend="italic">aurora borealis</hi> or the <hi
                    rend="italic">northern streamers.</hi> The friction of the mercury against the
                    inside of the tube excites electricity, while the vacuity, or rather the very
                    attenuated vapour in which the supposed fluid plays, facilitates its expansion.
                    When the vacuum is rendered very perfect by the careful and accurate boiling of
                    the mercury, the lambent flashing ceases for want of a fine medium to conduct
                    and disperse the electrical influence.</p>
                <p>The next point to which experimenters were led to direct their attention, was the
                    effect of the width of the tube on the altitude of the mercurial column.
                    Plantade, a lawyer of Montpellier, appears to have been one of the first who
                    remarked that the mercury stands always low er in narrow tubes. This fact he
                    communicated about the year 1730 to Cassini, wflio was then occupied in the
                    south of France with carrying on the great trigonometrical survey. But the
                    discrepancies observed by Plantade, being unfortunately confounded with other
                    collateral circumstances, were for a time overlooked. In tubes having a narrow
                    bore, the depression of the mercury, however, is very considerable, as may be
                    readily perceived in a small glass syphon, of which the one branch is about half
                    an inch in diameter, and that of the other branch less than the tenth of an
                    inch. Thus, if the narrow tube had a width of only the thirteenth part of an
                    inch, the depression of the mercury would amount to half an inch, which is about
                    the third part of the elevation to which water in similar circumstances would be
                    raised by capillary action. This effect has not been sufficiently examined, but
                    it appears to result from the attraction of the particles of the mercury to each
                    other exceeding their attraction to the surface of the glass. Mercury, in
                    contact with glass, therefore, tends to a spherical form, and always assumes a
                    convex <pb break="no" facs="nls:193194411" xml:id="kp-eb0704-4411-0392"/>surface
                    within a clean tube. Water and other liquids, again, manifest an opposite
                    character, the mutual attraction of their particles being less than their
                    adhesion to glass. Accordingly, they spread along a vitreous surface, instead of
                    collecting into drops; and in narrow tubes they mount above the level, and
                    invariably have a concave termination. If the bore be so small as to be reckoned
                    capillary, the depression of mercury is, like the elevation of water, inversely
                    as the diameter; but when the bore has a considerable width, the quantity of
                    depression, depending on the curvature of the surface of the mercury, diminishes
                    proportionally faster, and follows nearly the inverse duplicate ratio of the
                    diameter. But on the subject of capillary action we refer our readers with the
                    utmost confidence to a valuable paper communicated to the Royal Society of
                    London, by Mr Ivory, late of the Military College at Sandhurst, one of the most
                    original and profound mathematicians that our island has had the honour to
                    produce.</p>
                <p>The influence of the predominating attraction of the particles of mercury to
                    themselves, above their adhesion to the sides of a glass tube, has not been
                    considered with so much attention as it demands. Nothing is more common than to
                    remark that the mercury in the barometer is in the act of rising if it show a
                    convex surface, but about to fall if it should appear concave. Now, the top of
                    the mercurial column must always remain convex if the barometer be properly
                    constructed, the tube perfectly clean, and the mercury purged of all impurities.
                    But if the inside of the tube be anywise soiled, whether covered with humidity
                    or stained with mercurial oxyd, the metallic fluid will adhere so obstinately to
                    the glass as to lose its convexity, and to subside into a flat surface, or even
                    sink into a concavity, like water and other liquids. Hence the danger' of
                    boiling the mercury too long in the tube, as it becomes partially oxydated; and
                    the thin crust so formed not only suspends the column higher, but obstructs the
                    freedom of its motion. The same effect is produced by greasing the inside of the
                    tube. Some respectable authors, from not attending to these facts, have hastily
                    inferred that the convex appearance which mercury assumes in the barometer was
                    merely accidental, and consequently removed by a more complete boiling and
                    purification.</p>
                <p>In the case of tubes having wide bores, the depression of the mercurial column
                    may, without any sensible error, be disregarded. According to the. accurate
                    experiments made by Lord Charles Cavendish, and published by his son the
                    celebrated Mr Cavendish, the quantity of depression is only the 200th part of an
                    inch in a tube of 6-10ths of an inch in diameter, the 28th part of an inch in a
                    tube of 3-10ths diameter, and the 15th part of an inch in a tube of 2-10ths
                    diameter. Wide tubes ought, therefore, to be preferred in the construction of
                    barometers, both on account of the facility with which the mercury moves in
                    them, and the smallness of its depression. The only circumstance to overbalance
                    these advantages would be the necessity and inconvenience of having a very large
                    cistern. A quarter of an inch may be reckoned a good width of tube, and the
                    corresponding depression is only the twentieth part of an inch.</p>
                <p>In the syphon barometer, if both branches have the same diameter, the action is
                    exerted on opposite sides, and therefore the effect of depression becomes
                    entirely lost. For accurate purposes, this original form of the instrument has
                    been resumed, and the inconvenience arising from the large variation of the
                    lower lever entirely obviated by an ingenious contrivance introduced above fifty
                    years ago. This consists in the application of a leathern bag, instead of a
                    wooden or ivory cistern, to hold the surplus mercury. Besides the barometric
                    tube, there is placed adjacent to it another short one of the same width,
                    communicating with the mercury contained in the bag, which being pressed by
                    turning a screw below, is at each observation brought exactly to the same mark.
                    The external atmosphere readily acts through the substance of the leather; but
                    the mercury, from the powerful cohesion of its own particles, cannot be squeezed
                    through the pores of that casing without violent compression. The addition of a
                    bag within a cylindrical box, omitting the lower tube, likewise renders the
                    barometer easily portable; since, for safe carriage, the mercury can be screwed
                    up tight, to fill the whole cavity of its tube, but, on turning the screw again,
                    the column will subside and rest on a broad base.</p>
                <p>The last object which required nice observation, was to estimate the effect of
                    heat in dilating the mercury, and consequently increasing the altitude of the
                    equiponderant column. This correction could not be made with any sort of
                    accuracy previous to the application of the thermometer, which, though invented
                    half a century earlier than the barometer, was yet more than another
                    half-century in arriving at perfection. Hero, a mechanical philosopher, who
                    flourished at Alexandria about 130 years before Christ, has described in his <hi
                    rend="italic">Spiritalia</hi> a sort or huge weather-glass, in which water was
                    made to rise and fall by the vicissitudes of day and night, or rather the
                    changes of heat and cold. This machine had for ages been overlooked, or merely
                    considered in the light of a curious contrivance. But Sanctorio, the inventor of
                    the famous statical balance, a very learned and ingenious Italian physician, who
                    was long professor of medicine in the university of Padua, and had laboured to
                    improve his art by the application of experimental science, reduced the
                    hydraulic machine of Hero into a more compendious form, and thus constructed,
                    about the close of the sixteenth century, the instrument since known by the name
                    of the <hi rend="italic">air thermome∙ ter,</hi> which lie employed with obvious
                    advantage to examine the heat of the human body in fevers. Some years afterwards
                    a similar instrument was contrived, perhaps without any communication, by
                    Drebbel, a very clever and scheming Dutch artist, who visited London in the
                    reign of James I., and imported the knowledge of that instrument into
                    England.</p>
                <p>But this air thermometer was evidently of the same nature with what has been
                    since called the <hi rend="italic">manometer;</hi> it could measure only the
                    dilatation or augmented elasticity of the air confined within its bulb, whether
                    occasioned by heat or the diminution of external pressure. It was therefore
                    considered merely as a weather-glass, indicating the state of the atmosphere;
                    nor could its blended impressions, which might separately affect both the
                    thermometer and barometer, be then distinguishcd. Had it been more closely
                    studied, it must have led, by another path, to the discovery of the latter. But
                    those irregularities to which the air thermometer was hence subject appear to
                    have created such doubts respecting the accuracy of the instrument, as
                    occasioned its being neglected long afterwards.</p>
                <p>The same country, however, which had given birth to the thermometer, began its
                    improvement. After the principle of the barometer was established, the members
                    of the Academy del Cimento, founded at Florence in 1657, and supplied with
                    liberal funds by the grand duke of Tuscany, had, among other interesting
                    physical researches, resumed the application of the thermometer; and, instead of
                    air, they substituted alcohol or spirit ŋt wine, another very expansible fluid
                    not affected by atmospheric pressure, while they attached to the tube a scale
                    graduated on a regular plan, though directed by no very precise measures. The
                    instrument so constructed, but somewhat varied in its form, being copied by
                    Italian ar-tĮsts<pb break="no" facs="nls:193194424" xml:id="kp-eb0704-4424-0393"
                    /> was dispersed over Europe under the name of the <hi rend="italic">Florence
                    Glass-</hi> From its careless execution, however, in the hands of itinerant
                    venders, this thermometer, or rather thermoscope, appears never to have obtained
                    an established reputation.</p>
                <p>The great object proposed was to bring thermometers to an exact correspondence.
                    It was expedient, therefore, not only to select a proper fluid, but to adopt a
                    uniform ιnd’consistent scale. Alcohol, linseed oil, and mercury, had been
                    successively tried. The graduation was at first derived from the temperature of
                    cellars and deep caves, which, indicating the natural heat of the globe, had
                    long been considered invariable; but more enlarged experience discovered the
                    inaccuracy of that supposition, and showed the mean temperature to be materially
                    modified by the latitude of the place, and its elevation above the level of the
                    sea. Congelation, or rather the inverted process, the thawing of ice, or the
                    melting of snow, was then found to remain fixed; a most important fact, which
                    had been first noticed byGürické, but overlooked till a considerable time
                    afterwards. A stationary point was hence obtained, from which to commence the
                    thermometric scale. But different modes were pursued for determining the
                    divisions. Amontons, reverting to the air thermometer in spite of its
                    acknowledged defects, found that the elasticity of air compressed in the bulb,
                    and able at the temperature of melting snow to support a column of mercury
                    fifty-four inches high, was capable of raising this to seventy-eight inches at
                    the heat of boiling water; and he seemed contented with framing a rude standard,
                    by merely dividing the intermediate space into inches and half-inches.</p>
                <p>But about the same, or nearly at the beginning of the eighteenth century, Newton
                    himself cast a keen though rapid glance on the subject of heat, and proposed a
                    thermometer of a much simpler and more elegant construction. Having adopted
                    linseed oil as a fixed and uniform substance, capable of great dilatation, he
                    discovered by experiment, that dividing the capacity of the bulb into ten
                    thousand equal parts, the liquid expanded 256 parts from melting snow to
                    blood-heat, and 725 parts to that of boiling water. These numbers, however,
                    being inconveniently large, he reduced them somewhat more than twenty times,
                    adopting 12 and 34 as the proportional divisions on his scale. But oil, being so
                    viscid a substance, was found to trail and collect on the inside of the tube;
                    and this thermometer, though constructed on a right principle, never came into
                    general use.</p>
                <p>Roemer, the Danish astronomer who made the fine discovery of the progressive
                    motion of light, was the first who proposed mercury as the fittest fluid for
                    thermometers; and Halley and Amontons remarked about the same time, that it
                    expands uniformly with heat, and remains nearly stationary at the point of
                    boiling water. On this principle, Delisle of St Petersburg constructed, in 1733,
                    a mercurial thermometer with a descending scale, the distance from freezing to
                    boiling water occupying 153, or, in mund, numbers, 150 divisions, of which the
                    bulb itself contains 10,000. A more ingenious method, but perhaps too refined,
                    for graduating thermometers, was proposed lfim <hi rend="superscript"> na</hi>
                    ^* <hi rend="superscript"> n</hi> * ’ ∙ <hi rend="superscript"> a</hi>
                    distÎHguished Italian mathematician, in</p>
                <p>θ4. It consisted in adopting the scale, in the successive temperatures produced
                    by mixtures, in the different proposions of twelve parts of water at the moment
                    of thaw-</p>
                <p>, and of ebullition. This suggestion led to a very important inference, since it
                    proved that mercury expands <hi rend="superscript"> um</hi> θrmly with equal
                    additions of heat, while alcohol <hi rend="superscript"> e s</hi> constantly in
                    a rising progression. But the capital mpiovement of the thermometer was effected
                    by the skill o perseverance of Fahrenheit, whose name has remain-justly attached
                    to the instrument. This ingenious per son, originally a merchant at Dantzic, who
                    had the misfortune to fail in business, was induced, by his taste for mechanics
                    and chemistry, to have recourse to the manufacture of thermometers, as the means
                    of gaining a slender livelihood. But not meeting with sufficient encouragement
                    at home, he removed, about the year 1720, to Holland, the great emporium of the
                    arts, and fixed his future residence at Amsterdam. He now preferred mercury to
                    alcohol for filling his thermometers; and, adopting the division of the bulb
                    into 10,000 parts, he reckoned sixty-four of them as the expansion between
                    freezing and blood-heat, and thirty-two as the contraction from the same point
                    to what he considered as extreme cold, or that produced by the mixture of one
                    part of salt with three parts of snow. These numbers were extremely convenient,
                    being found by a repeated bisection. With respect to the heat of boiling water,
                    Fahrenheit discovered the important fact, that it varies with the state of
                    atmospheric pressure. Taking the mean, however, he reckoned 180 degrees from
                    freezing to ebullition, and therefore marked this point at 212 on his scale. The
                    thermometer owes its improvement to Celsius, professor at Upsal, who in 1742
                    placed the commencement of the scale at congelation, and divided the interval
                    thence to boiling water into an hundred degrees, extending such a portion
                    downwards as might be wanted. This centesimal thermometer is exactly the same as
                    what the French have since called the <hi rend="italic">centigrade,</hi> which,
                    from its fitness and simplicity, deserves to be universally adopted.</p>
                <p>The thermometer having been thus carried by successive steps to perfection, it
                    was found by delicate experiments, that, between the points of boiling and
                    freezing, the expansion of mercury amounts to the fifty-fourth part of its bulk,
                    or that it acquires, for each degree of heat, an increase of volume amounting to
                    the 5412th part on the centesimal scale, or the 9742d part on the scale of
                    Fahrenheit. A correction, therefore, on the height of the mercurial column in
                    the barometer becomes necessary according to the changes of temperature which it
                    undergoes. In this climate, the extreme variation arising from that cause will
                    seldom exceed two tenths of an inch. But if the barometer be suspended in a room
                    kept at an agreeable temperature, the error occasioned by the expansion of the
                    mercury may, in ordinary cases, be disregarded, since it will scarcely amount to
                    the twentieth part of an inch.</p>
                <p>Since the barometer marks the condition of the distant atmosphere, and intimates
                    those internal alterations which are generally connected with the change of the
                    weather, it is particularly valuable at sea, by forewarning the mariner of the
                    approach of a storm. But an instrument of the ordinary construction would not
                    answer this purpose, the agitation of a vessel on a tempestuous ocean being such
                    as would not only throw the ponderous mercurial column into violent oscillation,
                    but communicate those sudden shocks which must infallibly break the tube. V
                    arious attempts have accordingly been made to obtain a <hi rend="italic">marine
                    barometer</hi> exempt from risk, and yet sufficiently sensible to the variations
                    of" the atmosphere. The conical or pendant barometer being, from the narrowmess
                    of its bore, rather sluggish, was first recommended for that purpose, though
                    never adopted into practice. About the beginning of the eighteenth century, Dr
                    Hooke and Amontons severally proposed to employ for a barometer on board ship,
                    the manometer or air thermometer. To obviate the derangement arising from the
                    influence of heat, there was to be placed beside it a spirit-of-wine
                    thermometer, with a ball so large as to give expansions equal to those of the
                    portion of air confined within the bulb. The difference between the two adjacent
                    columns of liquid would therefore<pb break="no" facs="nls:193194437"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0704-4437-0394"/> measure the variation of external pressure. But
                    to procure such a nice adaptation would prove so extremely difficult in
                    practice, that most probably this instrument was seldom or never actually
                    constructed. Besides, the liquid column of the manometer, though light and
                    narrow, would yet be much shaken by the rolling and pitching at sea.
                    Notwithstanding these weighty objections, however, this compound manometer was
                    tried in England, mercury being employed as the fluid both of expansion and
                    pressure, and various adjustments applied by means of a complex machinery.</p>
                <p>An ingenious and very substantial kind of marine barometer was, above twenty
                    years ago, recommended by Blondeau, one of the professors of the naval academy
                    at Brest. (See fig. 11, Plate CVL) It consisted of an iron tube, bent below into
                    a syphon, and filled carefully with mercury, which carried a float. For this
                    purpose, a musket-barrel, about three feet long, was chosen, having a very
                    smooth and even bore, and an iron breech closely welded to it, instead of being
                    soldered with brass, which might become corroded by the action of the mercury.
                    The lower end of the tube had a collar of leather, to which was screwed a piece
                    of iron, perforated through its whole length, and bent into an arch, having
                    screwed likewise, with a collar of leather at its other extremity, a vertical
                    cylinder of iron, four inches high, and of the same bore exactly as the tube.
                    The contracted aperture at the end of the tube, not being exactly in the middle,
                    was not always opposite that of the arch; and, therefore, by turning it
                    occasionally aside, the communication could be contracted at pleasure, or even
                    obstructed entirely. The cylindrical appendix was tapered at the top to a narrow
                    orifice, through which an iron wire, attached to a small ivory float, had been
                    introduced. To prepare this instrument for action, the mercury was first boiled
                    in the tube; then the arch, filled with hot mercury, was screwed to the end, the
                    cock opened, and the surplus mercury allowed to flow over; next the vertical
                    piece, with its float, was screwed on, and a little mercury added, to give it
                    due play. The origin of the scale was to be determined from the comparison with
                    another good barometer of the ordinary construction; but, owing to the equality
                    of the bores of the opposite tubes, the divisions were only half the usual size,
                    or the inches were exhibited by half-inches.</p>
                <p>This species of barometer is certainly free from all sort of risk, while the
                    facility which, by means of turning the arch, it affords in checking the ascent
                    and descent of the mercury, prevents in a great measure the oscillations of that
                    fluid. If the instrument were properly suspended, therefore, its indications
                    would be tolerably steady and regular. The chief objection to it consists in the
                    diminutive range of its scale.</p>
                <p>In every marine barometer, the main object is to give steadiness to the mercurial
                    column, by retarding its motion in the tube; in short, to imitate the equalizing
                    effect of the fly in mechanics. One form of construction was, instead of the
                    cistern below, to annex a spiral tube composed of a number of horizontal
                    convolutions. Passemant, an ingenious Parisian artist, about the year 1758
                    improved on this idea. He twisted the barometer tube near the middle, at least
                    twice round, and joined to its upper end a wide cylinder. But, more effectually
                    to prevent all irregular oscillations, he took a tube with a very narrow or
                    capillary bore, and contracted it below, while he annexed a wide cylindrical
                    piece at its other extremity. The only thing wanted now to the perfection of
                    this instrument, was to devise a mode of suspending it that should soften the
                    jerks, and allow it generally to maintain a vertical position. Our English
                    artists have, by repeated trials, at last succeeded in surmounting all the
                    difficulties. The marine barometer, manufactured by Mr Cary of London (see fig.
                    12, Plate CVI.), is one of the most approved kind. It consists of a capillary
                    tube, about twenty-seven inches long, with a bore scarcely exceeding the
                    thirtieth part of an inch, but terminated by a cylinder four or five inches
                    high, and nearly three tenths of an inch in diameter. It is suspended by a
                    spring and jimbols, near the top, at a certain point, which in each case is
                    discovered by actual trial. By making the suspension lower, it i <hi
                    rend="subscript"> s</hi> found that the agitation of the barometer will cause
                    the mercury to rise a little; while, by placing the suspension higher, the
                    mercurial column suffers always some depression. The reason of this curious
                    observation is not well explained. It probably results from the différent
                    centrifugal tendencies communicated to the opposite portions of the columns. The
                    swinging of the instrument would evidently augment the pressure of the upper
                    portion of the column, while it diminished that of the under portion. But this
                    lower portion being longer than the other, its tendency to descend would be
                    proportionally so much greater. About the point of suspension, however, the
                    opposite effects of the centrifugal tendencies are balanced, since the superior
                    force being employed to set in motion a narrower column, the reflux and efflux
                    of the mercury in the upper cylinder must be preserved nearly equal.</p>
                <p>Marine barometers, thus improved, are now very generally used, and with great
                    benefit to the public service, on board ships of war and Indiamen. To facilitate
                    the keeping of a register of barometrical observations, the meritorious and
                    indefatigable Mr Horsburgh, hydrograph er to the East India Company, published a
                    set of engraved ruled sheets, adapted for the convenience of navigators. In
                    these plates the height of the mercury, from twenty-seven to thirty-one inches,
                    is represented in inches and tenth parts by horizontal lines, while each
                    successive day has a space apportioned to it by vertical bars. The state of the
                    barometer at every observation is marked with a dot, and these dots being
                    afterwards connected together, exhibit an irregular waved line, stretching
                    across the sheet, and indicating the series of the changes of the weather. At
                    the lowest points, from which the curve again returns, a gale generally follows.
                    From the observations made off the Cape of Good Hope during the month of May
                    1815, by an ingenious and active officer, Captain Basil Hall, then of his
                    majesty’s sloop Victor, it appears that whenever the mercury fell to 29∙60
                    inches, a storm ensued; the column always rose when the gale abated, and when it
                    reached near thirty inches, the weather became fair. Those gales often came on
                    suddenly, without any visible change in the aspect of the sky, but the marine
                    barometer never failed to give warning of their approach.</p>
                <p>A very convenient substitute for the marine barometer is the <hi rend="italic"
                    >sympesometer</hi> constructed by Mr Adie, optician m Edinburgh. It is merely an
                    improved <hi rend="italic">manometer,</hi> partly filled with a fixed oil, and
                    indicating the conjoined effect of heat and atmospheric pressure on the inclosed
                    air; but the influence of temperature is corrected by means of a sliding scale,
                    regulated by an attached mercurial thermometer. The sympesometer occupies little
                    room, is easily rectified, and comparatively cheap.</p>
                <p>To explain the cause of the variations of the barometer, has long perplexed
                    philosophers. Many hypotheses have at different times been advanced on the
                    subject; but it would be a mere waste of time to make any detailed recital of
                    such crude and unsatisfactory attempts. The various and often imaginary effects
                    of vapours, of heat, and of winds, have been employed in framing an explication
                    of the changes of the atmosphere. The fact, that the mer- <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193194450" xml:id="kp-eb0704-4450-0395"/>'. curial column generally
                    falls before rain, seemed at complete variance with the intimation of the
                    senses, a notion having become universally prevalent, that the air is heavier
                    when the sky appears lowering and overcast; another proof, were it wanted, how
                    fallacious are all current opinions in matters of science.</p>
                <p>Leibnitz, fancying he had discovered a’ new principle in hydrostatics,
                    endeavoured, by a sort of metaphysical argument, to demonstrate that, though a
                    body adds its own weight to the pressure of a fluid in which it is suspended,
                    yet it will cease to be ponderous during the act of falling. This alleged
                    principle will not, in the actual state of science, be thought to require any
                    serious refutation; nor, were it even admitted, would it be found at all
                    adequate to the explication of the phenomenon, since the weight of moisture
                    precipitated from the whole body of atmosphere could never, by the absence of
                    its pressure, occasion a diminution of the tenth part of an inch in the altitude
                    of the mercurial column.</p>
                <p>Dr Halley and Mairan sought to account for the depression of the barometer before
                    a storm, by the withdrawing of the vertical pressure of the atmosphere, when
                    borne swiftly along the surface of the globe by a horizontal motion. This
                    hypothesis at first sight appears very plausible, and might seem further
                    confirmed by a noted experiment which most authors have admitted without due
                    examination. Hauksbee, a skilful and ingenious experimental philosopher, about
                    the year 1704 placed two barometers, about three feet asunder, with their naked
                    cisterns in two close square wooden boxes, connected by a horizontal brass pipe;
                    one of these boxes had, inserted at right angles, an open pipe on the one side,
                    and a second pipe, terminating in a screw, on the other side; to this end he
                    adapted a strong globular receiver of about a foot in diameter, which had been
                    charged, by injection from a syringe, with three or four atmospheres; then
                    suddenly' opening the stop-cock, and giving vent for the escape of the air
                    through the box and over the surface of the included cistern, the mercury sunk
                    equally more than two inches in both the barometers.</p>
                <p>This elegant experiment might be deemed entirely conclusive, if a minute
                    circumstance, on which the success really depends, had not unfortunately been
                    overlooked. • It will be perceived from the inspection of the figure which
                    Hauksbee has given, that the exit pipe of the box was considerably wider than
                    the pipe which conveyed into it the stream of air. This fluid, escaping from
                    compression, would therefore be carried by its elasticity as much beyond the
                    state of equilibrium; while the width of the orifice, by facilitating its
                    emission, would allow the portion occupying the box and the connected reservoir
                    to preserve its acquired expansion. If the pipe c <hi rend="superscript"> r</hi>
                    discharge from the box had been much narrower than the other, an opposite effect
                    must have taken place; for the air accumulated over the cistern, not finding a
                    ready vent, would remain in a state of condensation. This curious fact is
                    another of the many instances which might be cited to show the great delicacy
                    and circumspection required in performing philosophical experiments.</p>
                <p>. Similar results, however, can be exhibited by a very simple apparatus. Let a
                    small box, or rather a glass ball, have a short narrow tube inserted in the one
                    side, and another wide tube opposite to this, with a cross slider of; brass, for
                    contracting the orifice at pleasure; and, to the under part of the ball, join a
                    long perpendicular tube, bent back like a syphon to more than half its height,
                    and containing a double column of water. Now, blow through the narrow tube into
                    the cavity of the ball, while the orifice of emission is quite opened, and the
                    liquid will rise several inches in the long stem; but, still continuing the
                    blast, let the orifice be gradually contracted, and the column will first
                    descend to its ordinary level, and then sink considerably below it.</p>
                <p>The fall and rise of the mercury in the barometer must evidently be occasioned by
                    some corresponding reduction or accumulation of the atmosphere at the place of
                    observation. Whatever augments the elasticity of the air will cause part of the
                    incumbent fluid to evade and leave for the time a diminished vertical pressure.
                    The efflux of wind might also produce a temporary reduction of the atmospheric
                    column. But the real difficulty consists in explaining why the variations of the
                    barometer should be greater in the high latitudes than between the tropics, and
                    why they so much exceed in all cases the quantities which calculation might
                    assign.</p>
                <p>The influence of heat will account for the semi-diurnal variations of the
                    barometer which are observed, especially within the torrid regions. From ten
                    o’clock in the morning till four in ⅛he afternoon, the mercury generally falls;
                    but, after that hour, it rises again, till ten o’clock at night, when it drops
                    till four in the morning, and then mounts till ten o'clock in the forenoon.
                    These regular changes, which amount to about the five hundredth part of the
                    whole atmospheric pressure, depend on the prevalence of the alternating land and
                    sea breezes, occasioned by the diversified action of the sun’s rays upon the
                    earth and water. The accumulation of air is greatest at four o’clock in the
                    morning and evening, and the mercury then attains its highest point; but it
                    sinks lowest at ten o’clock in the morning and evening, when the incumbent mass
                    has been the most reduced.</p>
                <p>A similar reason will explain the effects of the northerly and easterly winds, in
                    elevating the mercury of the barometer in our climate. A chill air, with
                    enfeebled elasticity, is thus accumulated and exerts a predominant pressure.</p>
                <p>The augmented elasticity communicated to the air by the action of heat or the
                    presence of humidity, and the reduction of the incumbent mass by the efflux of
                    winds, have each their distinct influence in disturbing the equilibrium of the
                    atmospheric ocean. But the effects, particularly in the high latitudes, much
                    surpass the regular operation of those causes. The only mode, perhaps, of
                    removing the difficulty, is to take into consideration the comparative slowness
                    with which any force is propagated through the vast body of atmosphere. An
                    inequality may continue to accumulate in one spot, before the counterbalancing
                    influence of the distant portions of the aerial fluid can arrive to modify the
                    result. In the higher latitudes, the narrow circle of air may be considered as,
                    in some measure, insulated from the expanded ocean of atmosphere, and hence,
                    perhaps, the variations of the barometer are concentrated there, and swelled
                    beyond the due proportion. See the articles <hi rend="smallcaps">Climate</hi>
