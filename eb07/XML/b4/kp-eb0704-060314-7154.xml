                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra

                <p><label type="entry">BETTERTON, <hi rend="smallcaps">Thomas</hi></label>, a
                    celebrated actor, was the son of Mr Betterton, under-cook to King Charles I.,
                    and was born in Tothill-street, Westminster, in the year 1635. Having received
                    the rudiments of a genteel education, his fondness for reading induced him to
                    request his parents to bind him apprentice to a bookseller; which was readily
                    complied with, and one Mr Rhodes, near Charing-cross, fixed on for his master.
                    This gentleman, who had been wardrobe-keeper to the theatre in Blackfriars
                    before the troubles, obtained in 1659, from the powers then in being, a license
                    to set up a company of players in the Cockpit in Drury-Lane, in which company Mr
                    Betterton entered himself, and, though not much above twenty years of age,
                    immediately gave proofs of genius and merit in the histrionic line.</p>
                <p>Soon after the Restoration, two different theatres were established by royal
                    authority; the one in Drury-Lane in <pb break="no" facs="nls:193197167"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0704-7167-0604"/>consequence of a patent granted to Henry
                    Killigrew, Esq. which was called the “King’s Company ;” and the other in
                    Lincoln’s-Inn-Fields, who styled themselves the “Duke of York’s Servants,” the
                    patentee of which was Sir William Davenant. This gentleman having long had a
                    close intimacy with and warm friendship for Mr Rhodes, engaged Mr Betterton, and
                    all who had acted under Mr Rhodes, into his company, and opened in 1662 with a
                    new play of his own, in two parts, called the <hi rend="italic">Siege of
                    Rhodes.</hi> In this piece, as well as in the subsequent characters which Mr
                    Betterton performed, he increased his reputation with the public, and became so
                    great a favourite with the king, that by his majesty’s special command he went
                    over to Paris to examine the French stage with a view to the improvement of our
                    own; and it was after his return, as is generally supposed, that moving scenes
                    were first introduced upon the English theatre, which previously had been only
                    hung with tapestry.</p>
                <p>In the year 1670 he married Mrs Sanderson, a female performer on the same stage,
                    who, both as an actress and a woman, was every thing he could desire, and with
                    whom, throughout the whole course of his after-life, he possessed every degree
                    of happiness that a perfect union of hearts could bestow.</p>
                <p>When the duke’s company removed to Dorset-Gardens, Betterton still continued with
                    them; and, on the coalition of the two companies in 1684, he acceded to the
                    treaty, and remained among them, Mrs Betterton maintaining the same rank among
                    the female that her husband supported among the male performers. And so great
                    was the estimation in which they were both held, that, in the year 1675, when a
                    pastoral called <hi rend="italic">Calista,</hi> or the <hi rend="italic">Chaste
                    Nymph,</hi> written by Mr Crown, at the desire of Queen Catharine, consort to
                    Charles IL, was to be performed at court by persons of the greatest distinction,
                    Mr Betterton was employed to instruct the gentlemen, and Mrs Betterton to tutor
                    the ladies, amongst whom were the two princesses, Mary and Anne, daughters of
                    the Duke of York. In grateful remembrance of this tuition, the latter, when
                    queen, settled a pension of L.100 per annum on her old instructress.</p>
                <p>In 1693 Mr Betterton having sounded the inclinations of a select number of the
                    actors whom he found ready to join him, obtained, through the influence of the
                    Earl of Dorset, the royal license for acting in a separate theatre; and was very
                    soon enabled, by the voluntary subscriptions of many persons of quality, to
                    erect a new playhouse within the walls of the Tennis Court in
                    Lincoln’s-Inn-Fields. To this step Mr Betterton is said to have been induced,
                    partly by ill treatment from the managers, and partly with a view to repair, by
                    the more enlarged profits of a manager, the loss of his whole fortune, upwards
                    of L.2000, which he had sustained in the year 1692, by risking it in a
                    commercial adventure to the East Indies. Be this, however, as it will, the new
                    theatre opened in 1695 with Mr Congreve’s <hi rend="italic">Love for Love,</hi>
                    the success of which was very great. Yet, in a few years, it appeared that the
                    profits arising from this theatre, opposed as it was by all the strength of
                    Cibber’s and Vanbrugh’s writings at the other house, were very insignificant;
                    and Mr Betterton growing infirm through age, and labouring under violent attacks
                    of the gout, gladly quitted at once the fatigues of management and the hurry of
                    the stage.</p>
                <p>The public, however, who retained a grateful sense of the pleasure they had
                    frequently received from this thea-tucal veteran, and sensible of the narrowness
                    of his circumstances, resolved to continue the marks of their esteem to him by
                    giving him a benefit. On the 7th of April 1709, the comedy of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Love for Love</hi> was performed for this purpose, and Betterton himself,
                    though then up wards of seventy years of age, acted the youthful part of]
                    Valentine; as in the September following he did that of Hamlet, his performance
                    of which the author of the Tatler has particularly noticed. On the former
                    occasion Mrs Barry, Mrs Bracegirdle, and Mr Dogget, who had all quitted the
                    stage some years before, in gratitude to one to whom they were under so many
                    obligations, enacted the parts of Angelica, Mrs Frail, and Ben; and Mr Rowe
                    wrote an epilogue for that night, which was spoken by the two ladies, supporting
                    between them this once powerful supporter of the English stage. The profits of
                    the night are said to have amounted to upwards of L.500, the prices having been
                    raised on the occasion; and when the curtain drew up, almost as large an
                    audience appeared behind as before it.</p>
                <p>The next winter Mr Betterton was prevailed on by Mr Owen M <hi rend="superscript"
                    > i</hi> Swinney, then manager of the opera-house in the Hay-market, at which
                    plays were acted four times a week, to continue performing, though but seldom.
                    In consequence of this arrangement, in the ensuing spring, being that of 1710,
                    another play was given out for his benefit, namely, <hi rend="italic">The Maid’s
                    Tragedy</hi> of Beaumont and Fletcher, in which he performed his celebrated part
                    of Melanthus. This, however, was his last appearance on the stage; for having
                    been suddenly seized with the gout, and being impatient at the thought of
                    disappointing his friends, he made use of outward applications to reduce the
                    swellings of his feet, and succeeded so far in accomplishing his object. But
                    although he acted that day with unusual spirit and briskness, and met with
                    universal applause, he paid dear for this tribute of public applause; for the
                    fomentations he had made use of occasioning a revulsion of the gouty humour,
                    threw the distemper into his head, and terminated his life on the 28th of April.
                    On the 2d of May his body was interred with much ceremony in the cloister of
                    Westminster, and great honour was paid to his memory by his friend the Tatler,
                    who has related in a pathetic, and at the same time dignified manner, the
                    process of the ceremonial. As an author, Mr Betterton had a considerable degree
                    of merit. His dramatic works are, 1. Amorous Widow, a comedy; 2. Diocletian, a
                    dramatic opera; 3. Masque in the Opera of the Prophetess; 4. Revenge, a comedy;
                    5. Unjust Judge, a tragedy; and, 6. Woman made a Justice, a comedy. As an actor,
                    he possessed uncommon merit; and those who are desirous of ascertaining the
                    opinion formed of him by his contemporaries may refer to the description given
                    of him by his friend and rival Colley Cibber, in the <hi rend="italic">Apology
                    for his own Life.</hi> The picture is unquestionably painted <hi rend="italic"
                    >en beau;</hi> but the lineaments are nevertheless true to nature, and the
                    likeness seems on the whole a just one.</p>
