                    significant corrections to the OCR text, predominantly in cases of confusing "c"
                    and "e." Isolates 90 entries that were mistakenly included at the end of prior
                    entries in v1 and v2. Normalizes ordinal numbers. Separates metadata in
                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra
                    space around the <gi>pb</gi> tag. Where a word is hyphenated at a <gi>pb</gi>,
                    the end fragment is now joined to the start fragment, making a machine-readable
                    word.</change>

                <p><label type="entry">BOHADDIN</label>, or, more properly, <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Boh-a-Eddyn,</hi> an eminent Aiabian writer and statesman, better known in the
                    East under the appellation of 1bn-Sjcddad, or <hi rend="italic">the Son of
                    Sjeddad.</hi> He was born at Mossul in the year 539 of the Hejira (1145 A. D.)
                    He early became eminent in the study of the Koran, and of the traditions and
                    controversies founded on it, as well as in that of jurisprudence. At the age of
                    twenty-seven he obtained the place of repeater or lecturer at Bagdad, and, soon
                    after, a professor’s chair in a college founded at Mossul. In 1187 he made the
                    pilgrimage to Mecca, and then proceeded to visit Jerusalem and Hebron. In
                    passing through Damascus he was sent for by Saladin, who was then employed in
                    the siege of Kancab. The sultan seems to have been pleased with the interview;
                    and his secretary, Omad-Eddyn-Isfahamy, a man of great learning and eloquence,
                    advised him, after completing his pilgrimage, to present himself again before
                    Saladin. Our author had observed, as he himself mentions <hi rend="italic">(
                    Vita Saladini,</hi> ch. v.), that the whole soul of the monarch was engrossed by
                    the war which he was then waging against the enemies of the faith; and that the
                    only mode of acquiring his favour was by urging him to its vigorous prosecution.
                    He, therefore, composed a treatise on the <hi rend="italic">Laws and Discipline
                    of Sacred War,</hi> and made a collection of all the passages in the Koran and
                    the books of traditions in which the extermination of infidels was recommended
                    and enforced. This work, on his return, he presented to Saladin, who received
                    both it and the author with peculiar favour. Bohaddin, from this time, remained
                    constantly attached to the person of the sultan, and was employed in various
                    important embassies and departments of civil government. That prince seems also
                    to have sought, by the friendship of so eminent a doctor, to exalt the
                    reputation for sanctity, of which he was extremely ambitious. Often, while
                    riding through the ranks, Bohad∙ din rode by his side, and read to him passages
                    out of the Koran or its interpreters, to which Saladin lent more apparent
                    attention than to the arrangements of the army. Our author was now appointed to
                    two important posts; those of judge of the army, and judge of Jerusalem. In this
                    latter capacity an incident occurred which he adduces to prove the impartial
                    justice exercised by the sultan. A merchant presented himself at the tribunal of
                    Bohaddin, and complained that he had been unjustly deprived of a large sum of
                    money. On being asked to name the author of the injury, he replied “the sultan
                    himself.” Here the judge deemed it expedient to suspend proceedings until the
                    case was laid before the royal defendant. Saladin, on learning the
                    circumstances, denied the truth of the charge; but said that the man should have
                    justice. Accordingly he was introduced into his presence; and the sultan,
                    descending from his throne, placed himself in the posture of a defendant, and
                    each pleaded his own cause before Bohaddin. The latter decided, on just grounds
                    as he alleges, in favour of Saladin, and even hinted that the temerity of the
                    plaintiff merited some portion of chastisement. The sultan, however, dismissed
                    the person not only unpunished, but with the present of a handsome robe and a
                    large sum of money.</p>
                <p>Bohaddin continued in favour with Saladin during the whole of that monarch’s
                    life; and he boasts that he often obtained ready admission, while the principal
                    officers and generals were waiting in vain for an audience. After the sultan’s
                    death, he was active in securing the throne to his son Melik-al-Dhaker. That
                    prince created him cadhi of his capital, Aleppo, which gave Bohaddin an
                    opportunity of founding in that city a college, of which he himself was the
                    principal professor. Under his auspices, the sciences, which hail greatly
                    declined in Aleppo, soon rose to more than their former lustre. But
                    Melik-al-Dhaker dying, left his son Melik-al-Aziz a minor, and Bohaddin obtained
                    the principal sway in the regency. This gave him an opportunity of introducing
                    learned men at court, and loading <pb break="no" facs="nls:193198896"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0704-8896-0737"/>them with honours. As the prince, however,
                    approached to manhood, he attached himself to more youthful counsellors; and
                    Bobaddin, though he still retained his offices, found it expedient to retire
                    from court, and devote himself entirely to the pursuits of learning. Even after
                    he was unable to <hi rend="italic">go</hi> to college, he continued to give
                    lectures in his own house; and he persevered in these learned labours till the
                    age of ninety, when be died on the 29th of October 1235. (Hejira 633.)</p>
                <p>Bohaddin wrote several works on jurisprudence and Moslem divinity; but the only
                    one that can be interesting to us is his <hi rend="italic">Life and Actions of
                    Saladin;</hi> which, with several other pieces connected with the same subject,
                    was published by Albert Schultens, at Leyden, in 1732, accompanied by a somewhat
                    inelegant Latin translation, also by notes and a geographical index. This work
                    affords a favourable specimen of the historical compositions of the Arabs.
                    Neither Bohaddin, however, nor any of his contemporaries, can enter into
                    competition with those great historians who have adorned the better ages of
                    European literature. They display no philosophical views nor accurate
                    discrimination of character; but confine themselves chiefly to a mere
                    chronological record of events. The work of Bohaddin is written with some
                    spirit, and, at the same time, is free from that verbose and empty inflation
                    which deforms the compositions of some of his contemporaries. Whatever relates
                    to Saladin, breathes, of course, the highest tone of panegyric; yet the
                    enthusiasm with which every thing about him is narrated, and the anecdotes which
                    the author, from his own personal knowledge, is able to communicate respecting
                    that extraordinary character, give his work a great degree of interest. <hi
