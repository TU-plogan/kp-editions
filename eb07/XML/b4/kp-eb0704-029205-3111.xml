                    Kent, about the year 1568. After going through the usual course of academical
                    learning at Hart Hall, in Oxford, he travelled into foreign parts; and upon his
                    return home was created master of arts, and soon after, in 1603, received from
                    King James I. the honour of knighthood. In 1620 he was made high sheriff of
                    Oxfordshire: but having engaged to pay some debts of his wife’s family, he was
                    reduced to poverty, and obliged to betake himself for shelter to the Fleet
                    prison, where he composed several books; amongst which are, Meditations and
                    Disquisitions on the Lord’s Prayer; Meditations, &amp;c. on several of the
                    Psalms of David; Meditations and Prayers upon the Seven Days of the Weck; <hi

                    Granger observes, that his <hi rend="italic">Chronicle of the Kings of
                    England</hi> was ever more esteemed by readers of a lower class than by such as
                    had a critical knowledge of history, ln the reign of the British Solomon, the
                    language was considered polite; and it long maintained its reputation,
                    especially amongst country gentlemen. But the author seems to have been
                    sometimes more studious to please than to inform, and with that view to have
                    sacrificed even chronology itself to method. In 1658, Edward Philips, nephew to
                    Milton, published a third edition of this work, with the addition of the reign
                    of Charles I. It has several times been reprinted since, and by successive
                    additions brought as far down as the reign of George I. Sir Richard also
                    translated several works from the French and Italian; and died very poor, in the
                    Fleet prison, on the 18th of February 1645.</p>

                    and learned antiquary, descended from a family ancient, well esteemed, and
                    distinguished by its loyalty and affection for the crown, was born at Crook in
                    1656. He was educated at the free school at Durham, and thence removed to St
                    John’s College, Cambridge, in 1674. He proceeded A. B. in 1677, A. Μ. in 1681,
                    was elected fellow in March 1680, ordained deacon by Bishop Compton of London in
                    December 1685, and priest by Bishop Barlow of Lincoln the following year. Dr
                    Watson, tutor of the college, who had been nominated, but not yet consecrated,
                    bishop of St David s, offered to take him for his chaplain; but this he
                    declined, probably in the prospect of a like offer from Lord Crew, bishop of
                    Durham, which he soon after accepted. His lordship collated him to the rectory
                    of Long-Ncwton in his diocese, in June 1687; and, as Dr Grey was informed by
                    some of the bishop’s family, the prelate further intended to give him that of
                    Sedgefield, worth L.600 or L.7θθ a year, with a golden prebend, had he not
                    incurred bis lordship’s displeasure and left his family for refusing to read
                    King James II.’s declaration for liberty of conscience. The bishop, who
                    disgraced him for this refusal, and was excepted out of King William’s pardon,
                    took the oaths to that king, and kept his bishopric till his death. Mr Baker
                    resigned Long-Newton on the 1st of August 1690, refusing to take the oaths; and
                    retired to his fellowship at St John s, in which he was protected till the 20th
                    of January 1716-1/, when, with one and twenty others, he was dispossessed of it·

                    annuity of L.40, which the last act required before it was amended and
                    explained. Though this annuity, left him by his father for his fortune, with
                    L.20 per annum out of his collieries by his elder brother, from the day of his
                    death in August 1699, and during the remaining part of the lease, which expired
                    at Whitsuntide 1722, was now his whole subsistence, he could not be prevailed on
                    to secure himself against the act. He retained a lively resentment of his
                    deprivations; and wrote himself in all his books, as well as in those which he
                    gave to the college library, <hi rend="italic">socius ejectus,</hi> and in some
                    <hi rend="italic">rector ejectus.</hi> He continued to reside in the college as
                    commoner-master till his death, which happened on the 2d of July 1740, in
                    consequence of a paralytic stroke. In the afternoon of the 29th June, being
                    alone in his chamber, he was struck with a slight apoplectic fit; but this
                    abating a little, he recovered his senses, and knew all those about him, who
                    were his nephew Burton, and Drs Bedford and Heberden. He seemed perfectly
                    satisfied and resigned; and when Dr Bedford desired him to take some medicine
                    then ordered, he declined it, saying he would only take his usual sustenance,
                    which his bed-maker knew the times and quantities of giving. He was thankful for
                    the affection and care his friends showed him; but, hoping the time of his
                    dissolution was at hand, he would by no means endeavour to retard it. His
                    disorder increased, and the third day after he was seized with the disorder he
                    died. Having been appointed one of the executors of his elder brother’s will, by
                    which a large sum was bequeathed to pious uses, he prevailed on the other two
                    executors, who were his younger brother Francis and the Hon. Charles Montagu, to
                    lay out L.1310 of the money upon an estate to be settled upon St John’s College
                    for six exhibitioners. He likewise gave to the college L.100 for the
                    consideration of L.6 a year, then only legal interest, during his life; and to
                    the library several choice books, both printed and in manuscript, with medals
                    and coins; besides what he left to it by his will, which were “all such books,
                    printed and manuscript, as he had, and were wanting there.” All that Mr Baker
                    printed was, lsŕ, Reflections on Learning, showing the insufficiency thereof in
                    its several particulars, in order to evince the usefulness and necessity of
                    Revelation, Lond. 1709-10, which went through many editions; and, 2d, The
                    preface to Bishop Fisher’s Funeral Sermon for Margaret countess of Richmond and
                    Derby, 1708; both without his name. The latter piece is a sufficient specimen of
                    the editor’s skill in antiquities to make us regret that he did not live to
                    publish his History of St John’s College, from the foundation of old St John’s
                    House to the present time; with some occasional and incidental accounts of the
                    affairs of the university, and of such private colleges as held communication or
                    intercourse with the old house or college; collected principally from
                    manuscripts, and carried on through a succession of masters to the end of Bishop
                    Gunning’s mastership, 1670. His manuscript collections relative to the history
                    and antiquities of the university of Cambridge, amounting to forty-nine volumes
                    in folio and three in quarto, are divided between the British Museum and the
                    public library at Camnudge the former possesses twenty-three volumes, the atter
                    sixteen in folio and three in quarto. Dr Knight styles him “the greatest master
                    of the antiquities of this °uι university;” and Hearne says, “Optandum est ut

                    Cl. Bakerus, quippe qui cruditione summa judicioque acri et subacto polleat.” Mr

                    was <hi rend="superscript"> 0rn</hi> in Fleet-street, London, either near the
                    end of the seventeen th, or very early in the beginning of the eighteenth
                    century. His father’s profession is not known, but his mother was in her time a
                    midwife of great practice. He was brought up under an eminent bookseller, who
                    preceded the elder Dodsley, to the business of a bookseller; in which, however,
                    he appears not to have engaged at all after his apprenticeship, or, if he did,
                    it was soon relinquished by him; for although it was in his power to have drawn
                    away all his master’s best customers, he would not set up against him. Mr Baker
                    being of a philosophical turn of mind, and having diligentlyattended to the
                    methods which might be practicable and useful in the cure of stammering,
                    especially in teaching deaf and dumb persons to speak, made this the employment
                    of his life. In the prosecution of so valuable and difficult an undertaking he
                    was very successful, and several of his pupils have borne testimony to the
                    ability and good effect of his instructions. He married Sophia, youngest
                    daughter of the famous Daniel Defoe, who brought him two sons, both of whom he
                    survived. On the 29th of January 1740 Mr Baker was elected a fellow of the
                    Society of Antiquaries, and on the 12th of March following, the same honour was
                    conferred upon him by the Royal Society. In 1744 Sir Godfrey Copley’s gold medal
                    was bestowed upon him, for having, by his microscopical experiments on the
                    crystallizations and configuration of saline particles, produced the most
                    extraordinary discovery during that year. Having led a very useful and
                    honourable life, he died at his apartments in the Strand on the 25th of November
                    1774, being then above seventy years of age. His wife had been dead some time
                    before; and he only left one grandson, William Baker, who was born the 17th of
                    February 1763, and to whom, onhisliving to the age of twenty-one, he bequeathed
                    the bulk of his fortune, which he had acquired by his profession of teaching
                    deaf and dumb persons to speak. His furniture, printed books (but not
                    manuscripts), curiosities, and collections of every sort, he directed to be
                    sold, which was accordingly done. His fine collection of native and foreign
                    fossils, petrifactions, shells, corals, vegetables, ores, &amp;c. with some
                    antiquities, and other curiosities, were sold by auction the 13th of March 1775
                    and the nine following days. He was buried, as he desired, in an unexpensive
                    manner, in the church-yard of St Mary-le-strand; within which church, on the
                    south wall, he ordered a small tablet to be erected to his memory. An
                    inscription for it, he said, would probably be found among his papers; if not,
                    he hoped some learned friend would write one agreeable to truth. This friendly
                    office, however, remains as yet to be performed. Mr Baker was a constant and
                    useful attendant at the meetings of the Royal and Antiquarian Societies, and in
                    both was frequently chosen one of the council. He was peculiarly attentive to
                    all new improvements in natural science, and very solicitous for the prosecution
                    of them. Several of his communications are printed in the Philosophical
                    Transactions; and besides the papers written by himself, he was the means, by
                    his extensive correspondence, of conveying to the society the intelligence and
                    observations of other inquisitive and philosophical men, both at home and
                    abroad. The Society for the Encouragement of Arts, Manufactures, and Commerce,
                    is under singular obligations to this worthy naturalist. As he was one of the
                    earliest members of the society, so he contributed in no small degree to its
                    rise and establishment. At its first institution he officiated for some time
                    gratis as secretary. He was many years chairman of the committee of accounts,
                    and he took an active part in the general deliberations of the society. He drew
                    up a short account of the original of this society, and of the concern he
                    himself had in forming it; which was read before the society of antiquaries, and
                    would be a pleasing present to <pb break="no" facs="nls:193193137"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0704-3137-0294"/>the public. Mr Baker was a poetical writer in the
                    early part of his life. His <hi rend="italic">Invocation of Health</hi> got
                    abroad without his knowledge; but was reprinted by himself in his <hi
                    rend="italic">Original Poems, serious and humorous,</hi> 8vo, 1725 and 1726.
                    Among these poems are some tales as witty and as loose as Prior’s. He was the
                    author likewise of <hi rend="italic">The Universe,</hi> a poem intended to
                    restrain the pride of man; which has been several times reprinted. His account
                    of the water polype, which was originally published in the Philosophical
                    Transactions, was afterwards enlarged into a separate treatise, and has gone
                    through several editions. But his principal publications are, <hi rend="italic"
                    >The Microscope made Easy,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Employment for the
                    Microscope.</hi> The first of these, which was originally published in 1742 or
                    1743, has gone through six editions. The second edition of the other, which, to
                    say the least of it, is equally pleasing and instructive, appeared in 1764.
                    These treatises, especially the latter, contain the most curious and important
                    of the observations and experiments which Mr Baker either laid before the Royal
                    Society or published separately. It has been said of Mr Baker, that “he was a
                    philosopher in little things.” But if it was intended by this language to lessen
                    his reputation, there is no propriety in the stricture. He was an intelligent,
                    upright, and benevolent man, much respected by those who knew him best; his
                    friends were the friends of science and virtue; and it will always be remembered
                    by his contemporaries, that no one was more ready than him to assist those of
                    whom he had acquaintance, in their various researches and endeavours for the
                    advancement of knowledge and the benefit of society.</p>

                    who was a silk-throwster in Spitalfields, young Baker succeeded him in the
                    business, but wanted the prudence and attention which are necessary to secure
                    prosperity in trade. Like his father, he was both a philosopher and a poet, and
                    wrote several occasional poems in the periodical collections, some of which were
                    much admired at the time; but so violent was his turn for dramatic performance,
                    that he repeatedly engaged with the lowest strolling companies, in spite of
                    every effort of his father to reclaim him. The public were indebted to him for
                    The Companion to the Play-house, in two volumes, 1764, 12mo; a work which,
                    though imperfect, had considerable merit, and showed that he possessed a very
                    extensive knowledge of our dramatic authors, and which has since, under the
                    title of “Biographia Dramatica,” been considerably improved.</p>

                    became a particular profession, and bakers were introduced. It is, however,
                    generally agreed that they had their rise in the East, and passed from Greece to
                    Italy after the war with Pyrrhus, about the year of Rome 583. Till that time
                    every housewife was her own baker; for the word <hi rend="italic">pistor,</hi>
                    which we find in Roman authors before this period, signified, as’ Varro 1 justly
                    observes, a person who ground or pounded the grain in a mill or mortar to
                    prepare it for baking. According to Athenaeus, the Cappadocians were the most
                    approved bakers; after them the Lydians; and then the Phoenicians. To the
                    foreign bakers brought into Rome were added a number of freedmen, who were
                    incorporated into a body, or, as they termed it, a college; from which neither
                    they nor their children were ever allowed to withdraw. They held their effects
                    in common, and could not dispose of any part of them. Every bakehouse had a
                    patronus intrusted with the superintendence of it; and these patroni again
                    elected one of their number every year, who had superintendence over all the
                    rest, and the care of the college. Out of the body of the bakers one was every
                    now and then admitted among the senators; and to preserve honour and honesty in
                    the college, they were expressly prohibited all alliance with comedians and
                    gladiators. Every one had his own shop or bakehouse, and they were distributed
                    into fourteen regions or wards of the city. They were excused from guardianships
                    and other offices which might divert them from their employment. By British
                    statutes bakers are declared not to be handicraftsmen. No man for using the
                    mysteries or sciences of baking, brewing, surgery, or writing, shall be
                    interpreted a handicraftsman. The bakers were a brotherhood in England before
                    the year 1155, in the reign of King Henry IL, although the white bakers were not
                    incorporated till 1407, by King Edward III., and the brown bakers not till 1621,
                    in King James I.’s time. The French had anciently a great baker, <hi
                    rend="italic">grand panetier de France,</hi> who had the superintendence of all
                    the bakers of Paris.</p>
