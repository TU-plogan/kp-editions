                <p><label type="entry">BELL</label>, a well-known instrument, ranked by musicians
                    among the musical instruments of percussion.</p>
                <p>The constituent parts of a bell are the body or <hi rend="italic">barrel·,</hi>
                    the <hi rend="italic">elaρρer</hi> on the inside, and the ear or <hi
                    rend="italic">cannon</hi> by which it is attached to a large beam of wood. The
                    matter of which it is formed is a composition called <hi rend="italic"
                    >bell-metal.</hi> The thickness of a bell’s edge is usually I-15th of the
                    diameter, and its height is twelve times its thickness. The bellfounders have a
                    diapason, or scale, wherewith they measure the size, thickness, weight, and tone
                    of their bells.</p>
                <p>The sound of a bell is conjectured to consist in a vibratory motion of its parts,
                    somewhat like that of a musical chord. The stroke of the clapper must
                    necessarily change the figure of the bell, and from a circle convert it into an
                    oval or ellipse; but the metal having a great degree of elasticity, that part
                    impinged on by the clapper, and driven farthest from the centre, will return,
                    and even incline nearer the centre than before; so that the two parts which were
                    extremes of the longest diameter become in turn those of the shortest; and tĥus
                    the external surface of the bell undergoes alternate changes of figure, and by
                    this means gives that tremulous motion to the air in which the sound consists.
                    Μ. Perrault maintains that the sound of the same bell or chord is a compound of
                    the sounds of the several parts thereof; so that where the parts are
                    homogeneous, and the dimensions of the figure uniform, there is such a perfect
                    mixture of all these sounds as constitutes one uniform, smooth, even sound; and
                    the contrary circumstances produce harshness. This he proves from bells
                    differing in tone according to the part impinged on, although there is a motion
                    of all the parts wherever the blow happens to be given. He therefore considers
                    bells as a compound of an infinite number of rings, which, according to their
                    different dimensions, have different tones, as chords of different lengths have;
                    and when struck, the vibrations of the parts immediately impinged determine the
                    tone, being supported by a sufficient number of consonant tones m the other
                    parts.</p>
                <p>Bells are heard at a greater distance when placed on plains than on hills, and
                    still farther in valleys than on Piams; the reason of which seems to be, that
                    the higher the sonorous body the rarer is the medium, and, consequently, the
                    less impulse it receives, and the less proper a vehicle it is to convey sound to
                    a distance.</p>
                <p>Μ. Reaumur, speaking of the shape most proper for Yells, in order to give them
                    the loudest and clearest sound, remarks, “that as pots and other vessels more
                    immediately necessary to the service of life were doubtless made before bells,
                    it probably happened that the observing these vessels to have a sound when
                    struck, gave occasion to making bells, intended only for sound, in that form;
                    but that it does not appear that this is the most eligible figure; for lead, a
                    metal which is in its common state not at all sonorous, yet becomes greatly so
                    on its being cast into a particular form, and that very different from the
                    common ’ shape of bells. In melting lead for the common occasions of casting in
                    small quantities, it is usually done in an iron ladle; and as the whole is
                    seldom poured out, the remainder which falls to the bottom of the ladle cools
                    into a mass of the shape of that bottom. This is consequently a segment of a
                    sphere, thickest in the middle, and thinner towards the edges; nor is the ladle
                    any necessary part of the operation, since, if a mass of lead be cast in that
                    form in a mould of earth or sand, in any of these cases it is found to be very
                    sonorous. Now if this shape alone can give sound to a metal which in other forms
                    is perfectly mute, how much more must it necessarily give it to other metals
                    naturally sonorous, in whatever form? It should seem that bells would much
                    better perform their office in this than in any other form; and that it must
                    particularly be a th ng of great advantage to the small bells of common
                    house-clocks, which are required to have a shrill note, and yet arc not allowed
                    any great size.”</p>
                <p>The use of bells was very ancient, as well as extensive. We find them among Jews,
                    Greeks, Romans, Christians, and Heathens, variously applied, as on the necks of
                    men, beasts, birds, horses, sheep; but they were chiefly suspended in buildings,
                    either religious, as in churches, temples, and monasteries; or civil, as in
                    houses, markets, baths; or military, as in camps and frontier towns.</p>
                <p>Among the Jews it was ordained that the lower part of the blue tunic which the
                    high priest wore when he performed religious ceremonies should be adorned with
                    pomegranates and gold bells, intermixed alternately and at equal distances. As
                    to the number of the bells worn by the high priest, the Scriptures are silent,
                    and authors are not very well agreed; but the sacred historian has let us into
                    the use and intent of them, which was to give intimation both when he entered
                    and came out of the holy place. The shahs of Persia are said to have the hem of
                    their robes adorned, like the Jewish high priests, with pomegranates and gold
                    bells.</p>
                <p>Among the Greeks, those who went the nightly rounds in camps or garrisons,
                    carried with them little bells, which they rung at each sentry-box, to see that
                    the soldiers on watch were awake. A codonophorus or bellman also walked, in
                    funeral processions, some space in advance of the corpse, not only to keep off
                    the crowd, but to advertise theyZ&lt;wen <hi rend="italic">dialis</hi> to keep
                    out of the way, for fear of being polluted by the sight, or by the funerary
                    music. The priest of Proserpine at Athens, called <hi rend="italic"
                    >hierophantus,</hi> rung a bell to call the people to sacrifice. There were also
                    bells in the houses of great men, to call up the servants in the morning.
                    Zonaras assures us that bells were suspended along with whips on the triumphal
                    chariots of victorious generals, in order to put them in mind that they were
                    still liable to public justice. We arc also informed that bells were put on the
                    necks of criminals going to execution, that persons might be warned by the noise
                    to get out of the way of so ill an omen as the sight of the hangman or the
                    condemned criminal, who was devoted and on the point of being sacrificed to the
                    <hi rend="italic">dii manes.</hi></p>
                <p>Of bells on the necks of brutes, express mention is made in Phaedrus; and taking
                    them away was construed theft by the civil law.</p>

                <p>With respect to the origin of <hi rend="italic">church-hells,</hi> Mr Whitaker
                    observes, that bells being used, among other purposes, by the Romans, to signify
                    the times of bathing, they were naturally applied by the Christians of Italy to
                    denote the hours of devotion, and summon the people to church. The first
                    application of them to this purpose is ascribed by Polydore Virgil and others to
                    Paulinus, bishop of Nola, a city of Campania, about <hi rend="smallcaps">a.
                    d.</hi> 400. Hence, it is said, the names <hi rend="italic">nolae</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">campanae</hi> were given them; the one referring to the city, the
                    other to the country. In Britain, bells were applied to church purposes before
                    the conclusion of the seventh century, in the monastic societies of Northumbria,
                    and, as early as the sixth, even in those of Caledonia. They were therefore used
                    from the first erection of parish churches. Those of France and England appear
                    to have been furnished with several bells. These were sometimes composed of iron
                    in France; and in England, as formerly at Rome, they were frequently made of
                    brass. As early as the ninth century, many were cast of a large size and deep
                    note.</p>
                <p>Ingulphus mentions that Turketulus, abbot of Croyland, who died about <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">a. d.</hi> 870, gave a great bell to the church of that abbey,
                    which he named <hi rend="italic">Guthlac,</hi> and afterwards six others, two of
                    which he called <hi rend="italic">Eartholomew</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Eette-lin,</hi> two <hi rend="italic">Turhetul</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Tatwin,</hi> and two he named <hi rend="italic">Pega</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Eega.</hi> All of them rang together; and the same author says, Aw <hi
                    rend="italic">erat tunc tanta consonantia campanarum in tota Anglia.</hi> Not
                    long after, Kinseus, archbishop of York, gave two great bells to the church of
                    St John at Beverley, and at the same time provided that other churches in his
                    diocese should be furnished with bells. Mention is also made by St Aidhem, and
                    William of Malmesbury, of bells given by St Dunstan to the churches in the West.
                    The number of bells in every church gave occasion to the curious and singular
                    architecture which is often found in the campanile or bell-tower; an addition
                    which is more susceptible of the grander beauties of architecture than any other
                    part of the edifice. It was the constant appendage of every parish church
                    belonging to the Saxons, and is distinctly mentioned as such in the laws of
                    Athelstane.</p>
                <p>The Greek Christians are usually said to have been unacquainted with bells till
                    the ninth century, when the construction of these instruments was first taught
                    them by a Venetian; but it is not true that the use of bells was entirely
                    unknown in the ancient eastern churches, and that they called the people to
                    church with wooden mallets. In some learned dissertations on the Greek temples,
                    Leo Allatius proves the contrary from several ancient writers. In his opinion
                    bells first began to be disused after the taking of Constantinople by the Turks;
                    the latter, it seems, having prohibited them lest their sound should disturb the
                    repose of souls wandering in the air. Father Simon, however, thinks that the
                    Turks prohibited the Christians the use of bells from political rather than
                    religious motives; inasmuch as the ringing of bells might serve as a signal for
                    the execution of revolts, insurrections, or popular commotions.</p>
                <p>In the ancient monasteries we. find six kinds of bells enumerated by Durandus,
                    namely, <hi rend="italic">squilla,</hi> rung in the refectory; <hi rend="italic"
                    >cymbalum,</hi> in the cloister; <hi rend="italic">nola,</hi> in the choir; <hi
                    rend="italic">nolula</hi> or <hi rend="italic">dupla,</hi> in the clock; <hi
                    rend="italic">campana,</hi> in the steeple; and <hi rend="italic">signum,</hi>
                    in the tower. Belethus very nearly agrees with Durandus, only for <hi
                    rend="italic">squilla</hi> he puts <hi rend="italic">tintinnabulum,</hi> and
                    places the <hi rend="italic">campana</hi> in the tower, and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Campanella</hi> in the cloister. Others place the <hi rend="italic"
                    >tintinnabulum</hi> or <hi rend="italic">tinniolum</hi> in the refectory or
                    dormitory; and add another bell, called <hi rend="italic">corrigiuncula,</hi>
                    rung at the time of giving discipline, to call the monks to be flogged. The <hi
                    rend="italic">cymbalum</hi> also is sometimes said to have been rung in the
                    cloister, to call the monks to meals.</p>
                <p>From the researches of a writer who has paid particular attention to this
                    subject, we learn that bells frequently bore such inscriptions as the
                    following:</p>
                <lg part="N">
                    <l part="N"> Funera plango, Fulgura frango, Sabatta pango, </l>
                    <l part="N"> Excito lentos, Dissipo ventos, Paco cruentos. </l>
                </lg>
                <p>In the little sanctuary at Westminster, King Edward III. erected a clocher, and
                    placed in it bells for the use of St Stephen’s chapel, round the largest of
                    which were cast in the metal these words:</p>
                <lg part="N">
                    <l part="N"> King Edward made mee thirtie thousand weight and three. </l>
                    <l part="N"> Take me down and wey mee, and more you shall fynd mee. </l>
                </lg>
                <p>But these bells having been ordered to be taken down in the reign of King Henry
                    VIII., some one wrote underneath with a coal:</p>
                <lg part="N">
                    <l part="N"> But Henry the eight </l>
                    <l part="N"> Will bait me of my weight. </l>
                </lg>
                <p>This last distich alludes to a fact mentioned by Stowe in his survey of London,
                    that near to St Paul’s school stood a clocher, in which were four bells called
                    <hi rend="italic">Jesus s Bells,</hi> the greatest in all England, against which
                    Sir Miles Partridge staked a hundred pounds, and won them of King Fienry VIII.
                    at a cast of dice. Nevertheless, in foreign countries there were bells of
                    greater magnitude. In the steeple of the great church at Rouen, in Normandy, was
                    a bell with this inscription:</p>
                <lg part="N">
                    <l part="N"> Je suis George d’Ambois, </l>
                    <l part="N"> Qui trente cinque mille pois. </l>
                    <l part="N"> Mais lui qui me pesera </l>
                    <l part="N"> Trente six mille me trouvera. </l>
                </lg>
                <p>But it was probably destroyed when the greater part of the magnificent edifice
                    containing it was consumed by fire, several years ago. It is a common tradition
                    that the bells of King’s College Chapel, in the university of Cambridge, were
                    brought by Henry V. from some church in France soon after the battle of
                    Agincourt. They were taken down many years ago, and sold to a bell-founder in
                    Whitechapel, who melted them down.</p>
                <p>The various uses of bells were cleverly summed up in the following distich:</p>
                <lg part="N">
                    <l part="N"> Laudo Deum verum, plebem voco, conjugo clerum, </l>
                    <l part="N"> Defunctos ploro, pestem fugo, festa decoro. </l>
                </lg>
                <p>Matthew Pars observes, that anciently the use of bells was prohibited in time of
                    mourning; at present, however, the tolling of them makes one of the principal
                    ceremonies of interment. Mabillon adds, that it was an ancient custom to ring
                    bells for persons about to expire, to advertise the people to pray for them. The
                    passing bell, indeed, was anciently rung for two purposes; one, to bespeak the
                    prayers of all good Christians for a soul just departing; the other, to drive
                    away the evil spirits who were supposed to stand near the bed of the dying, or
                    about the house, ready to seize their prey, or at least to molestand terrify the
                    soul in its passage. By the ringing of the bell,—for Durandus informs us that
                    evil spirits are desperately afraid of bells,—they were kept aloof; and the
                    soul, like a hunted hare, gained the start,yr had what is by sportsmen called
                    <hi rend="italic">law.</hi> This dislike of spirits to bells is mentioned in the
                    <hi rend="italic">Golden Legend</hi> by Wynkyn de Worde. “It is said, the evil
                    spirytes that ben in the regyon of tbayre, doubte moche when they here the
                    belles rongen: and this is the cause why the belles ben rongen when it
                    thondreth, and whan grete tempeste and outrages of wether happen, to the ende
                    that the feinds and wycked spirytes shold be abashed and flee, and cease of the
                    mov∙ ynge of tempeste.” Lobineau observes, that the custom of ringing bells at
                    the approach of thunder is of some antiquity; but that the design was not so
                    much to shake the air, and so dissipate the thunder, as to call the people to
                    church to pray that the parish might be preserved from that terrible meteor.</p>
                <p>In Roman Catholic times bells were baptized and anointed<pb break="no"

                    chrismatis;</hi> they were also exorcised and blessed by the bishop, from a
                    belief that, when these ceremonies were performed, they had power to drive the
                    devil out of the air, to calm tempests, to extinguish fires, and to recreate
                    even the dead. The ritual for these ceremonies is contained in the Roman
                    pontifical; and it was usual in such baptisms to give to bells the name of some
                    saint. In Chauncy’s <hi rend="italic">History of Hertfordshire</hi> there is a
                    relation of the baptism of a set of bells in Italy, which was performed with
                    great ceremony a short time before that book was written. And the bells of the
                    parish church of Winnington, in Bedfordshire, had their names cast about the
                    verge of every one in particular, with these rhyming hexameters:</p>

                <p>By an old chartulary, it appears that the bells of the priory ofLittle Dunmow, in
                    Essex, were, in the year 1501, new-cast, and baptized by the following
                    names:</p>

                <p>The bells of Osney Abbey, near Oxford, which were very famous, had the respective
                    names of Douce, Clement, Austin, Hautecter, or rather Hautcleri, Gabriel, and
                    John.</p>
                <p>Nankin, in China, was anciently celebrated for the largeness of its bells. But
                    their enormous weight brought down the tower which contained them, the whole
                    building fell to ruin, and the bells have ever since lain on the ground. One of
                    these bells is near twelve English feet in height, seven and a half in diameter,
                    and twenty-three in circumference; its figure is almost cylindric, except for a
                    swelling in the middle; and the thickness of the metal about the edges is seven
                    inches. From the dimensions of this bell, its weight is computed at 50,000
                    pounds, which is more than double the weight of that of Erfurt, said by Father
                    Kircher to be the greatest bell in the world. These bells were cast by the first
                    emperor of the preceding dynasty, upwards of 300 years ago. They have each their
                    name, the hanger <hi rend="italic">(tchouif</hi> the eater (c∕ιe), the sleeper
                    <hi rend="italic">(chouιf</hi> the will (<hi rend="subscript"> ι</hi> ∕7).
                    Father le Comte adds, that there are seven other bells in Pekin cast in the
                    reign of Youlo, each of which weighs 120,000 pounds. But the sound of even the
                    largest Chinese bell is very poor, owing to the circumstance of being struck
                    with a wooden instead of an iron clapper.</p>
                <p>The practice of ringing bells in change, or regular peals, is said to be peculiar
                    to England. The custom seems to have commenced in the time of the Saxons, and to
                    have been common before the conquest. The ringing of bells, though a recreation
                    chiefly of the lower sort, is in itself not incurious. The tolling of a bell is
                    nothing more than the producing a sound by a stroke of the clapper against the
                    side of the bell, the bell itself being in a pendant position and at rest. But
                    in ringing, the bell is elevated to a horizontal position, so that, by means of
                    a wheel and a rope, the clapper strikes forcibly on one side as it ascends, and
                    <hi rend="superscript"> 0n</hi> the other side in its return downwards,
                    producing at each stroke a sound. In England, ringing of ∖bells is reduced to a
                    science, and peals have been composed which θ <hi rend="superscript"> 6</hi> ψ
                    <hi rend="superscript"> t,</hi> hθ names of the inventors.</p>
                <p>The music of bells is altogether melody; but the pleasure arising from it
                    consists in the variety of interchange, and the various succession and general
                    predominance of <hi rend="superscript"> le</hi> consonances in the sounds
                    produced. Musical authors seem to have treated but little of this subject.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Electrical</hi><hi rend="italic smallcaps"> Hells</hi> are used
                    in a variety of entertaining experiments by electricians. The apparatus, which
                    is originally of German invention, consists of three small bells suspended from
                    a narrow plate of metal, the two outermost by chains, and that in the middle,
                    from which a chain passes to the floor, by a silken string. Two small knobs of
                    brass are also suspended by silken strings, one on each side of the bell in the
                    middle, which serve for clappers. When this apparatus is connected with an
                    electrified conductor, the outermost bells suspended by the chains will be
                    charged, attract the clappers, and be struck by them. The clappers, becoming
                    electrified, will likewise be repelled by these bells, and attracted by the
                    middle bell, and discharge themselves upon it by means of the chain extending to
                    the floor. After this they will be again attracted by the outermost bells, and
                    thus, by striking the bells alternately <hi rend="superscript"> 7</hi>, occasion
                    a ringing, which may be continued at pleasure. Flashes of light will be seen in
                    the dark between the bells and clappers, and if the electrification be strong,
                    the discharge will be made without actual contact, and the ringing will cease.
                    An apparatus of this kind, connected with one of those conductors which are
                    erected for securing buildings from lightning, will serve to give notice of the
                    approach and passage of an electrical cloud.</p>
