                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra

                <p><label type="entry">BEAUMARCHAIS, <hi rend="smallcaps">Pierre Augustin Caron
                    de</hi></label>, appears to have been one of those persons who, from
                    restlessness of disposition and singularity of character, obtain, in their own
                    age, more celebrity than they are entitled to from their merit or talents. He
                    was born at Paris in 1732, and was the son of a clockmaker, who brought him up
                    to his own trade. From his earliest youth, however, he discovered an inclination
                    for literature, together with a remarkable talent for music. FIis proficiency in
                    this art procured him an introduction to the French court, where he was employed
                    to teach the princesses, daughters of Louis XV., to play on the guitar. At their
                    concerts, which he attended, he became acquainted with the banker Duverney, by
                    whom he was instructed in business, and placed in a situation which was likely
                    to lead to fortune. Beaumarchais first attracted public attention by his drama
                    of <hi rend="italic">Eugenie,</hi> which was published in 17β7; but he was
                    chiefly indebted for the notoriety he obtained to the various law-suits in which
                    he became involved after the death of his patron Duverney. Having commenced an
                    action against the Count de la Blache, the grand-nephew of Duverney, for payment
                    of a trifling balance of an account which was due to him by his deceased patron,
                    and the suit having been removed from Aix to Paris, Μ. Goezman, one of the
                    judges of the parliament of Maupéou, which was then very unpopular in the
                    capital, was appointed to report and decide on its merits. Beaumarchais,
                    suspect-ing<pb break="no" facs="nls:193195542" xml:id="kp-eb0704-5542-0479"/>
                    that he was excluded from the presence of Goezman by the influence of the Count
                    de la Blache, and thus prevented from explaining the merits of his case, bribed
                    certain dependents of the judge in order to be admitted to an interview. The
                    cause, however, was decided against him before he could obtain an audience; and
                    the whole of the bribe not having been returned, a long correspondence took
                    place, by which Goezman was at length so much exasperated, that he instituted a
                    prosecution against Beaumarchais for an attempt to corrupt him in his judicial
                    capacity. Beaumarchais was acquitted of the charge, while Goezman was found
                    liable to him in damages, and was further convicted of subornation and falsehood
                    in his attempts to substantiate the accusation. But the decision against Goezman
                    having been rescinded, and the principal cause remitted to the parliament of
                    Aix, where it had originally depended, Beaumarchais became again involved with
                    the Count de la Blache in a litigation which originated in the calumnies and
                    undue influence by which the count attempted to overpower his adversary. In this
                    dispute, however, Beaumarchais also prevailed; but the chief advantage which he
                    acquired from these various processes was the astonishing interest and
                    admiration which were universally excited in France by the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Pactums</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Mémoires</hi> which he wrote in his defence;
                    in which the most logical and convincing argument is diversified with the
                    bitterest sarcasm, the keenest raillery, and the relation of incidents as
                    strange and amusing as any which are met with in romance. These able and lively
                    productions, however, procured him many enemies, as they discovered him to be a
                    man of a most resentful and calumnious disposition. He also lost a good deal of
                    the reputation he had acquired, from being involved in a new process, in which
                    he found the advocate Bergasse a more formidable opponent than Goezman or La
                    Blache; and his new <hi rend="italic">Mémoires</hi> wanted the spirit and gaiety
                    to which his former ones were indebted for their popularity. Though occupied
                    with these processes and various literary pursuits, Beaumarchais did not neglect
                    the improvement of his fortune. He engaged in various speculations, of which the
                    most profitable was his project of supplying the Americans with arms and
                    ammunition during the war with this country. Having thus gained a considerable
                    fortune, he built a magnificent villa in the Faubourg St Antoine, which he
                    embellished with much taste and at great expense. He afterwards lost some part
                    of the money he had acquired by an expensive and ill-executed edition of the
                    works of Voltaire; and neither the early support which he gave to the principles
                    of the French revolution, nor his importation of fire-arms for the use of the
                    French forces, was sufficient to preserve his property from confiscation, or his
                    person from proscription. The sufferings and dangers which he experienced during
                    this period have been detailed by him m a work entitled <hi rend="italic">Mes
                    Six Epoques,</hi> which is written with considerable force and interest. After
                    he had endured every species of accusation and persecution, and had passed some
                    time as an exile from his native country, he returned to France when the storms
                    of the revolution had subsided into a more settled tyranny; and having recovered
                    possession of his villa in the Faubourg St Antoine, he remained there till his
                    death, which happened suddenly i <hi rend="subscript"> n</hi> the year 1799.</p>
                <p>The moral character of Beaumarchais seems to have been far from unexceptionable.
                    He was remarkable for extraordinary indiscretion, restlessness, and ambition, an
                    overweening conceit of his own talents, and an undisguised contempt for others.
                    With these defects, it is not won-erful that his conduct should have formed the
                    subject of some absurd calumnies. Laharpe mentions that these <hi
                    rend="superscript"> w</hi> θre propagated to such an extent, that it was at one
                    time reported that he had made away by poison with his two wives, whom he had
                    successively married for their fortunes; a report on which Voltaire is said to
                    have remarked, “<hi rend="italic">Ce Beaumarchais n'est point un empoisonneur,
                    il est trop drole”</hi> Even the journey which he undertook to Spain in order to
                    vindicate the honour and secure the happiness of a sister, and which seems to
                    have been the most praiseworthy action of his life, was made the subject of
                    invidious misrepresentations, from which he has vindicated himself in one of his
                    <hi rend="italic">Mémoires</hi> against La Blache and Goezman.</p>
                <p>Besides his <hi rend="italic">Mémoires,</hi> Beaumarchais is the author of
                    various dramatic productions, which made a great noise, and gained him
                    considerable reputation in Paris at the time they appeared. His <hi
                    rend="italic">Eugenie,</hi> of which the plot is founded on a story in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Diable Boiteux,</hi> and his <hi rend="italic">Deux Amis,</hi>
                    which hinges on the embarrassment and perplexity of a merchant on the verge of
                    insolvency, are serious sentimental comedies, written in imitation of Diderot’s
                    <hi rend="italic">Pere de Famille. Eugenie,</hi> which was the most successful
                    of the two, is rather a romance carried on by dialogue than a drama. It
                    possesses little pathos or interest, and the only emotion felt in its perusal is
                    a certain degree of curiosity concerning the event of the story. The incidents
                    in <hi rend="italic">Les Deux Amis</hi> are flat and insipid; and as it is not
                    sustained by the charms of versification, it fails almost entirely in stage
                    effect. Beaumarchais obtained more success in his dramatic career when he
                    quitted the imitation of Diderot, and, following the natural gaiety of his own
                    genius, represented the lively and entertaining character of Figaro in two
                    successive pieces, <hi rend="italic">Le Barbier de Seville,</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">La Folle Journée, ou le Mariage de Figaro.</hi> The first of these
                    comedies merely turns on the assistance which the Count Almaviva receives from
                    Figaro, the <hi rend="italic">Barbier de Seville,</hi> in his stratagem to carry
                    off Rosine by duping an old guardian, by whom she was strictly watched, and who
                    intended to marry her himself. The <hi rend="italic">Mariage de Figaro</hi>
                    principally hinges on the scheme devised by the Count Almaviva for marrying a
                    beautiful attendant of his countess to Figaro, with designs which seem to have
                    been suggested by some scenes in the <hi rend="italic">Casina</hi> of Plautus.
                    Both pieces are full of lively dialogue, dramatic movement, and ingenious <hi
                    rend="italic">jeux de theatre.</hi> The author, however, had at first great
                    difficulty in getting the <hi rend="italic">Mariage de Figaro</hi> represented;
                    and the curiosity and expectation of the public were excited to the highest
                    pitch previously to its appearance. It continued to be acted twice a week for
                    two years, and produced immense profits both to the author and the comedians. To
                    a reader of the present day, the chief interest of the <hi rend="italic">Mariage
                    de Figaro</hi> arises from the distress experienced by the countess on finding
                    herself forsaken by her husband, and the engaging though not very moral
                    character of the page Cherubin; but in France its popularity might be partly
                    owing to the numerous sarcasms both on the political and judicial administration
                    of the country. This was evidently one of the author’s chief objects, as he
                    boasts in his preface, <hi rend="italic">quil a forme son plan de façon a y
                    faire entrer la critique June foule d’abus qui désolent la société.</hi>
                    Beaumarchais has introduced Figaro a third time, in his last drama, <hi
                    rend="italic">La Mere Coupable;</hi> and it is generally supposed that by this
                    character, in all the three dramas, he intended to represent himself. Figaro, it
                    is true, is originally a barber, and afterwards a <hi rend="italic">valet;</hi>
                    but he is also a poet, a musician, and a great intriguer, whilst the freedom
                    which he uses with his master gives full scope for the development of the
                    character. In <hi rend="italic">La Mere Coupable,</hi> he has also introduced,
                    under the name of Begearss, his old opponent the advocate Bergasse. Indeed he
                    says in his preface, <hi rend="italic">Ah! je vous jure que je l’ai vu agir; je
                    n aurais pas pu [inventer.</hi></p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:193195555" xml:id="kp-eb0704-5555-0480"/>
                <p>Most of the plays of Beaumarchais are preceded by prefaces, in which he has
                    vindicated them against objections, and pointed out their beauties; but, as he
                    was not possessed of much learning or taste, his literary pleadings were not so
                    happy as his judicial ones. Indeed the great secret of Beaumarchais’s success
                    was the perceiving and availing himself of the tone and spirit of the times. The
                    vogue in which the <hi rend="italic">Père de Famille</hi> then was, secured
                    applause for his <hi rend="italic">Comedies Larmoyantes.</hi> The unpopularity
                    of a parliament intrusted with the administration of justice procured a
                    favourable reception for his <hi rend="italic">Mémoires;</hi> and the rising
                    clamour against the government of the country gave additional zest to the
                    sarcasms of <hi rend="italic">∖X∖eMarmge de Figaro. Of</hi> consequence,
                    Beaumarchais, during his life, was more celebrated than respectable, and the
                    reputation he enjoyed in his own age was greater than that which he is likely to
                    preserve with posterity. <hi rend="smallcaps">(q.)</hi></p>
