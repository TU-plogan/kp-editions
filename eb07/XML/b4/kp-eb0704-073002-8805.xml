                    significant corrections to the OCR text, predominantly in cases of confusing "c"
                    and "e." Isolates 90 entries that were mistakenly included at the end of prior
                    entries in v1 and v2. Normalizes ordinal numbers. Separates metadata in
                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra
                    space around the <gi>pb</gi> tag. Where a word is hyphenated at a <gi>pb</gi>,

                <p><label type="entry">BOGALCUND</label>, a district of the province of Gundwana in
                    Hindostan, in the 25th degree of north latitude, and 82d of east longitude;
                    bounded on the west by the British possessions in Bundelcund, on the east by the
                    small territory of Man was, and watered by the rivers Soane, Bichanuddy, and
                    Behennuddy.</p>
                <p>The exact dimensions of this country, as far as we know, are not ascertained; but
                    they appear to be considerable.</p>
                <p>Part of it is fertile and well cultivated; the chief crops are wheat, barley, and
                    different kinds of pease, all in tolerable quantity; nevertheless, very little
                    grain exceeding their own necessities is raised by the natives. They have also
                    numerous herds of black cattle, and large flocks of sheep. The whole surface is
                    traversed by good roads. The access from Allahabad, to which it was annexed by
                    Aurungzebe, is by a pass called Sohagee Ghaut, long, steep, and difficult,
                    having at its extremity a redoubt in a strong position. From this point
                    Bogalcund appears like a great table land without any descent, and the traveller
                    is conducted by a good road to the capital.</p>
                <p>Gundwana is inhabited by various tribes, who have received the generic name of
                    Goands. Their manners and civilization are different, and in various stages of
                    advancement; some, particularly the mountaineers, being rude and savage. They go
                    almost naked, if not entirely so; practise gross superstitions; and dwell in
                    villages consisting of a few huts in places almost inaccessible. But those in
                    the lower and fertile parts of the country are more cultivated, and sufficiently
                    courteous to strangers. The inhabitants of Bogalcund are called Bogals,
                    Bogheleis, or Boghels, synonymes used indifferently; but it is not evident
                    whether they should be considered as a distinct race from the Goands of
                    Gundwana. They are reported to have migrated hither from Guzzerat many centuries
                    ago, and, gradually enlarging their confines by an encroachment on those of
                    their neighbours, to have expelled a tribe of mountaineers from Shewah, which
                    their chief was induced, by the excellence of its situation, to select for his
                    own residence. It is not unlikely that they are of Tartar origin. As this is one
                    of the northern countries of India, the history and statistics of which are
                    extremely obscure, very little can be said of the manners, customs, and
                    condition of its inhabitants. They consist of five different tribes,
                    acknowledging the same government, but without admitting an equal control, or
                    paying the like obedience to it. Part, or the whole, profess the Mahommedan
                    religion, and many temples are to be seen in the territory. Three of the tribes
                    follow a practice, too general in the East, of destroying their infant
                    daughters, which must inevitably restrict the population. The Bogals are skilful
                    in agriculture; and they have many fine tanks, or artificial ponds,
                    conveniencies of greater importance in India, and of infinitely larger size,
                    than Europeans are wont to conceive. These are generally situated on a
                    declivity, three sides being built up with much art and labour, ancì the fourth
                    serving asana-tural embankment. The agricultural skill of the inhabitants
                    results, in a great measure, from the nature of the government. Here the feudal
                    system prevails, and many of the lands are held by military tenure. The forces
                    have no pay, but, instead of it, certain lands are assigned for their
                    subsistence. Their influence is thence very great, and there is not an officer
                    among them without one or two villages for his support. The country is thus
                    partitioned among innumerable feudatories, who find it their interest to promote
                    agriculture in order to provide more amply for their own subsistence. It is
                    common with the peasantry to change their abode at intervals of three or four
                    years, for the purpose of tilling the ground whereon their cottages stood. The
                    traces of villages recently abandoned are, therefore, frequently to be seen, and
                    would indicate declining prosperity, did not their renewal in other places, as
                    often presented to view, prove the reverse.</p>
                <p>The chief town of Bogalcund is Rewah, which is large and populous. It is situated
                    on the small river Bichanuddy, rising twenty miles to the east, and joined by
                    the Behennuddy just above the town. The united stream runs immediately under a
                    large fort in the capital, which includes the houses of the most wealthy and
                    respectable inhabι-tants, <pb break="no" facs="nls:193198818"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0704-8818-0731"/>and where the rajah resides. In the neighbourhood
                    are some memorials of the slain, who fell in a great battle, wherein the Bogals
                    were victorious against an invading enemy. Rewah stands in latitude 24. 37. N.
                    and 81. 25. E. longitude; and is distant 126 miles north-east of Benares.</p>
                <p>This district is under the government of an independent rajah, who is said to be
                    the maha-rajah or sovereign of several neighbouring territories; and although
                    the rajah of Bundelcund is himself quite independent, and infinitely the more
                    powerful of the two, it is necessary for him to be invested by the rajah of
                    Bogalcund; which exhibits another analogy to feudal principles. His revenues are
                    very small, principally owing to the subdivisions of the district; for it has
                    sometimes excited astonishment that the sovereign of so fertile a territory
                    should be so poor. He receives an inconsiderable tribute from the rajahs
                    acknowledging his superiority, land-rents, and customs on merchandise passing
                    through the capital.</p>
                <p>Ali Bahauder, a Mahratta chief who held a powerful command in the army of the
                    Peishwa, or head of the nation, threatened Bogalcund with invasion about the
                    year 1794 or 1795, in order to levy contributions from the rajah, which he was
                    little able to afford. But he was beloved by his subjects; and Ali Bahauder
                    having put his menaces in execution, he raised an army of about 3000 men to
                    oppose him. The enemy advanced with 6000 men, overthrowing every thing in his
                    course, until he arrived within two miles of the capital. There he was
                    encountered and totally defeated by the rajah, with the loss of his general and
                    his cannon. The invader vowed to revenge the destruction of this army and the
                    death of his general. He again collected a powerful force, and invaded Bogalcund
                    a second time, in the year 1795; but the rajah, then aged and incapable of the
                    exertion necessary to resist so active an enemy, purchased peace by concessions.
                    Either at this time, or previously, he engaged to pay Ali Bahauder L. 14,500
                    sterling; a stipulation which he found himself totally unable to perform; and a
                    neighbouring rajah, who had become security for the payment, and required
                    hostages for his indemnification, afterwards obtained the cession of a valuable
                    district in Bogalcund, probably from having been obliged to fulfil his part of
                    the engagement. But this was not the only calamity; for a supervening scarcity
                    in the succeeding season followed the depredations of Ali Bahauder’s troops. The
                    natural fertility of the soil, however, and importation of various commodities
                    from Misapour, contributed to relieve the inhabitants, and the country began to
                    recover speedily from the disasters to which it had been exposed. Nevertheless
                    its dismemberment, at no distant period, was anticipated, from the increasing
                    poverty and declining power of the rajah, though the nature of the soil and the
                    state of agriculture were both sufficient to support a numerous population.
                    Formerly, the influence of the rajahs of Bogalcund was very considerable in
                    Indian affairs; and they have been known to afford an asylum to powerful
                    princes, whom temporary adversity exiled from their own dominions. Here the
                    illustrious emperor of the Moguls, Ackbar, was born, in the year 1542. On
                    occasion of a usurpation of the empire, his father, Huma-yoon, retired from
                    Delhi; and his mother, when pregnant, was, for greater security, sent to a
                    strong fortress, where, tradition reports, she was almost immediately taken in
                    labour. But the astrologers of the day having previously determined that future
                    felicity would attend the child who should be born at a certain moment, she was
                    suspended during two hours by the legs, in order to retard the period of
                    delivery, and then being taken down, the great Ackbar saw the light. More
                    recently, when his descendant, Shah Aulum, was dispossessed of the throne of
                    Delhi, in the course oſlast century, by the invasion of another potentate, he
                    sought refuge with Ajut Sing, the rajah of whom we have already spoken; and
                    here, also, between the years 1750 and 1760, one of his wives was delivered of a
                    prince, whom she called Ackbar, in commemoration of his ancestor. (<hi
