                <p><label type="entry">BIGAMY</label> literally signifies being twice married, but
                    with us the term is used as nearly synonymous with polygamy, or having a
                    plurality of wives at once. A second marriage, while the former husband or wife
                    is still living, is simply void, and a mere nullity, by the ecclesiastical law
                    of England; yet the legislature has thought it just to make it felony, by reason
                    of its being so great a violation of the public economy and decency of a
                    well-ordered state. Hence it was enacted by statute 1 Jac. I. c. 12, that if any
                    person being married, do afterwards marry agaifi, the for mer husband or wife
                    being alive, it is felony, but within <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> the benefit
                    of clergy. The first wife in this case cannot be admitted as an evidence against
                    her husband, because she ıŝ the true wife; but the second may, for she indeed is
                    no wife at all; and so, <hi rend="italic">vice versa,</hi> of a second husband.
                    This act makes an exception to five cases, in which such second marriage,'though
                    in the first three' it is void, is yet’ no felony. 1. Where’ either party has
                    been continually abroad for severi years, whether the' party in England has
                    notice of the other’s being alive or not. 2. Where either of the parties has
                    been absent from the .other seven years within this kingdom, and the remaining
                    party has had' no knowledge of the other’s being alive within that time. 3.
                    Where there'iš a divorce, or separation <hi rend="italic">a mensa et toro,</hi>
                    by sentence in <hi rend="superscript">!</hi> the ecclesiastical court 4. Where
                    the first marriage is declared absolutely void by any such sentence, and the
                    parties are loosed <hi rend="italic">a vinculo matrimonii.</hi><hi
                    rend="superscript"> 0</hi> ∙ Where either of the' parties was under the aġe of
                    con-sθnt'at the time of the first marriage; in which case the first marriage was
                    voidable by the disagreement of either P <hi rend="superscript"> ar</hi> ty, and
                    th⅛ the^ second, mårrííige clearly amounts" to.</p>
                <p>But if at the age of consent the parties had agreed to the marriage, which
                    completes the contract, and indeed constitutes the real marriage, and if one of
                    them should afterwards marry again, the other being still alive, Blackstone
                    apprehends that such second marriage would be within the reason and penalties of
                    the act.</p>
                <p>In Scotland this offence has been viewed in a light somewhat different. At the
                    date of our only statute respecting bigamy, that of 1551, c∙ 19, the offence
                    seems to have been chiefly considered in a religious point of view, as a sort of
                    perjury, or violation of the solemn vow or oath which was then used in
                    contracting marriage; and, accordingly, it was ordained to be punished with the
                    proper pains of perjury. But this injunction has not in every instance been
                    complied with; and, from considerations of policy or expediency, the court has
                    long been in use to inflict an arbitrary punishment, suited, as nearly as may
                    be, to the degree and measure of guilt brought home to the prisoner. The most
                    important point concerning the description of bigamy which is the contracting of
                    a second marriage during the subsistence of the first, relates to the quality of
                    the two marriages, and involves the nice and delicate inquiry whether both must
                    be marriages by formal celebration, or whether the charge will lie although both
                    or one of them be contracted in that loose and unceremonious fashion which is
                    sustained, in single cases, by the law and custom of Scotland. And here it may
                    be observed, in the first place, that from the general strain and language of
                    the statute above referred to, which passed at a time when there was no marriage
                    without formal celebration, the presumption appears to be in favour of the more
                    lenient opinion; and this is further confirmed by the circumstance that the
                    application of the pains of perjury to this offence seems plainly to presuppose
                    the contempt of a solemn oath or vow, and a gross abuse of the service of the
                    church. The most favourable case for the offender, therefore, is that where both
                    connections are of this loose and ambiguous character, as by promise and <hi
                    rend="italic">copula,</hi> courtship and acknowledgements, or the like: for here
                    it may be urged that there has been no solemn entry into the holy state of
                    matrimony, and no prostitution of religious ceremonies or ecclesiastical
                    ministrations; and that circumstances which may be held relevant in a civil
                    question of <hi rend="italic">status,</hi> if consisting merely of probabilities
                    and presumptions of law, cannot afford that full and decisive proof of <hi
                    rend="italic">dole,</hi> or of a settled purpose to marry and betray, without
                    which there ought to be no conviction of the crime of bigamy. Secondly, although
                    this argument does not fully apply to the case of one who, after having duly
                    solemnized a marriage, betakes himself to some clandestine and' irregular
                    connection; yet it may still be argued, that, as he knew himself to be already
                    married, and, consequently for the time incapable of contracting a second,
                    marriage, so it ought to be presumed in his favour as long as it reasonably can,
                    and until he take the decisive step of again undergoing the ceremony, that he
                    had no abusive or deceitful purpose in view, but merely intended an intercourse
                    of a different sort, highly immoral in itself, but by no means tantamount to the
                    celebration of a second marriage. Thirdly, a more unfavourable case than either
                    of the former is that of a regular marriage subsequently to some clandestine
                    connection; yet even here it is doubtful whether we have got the proper
                    materials of the crime <hi rend="subscript"> t</hi> of bigamy. For, in those
                    anomalous situations where the female has not been in possession of the repute
                    and status of a married woman, but is merely a claimant or pretender to that
                    character, it may be exceedingly doubtful whether, after all, the man intended
                    to marry, notwithstanding what the civil court may have found; and, while such a
                    doubt exists, it” may deserve consideration whether the <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193197609" xml:id="kp-eb0704-7609-0638"/>party can be reasonably and
                    consistently held to have committed the particular crime contemplated by the
                    law. But this will scarcely apply to the case where, instead of a secret and
                    ambiguous intercourse, the woman has been supposed and held to have been in the
                    full and continued enjoyment, not only of that degree of repute which a civil
                    court might possibly sustain as sufficient to entitle her to the legal character
                    and privileges of a wife, but of that public and invariable character which
                    prevents any doubt being raised as to the understood relation of the parties. So
                    much for the form of the two marriages. The other qualities which must unite in
                    the first marriage to bring it under the safeguard of the law are, 1. That it
                    must be a lawful marriage, such as has not been contracted in contempt of any
                    injunctions of law relative to proximity of kindred or previous conviction of
                    adultery; and, 2. That it be not only a lawful, but a subsisting marriage, the
                    parties living together lawfully married and undivorced. In every case the
                    second marriage is null from being contracted during the subsistence of a
                    previous one; and if it be also an incestuous, adulterous, or otherwise
                    forbidden marriage, this additional aggravation cannot alter the character or
                    shelter from the pains of the crime of bigamy. Further, it is obvious that,
                    according to the circumstances of the case, the guilt of this offence may either
                    be chargeable exclusively against one of the parties, in whose person there is a
                    double marriage; or it may be the common guilt of both the parties to the second
                    marriage, although to one of them it may be a first marriage. (Hume’s <hi
