                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra

                <p><label type="entry">BALANCE</label>, a machine for ascertaining the weight of
                    substances. There are several kinds of balances, as the common balance or
                    scales, the steelyard, the Danish or Swedish balance, the Chinese balance, the
                    hydrostatic balance, &amp;c. The same name is also given to certain kinds of
                    apparatus employed for measuring or comparing the intensities of very small
                    forces, as the balance of torsion, the electric balance, &amp;c.</p>
                <p>The common balance, which is of the most extensive use in the affairs of life, as
                    well as in the arts and experimental<pb break="no" facs="nls:193193267"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0704-3267-0304"/> physics, consists of a beam, AB (fig. 1, Plate
                    CIII.), supported in the middle by a fulcrum or prop C, round which it turns
                    freely, and having a scale or dish attached to each of its extremities A, B, one
                    of which holds the weight, and the other the substance to be weighed. The
                    balance, therefore, in reference to the mechanical powers, is a lever of the
                    first kind; that is to say, having the fulcrum placed between the power and the
                    weight to be raised; hence its theory is easily deduced from the statical
                    properties of the lever. Let P represent the weight in the scale D, and Q that
                    in E; then (supposing AB an inflexible straight line without weight), when AB
                    becomes stable in the horizontal position, or when P <hi rend="italic"
                    >balances</hi> Q, the condition of equilibrium is expressed by the equation</p>
                <p>P×AC = Q× BC.</p>
                <p>In order, therefore, that the two bodies P and Q may have precisely the same
                    weight, or both exert the same force in turning the beam about its axis of
                    motion, it is indispensable that the two points of suspension A and B be exactly
                    equidistant from the fulcrum C.</p>
                <p>When the two arms of the balance are not exactly of the same length, it is
                    obvious that the two weights P and Q, which, in the case of equilibrium, are
                    reciprocally as CA and CB, must also be unequal, in order that the foregoing
                    equation may still be true. If, for example, AC is longer than CB, then a less
                    weight in D will balance a greater in E; and it is on this principle that false
                    balances are constructed. The fraud, however, may be easily detected by
                    transferring the weights P and Q, to the opposite scales; for then the less
                    weight P being attached to the shorter arm CB, the product P × CB will be
                    smaller than Q × CA, and the equilibrium consequently destroyed.</p>
                <p>It may be remarked, that the true weight of a body may easily be found by means
                    of a false balance of this kind. It is only necessary to weigh the body first in
                    the one scale and then in the other, and the true weight will be a mean
                    proportional between the two weights thus indicated. To demonstrate this
                    property, let <hi rend="italic">w</hi> be the true weight of the body in grains,
                    and suppose that when placed in the scale E it balances <hi rend="italic">p</hi>
                    grains in D, and that when transferred to D it balances <hi rend="italic">q</hi>
                    grains in E, and makes <hi rend="italic">m</hi> = AC, <hi rend="italic">η =</hi>
                    BC; by the statical property of the lever we have the two equations, <hi

                    superscript"> 11</hi> so that w is a mean proportional between <hi rend="italic"
                    >p</hi> and <hi rend="italic">q,</hi> and is consequently found by multiplying
                    those numbers together, and extracting the square root of their product.</p>
                <p>In what precedes, the beam has been regarded as an inflexible rod devoid of
                    weight; but in order to investigate fully the properties of the instrument, and
                    the conditions that must be fulfilled in order to render it practically useful,
                    it is necessary to have regard to the weight of the beam, and the position of
                    its centre of gravity in respect of the axis of motion. The great requisites of
                    a good balance are sensibility and stability; that is to say, it ought to be
                    such that a very small weight added to either scale disturbs the equilibrium,
                    and causes the beam to deviate sensibly from the horizontal position; and also
                    such, that when the equilibrium has been disturbed, it may return quickly to a
                    state of rest. In order to discover the construction best adapted to confer
                    these two properties, it is convenient to regard the beam as a bent lever. Let G
                    (fig. 2) be the centre of gravity of the beam, 0 the middle point of the
                    straight line joining the points of suspension A and B, H' H a horizontal
                    straight line drawn through C, and GD, OE, BH, AH', perpendiculars to H'H.
                    Make</p>
                <p>W = weight of beam,</p>
                <p>L = weight of scales with their load, P = the preponderating weight, <hi
                    rend="italic">&lt;ρ =.</hi> COE = BOK = angle of inclination.</p>
                <p>The condition of equilibrium is now</p>
                <p>L.CE +W.CD = P.CH <hi rend="subscript"> 5</hi> whence, since CH = EH — EC = OK —
                    EC, L.OC sin. <hi rend="italic">φ</hi> + W.GC sin. p = P.OB cos. <hi
                    rend="italic">φ—</hi> P.OCsin. ß; therefore, εin. <hi rend="italic">ţ&gt;</hi>
                    [(L + P) . OC + W.GC] = P.OBcos.¢; sin. <hi rend="italic">φ _</hi> P.OB</p>

                <p>From this equation it appears that, for any given value of P, the tangent of the
                    angle of inclination, which measures the sensibility of the balance, is directly
                    as the length of the beam, inversely as the weights of the beam and load, and
                    also inversely as the distances of G and 0 from the axis. The sensibility is
                    therefore greatest when the quantity (L + P) . OC + W . CG is the least
                    possible. On the other hand, when P = 0, the stability, or the force acting to
                    restore the beam to the horizontal position, is sin. <hi rend="italic">φ</hi> [L
                    . OC -fW. CG], which will be diminished by diminishing the value of L . OC + W.
                    CG.</p>
                <p>In what precedes we have supposed the points G andθ both to fall below the centre
                    of the motion C; but the balance may be constructed so that one or both of these
                    points shall coincide with C, or fall above it. Suppose, in the first place, the
                    arms to be bent upwards, so that 0 falls above the fulcrum, while G remains
                    below it. In this case the measure of stability is sin. <hi rend="italic"
                    >&lt;ρ</hi> (W.CG — L.OC), whence it appears that a balance of this sort can
                    only be used for small weights; for if the load is increased till L.OC becomes
                    equal to W.CG, the balance has no restoring power, and is indifferent to any
                    position. If L.OC exceeds W.CG, it would entirely upset by the slightest
                    deviation from the horizontal position.</p>
                <p>Suppose next that the centre of gravity G falls above the fulcrum, 0 remaining
                    below it. The measure of stability now becomes sin. <hi rend="italic">φ</hi>
                    (L.OC — W.CG), and consequently the balance is only useful for heavy weights;
                    for as L.OC is diminished, the stability is lessened, and when L.OC is equal to
                    or less than W.CG, the balance is useless. Hence it appears that when either of
                    the points G, 0, falls above C, the balance can only be employed in particular
                    cases.</p>
                <p>Let the point G coincide with C, and 0 fall below it. In this case CG vanishes,
                    and the measure of stability becomes sin. <hi rend="italic">φ</hi> L.OC, which,
                    for any given value of p, increases with the load, or the weight of the
                    substance to be weighed. A balance of this sort would be unfit for weighing
                    small bodies on account of its want of stability, though it might be used in the
                    estimation of great weights.</p>
                <p>Lastly, let 0 coincide with C, while G falls below the axis. The three points of
                    action A, C, B, are now arranged in a straight line, and the measure of
                    stability is sin. ç W. CG, which is constant for a given value of <hi
                    rend="italic">φ.</hi> The restoring force is therefore independent of the load
                    in the scales, so that a balance of this sort can be employed in all cases,
                    whether the weights are great or small; and as it is easy, diminishing W and CG,
                    to give it any required degree of sensibility, it is this form that ought to be
                    adopted in every case where great precision and accuracy are necessary.</p>
                <p>Another reason for this disposition of the three points of action in a straight
                    line is, that unless C is in the same straight line with A and B, an equilibrium
                    will subsist between two unequal weights when AB is not exactly horizontal. In
                    fact, since the weights P, Q, suspended from A and B, act in the direction
                    perpendicular to H'H, the moments<pb break="no" facs="nls:193193280"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0704-3280-0305"/> of these weights, or their energies in turning
                    the beam round its axis, are respectively P × CH', and Q × CH; therefore, when
                    BCH is a greater angle than ACH', and the line CH consequently less than CH', a
                    smaller weight at A will balance a greater at B, and the beam remain at rest
                    though loaded with unequal weights. It is hence important, in all accurate
                    weighing, to make certain that when the equilibrium takes place, the line AB is
                    exactly horizontal.</p>
                <p>Having determined from theory the conditions that ouθ <hi rend="superscript">
                    -</hi> ht to be observed in the construction of the balance, we shall now
                    proceed to give a brief description of the instrument as it is constructed for
                    assaying or other delicate purposes. In the first place, the beam ought to be as
                    light as possible, consistently with its perfect inflexibility; for it is
                    evident that the friction of the axis will be increased with its weight, and the
                    sensibility proportionally diminished. To combine the qualities of lightness and
                    inflexibility, it is found most advantageous to form the arms of the balance of
                    two hollow cones of brass, very thin, but strengthened and inflexible by means
                    of circular rings driven into them at proper intervals. In order to diminish as
                    much as possible the extent of the surfaces in contact, the axis is formed of
                    two sharp edges of tempered steel, lying in the same straight line, and
                    supported on two planes of steel, agate, or crystal, finely polished, and placed
                    with the greatest precision, in the same horizontal plane. In a balance made by
                    the celebrated Troughton, the sharp edges are ground on the lower side of a
                    cylinder of steel, which crosses the beam in the middle, and they extend over
                    the agate planes about 2 <hi rend="superscript"> j</hi> θth of an inch. The
                    angle of the edges is about 30°. The suspension at the extremities of the beam
                    ought also to be made by sharp, edges, crossing each other at right angles; and
                    in order to obviate any risk of displacement, the edges may be concave, those
                    formed in the beam being sharp upwards, and the others, to which the scales are
                    attached, being sharp downwards. The horizontality of the beam is usually
                    indicated by a slender pointed rod called the <hi rend="italic">tongue</hi> of
                    the balance, rising perpendicularly above the beam, and passing through the
                    centres of gravity and motion. A divided ivory scale, placed contiguous to it,
                    shows deviations of the tongue from the perpendicular, and renders sensible the
                    slightest motion of the beam. In some balances the tongue is placed below the
                    beam, pointing downwards, in order to diminish the volume of instrument. But the
                    preferable method is to bring the arms themselves to terminate in sharp points,
                    and place a divided scale behind each. By this means the tongue is rendered
                    unnecessary, and any flexure of the beam immediately becomes evident. Care must
                    be taken that the zeros of the two scales be placed exactly in the same level.
                    The points of suspension at the extremities of the arms ought to be adjustable
                    both horizontally and vertically; horizontally, for the purpose of giving the
                    two arms exactly the same length; and vertically, in order to bring the three
                    points of action into a straight line. A nut or bob, formed of some heavy
                    substance, placed near the middle of the beam (in the interior of the cylinder
                    if it be hollow), and capable of being raised or lowered by a screw, serves to
                    increase or diminish the distance of the centre of gravity of the beam from the
                    axis of motion, and consequently to accelerate or retard the oscillations at
                    pleasure. Two supporters, the upper ends of,which are formed into angles, are
                    placed under the b(⅛m. These, being raised by means of a screw, lift the beam
                    from the supporting planes, and relieve the sharp edges when the balance is not
                    in use. If the arms of the balance are hollow, this object may be accomplished
                    with less risk by placing the supporters under the extremities of the cross
                    steel bar on which the sharp edges are formed. Props should also be placed under
                    the scales while loading or unloading them; and care taken to confine the
                    oscillations within narrow limits, or prevent the beam from deviating much from
                    the horizontal position, by which the points of action might be endangered. The
                    sensibility, as we have seen, increases with the length of the beam; but the
                    liability to flexure also increases in the same proportion: and the arms of a
                    balance, such as has been described, cannot, perhaps, safely exceed nine or ten
                    inches. When great delicacy is required, the apparatus must be protected from
                    the disturbing influences of currents of air, by being inclosed within a glass
                    case, having doors at the ends for the convenience of loading and unloading the
                    scales.</p>
                <p>Fig. 3, Plate CIII. represents a balance by Fortin, a celebrated mechanician of
                    Paris. The beam is made of tempered steel, and the arms slightly bent, so that
                    all the parts of action may be situated in the same plane, and the centre of
                    gravity fall a little below the axis of motion, which is here under the beam.
                    The planes of support are of steel, and highly polished. The suspension at the
                    extremities of the arms is represented by fig. 4.</p>
                <p>With a balance of great sensibility, weighing is not only a delicate, but also
                    tedious operation. When the adjustments are all perfect, and the beam nearly
                    poised, the oscillations should be extremely' slow and regular, and extend to
                    equal distances on each side of the zero of the scale. In fact, it is by the
                    equality of the excursions of the index from zero that the horizontality of the
                    beam must be inferred; for a very long time would elapse before the oscillations
                    entirely cease. The sensibility of a balance constructed with the requisite
                    care, according to the principles above explained, is very great. Those of
                    Fortin of Paris have been found to oscillate by the addition of a single
                    milligramme, when loaded with a weight of 1000 grammes in each scale; so that
                    the weight is indicated to the millionth part. A balance constructed by the late
                    Mr Ramsden, for the Royal Society of London, is said to vibrate with the
                    seven-millionth part of its load. In general, however, no such exactness can be
                    hoped for; and even when the greatest precautions are taken, and the most
                    delicate instruments employed, it would seldom be safe to vouch for the truth of
                    any figure carried beyond the fourth decimal.</p>
                <p>But notwithstanding the high state of perfection to which the mechanical arts
                    have arrived, the mathematical equality of the length of the arms, and their
                    symmetry in respect of the axis of motion, can never be practically attained; it
                    is therefore desirable to have the means of obtaining results in as great a
                    degree as possible independent of such extreme precision. The following method
                    of weighing, ascribed by the French writers to Borda, gives results not affected
                    by the inequality of the arms, or other imperfections to which the balance is
                    principally subject, and ought to be practised whenever very great accuracy is
                    necessary. Let the body to be weighed, which we shall call P, be placed in the
                    scale A, and for a counterpoise put into the scale B, substances of any sort,
                    for instance bits of copper, lead, wire, or even chips of paper, added in small
                    quantities till the beam becomes perfectly horizontal, which is known by the
                    index pointing to zero. This being done, remove gently the body P from A, and
                    substitute for it known weights, as grains and fractions of a grain, till the
                    equilibrium is restored, and the index again settles at zero. Now it is evident
                    that the weights in A, having been placed exactly in the same circumstances with
                    the body P, and producing equally with it an equilibrium with the loaded scale
                    B, must be the exact equivalent or weight of P. In fact, the accuracy of this
                    nrocess can only be affected by two circumstances; the <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193193293" xml:id="kp-eb0704-3293-0306"/>first is, the friction of the
                    axis, or the want of sensibility in the balance; and the second is, a change of
                    position in the point of suspension. Unless the points of suspension are
                    identical in both operations, the weights which successively produce equilibrium
                    with B will not be exactly equal; for even if no change takes place in the
                    length of the arm, the friction developed at the new points of contact will have
                    a different value, and consequently require a different force to overcome it.
                    The chief objects to be attended to, therefore, in practising the method of
                    double weighing, are, that the mode of contact may receive no change during the
                    loading and unloading of the scales; and that the friction may be reduced to its
                    least possible value by giving the finest polish to the edges, as well as the
                    plane of support.</p>
                <p>With regard to the weights that ought to be employed, it may be sufficient to
                    state, that, in delicate weighing, and for philosophical purposes, they are
                    usually reckoned by Troy grains. The geometrical series 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, &amp;c.
                    offers one considerable advantage, namely, that a smaller number of weights is
                    required than when any other system is adopted; but it would, perhaps, be more
                    convenient in practice to follow the decimal division, and use weights of the
                    following values: 1, 2, 3, 4, &amp;c.; 10, 20, 30, 40, &amp;c.; 100, 200, 300,
                    400, &amp;c.; 1000, 2000, 3000, 4000, &amp;c., up to 9000; and ∙1, ∙2, ∙3, ∙4,
                    &amp;c.; ∙01, ∙02, ∙03, 0*4, &amp;c.; ∙001, •002, Ό03, ∙004, &amp;c. By this
                    means the trouble of adding would be entirely avoided, and the number of weights
                    in the scale would equal the digits in the number by which the grains are
                    expressed. Thus a load of 735∙4 grains would be counterpoised by weights of 700
                    grains, 30 grains, 5 grains, and 4-10ths of a grain.</p>

                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Steelyard</hi> is a balance by which the weights of bodies
                    are estimated by means of a single weight. This machine, which is represented by
                    fig. 5, is likewise a lever of the first kind, having two unequal arms. The load
                    L to be weighed is suspended from the extremity of the short arjn CA, and the
                    counterpoise or constant weight P is movable along CB. Divisions traced on CB
                    indicate the weight of L corresponding to each of the positions of P. In the
                    East, where the steelyard is much in use, the standard weight P is generally
                    made to resemble a pomegranate in shape; whence the instrument acquired the name
                    of <hi rend="italic">Pomman,</hi> and from this circumstance it has frequently
                    but erroneously been denominated the <hi rend="italic">Roman</hi> balance or <hi
                    rend="italic">Statera.</hi></p>
                <p>To find the points of division of the arm CB, let W be the weight of the bar AB,
                    exclusive of L and P; and let <hi rend="italic">p</hi> be the weight in pounds
                    of the body L. Let CA = <hi rend="italic">l,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">x</hi>
                    be the unknown distance of the centre of gravity of the beam from the fulcrum C.
                    Then, carrying P along the arm CB till the beam is horizontal, let A <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 1</hi> be the point at which P rests, and put CA <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 1</hi> = X <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi>. Now, the beam is kept
                    in equilibrium by its own weight acting at the centre of gravity <hi
                    rend="italic">x,</hi> and by the weights <hi rend="italic">p</hi> and P acting
                    respectively at A and A <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi>; therefore the condition of
                    equilibrium is expressed by the equation</p>
                <p>Wa&gt;+ <hi rend="subscript"> y</hi> √+ PX <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> =0.</p>
                <p>Let another weight <hi rend="italic">p,</hi> equal to the former, be suspended
                    from A, and let A <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> be the position of P when the
                    equilibrium is restored. Make CA <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> = X <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 2</hi>, and the above equation now becomes</p>
                <p>Wae+ <hi rend="italic">2pld</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> r</hi> PX <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 2</hi> = 0.</p>
                <p>In this manner, by the successive addition of equal weights <hi rend="italic"
                    >p</hi> to A, the following system of equations is formed:</p>
                <p>Wae÷ jnZ⅛PX <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> =0 Wx÷ 2τ√+ PX <hi rend="subscript">
                    2</hi> = 0 Wae + 3, t√+ PX~ =0</p>
                <p>W <hi rend="italic">X + npl</hi> + PX <hi rend="subscript"> w</hi> = 0.</p>
                <p>By subtracting the first of these equations from the second, the second from the
                    third, and so on, we have <hi rend="subscript"> jt</hi>,Z÷P(X <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 2</hi>-X <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi>) = 0 <hi rend="italic"

                    y&gt;Z + P (X <hi rend="subscript"> 4</hi> — X <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi>) =
                    0</p>
                <p><hi rend="subscript"> 7</hi> &gt;Z+P(X <hi rend="subscript"> w</hi>-X <hi
                    rend="subscript"> w</hi>- <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi>) = 0.</p>
                <p>The successive differences X <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> — X <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 1</hi>, X <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi> — X <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 2</hi>, &amp;c. are therefore constant, each being equal to
                    the constant quan- <hi rend="italic">υl</hi> tity ψ-. The divisions of the arm
                    CB may therefore be found as follows:</p>
                <p>Having suspended the given weight <hi rend="italic">p</hi> from the extremity of
                    the shorter arm CA, find the point A <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> at which it is
                    necessary to place P in order that the beam may be horizontal. Then, having
                    removed <hi rend="italic">ρ,</hi> substitute for it another weight, which is an
                    exact multiple of <hi rend="italic">p,</hi> as <hi rend="italic">ηρ,</hi> and
                    let P be moved toward C till the equilibrium is restored, <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >A</hi><hi rend="subscript smallcaps"> m</hi> being the point where P is now
                    placed. Divide the distance A <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> A <hi
                    rend="subscript"> n</hi> into <hi rend="italic">n —</hi> 1 equal parts, and the
                    points of division will be respectively those at which P will balance the
                    intermediate weights between <hi rend="italic">p</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >np.</hi> If, therefore, each of those points is marked with the corresponding
                    value of <hi rend="italic">p,</hi> the weight of any body whatever suspended
                    from A will be indicated by the number of the division at which P rests when the
                    beam is horizontal. The distances A <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> A <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 2</hi>, A <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> A <hi rend="subscript">
                    3</hi>, &amp;c. may be divided into tenths, or other fractional parts.</p>
                <p>For weighing heavy loads the steelyard is a convenient instrument; but for small
                    weights it is not susceptible of so much accuracy as the common balance. The
                    pressure on the fulcrum, and consequently the friction, is greater, when the
                    commodities to be weighed are less than the constant weight P, and the
                    subdivision of the arm cannot be effected with the same precision as that of
                    weights for the balance. It may be proper, however, to remark, that the
                    instrument ought to be constructed so that the constant centres C and A may be
                    in the same straight line with the divisions of the beam, and that the centre of
                    gravity of the unloaded beam, when placed horizontally, shall be in the vertical
                    passing through C, and a little below that point, as in the common balance. An
                    index or tongue shows when the beam takes the horizontal situation.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Chinese Balance</hi> is a sort of steelyard for weighing
                    small commodities, formed of a slender tapering rod of wood or ivory, about a
                    foot in length, perforated generally with four holes through which silk threads
                    are passed, to serve as so many points of support. Four different sets of
                    divisions are marked on the corresponding sides of the rod; and when any thing
                    is to be weighed, the rod is held up by one of the strings, and a sliding weight
                    of about 1∣ ounce Troy employed as a counterpoise to the substance, which is
                    placed in a small scale suspended from the extremity of the shorter arm. The
                    position of the standard weight indicates the weight of the substance, as in the
                    ordinary steelyard.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Danish</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Swedish Balance,</hi>
                    which is commonly employed in many parts of the north of Europe for weighing
                    coarse commodities, is of a very simple construction. It consists usually of a
                    batten of hard wood, having a heavy lump A (fig. 6) fixed at one end, and a
                    swivel hook at the other. The goods to be weighed are fixed to the hook, and the
                    whole is suspended in a loop of whipcord C, in which the rod is slid backward
                    and forward <pb break="no" facs="nls:193193306" xml:id="kp-eb0704-3306-0307"
                    />till the equilibrium is established. The weight of the ' load L is determined
                    by the position of the loop on a scale of divisions, which may be formed in the
                    following manner. .</p>
                <p>Let 0 be the centre of gravity of the beam and the attached weight at A, W their
                    weight, L the load to be weighed, and make BO == <hi rend="italic">a,</hi> BC =
                    <hi rend="italic">x.</hi> The equation of <hi rend="superscript"> 0</hi> Wα</p>
                <p>equilibrium is <hi rend="italic">Lx = W (a — x),</hi> whence <hi rend="italic"
                    >x</hi> = jyq—çŷ. Now, if we suppose <hi rend="italic">a</hi> to be 30 inches, W
                    = 2 lbs., and substitute for L the numbers 1, 2, 3, &amp;c. successively, we
                    shall have the following values of <hi rend="italic">x:</hi></p>
                <p>When L = 1, <hi rend="italic">x =</hi> 20 inches</p>
                <p>L “2, <hi rend="italic">X —</hi> 15 L — 3, <hi rend="italic">X =</hi> 12 *</p>
                <p>L = 4, <hi rend="italic">X =</hi> 10</p>
                <p>&amp;c.</p>
                <p>A balance constructed in this manner is obviously susceptible of very little
                    accuracy.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Bent Lever Balance,</hi> which is represented by fig. 7, is
                    sometimes employed for expedition in the coarser processes of weighing. To one
                    extremity of a bent lever ACB, is attached a constant weight B, which acts as a
                    counterpoise to the load placed in the scale suspended from A. Through C, the
                    point of support, draw the horizontal line DE, and through A and B the
                    perpendiculars AD, BE, meeting DE in D and E. Now the equilibrium will take
                    place when CE is to CD as the load at A to the constant weight B; and if the
                    arms are bent so that the lines joining CA and CB are at right angles, then as B
                    moves upward, its momentum increases in proportion to the sine of the arc it
                    describes, while the momentum at B decreases in proportion to the cosine of a
                    similar arc. The weight on A corresponding to any position of B, may therefore
                    be expressed on a graduated circular scale placed behind the index at B.
                    Theoretically considered, the range of this balance is very considerable; but
                    the indications are little to be depended on when B approaches either the
                    perpendicular or the horizontal line passing through C.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Hydrostatic Balance</hi> is an instrument contrived for
                    weighing bodies in water, and thereby determining their specific gravities.</p>
                <p>It is constructed in various forms; but we shall content ourselves here with
                    describing that which appears of all others the most accurate. VCG (fig. 8) is
                    the stand or pillar of this hydrostatic balance, which is to be fixed in a
                    table. From the top A hangs, by two silk strings, the horizontal bar BB, from
                    which is suspended, by a ring <hi rend="italic">i,</hi> the fine beam of a
                    balance <hi rend="italic">b,</hi> which is prevented from descending too low on
                    either side by the gently springing piece <hi rend="italic">txyz,</hi> fixed on
                    the support M. The harness is an- ∏ulated at <hi rend="italic">o,</hi> to show
                    distinctly the perpendicular position of the examen, by the small pointed index
                    fixed above it.</p>
                <p>The strings by which the balance is suspended, passing over two pulleys, one on
                    each side of the piece at A, go down to the bottom on the other side, and are
                    hung over the hook at <hi rend="italic">v;</hi> which hook, by means of a screw
                    P, is movable about one inch and a quarter backward and forward, and therefore
                    the balance may be raised or depressed so much. But if a greater elevation or
                    depression be required, the sliding piece S, which carries the screw P, is
                    readily moved to any part of the square brass rod VK, and fixed by means of a
                    screw.</p>
                <p>The motion of the balance being thus adjusted, the rest of the apparatus is as
                    follows. HH is a small board, fixed upon the piece D, under the scales <hi
                    rend="italic">d</hi> and <hi rend="italic">e,</hi> and is movable up and down in
                    a low slit in the pillar above C, and fastened at any part by a screw behind.
                    From the point in the middle of the bottom of each scale hangs, by a fine hook,
                    a brass wire <hi rend="italic">ad</hi> and <hi rend="italic">ac.</hi> These pass
                    throug⅛ two holes <hi rend="italic">m, m,</hi> in the table. To the wire <hi
                    rend="italic">ad</hi> is suspended a cylindric wire <hi rend="italic">rs,</hi>
                    perforated at each end for that purpose. This wire <hi rend="italic">rs</hi> is
                    covered with paper, graduated by equal divisions, and is about five inches
                    long.</p>
                <p>In the corner of the board at E is fixed a brass tube, on which a round wire <hi
                    rend="italic">hl</hi> is so adapted as to move neither too tight nor too free,
                    by its flat head I. Upon the lower part of this moves another tube Q, which has
                    sufficient friction to make it remain in any position required. To this is fixed
                    an index T, moving horizontally when the wire <hi rend="italic">hl</hi> is
                    turned about, and therefore may be easily set to the graduated wire <hi
                    rend="italic">rs.</hi> To the low er end of the wire <hi rend="italic">rs</hi>
                    hangs a weight L; and to that a wire <hi rend="italic">pn,</hi> with a small
                    brass ball <hi rend="italic">g</hi> about one fourth of an inch diameter. On the
                    other side, to the wire <hi rend="italic">ac,</hi> hangs a large glass bubble R,
                    by a horse hair.</p>
                <p>Let us first suppose the weight L taken away, and the wire <hi rend="italic"
                    >pn</hi> suspended from S; and, on the other side, let the bubble R be taken
                    away, and the weight F suspended at <hi rend="italic">c</hi> in its room. This
                    weight F we suppose to be sufficient to keep the several parts hanging to the
                    other scale in equilibrium; at the same time that the middle point of the wire
                    <hi rend="italic">pn</hi> is at the surface of the water in the vessel 0. The
                    wire <hi rend="italic">pn</hi> is to be of such a size that the length of one
                    inch shall weigh four grains.</p>
                <p>Now, it is evident, since brass is eight times heavier than water, that for every
                    inch the wire sinks in the water it will become half a grain lighter, and half a
                    grain heavier for every inch it rises out of the water: consequently, by sinking
                    two inches below the middle point, or rising two inches above it, the wire will
                    become one grain ' lighter or heavier. Therefore if, when the middle point is at
                    the surface of the water in equilibrium, the index T be set to the middle point
                    <hi rend="italic">a</hi> of the graduated wire <hi rend="italic">rs,</hi> and
                    the distance on each side <hi rend="italic">ar</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >as</hi> contains 100 equal parts; then, if in weighing bodies the weight is
                    required to the hundredth part of a grain, it may be easily had by proceeding in
                    the following manner.</p>
                <p>Let the. body to be weighed be placed in the scale <hi rend="italic">d.</hi> Put
                    the weight X in the scale <hi rend="italic">e;</hi> and let this be so
                    determined, that one grain more shall be too much, and one grain less too
                    little. Then, the balance being moved gently up or down by the screw P, till the
                    equilibrium be nicely shown at <hi rend="italic">o,</hi> if the index T be at
                    the middle point <hi rend="italic">a</hi> of the wire <hi rend="italic">rs,</hi>
                    it shows that the weights put into the scale <hi rend="italic">e</hi> are just
                    equal to the weight of the body. By this method we find the absolute weight of
                    the body; the relative weight is found by weighing it hydrostatically in water,
                    as follows.</p>
                <p>Instead of putting the body into the scale <hi rend="italic">e,</hi> as before,
                    let it hang with the weight F at the hook c by a horse hair, as at R, supposing
                    the vessel 0 of water were away. The equilibrium being then made, the index T
                    standing between <hi rend="italic">a</hi> and <hi rend="italic">r</hi> at the 36
                    division, shows the weight of the body put in to be 1095∙36 grains. As it thus
                    hangs, let it be immersed in the water of the vessel N, and it will become much
                    lighter; the scale <hi rend="italic">e</hi> will descend till the beam of the
                    balance rest on the support <hi rend="italic">z.</hi> Then, suppose 100 grains
                    put into the scale <hi rend="italic">d</hi> restore the equilibrium precisely,
                    so that the index T stand at the 36 division above <hi rend="italic">a,</hi> it
                    is evident that the weight of an equal bulk of water would in this case be
                    exactly 100 grains.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Balance of Torsion</hi> is an instrument invented by
                    Coulomb, for comparing the intensities of very small forces. It consists
                    essentially of a metallic wire, suspended vertically from a fixed point, to the
                    lower end of which a horizontal needle is attached, with a small weight for the
                    purpose of keeping the wire stretched. The intensity of any small force made to
                    act on the extremity of <pb break="no" facs="nls:193193319"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0704-3319-0308"/>the needle is measured by the arc which the needle
                    passes over, reckoned from the point of repose. The force is thus balanced by
                    the <hi rend="italic">torsion</hi> of the wire, whence the name of the
                    instrument.</p>
                <p>To prevent any derangement from the agitation of the air, the apparatus must be
                    covered by a glass cylinder, to which a circular scale is applied horizontally,
                    for the purpose of measuring the amplitude of the arc traversed by the needle. A
                    divided circle is also adapted to the top of the cylinder, and capable of being
                    turned round on it, by means of which, and a fixed index attached horizontally
                    to the hook from which the wire is suspended, the wire may be twisted any
                    required number of degrees. This apparatus is represented by fig. 9. The length
                    of the wire and the needle must be regulated by the object in view. If the
                    forces to be measured are very small, and great sensibility is consequently
                    required, the wire must be long and very fine; for the force of torsion is
                    inversely proportional to the length of the wire, and directly as the fourth
                    power of its diameter. It must also-be formed of a substance possessing
                    considerable elasticity, and for this reason brass wire is greatly superior to
                    iron. By experiments undertaken for the purpose, Coulomb found the elasticity of
                    some wires so perfect, that on keeping them twisted through eight circumferences
                    for thirty liours together, the centre of torsion was not displaced by a single
                    degree. Their length was about a metre, or 39 inches.</p>
                <p>The balance of torsion is used chiefly in experiments on electricity, magnetism,
                    the adhesion of fluids, &amp;c.; and it was by means of this instrument that
                    Cavendish made his famous experiments on the attraction of lead balls, from
                    which he deduced the mean density of the earth equal to about 5∙5, that of water
                    being unit. (s,)</p>
