                    superintendent of the royal press at Parma, chief printer to his catholic
                    majesty, member of various academies in Italy, and knight of several orders, was
                    born in 1740, at Saluzzo in Piedmont, where his father owned a printing
                    establishment. While yet a boy, he began to employ himself in engraving on wood;
                    and his labours meeting with success, he at length went to Rome, where he was
                    admitted as a compositor for the press of the Propaganda. By the advice of the
                    superintendent, he made himself acquainted with the oriental languages, in order
                    to qualify himself for the kind of printing required in them; and he was thus
                    enabled to render essential service to the Propaganda press, by restoring and
                    accurately distributing the types of several oriental alphabets which had fallen
                    into disorder. About the year 1760, the Infanta Don Ferdinand having established
                    in Parma a printing-house on the model of those in Paris, Madrid, and Turin,
                    Bodoni was placed at the head of this establishment, which he soon rendered the
                    first of the kind in Europe, and gained the reputation of having surpassed the
                    most splendid productions of his predecessors. The beauty of his typography,
                    indeed, as well as the whole management of the technical part of the work,
                    leaves nothing further to be desired; but the intrinsic value of his editions is
                    seldom equal to their outward splendour. His Homer, however, is a truly
                    magnificent work; and, indeed, his Greek letters are the most perfect imitations
                    that have been executed in modern times of the best Greek manuscript. His
                    editions of the Greek, Latin, Italian, and French classics, are all highly
                    prized for their typographical splendour, and some of them are not less
                    remarkable for their accuracy. Bodoni died at Padua on the 29th of November
                    1813, aged seventy-three. Some years after his death appeared a magnificent work
                    in two volumes quarto, entitled <hi rend="italic">Manuale Tipografico,</hi>
