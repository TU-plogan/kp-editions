                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra

                <p><label type="entry">BEETHOVEN, <hi rend="smallcaps">Ludwig Von</hi></label>, one
                    of the greatest pianoforte players and musical composers of modern times, was
                    born in the year 1772, at Bonn, in Prussian Germany. Some foreign writers allege
                    that he was a natural son of Frederick William II. king of Prussia.</p>
                <p>His musical genius, like Mozart’s, seems to have been very early developed. He is
                    said to have been at once a performer and a composer when only eleven years old.
                    His first master was C. G. Neefe, chapel-master and organist at Bonn. His next
                    was the celebrated teacher, theoretical writer, and composer, Albrechtsberger,
                    then chapelmaster at Vienna. His exercises in composition, written under the
                    superintendence of Albrechtsberger, have been advertised for publication in
                    Germany. Some of his musical instruction was derived from the celebrated Italian
                    composer Salieri, at Vienna.</p>
                <p>It appears that during a great part of his life he suffered from deafness, which
                    had become almost total in his <pb break="no" facs="nls:193196309"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0704-6309-0538"/>28th year. In his will, dated 1802, his
                    expressions of wretchedness under this infliction are very strong. He says that
                    his deafness occasioned him such anguish of mind that he was often tempted to
                    commit suicide; but that his art restrained him. There is something very
                    affecting in all this, which reminds one of Milton’s bitter and frequent
                    allusions to the miseries of blindness.</p>
                <p>Beethoven tells us that his unhappy deafness, occasioned by the ignorance and
                    mismanagement of a surgeon, was the cause of his withdrawing himself from
                    society, and leading a solitary and miserable life. He speaks in terms of the
                    deepest grief, of the many privations to which the loss of bis hearing subjected
                    him ;—his incapacity of enjoying audible music, and his inability to maintain
                    social intercourse by means of speech. The feeling of his irreparable loss seems
                    to have haunted him perpetually like some hideous phantom. Doubtless he often
                    felt most deeply what Dante has so well expressed in the bitterness of his
                    recollections:</p>

                    Beethoven’s appearance, and manners, and musical performance, is quite
                    consistent with what the writer of this article has heard from other persons. Mr
                    Russell tells us (<hi rend="italic">Tour in Germany,</hi> vol. i. p. 277),
                    “though not an old man, he (Beethoven) is lost to society in consequence of his
                    extreme deafness, which has rendered him almost unsocial. The neglect of his
                    person which he exhibits gives him a somewhat wild appearance. His features are
                    strong and prominent; his eye is full of rude energy; his hair, which neither
                    comb nor scissors seem to have visited for years, overshadows his broad brow, in
                    a quantity and confusion to which only the snakes round a Gorgon’s head offer a
                    parallel. His general behaviour does not ill accord with this unpromising
                    exterior. Except when he is among his chosen friends, kindliness or affability
                    are not his characteristics. The total loss of hearing has deprived him of all
                    the pleasure which society can give, and perhaps soured his temper.”</p>
                <p>“He has always a small paper book with him, and what conversation takes place is
                    carried on in writing. In this, too, although it is not lined, he instantly jots
                    down any musical idea which strikes him.” Mr Russell heard him play, and says
                    that, from his deafness, “when playing <hi rend="italic">very piano,</hi> he
                    often does not bring out a single note, yet he hears it himself in the ‘ mind’s
                    ear.’ While his eye, and the almost imperceptible motion of his fingers, show
                    that he is following out the strain in his own soul through all its dying
                    gradations, the instrument itself is actually as dumb as the musician is
                    deaf·”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic"
                    >Vide</hi> vol. i. pp. 277, 278, 299.</p></note> (vol. i. p. 299.)</p>
                <p>Beethoven died of dropsy, at Vienna, on the evening of the 26th March 1827, in
                    the fifty-sixth year of his age. His funeral took place on the 29th, and was
                    attended by a great number of poets, literary men, and musicians, who attended
                    as mourners, besides a vast concourse of the people of Vienna. His body was
                    interred in the churchyard of Friedhofe, a village about two English miles from
                    Vienna, which is said to have been a favourite resort of his, where he passed
                    many solitary hours in meditation and composition. The church-yard rises
                    gradually from the road, and Beethoven’s grave is situated about halfway up,
                    close to the wall, on the left-hand side. .Against the wall was placed a marble
                    slab, of which a print has been published, having merely the word Beethoven, in
                    carved gilt letters, but surmounted by the image of a lyre and a head crowned
                    with rays, and at the top a butterfly with expanded wings, the symbol of
                    resurrection and immortality. In 1828 subscriptions were collected at Vienna, in
                    order to construct a splendid monument to this illustrious composer.</p>
                <p>With regard to Beethoven’s abilities as a piano-forte player, the opinion of Mr
                    J. B. Cramer, one of the greatest masters of that instrument, may be sufficient.
                    Mr Cramer described him as “by no means a <hi rend="italic">finished or very
                    delicate</hi> player; but a giant in respect of command of ideas and energy of
                    style.” “His extemporaneous playing,” Mr Cramer adds, “is the most magnificent I
                    ever heard.” Signor Dragonetti concurs in this opinion.</p>
                <p>As a composer Beethoven ranks very high. He possessed a powerful, inventive, and
                    original mind. In respect of regularity of design, purity of harmonic
                    combination, sustained melody, and skilful management of his materials, he is,
                    generally speaking, greatly inferior to Haydn and Mozart. But still, throughout
                    all his best compositions there is an enthusiastic spirit of inspiration, a wild
                    and masculine energy, relieved by occasional touches of tender beauty and
                    melancholy, which makes us feel deeply the genius of the man, and which may,
                    perhaps, be said to render his music analogous in character to the poetry of
                    Dante.</p>
                <p>His earlier works are his best, and are strongly tinctured with the style of
                    Mozart. His deafness may in a great measure account for the dry, crude, and
                    unmelodious style of many of his later works. In vocal composition he was not in
                    general greatly successful. However, his scena ed aria, “Ah perfido! spergiuro
                    !” and his canzonet “Adelaide,” are both charming compositions. The latter is
                    modelled upon Haydn’s fine canzonet “0 tuneful voice.” For a detailed criticism
                    on and list of Beethoven’s works, the readers may consult the German “Catalogue
                    Thématique,” and “Handbuch der Musikalischen Literatur,” published at Leipsic by
                    C. F. Whistling.</p>
                <p>Several portraits of Beethoven have been published. The one drawn by Decker,
                    engraved by Steinmiiller, and published by Artaria, at Vienna, is considered the
                    best likeness. <hi rend="smallcaps">(r r.)</hi></p>
