                <p><label type="entry">BATTERY</label>, in the military art, any place where cannon
                    or mortars are mounted, either to attack the forces of the enemy or to batter a
                    fortification; and hence batteries have various names, according to the purposes
                    which they are designed to effect.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Gun-Battery</hi> is a defence constructed of earth faced with
                    green sods or fascines, sometimes of gabions filled with earth. It consists of a
                    breast-work, epaulement, or parapet, about 8 feet in height, and 18 or 20 feet
                    in thickness, with a ditch 12 feet broad at the bottom, 18 at the top, and 7
                    feet in depth. The open spaces through which the muzzles of the cannon are
                    pointed are called <hi rend="italic">embrasures,</hi> and the solid masses
                    between the embrasures, <hi rend="italic">merlons.</hi> The distance from the
                    centre of one embrasure to that of another is 18 feet, and this is also the
                    distance at which the guns are placed from each other; consequently the merlons
                    are 16 feet within and 7 without. The <hi rend="italic">genouillères,</hi> or
                    those parts of the parapet which cover the carriage of the gun, are generally
                    made 2∣ feet in height from the platform to the opening of the embrasures; but
                    this height must be regulated by the semi-diameter of the wheels of the carriage
                    and the nature of the gun. The platforms are plank floors made to prevent the
                    cannon from sinking into the ground, and they are generally 18 feet in length,
                    15 feet in breadth behind, and 9 feet before, with a rise of nine or ten inches
                    from the parapet to check the recoil of the guns, and to render it more easy to
                    bring them forward again when loaded.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Mortar-Batteries</hi> differ from gun-batteries in this, that
                    the parapets have no embrasures, and the platforms have no slope, but are
                    exactly horizontal; the shells being fired quite over the parapet, commonly at
                    an elevation of 45 degrees.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Open Battery</hi> is a number of cannon, commonly field pieces,
                    ranged in a row abreast, on some natural elevation of ground, or on an
                    artificial bank raised for the purpose.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Covered</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Masked Battery</hi> is when
                    the cannon and gunners are covered by a bank or breast-work, commonly made of
                    brushwood, faggots, and earth.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Sunk</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Buried Battery</hi> is when the
                    platform is sunk or let down into the ground, so that trenches must be cut m the
                    earth opposite the muzzles of the guns, to serve as embrasures to fire
                    through.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Cross-Batteries</hi> are two batteries which play athwart each
                    other upon the same object, forming there an angle, and battering with more
                    effect, because what one battery shakes, the other beats down.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Battery d’Eηβlade</hi> is one that sweeps or scours the whole
                    length of a straight line, or the face or flank of any work.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Battery en Echarpe</hi> is that which plays obliquely.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Battery de Reverse</hi> is one which plays upon the rear of the
                    troops appointed to defend a place.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Camerade Battery</hi> is when several guns are discharged upon
                    one point at the same instant.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Redan Batteries</hi> are such as flank each other at the sa-

                    angles of a fortification.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Ricohet Battery,</hi> so called by its inventor M. Vauban, was
                    ffist <hi rend="superscript"> l</hi> ∙ <hi rend="superscript"> se</hi> d <hi
                    rend="superscript"> at</hi> ^ <hi rend="superscript"> ιe</hi> siege of Aeth in
                    1697. It is a me-</p>
                <p>°d of discharging cannon with a very small charge of powder, and with just
                    elevation enough to fire over the parapet. When properly managed, its effects
                    are most destructive; for the shot, rolling along the opposite rampart,
                    dismounts the cannon and disperses or destro∙ s the troops. Ricohet practice is
                    not confined to cannon alone: small mortars and howitzers may be effectually
                    employed for the same purpose.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Fascine</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Gabion Batteries</hi> are
                    batteries constructed of those machines where sods are scarce, and the earth
                    very loose or sandy.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Battery,</hi> in <hi rend="italic">Law,</hi> is the unlawful
                    beating of another. The least touching of another’s person wilfully, or in
                    anger, is a battery, for the law cannot draw the line between different degrees
                    of violence, and therefore totally prohibits the first and lowest stage of it;
                    every man’s person being sacred, and no other having a right to meddle with it,
                    in any the slightest manner. Upon a similar principle, the Cornelian law <hi
                    rend="italic">de injuriis</hi> prohibited <hi rend="italic">pulsation</hi> as
                    well as <hi rend="italic">verbération;</hi> distinguishing verberation, which
                    was accompanied with pain, from pulsation, which was attended with none. But
                    battery is in some cases justifiable or lawful; as where one having authority,a
                    parentor master, bestows moderate correction on his child, his scholar, or his
                    apprentice. It is justifiable on the principle of self-defence; for if one man
                    strikes another, or only assaults him, the latter may strike in his own defence,
                    and if sued for it, may plead that it was the plaintiff’s own original assault
                    which occasioned it. It is likewise justifiable in defence of goods or
                    possession, and in the exercise of an office, as that of church-warden or
                    beadle; but the person pleading such justification in a civil suit, or in a
                    criminal prosecution, must be prepared to instruct that he has observed the <hi
                    rend="italic">moderamen inculpatoe tuteloe.</hi> By reason of these and other
                    grounds of justification, battery is defined the unlawful beating of another;
                    and the remedy is, as for assault, by action of trespass or damages, in -which
                    the jury will or ought to give adequate compensation.</p>
