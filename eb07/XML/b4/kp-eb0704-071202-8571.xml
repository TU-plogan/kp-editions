                <p><label type="entry">BLOW-PIPE</label>, an instrument for directing the flame of a
                    lamp or candle horizontally, so as to communicate an intense heat to small
                    bodies placed in the flame. This is effected by impelling with velocity through
                    a small aperture, against the flame, a stream of air, by means of the muscles of
                    respiration and the mouth, or by a bellows. The blow-pipe is used in soldering,
                    by the jeweller and goldsmith, and other artists, who fabricate small objects of
                    metal; by the glass-blower, in making thermometers and barometers, and other
                    instruments formed from the tubes which are obtained from the glass-house; by
                    the enameller; and also in glass-pinching, which is the art of forming glass in
                    a mould fixed on a pair of pincers, into the ornamental pendants for glass
                    lustres. This is one of the many ingenious processes carried on at Birmingham.
                    The glass-blower, the enameller, and the glass-pincher, work their blow-pipe
                    with the blast of a pair of bellows. As the process of soldering requires a
                    shorter continuance of the blast, the blow-pipe for this purpose is blown by the
                    mouth. By the mineralogist and chemist, the blow-pipe is used as an instrument
                    for extemporaneous analysis in the dry way.</p>
                <p>Fig. 1, Plate CIX. is the common blow-pipe used in soldering; it is of brass.
                    Fig. 2 is Dr Wollaston’s blowpipe, which is composed of three tubes of brass, of
                    an elongated conical form, which are made to fit stiff and air-tight into each
                    other when in use, and the two smaller pack into the largest; so that the
                    instrument, when not in use, occupies a very small space, and may be carried in
                    the pencil-case of a common pocket-book. This, with a piece of platina-foil, two
                    or three inches long, to hold the object of experiment to the flame, constitutes
                    a commodious dokimastic apparatus for the travelling mineralogist. The three
                    parts of the tube are represented, packed the one within the other, at A,
                    separate at B, and put together ready for use at C, fig. 2.</p>
                <p>A second division of blow-pipes consists of those which have a cavity for the
                    purpose of retaining the humidity of the breath, which, without this precaution,
                    collects into drops when the blowing is continued long, and is at last driven
                    upon the matter under operation so as to cool it. They are of various forms; see
                    figures 3, 4, 5, 6, 7; and have been contrived for the purposes of the chemist
                    and mineralogist. Fig. 3 is of glass or of metal. Fig. 4 is of brass or of
                    silver, containing no alloy of copper, so that it may not be subject to green
                    rust. This is the form recommended by Bergman in his treatise on the application
                    of the blow-pipe to the purposes of the mineralogist, which is contained in the
                    collection of his works. (See Berg-mani <hi rend="italic">Opuscula,</hi> vol.
                    ii.) For the facility of cleaning, it is in three pieces, which fit in stiff at
                    A and B. Fig. 5 is of tin, that is to say, tinned iron; the small pipe A is of
                    brass, and has two or three caps that fit on stiff; each cap is pierced with a
                    hole of a different diameter; and as the blast issues through this hole, the
                    force of the blast may be varied by changing the cap. This is called Dr Black s
                    blow-pipe. Fig. 6 is of silver; the adjutage, which is of platina, turns on an
                    axis at right angles to the main tube at A, so that it may be made to form
                    different angles with the main tube; the prolongation B serves to receive the
                    condensed vapour of the breath. Fig. 7 is of brass; A is cylindrical, the axis
                    of the cylinder being at right angles <pb break="no" facs="nls:193198584"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0704-8584-0713"/>to the axis of the blow-pipe. A consists of two
                    pieces, one of which fits air-tight into the other, and may be turned on its
                    axis, so that the pipe of issue may be made to form different angles with the
                    axis of the blow-pipe, as the position of the matter under experiment may
                    require.</p>
                <p>Flame consists of vapour in a state of incandescence. Many substances, both of
                    the vegetable, animal, and mineral kingdoms, have the quality of giving out this
                    incandescent vapour. For domestic uses, and for the arts, organized bodies of
                    the vegetable and animal kingdom alone are employed to produce it; such as oils,
                    some of which are solid, others fluid, at the usual temperature of the air,
                    alcohol, ether, wood, and pit-coal. This latter, though found amongst minerals,
                    is composed of organized matter changed and rendered bituminous by a particular
                    process of decomposition. The blow-pipe, by directing the incandescent particles
                    of which the flame consists so as to strike against and surround a small body,
                    produces the effect of heating the body considerably. The flame used with the
                    blow-pipe may either be the flame of an oil or spirit lamp, or of a candle; the
                    flame of the carbonated hydrogen gas proceeding from the distillation of the
                    pitcoal, is also found advantageous for this purpose.</p>
                <p>In order to use the blow-pipe, the breath impelled through it is to be directed
                    across the flame of a lamp or candle, applying the orifice from which the air
                    issues a little above the upper end of the wick; and a jet of flame is thus
                    formed, as represented at fig. 8. This jet is made to fall on the body to be
                    heated. The operation may be continued for a considerable length of time; an
                    uninterrupted blast is kept up by the muscular action of the cheeks, whilst the
                    ordinary respiration goes on through the nose; and a little practice is
                    sufficient to enable the operator to succeed. The jet of flame is conoidal,
                    internally blue, and externally yellow. By more or less immersion in this jet of
                    flame the subject of operation receives a greater or less degree of heat, and
                    becomes oxidated in a greater or less degree. If a bead of borax, containing
                    oxide of manganese, be kept fused for some time in the inner flame, the bead
                    becomes colourless; when it is afterwards kept fused in the outer flame, the
                    manganese acquires more oxygen, and the bead becomes of a violet colour. This
                    violet colour may be made to appear more speedily by adding a particle of
                    nitre.</p>
                <p>The first who applied the blow-pipe to the analysis of minerals was Swab,
                    counsellor of the college of mines in Sweden in 1738. Its application to the
                    science of mineralogy was afterwards further improved by Cronsted, Rinman, Gahn,
                    Scheele, and Bergman, and by other men of science since their time.</p>
                <p>The blow-pipe is useful to the mineralogist and chemist, as affording a ready
                    method of knowing what the component parts of bodies are. Trials with the
                    blow-pipe are generally made by the chemist in order to know the nature of the
                    constituent parts, before he proceeds to the other steps of dry or humid
                    analysis, which are requisite for ascertaining the quantities of the constituent
                    parts. Then recourse is had to other means than the blow-pipe; for, in order to
                    come at a knowledge of the proportions of the constituent parts, it is necessary
                    that the quantity of each constituent part be large enough to be weighed in a
                    balance, and, for this purpose, the quantity of the substance employed must be
                    larger than what can be managed with the blow-pipe.</p>
                <p>ŗ In experimental mineralogy with the blow-pipe, the small fragment of the body
                    subjected to trial should not exceed the size of half a peppercorn; if larger,
                    it cannot be sufficiently heated. It is placed in a lenticular cavity, made with
                    a knife, in a piece of well-burnt charcoal of wood, free from cracks, and not
                    too porous, and of the length of four or five inches, so as to be held
                    conveniently’ in the left hand. Some blow-pipes have been made with a stand, to
                    which they arc connected by a ball and socket joint, the stand being fixed to
                    the table by a clamp; and this construction leaves the right hand at liberty. In
                    reducing fragments of metallic ores by the blow-pipe, charcoal should be used as
                    a support, for the charcoal attracts the oxygen from the metallic oxide, and
                    reduces it to a metallic form; and when thus reduced, the metal may be kept
                    fused on the charcoal, which prevents or retards its again attracting oxygen.
                    The charcoal support has likewise the advantage of increasing the heat by its
                    incandescence. For both these reasons, to prevent oxidation, and to increase and
                    reverberate the heat proceeding from the jet of flame, the goldsmith who solders
                    his small work by the blow-pipe attaches his work to a piece of charcoal, by
                    means of wires, in the process of soldering.</p>
                <p>When it is required that the fragment of a mineral should be heated without the
                    contact of charcoal, the fragment is exposed to the flame in a small spoon of
                    platina, with a wooden handle, the cavity of the spoon being a hemisphere of
                    three tenths of an inch in diameter; or on a thin lamina of platina two or three
                    inches long and half an inch broad, and of the thickness of common writing
                    paper; or it is held by a forceps, three inches long, made of thin platina.
                    Bergman, who published his treatise on the blow-pipe in 1780, before the working
                    of platina had come into use, employed a small gold spoon, as that metal has the
                    quality of remaining pure and uncontaini-nated, whilst in contact with many of
                    the chemical agents; but platina is preferable; for, besides possessing the
                    quality of resisting the action of many chemical agents, it has likewise the
                    advantage of difficult fusibility. It has now for a good many years been wrought
                    into various instruments both in London and Paris; and when wrought it is sold
                    at the price of about a guinea the ounce, which is one quarter the price of
                    gold. Some platina workers, as Jean-etti of Paris, who was one of the first,
                    form the crude granular platina into masses, by melting it with arsenic, and
                    subsequent heating and forging; others dissolve the crude platina in
                    nitro-muriatic acid, and reduce the nitro-muriate of platina to a metallic state
                    by heat. Platina, however, although infusible alone by the heat of the common
                    blowpipe, will be dissolved and melted if heated along with some of the metals.
                    Platina supports, therefore, should not be used where they are liable to be in
                    contact with a fused metal. These effects are notable in the case of tin; for
                    when tin is melted in contact with a vessel of platina, the tin enters into a
                    combination with the platina, corroding and rendering it brittle, so that pieces
                    of the platina vessel come off on the application of a small force, and the
                    vessel is thus rendered useless. Platina vessels also become unserviceable by
                    frequent and continued exposure to great heat. Platina crucibles which are much
                    used become brittle, and crack at the edges; and care should be taken to cool
                    these vessels gradually, that they may last as long as possible. A platina
                    vessel, in which sulphuric acid was boiled for a long time, at last became
                    perforated and unserviceable.</p>
                <p>Borax (borate of soda) is used along with the fragment of mineral in many cases.
                    When exposed to the flame it becomes opaque, swells and ramifies much, in
                    consequence of parting with its water of crystallization; afterwards it fuses
                    into a colourless and transparent bead. It is convenient <hi rend="subscript">
                    ιι</hi> to use calcined borax, which is borax deprived of its water of
                    crystallization by heat in a crucible: this melts into a bead on the charcoal at
                    once. The solubility of a mineral in borax, with effervescence or without
                    effervescence, and the colour which the mineral communicates to the borax, are
                    the chief distinctive characters obtained <pb break="no" facs="nls:193198597"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0704-8597-0714"/>by treating a minèraI with that substance.
                    Phosphate of ammonia is also sometimes used as a flux in the same manner as
                    borax, and carbonate of soda; but both these, especially the latter, have the
                    inconvenience of sinking into the charcoal, which borax is free from.</p>
                <p>Mention must be made here of a few of the most prominent phenomena,
                    characteristic of different mineral substances when treated by the blow-pipe.
                    Some minerals are fusible alone, such as garnet and felspar; the last, however,
                    is rather difficult to fuse. Some are infusible, and change colour; bituminous
                    shale loses its black colour, and becomes white; green and dark coloured
                    steatite become white. Some dissolve in borax without effervescence, as agate,
                    quartz, felspar, amiantus, garnet. Some dissolve in borax with effervescence.
                    This is the case with carbonate of lime; it forms with borax a globule
                    transparent whilst in fusion, but in cooling the globule becomes opaque, the
                    lime being no longer held in solution by the borax, in like manner as the watery
                    solutions of certain salts, saturated when hot, deposit a part of the salt on
                    cooling. Some of the metals communicate peculiar colours to borax. Copper, in
                    certain proportions, and at a certain degree of oxidation, gives a brown colour
                    to borax when heated by the blow-pipe; cobalt gives a deep blue tinge; manganese
                    communicates a violet colour; iron tinges borax brown, and, if in greater
                    quantity, black. These colours are produced by the metals, in a state of oxide.
                    The smell emitted by some minerals when heated by the blow-pipe is another
                    character serving to distinguish them. That of minerals containing sulphur is
                    the peculiar suffocating smell of sulphureous gas; minerals that contain arsenic
                    emit, when heated, a smell like that of garlic. The nature of some minerals is
                    recognised by the particular form of crystallization which they assume in
                    cooling. This is the case with phosphate of lead, which, after being fused,
                    cools on the charcoal into an opaque white spheroidal polyhedron. Some ores are
                    reduced to a metallic globule with great ease on the charcoal; thus the native
                    sulphuret of lead, called galaena, being heated by the blow-pipe, the sulphur is
                    driven off, and the lead remains in its metallic state. A small particle of
                    silver may be melted by the blow-pipe; likewise gold, copper, and, Bergman says,
                    cast-iron. Metallic zinc, when exposed to the flame of the blow-pipe on the
                    charcoal, melts and burns with a bluish-green flame, and becomes covered with
                    oxide, which flies off and floats in the air in light white flocks. Metallic
                    antimony becomes red hot, and melts on the charcoal; and if the operator ceases
                    to blow, a white fume rises, and oxide of antimony forms upon the globule, in
                    whitish crystalline spiculae; but if the globule, in a state of fusion, be
                    thrown upon a brick floor, it runs along for a considerable way, rebounding
                    several times, and leaving a trace of white oxide of antimony.</p>
                <p>Some substances communicate colour to the flame of the blow-pipe. Muriate of
                    copper, whose crystals are green, communicate a vivid green to the flame;
                    sulphate and nitrate of copper, whose crystals are blue, likewise impart a green
                    colour to the flame when they are exposed to its action. Some of the salts of
                    strontian give a purple tinge to the flame.</p>
                <p>The preceding observations relate to the blow-pipe worked by the breath. When it
                    is required to continue the use of the blow-pipe so long that it would be
                    fatiguing if the breath, merely were employed, the glass-blower’s table, fig. 9,
                    is used. It consists of a double bellows, so fixed as to be worked by the foot,
                    and to impel a current of air through a tin blow-pipe against the flame of a
                    lamp fixed on the table. For the sake of durability, the blowpipe is sometimes
                    of brass, on which is screwed a nozzle of platina. The blow-pipe may have a
                    stop-cock, as in fig. 9, serving to regulate the blast. The lamp has a cotton
                    wick of nearly an inch in thickness; the wick is kept together by a tin
                    wick-holder, which is soldered to the lamp; and melted tallow fills the lamp,
                    and feeds the wick with fuel. In order to get rid of the smoke, which is in
                    considerable quantity, there may be placed at a convenient distance above the
                    flame a tin funnel ending in a tube, which conveys the smoke out of the room. A
                    convenient method of carrying away the smoke from the glass-blowers’ lamp is
                    represented in fig. 13. It consists of a cover of thin sheet copper, which is
                    placed on the table, covering the lamp and nozzle. The fore-part of this cover
                    is open, so as to allow the jet of flame to pass freely. From the upper part of
                    the cover two tubes run upwards for the exit of the smoke; and between these the
                    glass-blower has a view of the object he is at work upon, whilst his eyes are
                    screened from the light of the flame. The two tubes join above in one short
                    tube; and over the open end of this short tube, at a small distance above, is a
                    tube suspended from the ceiling by wires, which conveys the smoke into the
                    chimney of the room. By a handle attached to the cover, the cover with its tubes
                    is removed when it is necessary to trim the wick. The flame of gas from pit-coal
                    may be used instead of a lamp, with a bellows of this kind.</p>
                <p>The regularity of the blast in the double bellows is effected by means of a
                    weight pressing on the air contained in the second compartment of the bellows;
                    just in the same way as a stream of air is made to issue regularly from a tube
                    fixed in the mouth of an inflated bladder, when a weight is placed on the
                    bladder. A regular stream of air may also be obtained, by subjecting inclosed
                    air to the pressure of a column of water, mercury, or some other liquid. If a
                    vessel containing air, and open at the mouth, be plunged into the water with the
                    mouth downwards, and if the water on the outside of the vessel rise higher than
                    the surface of the water within the vessel, then the column of water, whose
                    height is the difference of level, exercising its pressure, as all liquids do,
                    in every direction, will act upwards on the inclosed air; the inclosed air,
                    pressed and more condensed than the external air, will escape in a current, by a
                    stop-cock opened on the top of the vessel for its issue; and this issue will
                    continue till the surface of the exterior and interior water come to a level,
                    when the air in the vessel will have the same density as the external air. The
                    force with which the inclosed air is pressed is equal to the weight of a column
                    of water whose height is the difference of levels, and whose base is the surface
                    of water exposed to the inclosed air. The gasometers used by Lavoisier, to
                    afford a stream of oxygen gas and a stream of hydrogen gas, for effecting the
                    composition of water, are constructed upon this principle. An apparatus of the
                    same nature has for many years been employed upon a great scale in different
                    parts of Britain, to regulate the most powerful blast used in the arts,—that for
                    reducing ironstone to the state of cast-iron. In blast-furnaces upon this
                    construction, the blast is raised by means of a large cast-iron cylinder, which
                    acts as a bellows, having a valve in the bottom that opens inwards, and that
                    admits the air during the ascent of the piston; when the piston descends, the
                    valve shuts, and the air is driven into a large parallelopipedal vessel, less in
                    height than in the other dimensions, immersed in water, and having its under
                    surface closed only by the water. In this vessel the air is pressed by the
                    column of water, whose height is the distance between the surfaces of the
                    exterior and interior water; and a pipe of issue, terminating in a nosepipe,
                    conducts the blast to the furnace.</p>

                <p>It is composed of two hollow globes, the upper filled with water, which, by
                    running into the lower, forces the air contained in the lower to issue through a
                    nozzle. This apparatus is described by Mr Greenough, in <hi rend="italic"
                    >Nicholsons Journal,</hi> vol. ix. p. 25 and 143. It has some inconveniences,
                    and does not appear ever to have come into much use.</p>
                <p>The water-pressure apparatus, applied to the blow-pipe, of which a section is
                    given at fig. 10, was contrived by Mr Tilley, an ingenious fancy glass-blower.
                    It consists of a tin box with a partition in it, reaching within half an inch of
                    the bottom; water is poured in, equal in bulk to three fourths of the capacity
                    of the box. The water in the cavity DE is open, and subject to no other pressure
                    but that of the atmosphere, being only covered by the lid of the vessel; the
                    apartment F is closed at top, so as to be airtight, and the water in it is
                    pressed by the elasticity of the air confined in its upper part. The tube C has
                    its lower extremity always plunged in water, so that when air is blown in
                    through it, the return of the air by that tube is prevented. Before the
                    apparatus is set to work, the surface of the water in both compartments is at
                    the same height, both being pressed by air of the density of the surrounding
                    air; but when air is blown in through C, the air rises through the water to the
                    top of the compartment F; and as the only issue for the air is through the small
                    aperture of the blow-pipe, by which it cannot escape nearly so fast as it is
                    blown in, the air consequently becomes condensed in the upper part of the
                    compartment F; and this condensed air pressing on the water in F more strongly
                    than the atmosphere does on the water in DE, depresses the surface of the water
                    in F, and causes it to rise in DE, which is effected by a portion of the water
                    passing under the partition into the open compartment DE. Thus the pressure
                    exerted by the column of water whose height is the difference of level of the
                    water in DE, and of the water in F, forces the air from the compartment F
                    through the blow-pipe <hi rend="italic">a,</hi> which is directed against the
                    flame of a lamp; and this pressure keeps up a constant' blast till the water in
                    the two compartments comes nearly to the same height. The degree of condensation
                    of the inclosed air, and the height of the column of water pressing on the
                    condensed air, are measures of each other, when much air is blown in, so as to
                    occasion a considerable degree of condensation. The difference of level
                    resulting is considerable; and the column of water, which is always re-acting
                    with an equal and contrary pressure on the condensed air, causes it to issue
                    with greater velocity from the blow-pipe. When the condensation diminishes, so
                    does the column of water, and the velocity of the issuing stream of air. More
                    air is to be blown in with the mouth through the tube C from time to time, so as
                    to keep the blast regular. Mr Tilley is of opinion that this apparatus produces
                    a more regular stream of air than a double bellows, and it has likewise the
                    advantage that the operator is free from the trouble of moving a pedal. The
                    dimensions of the vessel AA, which is either of tinned iron or of tinned copper,
                    are seventeen inches in height, five inches in width, and nine in breadth; the
                    lid of the vessel opens and shuts on hinges, and supports the tallow lamp B. The
                    bent glass tube <hi rend="italic">a,</hi> which terminates in a small hole, is
                    fitted air-tight into a tin tube, which is made conical, and which forms the
                    issue from the top of the compartment F; for this purpose paper is wrapped round
                    the glass tube, and then cotton wick yarn, in a conical form, so that the glass
                    tube thus clothed may fit tight into the socket, and may nevertheless be moved
                    round, that the blast may act properly on the flame. The bent metal tube C is
                    also fixed into its socket in the same manner: its junction with the socket is
                    seen in fig. 10. There is a screen formed of a tin plate sliding vertically in
                    grooves between two upright pieces of tin; the edge of this is seen at S, in
                    fig. 10. It is intended to protect the eyes of the operator from the light of
                    the lamp, whilst, at the same time, he can see the subject of his operation over
                    the top of the screen. This screen is not soldered to the vessel, but is held
                    fast by its foot being placed between the lid of the vessel and the top of the
                    close chamber F. Two rests for supporting the operator’s arms project, one from
                    each side of the vessel; upon these the arms are placed when any substance is
                    held to the flame. These rests are wrapped round with woollen list or leather,
                    so as to be more convenient for leaning upon. The whole of the apparatus,
                    including the lamp and case, weighs only three pounds and a half. When it is to
                    be used, the vessel is fixed to a table or bench by means of a leather strap
                    buckled to two loops, which are on the sides of the vessel opposite to each
                    other; and the strap is passed under the table or bench. The long flat cotton
                    wick is preferred by some glass-blowers to the usual round cotton wick. The lamp
                    is filled with tallow, which melts after the lamp has been lighted for some
                    time, and then it burns as freely as oil, and with a less offensive smell. When
                    not in use the tallow becomes solid, and is more conveniently carried about than
                    oil. Hogs’ lard also does well for burning in this lamp. Some glass-blowers mix
                    cocoa-nut oil, which is solid at the temperature of the climate of Britain, with
                    hogs’ lard, and find it to answer well in the lamp. The lamp is placed within
                    another vessel, marked K, which supports it at a proper height, leaving a space
                    between them, to receive any tallow that may run over the edge of the lamp. A
                    wire bent at the end is convenient for trimming the wick, and forming it into a
                    channel through which the stream of air is to be directed. It is convenient to
                    have several lamps with wicks of different thicknesses, namely, one to hold two
                    flat cottons of about one inch and a quarter broad, another to hold four, a
                    third to hold six, or as much common wick-yarn as is equal to those wicks in
                    bulk, and glass adjutages of different sized apertures to suit the different
                    sized wicks. (See <hi rend="italic">Transactions of the Society for Encouraging
                    Arts,</hi> vol. xxxi.)</p>
                <p>The colipile, fig. 11, has been applied to act as a blowpipe. It is a hollow
                    vessel of brass, sometimes made in form of a small kettle, sometimes in form of
                    a ball of two inches in diameter, with a tube of brass that screws into it. The
                    tube is to be screwed off in order to pour in alcohol by a small funnel, and
                    then the tube being replaced, and heat applied to the bulb, the vapour of the
                    alcohol issues from the small aperture of the tube, and being directed against
                    the flame of a lamp, the flame is driven in a horizontal stream, such as the
                    blow-pipe produces. The instrument has a safety valve, S, to prevent the danger
                    of explosion, which might happen if the nozzle •were stopped. The same wick that
                    heats the bulb may serve to furnish the jet of flame, as is the case in the
                    colipile represented in fig. 11. This instrument has been proposed to be applied
                    to the purposes of the mineralogist; but it does not appear to be either so
                    readily put in action or so efficacious as the common blow-pipe, which is also
                    simpler in its construction, less bulky, and more easily carried about.</p>
                <p>Mr Newman, philosophical instrument-maker, of Lisle Street, London, having
                    observed that air condensed in a cavity required a considerable time to escape
                    through a small aperture made to give it issue, contrived the apparatus
                    represented at fig. 12, which acts as a blow-pipe. This apparatus consists of a
                    strong plate-copper box, perfectly air-tight, three inches in width and height,
                    and four in length; a condensing syringe to force air into the box; and an
                    adjutage with a stop-cock at pne end of the box, <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193198623" xml:id="kp-eb0704-8623-0716"/>by which the issue of the air
                    is regulated. The piston rod of the condensing syringe works through collars of
                    leather in the cap, which has an aperture in the side, and a screw N connected
                    with a stop-cock, which may be made, to communicate with a jar, bladder, or
                    gasometer, containing oxygen, hydrogen, or other gases. When this communication
                    is made, and the condenser worked, the gas contained in the jar or bladder is
                    thrown into the box, and issues through the adjutage upon the flame of a lamp
                    placed near it. When the apparatus is worked with common air, a few strokes of
                    the piston fills the chamber with compressed air. When the cock of the adjutage
                    is opened, the air issues with great velocity in a small stream, and, when
                    directed on the flame of a lamp, produces a jet of flame as the common blow-pipe
                    does, but with more precision and regularity. The force of the stream of air is
                    easily adjusted by opening more or less the stop-cock of the adjutage; and, when
                    the box has been moderately charged, the stream will continue to issue uniformly
                    for twenty minutes; when the strength of the blast begins to decline, it will be
                    restored by working the syringe. The apparatus is very portable, and not liable
                    to injury. It is made by Mr Newman, the inventor, with a lamp adapted to it, so
                    as to pack up in a box not more than six inches in length and four inches in
                    width and height, enough of space being left for other small articles; others he
                    makes in boxes somewhat larger, so as to contain also a selection of chemical
                    tests. (See <hi rend="italic">Journal of Science,</hi> edited by the Royal
                    Institution, No. 1.)</p>
                <p>Sir Humphry Davy having discovered that the explosion from oxygen and hydrogen
                    gases would not communicate through very small apertures, Mr Children proposed
                    to him to employ Newman’s blow-pipe for effecting a combustion of a mixture of
                    oxygen and hydrogen gas issuing from a small aperture. This Sir Humphry did, and
                    found that the flame produced an intense heat, which instantly fused bodies of a
                    very refractory nature. Dr Clarke, professor of mineralogy at Cambridge, having
                    consulted Sir Humphry on the subject, proceeded to expose a great variety of
                    mineral substances to the flame, for the purpose of observing its effects upon
                    each of them. The tube of glass through which the mixture of the two gases
                    issues, is cemented on the pipe of issue of Newman’s blow-pipe. The tube at
                    first used by Dr Clarke was three inches in length, and the diameter of its
                    cavity 7- <hi rend="superscript"> l</hi> (jth of an inch. The end of the tube
                    was constantly breaking during the experiments, owing to the sudden changes of
                    temperature, until at last he usually worked with a tube only one inch and
                    three-eighths in length. When the current of gas is feeble, from the gas in the
                    reservoir having come nearly to the same degree of density as the surrounding
                    air, or from the current being suppressed in the beginning of an experiment,
                    then the flame has a retrograde movement, passing up the capillary cavity of the
                    tube about half an inch, and, after splitting the end of the glass tube, the
                    flame goes out of itself; so that, even in this case, there is no danger of
                    explosion. In order to try the effects of an explosion, four pints of a mixture
                    of the two gases were condensed into the chest, which was all that the syringe
                    could force into it. The glass tube was taken off, so that the diameter of the
                    nose-pipe, by which the gas was to issue, was about one eighth of an inch. A
                    burning spirit-lamp was placed at this aperture, and the stop-cock being opened
                    by means of a long string attached to it, the whole gas exploded with a report
                    like that of a cannon; the chest was burst, the stop-cock driven out,, and one
                    end of the chest was torn off and thrown against the wall of the room. This
                    shows the danger of using the apparatus with too large an aperture, and the
                    necessity of employing a capillary tube.</p>
                <p>When the mixture of the two gases is to be employed in Newman’s blow-pipe, the
                    chest is first exhausted of air, and then the gaseous mixture in a bladder,
                    screwed on at N, is to be forced into the chest by the condensing syringe. The
                    proportions of the two gases which Dr Clarke found to produce the greatest heat
                    are, two volumes of hydrogen and one of oxygen gas. The intensity of the heat is
                    much greater when the gases are pure; the oxygen procured from manganese does
                    not produce nearly so great a heat as that got from the hyper-oxymuriate of
                    potass. The intensity of the heat may be regulated by allowing the gas to issue
                    in a more or less copious stream, which is done by turning the stop-cock. The
                    heat, Dr Clarke thinks, is greater than that produced by the largest galvanic
                    batteries. Most substances hitherto tried are fused by it, so that it is
                    difficult to find supports for holding the subject of experiment to the flame.
                    The supports employed by Dr Clarke were, charcoal, platina, a piece of
                    tobacco-pipe, black lead. Lime, strontian, and alumine, were fused. The metal of
                    strontian was got, and retained its lustre for some hours. The alkalies were
                    fused and volatilized almost the instant they came in contact with the flame.
                    Rock-crystal fused into a transparent glass full of bubbles. Quartz gave the
                    same result. Opal fused into a pearly white enamel. Flint fused rapidly into a
                    white frothy enamel. Blue sapphire melted into greenish glass balloons, ramified
                    singularly. Foliated talc fused into a greenish glass. Peruvian emerald melted
                    into a transparent and colourless glass, without bubbles. Lapis lazuli fused
                    into transparent glass, with a slight tinge of green. Pure foliated native
                    magnesia, from America, is the substance the most difficult of fusion; it is,
                    however, at last reduced to a white opaque enamel. Agalmatolite of China fuses
                    into a limpid colourless glass. Iceland spar is next in difficulty of fusion to
                    the native magnesia; but it does at last melt into a limpid glass, and, during
                    the process, gives an amethyst-coloured flame, as strontian does; the fusion of
                    pure lime and of all its compounds is attended with a flame of the same colour.
                    Diamond first became opaque, and then was gradually volatilized. Gold, fused
                    along with borax, on a piece of tobacco pipe, was nearly all volatilized.
                    Platina wire, ⅛th of an inch in diameter, melted the instant it was brought into
                    contact with the flame of the gas; the melted platina ran down in drops, and the
                    wire burnt as iron wire does in oxygen gas. Brass wire burnt with a green flame,
                    differing from the green flame that salts of copper give. Copper wire melted
                    rapidly without burning. Iron wire burnt with bril hant scintillation. Plumbago
                    melted into a bead which was attractable by the magnet. Blende or native
                    sulphuret of zinc melted, and metallic zinc appeared in the centre of the melted
                    mass. And metalloid oxide of manganese, crystallized in prisms, was reduced to a
                    metallic state. (See Dr Clarke’s Account of his Experiments, in the <hi
