                <p><label type="entry">BEAUTY</label>, <hi rend="smallcaps">That</hi> property in
                    objects by which they are recommended to the power or faculty of taste—the
                    reverse of ugliness —the primary or more general object of love or
                    admiration.</p>
                <p>These, we confess, are rather explanations of the word than definitions of the
                    thing it signifies; and can be of no value, even as explanations of the word,
                    except only to those who understand, without explanation, all the other words
                    they contain. For, if the curious inquirer should proceed to ask, “And what is
                    the faculty or power of taste?” we do not see what other answer we could give,
                    than that it was that of which beauty was the object, or by which we were
                    enabled to discover and to relish what was beautiful. It is material, however,
                    to observe, that if it could be made out, as some have alleged, that our
                    perception of beauty was a simple sensation, like our perception of colour; and
                    that taste was an original and distinct sense, like that of seeing or hearing;
                    this would be truly the only definition that could be given, either of the sense
                    or of its object; and all that we could do in investigating the nature of the
                    latter, would be to digest and enumerate the circumstances under which it was
                    found to present itself to its appropriate organ. All that we can say of colour,
                    if we consider it very strictly, <hi rend="superscript"> ls</hi> &gt; that it is
                    that property in objects by which they are recommended to the faculty of sight;
                    and the facu ty of sight can scarcely be defined in any other way than as that
                    by which we are enabled to discover the existence of colour. When we attempt to
                    proceed farther, and say that green is the colour of grass, and red of roses or
                    blood, it is plain that we do not in any respect explain the nature of those
                    colours, but only <hi rend="italic">give instances</hi> of their occurrence; and
                    that one who had never seen them could earn nothing whatever from these
                    pretended definitions. Complex ideas, on the other hand, and compound emotions,
                    may be always defined, and explained to a certain extent, by enumerating the
                    parts of which they are made up, or resolving them into the elements of which
                    they are composed; and we may thus acquire not only a substantial knowledge of
                    their nature, but a practical power in their regulation or production.</p>
                <p>It becomes of importance, therefore, in the very outset of this inquiry, to
                    consider whether our sense of beauty be really a simple sensation, like some of
                    those we have enumerated, or a compound or derivative feeling, the sources or
                    elements of which maybe investigated and ascertained. If it be the former, we
                    have then only to refer it to the peculiar sense or faculty of which it is the
                    object, and to determine, by repeated observation, under what circumstances it
                    occurs; but, if it be the latter, we have to proceed, by a joint process of
                    observation and reflection, to ascertain what are the primary feelings to which
                    it may be referred, and by what peculiar modification of them it is produced and
                    distinguished. We are not quite prepared as yet to exhaust the whole of this
                    important discussion, to which we shall be obliged to return in the sequel of
                    our inquiry; but it is necessary, in order to explain and to set forth, in their
                    natural order, the difficulties with which the subject is surrounded, to state
                    here, in a very few words, one or two of the most obvious, and, as we think,
                    decisive objections against the notion of beauty being a simple sensation, or
                    the object of a separate and peculiar faculty.</p>
                <p>The first, and perhaps the most considerable, is the want of agreement as to the
                    presence and existence of beauty in particular objects, among men whose
                    organization is perfect, and who are plainly possessed of the faculty, whatever
                    it may be, by which beauty is discerned. Now, <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193195581" xml:id="kp-eb0704-5581-0482"/>no such thing happens, we
                    imagine, or can be conceived to happen, in the case of any other simple
                    sensation, or the exercise of any other distinct faculty. Where one man sees
                    light, all men who have eyes see light also. All men allow grass to be green,
                    and sugar to be sweet, and ice to be cold; and the unavoidable inference from
                    any apparent disagreement in such matters necessarily is, that the party is
                    insane, or entirely destitute of the sense or organ concerned in the perception.
                    With regard to beauty, however, it is obvious at first sight that the case is
                    quite different. One man sees it perpetually, where to another it is quite
                    invisible, or even where its reverse seems to be conspicuous. Nor is this owing
                    to the insensibility of either of the parties; for the same contrariety exists
                    where both are keenly alive to the influences of the beauty they respectively
                    discern. A Chinese or African lover would probably see nothing at all attractive
                    in a belle of London or Paris; and, undoubtedly, an <hi rend="italic">elegans
                    formarum spectator</hi> from either of these cities would discover nothing but
                    deformity in the Venus of the Hottentots. A little distance in time produces the
                    same effects as distance in place: the gardens, the furniture, the dress, which
                    appeared beautiful in the eyes of our grandfathers, are odious and ridiculous in
                    ours. Nay, the difference of rank, education, or employments, gives rise to the
                    same diversity of sensation. The little shopkeeper sees a beauty in his roadside
                    box, and in the staring tile roof, wooden lions, and clipped boxwood, which
                    strike horror into the soul of the student of the picturesque; whilst <hi
                    rend="italic">he</hi> is transported in surveying the fragments of ancient
                    sculpture, which are nothing but ugly masses of mouldering stone in the judgment
                    of the admirer of neatness. It is needless, however, to multiply instances,
                    since the fact admits of no contradiction. But how can we believe that beauty is
                    the object of a peculiar sense or faculty, when persons undoubtedly possessed of
                    the faculty, and even in an eminent degree, can discover nothing of it in
                    objects where it is distinctly felt and perceived by others with the same use of
                    the faculty? This one consideration, we confess, appears to us conclusive
                    against the supposition of beauty being a real property of objects, addressing
                    itself to the power of taste as a separate sense or faculty, and seems to point
                    irresistibly to the conclusion, that our sense of it is the result of other more
                    elementary feelings, into which it may be analyzed or resolved.</p>
                <p>A second objection, however, if possible of still greater force, is suggested by
                    considering the prodigious and almost infinite variety of things to which this
                    property of beauty is ascribed, and the impossibility of imagining any one
                    inherent quality which can belong to them all, and yet at the same time possess
                    so much unity as to be the peculiar object of a separate sense or faculty. All
                    simple qualities that are perceived in any one object are immediately recognised
                    to be <hi rend="italic">the same</hi> when they are again perceived in another;
                    and the objects in which they are thus perceived are at once felt so far to
                    resemble each other, and to partake of the same nature. Thus snow is seen to be
                    white, and chalk is seen to be white; but this is no sooner seen than the two
                    substances, however unlike in other respects, are felt at once to have this
                    quality in common, and to resemble each other in all that relates to the quality
                    of colour and the sense of seeing. Now, is this felt, or could it even be
                    intelligibly asserted, with regard to the quality of beauty? Take even a limited
                    and specific sort of beauty,—for instance the beauty of form. The form of a fine
                    tree is beautiful,—and the form of a fine woman,—and the form of a column, and a
                    vase, and a chandelier. Yet how can it be said that the form of a woman has any
                    thing in common with that of a tree or a temple? or to which of the senses by
                    which forms are distinguished, does it appear they have any resemblance or
                    affinity?</p>
                <p>The matter, however, becomes still more inextricable when we recollect that
                    beauty does not belong merely to forms or colours, but to sounds, and perhaps to
                    the objects of other senses; nay, that in all languages and in all nations, it
                    is not supposed to reside exclusively in material objects, but to belong also to
                    sentiments and ideas, and intellectual and moral existences. Not only is a tree
                    beautiful, as well as a palace or a waterfall; but a poem is beautiful, and a
                    theorem in mathematics, and a contrivance in mechanics. But if things
                    intellectual and totally segregated from matter may thus possess beauty, how can
                    it possibly be a quality of material objects? Or what sense or faculty can that
                    be, whose proper office it is to intimate to us the existence of some property
                    which is common to a flower and a demonstration, a valley and an eloquent
                    discourse?</p>
                <p>The only answer which occurs to this is plainly enough a bad one; but the
                    statement of it, and of its inefficiency, will serve better, perhaps, than any
                    thing else to develope the actual difficulties of the subject, and the true
                    state of the question with regard to them. It may be said, then, in answer to
                    the questions we have suggested above, that all these objects, however various
                    and dissimilar, agree at least in being agreeable; and that this <hi
                    rend="italic">agreeableness,</hi> which is the only quality they possess in
                    common, may probably be the beauty which is ascribed to them all. Now, to those
                    who are accustomed to such discussions, it would be quite enough to reply, that
                    though the agreeableness of such objects depends plainly enough upon their
                    beauty, it by no means follows, but quite the contrary, that their beauty
                    depends upon their agreeableness; the latter being the more comprehensive or
                    generic term, under which beauty must rank as one of the species. Its nature,
                    therefore, is no more explained, nor is less absurdity substantially committed,
                    by saying that things are beautiful because they are agreeable, than if we were
                    to give the same explanation of the sweetness of sugar; for no one, we suppose,
                    will dispute, that though it be very true that sugar is agreeable because it is
                    sweet, it would be manifestly preposterous to say that it was sweet because it
                    was agreeable. For the benefit, however, of those who wish or require to be more
                    regularly initiated in these mysteries, we beg leave to add a few
                    observations.</p>
                <p>In the first place, then, it seems evident that agreeableness in general cannot
                    be the same with beauty, because there are very many things in the highest
                    degree agreeable that can in no sense be called beautiful. Moderate heat, and
                    savoury food, and rest, and exercise, are agreeable to the body; but none of
                    these can be called beautiful: and, among objects of a higher class, the love
                    and esteem of others, and fame, and a good conscience, and health, and riches,
                    and wisdom, are all eminently agreeable; but not at all beautiful, according to
                    any intelligible use of the word. It is plainly quite absurd, therefore, to say
                    that beauty consists in agreeableness, without specifying in consequence of what
                    it is agreeable; or to hold that any thing whatever is taught as to its nature,
                    by merely classing it among our pleasurable emotions.</p>
                <p>In the second place, however, we may remark, that among all the objects that are
                    agreeable, whether they are also beautiful or not, scarcely any two are
                    agreeable on account of the same qualities, or even suggest their agreeableness
                    to the same faculty or organ. Most certainly there is no resemblance or affinity
                    whatever between the qualities which make a peach agreeable to the palate, and a
                    beautiful statue to the eye; which soothe us in an easy chair by the fire, or
                    delight us in a philosophical discovery.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:193195594" xml:id="kp-eb0704-5594-0483"/>
                <p>The truth is, that agreeableness is not properly a quality of any object
                    whatsoever, but the effect or result of certain qualities, the nature of which
                    we can generally define pretty exactly, or of which we know at least with
                    certainty that they manifest themselves respectively to some one particular
                    sense or faculty, and to no other; and consequently it would be just as
                    obviously ridiculous to suppose a faculty or organ, whose office it was to
                    perceive agreeableness, as to suppose that agreeableness was a distinct quality
                    that could thus be perceived.</p>
                <p>The class of agreeable objects, thanks to the bounty of Providence, is
                    exceedingly large. Certain things are agreeable to the palate, and others to the
                    smell and to the touch. Some, again, are agreeable to our faculty of
                    imagination, to our understanding, or to our moral feelings; and none of all
                    these we call beautiful. But there are others which we do call beautiful; and
                    those we say are agreeable to our faculty of taste: yet when we come to ask what
                    is the faculty of taste, and what are the qualities which recommend them to that
                    faculty, we find ourselves just where we were at the beginning of the
                    discussion, and embarrassed with all the difficulties arising from the
                    prodigious diversity of objects which seem to possess these qualities.</p>
                <p>We know pretty well what is the faculty of seeing or hearing; or, at least, we
                    know that what is agreeable to one of those faculties, has no effect whatever on
                    the other. We know that bright colours afford no delight to the ear, nor sweet
                    tones to the eye; and are therefore perfectly assured that the qualities which
                    make the visible objects agreeable, cannot be the same with those which give
                    pleasure to the ear. But it is by the eye and by the ear that all material
                    beauty is perceived; and yet the beauty which discloses itself to these two
                    separate senses, and plainly depends upon qualities which have no sort of
                    affinity, is supposed to be one distinct quality, and to be perceived by a
                    peculiar sense or faculty I The perplexity becomes still greater when we think
                    of the beauty of poems or theorems, and endeavour to imagine what qualities they
                    can possess in common with the agreeable modifications of light or of sound.</p>
                <p>It is in these considerations undoubtedly that the difficulty of the subject
                    consists. The faculty of taste, plainly, is not a faculty, like any of the
                    external senses, the range of whose objects is limited and precise, as well as
                    the qualities by which they are gratified or offended; and beauty, accordingly,
                    is discovered in an infinite variety of objects, among which it seems at first
                    sight impossible to discover any other bond of connection. Yet boundless as
                    their diversity may appear, it is plain that they <hi rend="italic">must</hi>
                    resemble each other in <hi rend="italic">something,</hi> and in something more
                    definite and definable than in merely being agreeable; since they are all
                    classed together, in every tongue and nation, under the common appellation of
                    beautiful, and are felt indeed to produce emotions in the mind that have some
                    sort of kindred or affinity. The words <hi rend="italic">beauty</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">beautiful,</hi> in short, must mean something, and are universally
                    felt to mean something, much more definite than agreeableness or gratification
                    in general; and while it is confessedly by no means easy to describe or define
                    what that something is, the force and clearness of our perception of it is
                    demonstrated by the readiness with which we determine, in any particular
                    instance, whether the object of a given pleasurable emotion is or is not
                    properly described as beauty.</p>
                <p>What we have already said, we confess, appears to us conclusive against the idea
                    of this beauty being any fixed ° <hi rend="superscript"> r</hi> inherent
                    property of the objects to which it is ascribed, or itself the object of any
                    separate and independent faculty; and we will no longer conceal from the reader
                    what we take to be the true solution of the difficulty. In our opinion, then,
                    our sense of beauty depends entirely on our previous experience of simpler
                    pleasures or emotions, and consists in the <hi rend="italic">suggestion</hi> of
                    agreeable or interesting sensations with which we had formerly been familiar by
                    the direct and intelligible agency of our common sensibilities; and that vast
                    variety of objects, to which we give the common name of beautiful, become
                    entitled to that appellation, merely because they all possess the power of
                    recalling or reflecting those sensations of which they have been the
                    accompaniments, or with which they have been associated in our imagination by
                    any other more casual bond of connection. According to this view of the matter,
                    therefore, beauty is not an inherent property or quality of objects at all, but
                    the result of the accidental relations in which they may stand to our experience
                    of pleasures or emotions,—and does not depend upon any particular configuration
                    of parts, proportions, or colours, in external things, nor upon the unity,
                    coherence, or simplicity of intellectual creations, but merely upon the
                    associations which, in the case of every individual, may enable these inherent,
                    and otherwise indifferent qualities, to suggest or recall to the mind emotions
                    of a pleasurable or interesting description. It follows, therefore, that no
                    object is beautiful in itself, or could appear so, antecedently to our
                    experience of direct pleasures or emotions; and that, as an infinite variety of
                    objects may thus reflect interesting ideas, so all of them may acquire the title
                    of beautiful, although utterly diverse and disparate in their nature, and
                    possessing nothing in common but this accidental power of reminding us of other
                    emotions.</p>
                <p>This theory, which we believe is now very generally adopted, though under many
                    needless qualifications, shall be further developed and illustrated in the
                    sequel. But at present we shall only remark, that it serves at least to solve
                    the great problem involved in the discussion, by rendering it easily conceivable
                    how objects which have no inherent resemblance, nor indeed any one quality in
                    common, should yet be united in one common relation, and consequently acquire
                    one common epithet,—just as all the things that belonged to a beloved individual
                    may serve to remind us of him, and thus to awake a kindred class of emotions,
                    though just as unlike each other as any of the objects that are classed under
                    the general name of beautiful. His poetry, for instance, or his slippers,—his
                    acts of bounty, or his saddle-horse,—may lead to the same chain of interesting
                    remembrances, and thus agree in possessing a power of excitement, for the
                    sources of which we should look in vain through all the variety of their
                    physical or metaphysical qualities.</p>
                <p>By the help of the same consideration, we get rid of all the mystery of a
                    peculiar sense or faculty, imagined for the express purpose of perceiving
                    beauty; and discover that the power of taste is nothing more than the habit of
                    tracing those associations, by which almost all objects may be connected with
                    interesting emotions. It is easy to understand, that the recollection of any
                    scene of delight or emotion must produce a certain agreeable sensation, and that
                    the objects which introduce these recollections should not appear altogether
                    indifferent to us: nor is it, perhaps, very difficult to imagine, that
                    recollections thus strikingly suggested by some real and present existence
                    should present themselves under a different aspect, and move the mind somewhat
                    differently from those which arise spontaneously in the ordinary course of our
                    reflections, and do not thus grow out of a direct and peculiar impression.</p>
                <p>The whole of this doctrine, however, we shall endeavour by and by to establish
                    upon more direct evidence; but having now explained, in a general way, both the
                    <pb break="no" facs="nls:193195607" xml:id="kp-eb0704-5607-0484"/> difficulties
                    of the subject, and our suggestion as to their true solution, it is proper that
                    we should take a short review of the more considerable theories that have been
                    proposed for the elucidation of this curious question; which is one of the most
                    delicate, as well as the most popular, in the science of metaphysics,—was one of
                    the earliest which exercised the speculative ingenuity of philosophers,—and has
                    at last, we think, been more successfully treated than any other of a similar
                    description.</p>
                <p>In most of these speculations we shall find rather imperfect truth than
                    fundamental error,—or, at all events, such errors only as arise naturally from
                    that peculiar difficulty which we have already endeavoured to explain, as
                    consisting in the prodigious multitude and diversity of the objects in which the
                    common quality of beauty was to be accounted for. Those who nave not been
                    sufficiently aware of the difficulty have generally dogmatized from a small
                    number of instances, and have rather given examples of the occurrence of beauty
                    in some few classes of objects, than afforded any light as to that upon which it
                    essentially depended in all; whilst those who felt its full force have very
                    often found no other resource than to represent beauty as consisting in
                    properties so extremely vague and general (such, for example, as the power of
                    exciting ideas of relation), as almost to elude our comprehension, and, at the
                    same time, of so abstract and metaphysical a description, as not to be very
                    intelligibly stated as the radicals of a strong, familiar, and pleasurable
                    emotion. This last observation leads us to make one other remark upon the
                    general character of these theories; and this is, that some of them seem
                    necessarily to imply the existence of a peculiar sense or faculty for the
                    perception of beauty, as they resolve it into properties that are not in any way
                    interesting or agreeable to any of our known faculties. Such are all those which
                    make it consist in proportion,— or in variety, combined with regularity,—or in
                    waving lines,—or in unity,—or in the perception of relations,— without
                    explaining, or attempting to explain, how any of these things should affect us
                    with any delight or emotion. Others, again, do not require the supposition of
                    any such separate faculty; because in them the sense of beauty is considered as
                    arising from other more simple and familiar emotions, which are in themselves
                    and beyond all dispute agreeable. Such are those which teach that beauty depends
                    on the perception of utility, or of design, or of fitness, or in tracing
                    associations between its objects and the common joys or emotions of our nature.
                    Which of these two classes of speculation (to one or other of which, we believe,
                    all theories of beauty may be reduced) is the most philosophical in itself, we
                    imagine can admit of no question; and we hope, in the sequel, to leave it as
                    little doubtful, which is to be considered as most consistent with the fact. In
                    the meantime, we must give a short account of some of the theories
                    themselves.</p>
                <p>The most ancient of which it seems necessary to take any notice, is that which
                    may be traced in the Dialogues of Plato,—though we are very far from pretending
                    that it is possible to give any intelligible or consistent account of its tenor.
                    It should never be forgotten, however, that it is to this subtile and ingenious
                    spirit that we owe the suggestion that it is <hi rend="italic">Mind</hi> alone
                    that is beautiful; and that, in perceiving beauty, it only contemplates the
                    shadow of its own affections ;—a doctrine which, however mystically unfolded in
                    his writings, or however combined with extravagant or absurd speculations,
                    unquestionably carries in it the germ of all the truth that has since been
                    revealed on the subject. By far the largest dissertation, however, that this
                    great philosopher has left upon the nature of beauty, is to be found in the
                    dialogue entitled <hi rend="italic">The Greater Hippias,</hi> which is entirely
                    devoted to that inquiry.</p>
                <p>We do not learn a great deal of the author’s own opinion indeed, from this
                    performance; for it is one of the dia- ' logues which have been termed <hi
                    rend="italic">anatrβptic</hi> or confuting, in which nothing is concluded in the
                    affirmative, but a series of sophistical suggestions or hypotheses are
                    successively exposed. The plan of it is to lead on Hippias, a shallow and
                    confident sophist, to make a variety of dogmatical assertions as to the nature
                    of beauty, and then to make him retract and abandon them upon the statement of
                    some obvious objections. Socrates and he agree at first in the notable
                    proposition, “that beauty is that by which all beautiful things are beautiful
                    and then, after a great number of suggestions, by far too childish and absurd to
                    be worthy of any notice, such as, that the beautiful may peradventure be gold,
                    or a fine woman, or a handsome mare, they at last get to some suppositions,
                    which show that almost all the theories that have since been propounded on this
                    interesting subject, had occurred thus early to the active and original mind of
                    this keen and curious inquirer. Thus Socrates first suggests that beauty may
                    consist in the fitness or suitableness of any object to the place it occupies;
                    and afterwards more generally and directly, that it may consist in utility; a
                    notion which is ultimately rejected, however, upon the subtile consideration
                    that the useful is that which produces good, and that the producer and the
                    product being necessarily different, it would follow, upon that supposition,
                    that beauty could not be good, nor good beautiful. Finally, he suggests, that
                    beauty may be the mere organic delight of the eye or the ear,—to which, after
                    stating very slightly the objection, that it would be impossible to account upon
                    this ground for the beauty of poetry or eloquence, he proceeds to rear up a more
                    refined and elaborate refutation, upon such grounds as these: If beauty be the
                    proper name of that which is naturally agreeable to the sight and hearing, it is
                    plain that the objects to which it is ascribed must possess some common and
                    distinguishable property besides that of being agreeable, in consequence of
                    which they are separated and set apart from objects that are agreeable to our
                    <hi rend="italic">other</hi> senses and faculties, and, at the same time,
                    classed together under the common appellation of beautiful. Now we are not only
                    quite unable to discover what this property is, but it is manifest that objects
                    which make themselves known to the ear <hi rend="italic">can</hi> have no
                    property as such in common with objects that make themselves known to the eye;
                    it being impossible that an object which is beautiful by its colour, can be
                    beautiful from the same quality with another which is beautiful by its sound.
                    From all which it is inferred, that, as beauty is admitted to be something real,
                    it cannot be merely what is agreeable to the organs of sight or hearing.</p>
                <p>There is no practical wisdom, we admit, in those finedrawn speculations; nor any
                    of that spirit of patient observation by which alone any sound view of such
                    objects can ever be attained. There are also many marks of that singular
                    incapacity to distinguish between what is absolutely puerile and silly, and what
                    is plausible, at least, and ingenious, which may be reckoned among the
                    characteristics of “the divine philosopher,” and in some degree of all the
                    philosophers of antiquity: but they show clearly enough the subtile and abstract
                    character of Greek speculation, and prove at how eärly a period, and to how
                    great an extent, the inherent difficulties of the subject were felt, and
                    produced their appropriate effects.</p>
                <p>There are some hints on these subjects in the works of Xenophon, and some
                    scattered observations in those of Cicero, who was.the first, we believe, to
                    observe that the sense of beauty is peculiar to man; but nothing else, we
                    believe, in classical antiquity which requires to be analyzed or explained. It
                    appears that St Augustin composed a <pb break="no" facs="nls:193195620"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0704-5620-0485"/>large treatise on beauty, and it is to be lamented
                    that the speculations of that acute and ardent genius on such a subject have
                    been lost. We discover, from incidental notices in other parts of his writings,
                    that he conceived the beauty of all objects to depend on their unity, or on the
                    perception of the principle or design which fixed the relations of their various
                    parts, and presented them to the intellect or imagination as one harmonious
                    whole. It would not be fair to deal very strictly with a theory with which we
                    are so imperfectly acquainted: but it may be observed, that, while the author is
                    so far in the right as to make beauty consist in a relation to mind, and not in
                    <hi rend="subscript"> an</hi> y physical quality, he has taken far too narrow
                    and circumscribed a view of the matter, and one which seems almost exclusively
                    applicable to works of human art; it being plain enough, we think, that a
                    beautiful landscape, ora beautiful horse, has no more unity, and no more traces
                    of design, than one which is not beautiful.</p>
                <p>We do not pretend to know what the schoolmen taught upon this subject during the
                    dark ages, but the discussion does not seem to have been resumed for long after
                    the revival of letters. The followers of Leibnitz were pleased to maintain that
                    beauty consisted in perfection; but what constituted perfection they did not
                    attempt to define. M. Crouzas wrote a long essay to show that beauty depended on
                    these five elements, variety, unity, regularity, order, and proportion; and the
                    Père André, a still longer one to prove, that, admitting these to be the true
                    foundations of beauty, it was still most important to consider, that the beauty
                    which results from them is either essential, or natural, or artificial, and that
                    it may be greater or less, according as the characteristics of each of these
                    classes are combined or set in opposition.</p>
                <p>Among ourselves we are not aware of any considerable publication on the subject
                    till the appearance of Lord Shaftesbury’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Characteristics,</hi> in which a sort of rapturous Platonic doctrine is
                    delivered as to the existence of a primitive and supreme good and beauty, and of
                    a certain internal sense, by which both beauty and moral merit were
                    distinguished. Addison published several ingenious papers in <hi rend="italic"
                    >The Spectator</hi> on the pleasures of the imagination, and was the first, we
                    believe, who referred them to the specific sources of beauty, sublimity, and
                    novelty. He did not enter much, however, into the metaphysical discussion of the
                    nature of beauty itself; and the first philosophical treatise of note that
                    appeared on the subject may be said to have been the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Inquiry</hi> of Dr Hutcheson, first published, we believe, in 1725.</p>
                <p>In this work the notion of a peculiar internal sense, by which we are made
                    sensible of the existence of beauty, is very boldly promulgated, and maintained
                    by many ingenious arguments. Yet nothing, we conceive, can be more extravagant
                    than such a proposition; and nothing but the radical faults of the other parts
                    of the hypothesis could possibly have driven the learned author to its adoption.
                    Even after the existence of this sixth sense was assumed, be felt that it was
                    still necessary that he should explain what were the qualities by which it was
                    gratified, and these, he was pleased to allege, were nothing but the
                    combinations of variety with uniformity; all objects, as he has himself
                    expressed it, which are equally uniform being beautiful in proportion to their
                    variety, and all objects equally various being beautiful in proportion to their
                    uni-ormity. Now, not to insist upon the obvious and radical objection that this
                    is not true in fact, as to flowers, landscapes, or indeed of any thing but
                    architecture, if it be rue of that, it could not fail to strike the ingenious
                    au- <hi rend="superscript"> lur</hi> that these qualities of uniformity and
                    variety were <hi rend="superscript"> n</hi> °t °‘ themselves agreeable to any of
                    our known senses <hi rend="superscript"> 0r</hi> aculties, except when
                    considered as symbols of utility or design, and therefore could not intelligibly
                    account for the very lively emotions which we often experience from the
                    perception of beauty, where the notion of design or utility was not at all
                    suggested. He was constrained, therefore, either to abandon this view of the
                    nature of beauty altogether, or to imagine a new sense or faculty, whose
                    characteristic and description it should be to receive delight from the
                    combinations of uniformity and variety, without any consideration of their being
                    significant of things agreeable to our faculties; and this being accomplished by
                    the mere force of the assumption and the definition, there was no room for
                    further dispute or difficulty in the matter.</p>
                <p>Some of Hutcheson’s followers, such as Gerard and others, who were a little
                    startled at the notion of a separate faculty, and yet wished to retain the
                    doctrine of beauty depending on variety and uniformity, endeavoured, ’
                    accordingly, to show that these qualities were <hi rend="italic">naturally'</hi>
                    agreeable to the mind, and were recommended by considerations arising from its
                    most familiar properties. Uniformity or simplicity, it is said, renders our
                    conception of objects easy, and saves the mind from all fatigue and distraction
                    in the consideration of them; whilst variety, if circumscribed and limited by an
                    ultimate uniformity, gives it a pleasing exercise and excitement, and keeps its
                    energies in a state of pleasurable activity. Now this appears to us to be mere
                    trifling. The varied and lively emotions which we receive from the perception of
                    beauty obviously have no sort of resemblance to the pleasure of moderate
                    intellectual exertion; nor can any thing be conceived more utterly dissimilar
                    than the gratification we have in gazing on the form of a lovely woman, and the
                    satisfaction we receive from working an easy problem in arithmetic or geometry.
                    If a triangle is more beautiful than a regular polygon, as those authors
                    maintain, merely because its figure is more easily comprehended, the number <hi
                    rend="italic">four</hi> should be more beautiful than the number three hundred
                    and twenty-seven, and the form of a gibbet far more agreeable than that of a
                    branching oak. The radical error, in short, consists in fixing upon properties
                    that are not interesting in themselves, and can never be conceived, therefore,
                    to excite any emotion, as the fountainspring of all our emotions of beauty; and
                    it is an absurdity that must infallibly lead to others,—whether these take the
                    shape of a violent attempt to disguise the truly indifferent nature of the
                    properties so selected, or of the bolder expedient of creating a peculiar
                    faculty, whose office it is to find them interesting.</p>
                <p>The next remarkable theory was that proposed by Edmund Burke, in his <hi
                    rend="italic">Treatise of the Sublime and Beautiful,</hi> But of this, in spite
                    of the great name of the author, we cannot persuade ourselves that it is
                    necessary to say much. His explanation is founded upon a species of materialism,
                    —not much to have been expected from the general character of his genius, or the
                    strain of his other speculations,—for it resolves entirely into this, that all
                    objects appear beautiful which have the power of producing a peculiar relaxation
                    of our nerves and fibres, and thus inducing a certain degree of bodily langour
                    and sinking. Of all the suppositions that have been at any time hazarded to
                    explain the phenomena of beauty, this, we think, is the most unfortunate, and
                    the most weakly supported. There is no philosophy in the doctrine; and the
                    fundamental assumption is in every way contradicted by the most familiar
                    experience. There is no relaxation of the fibres in the perception of beauty,
                    and there is no pleasure in the relaxation of the fibres. If there were, it
                    would follow that a warm bath would be by far the most beautiful thing in the
                    world, and that the brilliant lights and bracing airs of a fine autumn morning
                    would be the very reverse <pb break="no" facs="nls:193195633"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0704-5633-0486"/>of beautiful. Accordingly, though the treatise
                    alluded to will always be valuable on account of the many fine and just remarks
                    it contains, we are not aware that there is any accurate inquirer into the
                    subject (with the exception, perhaps, of Mr Price, in whose hands, however, the
                    doctrine assumes a new character), by whom the fundamental principle of the
                    theory has not been explicitly abandoned.</p>
                <p>A yet more extravagant doctrine was soon afterwards inculcated, and in a tone of
                    great authority, in a long article from the brilliant pen of Diderot, in the
                    French <hi rend="italic">Encyclopedic,</hi> and one which exemplifies, in a very
                    striking manner, the nature of the difficulties with which the discussion is
                    embarrassed. This ingenious person, perceiving at once that the beauty which we
                    ascribe to a particular class of objects could not be referred to any peculiar
                    and inherent quality in the objects themselves, but depended upon their power of
                    exciting certain sentiments in our minds,—and being, at the same time, at a loss
                    to discover what common power could belong to so vast a variety of objects as
                    pass under the general appellation of beautiful, or by what tie all the various
                    emotions which are excited by the perception of beauty could be united,— was at
                    last driven, by his sense of the necessity of keeping his definition
                    sufficiently wide and comprehensive, to hazard the strange assertion, that all
                    objects were beautiful which excite in us the idea of <hi rend="italic"
                    >relation;</hi> that our sense of beauty consisted in tracing out the relations
                    which the object possessing it might have to other objects; and that its beauty
                    was in proportion to the number and clearness of the relations thus suggested
                    and perceived. It is scarcely necessary, we presume, to expose by any arguments
                    the manifest fallacy, or rather the palpable absurdity, of such a theory as
                    this. In the first place, we conceive it to be obvious, that all objects
                    whatever have an infinite, and consequently an equal number of relations, and
                    are equally likely to suggest them to those to whom they are presented: at all
                    events, it is certain that ugly and disagreeable objects have just as many
                    relations as those that are agreeable, and ought, therefore, to be just as
                    beautiful, if the sense of beauty consists in the perception of relations. In
                    the next place, it seems to be sufficiently certain, from the experience and
                    common feelings of all men, that the perception of relations among objects is
                    not in itself accompanied by any pleasure whatever, and in particular has no
                    conceivable resemblance to the emotion we receive from the perception of beauty.
                    When we perceive one ugly old woman sitting exactly opposite to two other ugly
                    old women, and observe at the same moment that the first is as big as the other
                    two taken together, we humbly conceive that this clear perception of the
                    relations in which these three graces stand to each other cannot well be
                    mistaken for a sense of beauty, and that it does not in the least abate or
                    interfere with our sense of their ugliness. Finally, we may observe, that the
                    sense of beauty results instantaneously from the perception of the object;
                    whereas the discovery of its relations to other objects must necessarily be a
                    work of time and reflection, in the course of which the beauty of the object, so
                    far from being created or brought into notice, must, in fact, be lost sight of
                    and forgotten.</p>
                <p>Another more plausible and ingenious theory was suggested by the Père Buffier,
                    and afterwards adopted and I illustrated with great talent in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Discourses</hi> of Sir Joshua Reynolds. According to this
                    doctrine, beauty consists, as Aristotle held virtue to do, in mediocrity, or
                    conformity to that which was most usual. Thus a beautiful nose, to make use of
                    Dr Smith’s very apt illustration of this doctrine, is one that is neither very
                    long nor very short, very straight nor very much bent, but of an ordinary form
                    and proportion compared with all the extremes. It is the form, in short, which
                    nature seems to have aimed at in all cases, though she has more frequently
                    deviated from it than hit it; but deviating from it in all directions, all her
                    deviations come nearer to it than they ever do to each other. Thus the most
                    beautiful in every species of creatures bears the greatest resemblance to the
                    whole species, while monsters are so denominated because they bear the least;
                    and thus the beautiful, though in one sense the rarest, as the exact medium is
                    but seldom hit, is invariably the most common, because it is the central point
                    from which all the deviations are the least remote. This view of the matter is
                    adopted by Sir Joshua in its full extent, and is even carried so rar by this
                    great artist, that he does not scruple to conclude, “That if we were more used
                    to deformity than beauty, deformity would then lose the idea that is now annexed
                    to it, and take that of beauty ;—just as we approve and admire fashions in
                    dress, for no other reason than that we are used to them.”</p>
                <p>Now, not to dwell upon the very startling conclusion to which these principles
                    must lead, viz. that things are beautiful in proportion as they are ordinary,
                    and that it is merely their familiarity which constitutes their beauty, we would
                    observe, in the first place, that the whole theory seems to have been suggested
                    by a consideration of animal forms, or perhaps of the human figure exclusively.
                    In these forms, it is quite true that great and monstrous deviations from the
                    usual proportions are extremely disagreeable. But this, we have no doubt, arises
                    entirely from some idea of pain or disaster attached to their existence, or from
                    their obvious unfitness for the functions they have to perform. In vegetable
                    forms, accordingly, these irregularities excite no such disgust; it being, in
                    fact, the great object of culture, in almost all the more beautiful kinds, to
                    produce what may be called monstrosities. And, in mineral substances, where the
                    idea of suffering is still more completely excluded, it is notorious that, so
                    far from the more ordinary configurations being thought the most beautiful, this
                    epithet is scarcely ever employed but to denote some rare and unusual
                    combination of veins, colours, or dimensions. As to landscapes, again, and
                    almost all the works of art, without exception, the theory is plainly altogether
                    incapable of application. In what sense, for example, can it be said that the
                    beauty of natural scenery consists in mediocrity; or that these landscapes are
                    the most beautiful that are the most common? or what meaning can we attach to
                    the proposition, that the most beautiful building, or picture, or poem, is that
                    which bears the nearest resemblance to all the individuals of its class, and is,
                    upon the whole, the most ordinary and common?</p>
                <p>To a doctrine which is liable to these obvious and radical objections, it is not
                    perhaps necessary to make any other; but we must remark further, <hi
                    rend="italic">first,</hi> That it necessarily supposes that our sense of beauty
                    is, in all cases, preceded by such a large comparison between various
                    individuals of the same species, as may enable us to ascertain that average or
                    mean form in which beauty is suppos· ed to consist, and, consequently, that we
                    could never discover any object to be beautiful antecedently to such a
                    comparison; and, <hi rend="italic">secondly,</hi> That, even if we were to allow
                    that this theory afforded some explanation of the superior beauty of any one
                    object compared with others of the same class, it plainly furnishes no
                    explanation whatever o the superior beauty of one class of objects compared wit
                    another. We-may believe, if we please, that one peacoc is handsomer than another
                    because it approaches more nearly to the average or mean form of peacocks in
                    general; but this reason will avail us nothing whatever in e <hi
                    rend="superscript"> χ</hi> '</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:193195646" xml:id="kp-eb0704-5646-0487"/>
                <p>plaining why any peacock is handsomer than any pelican or penguin. We may say,
                    without manifest absurdity, that the most beautiful pig is that which has least
                    of the extreme qualities that sometimes occur in the tribe; but it would be
                    palpably absurd to give this reason, or any thing like it, for the superior
                    beauty of the tribe of antelopes or spaniels. .</p>
                <p>The notion, in short, seems to have been hastily adopted by the ingenious persons
                    who have maintained it, partly upon the narrow ground of the disgust produced by
                    monsters in the animal creation, which has been already sufficiently
                    explained,—and partly in consequence of the fallacy which lurks in the vague and
                    general proposition of those things being beautiful which are neither <hi
                    rend="italic">too</hi> big nor <hi rend="italic">too</hi> little, <hi
                    rend="italic">too</hi> massive nor <hi rend="italic">too</hi> slender, &amp;c.;
                    from which it was concluded that beauty must consist in mediocrity:— not
                    considering that the particle <hi rend="italic">too</hi> merely denotes those
                    degrees which are exclusive of beauty, without in any way fixing what those
                    degrees are. For the plain meaning of these phrases is, that the rejected
                    objects are too massive or too slender <hi rend="italic">to be beautiful;</hi>
                    and, therefore, to say that an object is beautiful which is neither too big nor
                    too little, &amp;c. is really saying nothing more than that beautiful objects
                    are such as are not in any degree ugly or disagreeable. The illustration as to
                    the effects of use or custom in the article of dress is singularly inaccurate
                    and delusive; the fact being, that we never admire the dress which we are most
                    accustomed to see,—which is that of the common people,—but the dress of the few
                    who are distinguished by rank or opulence; and that we require no more custom or
                    habit to make us admire this dress, whatever it may be, than is necessary to
                    associate it in our thoughts with the wealth and dignity of those who wear
                    it.</p>
                <p>We need say nothing in this place of the opinions expressed on the subject of
                    beauty by Dr Gerard, Dr Blair, and a whole herd of rhetoricians, because none of
                    them pretend to have any new or original notions with regard to it, and, in
                    general, have been at no pains to reconcile or render consistent the various
                    accounts of the matter which they have contented themselves with assembling and
                    laying before their readers altogether, as affording among them the best
                    explanation that could be offered of the question. Thus they do not scruple to
                    say, that the sense of beauty is sometimes produced by the mere organic
                    affection of the senses of sight or hearing; at other times by a perception of a
                    kind of regular variety; and in other instances by the association of
                    interesting conceptions;—thus abandoning altogether any attempt to answer the
                    radical question, how the feeling of beauty should be excited by such opposite
                    causes,—and confounding together, without any attempt at discrimination, those
                    theories which imply the existence of a separate sense or faculty, and those
                    which resolve our sense of beauty into other more simple or familiar
                    emotions.</p>
                <p>More recently, however, we have had three publications on the subject, of a far
                    higher character,—we mean Mr Alison’s <hi rend="italic">Essays on the Nature and
                    Principles of Taste,</hi> Mr Payne Knight’s <hi rend="italic">Analytical
                    Inquiry</hi> into the same objects, and Mr Dugald Stewart’s Dissertations on the
                    Beautiful, and on Taste, in his volume of <hi rend="italic">Philosophical
                    Essays.</hi> All these works possess an infinite deal of merit, and have among
                    them disclosed almost all the truth that is to be known on the subject; though,
                    as it seems to us, with some little admixture of error, from which it will not,
                    however, be difficult to separate it.</p>
                <p>Mr Alison maintains, that all beauty, or at least that all the beauty of material
                    objects, depends on the associations that may have connected them with the
                    ordinary attections or emotions of our nature; and in this, which <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ls</hi> * <hi rend="superscript"> 31e</hi> fundamental point
                    of his theory, we conceive him to be no less clearly right, than he is
                    convincing and judicious in the copious and beautiful illustration by which he
                    has sought to establish its truth. When he proceeds, however, to assert that our
                    sense of beauty consists not merely in the suggestion of ideas of emotion, but
                    in the contemplation of <hi rend="italic">a connected series</hi> of such ideas,
                    and indicates a state of mind in which the faculties, half active and half
                    passive, are given up to a sort of reverie or musing, in which they may wander,
                    though among kindred impressions, far enough from the immediate object of
                    perception, we will confess that he not only seems to us to advance a very
                    questionable proposition, but very essentially to endanger the evidence, as well
                    as the consistency, of his general doctrine. We are far from denying, that, in
                    minds of sensibility and of reflecting habits, the contemplation of beautiful
                    objects will be apt, especially in moments of leisure, and when the mind is
                    vacant, to give rise to such trains of thought, and to such protracted
                    meditations; but we cannot possibly admit that their existence is necessary to
                    the perception of beauty, or that it is in this state of mind exclusively that
                    the sense of beauty exists. The perception of beauty, on the contrary, we hold
                    to be, in most cases, quite instantaneous, and altogether as immediate as the
                    perception of the external qualities of the object to which it is ascribed.
                    Indeed, it seems only necessary to recollect, that it is to a present material
                    object that we actually ascribe and refer this beauty, and that the only thing
                    to be explained is, how this object comes to appear beautiful. In the long train
                    of interesting meditations, however, to which Mr Alison refers,—in the
                    delightful reveries in which he would make the sense of beauty consist,—it is
                    obvious that we must soon lose sight of the external object which gave the first
                    impulse to our thoughts; and though we may <hi rend="italic">afteruiards</hi>
                    reflect upon it, with increased interest and gratitude, as the parent of so many
                    charming images, it is impossible, we conceive, that the perception of <hi
                    rend="italic">its</hi> beauty can ever depend upon a long series of various and
                    shifting emotions.</p>
                <p>It likewise occurs to us to observe, that if every thing were beautiful which was
                    the occasion of a train of ideas of emotion, it is not easy to see why objects
                    that are called ugly should not be entitled to that appellation. If they are
                    sufficiently ugly not to be viewed with indifference, they too will give rise to
                    ideas of emotion; and those ideas are just as likely to run into trains and
                    series as those of a more agreeable description. Nay, as contrast itself is one
                    of the principles of association, it is not at all unlikely that, in the train
                    of impressive ideas which the sight of ugly objects may excite, a transition may
                    be ultimately made to such as are connected with pleasure; and, therefore, if
                    the perception of the beauty of the object which first suggested them depended
                    upon its having produced a series of ideas of emotion, or even of agreeable
                    emotions, there seems to be no good reason for doubting that ugly objects may
                    thus be as beautiful as any other, and that beauty and ugliness may be one and
                    the same thing. Such is the danger, as it appears to us, of deserting the object
                    itself, or going beyond its immediate effect and impression, in order to
                    discover the sources of its beauty. Our view of the matter is safer, we think,
                    and far more simple. We conceive the object to be associated, either in our past
                    experience, or by some universal analogy, with pleasures or emotions that upon
                    the whole are pleasant; and that these associated pleasures are instantaneously
                    suggested, as soon as the object is presented, and by the first glimpse of its
                    physical properties, with which, indeed, they are con-substantiated and
                    confounded in our sensations.</p>
                <p>The work of Mr Knight is more lively, various, and dis-: cursive, than Mr
                    Alison’s, but not so systematic or conclusive<pb break="no" facs="nls:193195659"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0704-5659-0488"/>. It is the cleverer book of the two, but not the
                    most philosophical discussion of the subject. He agrees with Mr Alison in
                    holding the most important, and, indeed, the only considerable part of beauty,
                    to depend upon association; and has illustrated this opinion with a great
                    variety of just and original observation. But he maintains, and maintains
                    stoutly, that there is a beauty independent of association—prior to it, and more
                    original and fundamental—the primitive and natural beauty of colours and sounds.
                    Now this we look upon to be a heresy, and a heresy inconsistent with the very
                    first principles of catholic philosophy. We shall not stop at present to give
                    our reasons for this opinion, which we shall illustrate at large before we bring
                    this article to a close; but we beg leave merely to suggest at present, that if
                    our sense of beauty be confessedly in most cases the mere image or reflection of
                    pleasures or emotions that have been associated with objects in themselves
                    indifferent, it cannot fail to appear strange that it should also on some few
                    occasions be a mere organic or sensual gratification of the particular organs.
                    Language, it is believed, affords no other example of so whimsical a combination
                    of different objects under one appellation, or of the confounding of a direct
                    physical sensation with the suggestion of a social or sympathetic moral feeling.
                    We would observe also, that while Mr Knight stickles so violently for this alloy
                    of the senses in the constitution of beauty, he admits unequivocally, that
                    sublimity is, in every instance and in all cases, the effect of association
                    alone. Yet sublimity and beauty, in any just or large sense, and with a view to
                    the philosophy of either, are manifestly one and the same; nor is it conceivable
                    to us, that, if sublimity be <hi rend="italic">always</hi> the result of an
                    association with ideas of power or danger, beauty can possibly be, in any case,
                    the result of a mere pleasurable impulse on the nerves of the eye or the ear. We
                    shall return, however, to this discussion hereafter. Of Mr Knight we have only
                    further to observe, that we think he is not less heretical in maintaining that
                    we have no pleasure in sympathizing with distress or suffering, but only with
                    mental energy; and that, in contemplating the sublime, we are moved only with a
                    sense of power and grandeur, and never with any feeling of terror or awe. These
                    errors, however, are less intimately connected with the subject of our present
                    discussion.</p>
                <p>With Mr Stewart we have less occasion for quarrel; chiefly, perhaps, because he
                    has made fewer positive assertions, and entered less into the matter of
                    controversy. His Essay on the Beautiful is rather philological than
                    metaphysical. The object of it is to show by what gradual and successive
                    extensions of meaning the word, though at first appropriated to denote the
                    pleasing effect of <hi rend="italic">colours</hi> alone, might naturally come to
                    signify all the other pleasing things to which it is now applied. In this
                    investigation he makes many admirable remarks, and touches, with the hand of a
                    master, upon many of the disputable parts of the question; but he evades the
                    particular point at issue between us and Mr Knight, by stating that it is quite
                    immaterial to his purpose whether the beauty of colours be supposed to depend on
                    their organic effect on the eye, or on some association between them and other
                    agreeable emotions; it being enough for his purpose that this was probably the
                    first sort of beauty that was observed, and that to which the name was at first
                    exclusively applied. It is evident to us, however, that he leans to the opinion
                    of Mr Knight, as to this beauty being truly sensual or organic. In observing,
                    too, that beauty is not now the name of any one thing or quality, but of very
                    many different qualities, and that it is applied to them all merely because they
                    are often united in the same objects, or perceived at the same time and <hi
                    rend="italic">by the same organs,</hi> it appears to us that he carries his
                    philology a little too far, and disregards other principles of reasoning of far
                    higher authority. T <hi rend="subscript"> o</hi> give the name of beauty, for
                    example, to every thing that interests or pleases us through the channel of
                    sight, i∏. eluding in this category the mere impulse of light that is pleasant
                    to the organ, and the presentment of objects whose whole charm consists in
                    awakening the memory of social emotions, seems to us to be confounding things
                    together that must always be separate in our feelings, and giving a far greater
                    importance to the mere identity of the organ of perception than is warranted
                    either by the ordinary language or ordinary experience of men. Upon the same
                    principle, we should give this name of beautiful, and no other, to all acts of
                    kindness or magnanimity, and, indeed, to every interesting occurrence which took
                    place in our sight, or came to our knowledge by means of the eye: nay, as the
                    ear is also allowed to be a channel for impressions of beauty, the same name
                    should be given to any interesting or pleasant thing that we hear; and good news
                    read to us from the gazette should be denominated beautiful, justas much as a
                    fine composition of music. These things, however, are never called beautiful,
                    and are felt, indeed, to afford a gratification of quite a different nature. It
                    is no doubt true, as Mr Stewart has observed, that beauty is not one thing, but
                    many, and does not produce one uniform emotion, but an infinite variety of
                    emotions. But this, we conceive, is not merely because many pleasant things
                    maybe intimated to us by the same sense, but because the things that are called
                    beautiful may be associated with an infinite variety of agreeable emotions, of
                    the specific character of which their beauty will consequently partake. Nor does
                    it follow, from the fact of this great variety, that there can be no other
                    principle of union among these agreeable emotions than that of a <hi
                    rend="italic">name,</hi> extended to them all upon the very slight ground of
                    their coming through the same organ; since, upon our theory, and indeed upon Mr
                    Stewart’s, in a vast majority of instances, there is the remarkable
                    'circumstance of their being all <hi rend="italic">suggested</hi> by association
                    with some present sensation, and all modified and compounded to our feelings by
                    an actual and direct perception.</p>
                <p>It is unnecessary, however, to pursue these criticisms, or, indeed, this hasty
                    review of the speculation of other writers, any further. The few observations we
                    have already made will enable the intelligent reader both to understand in a
                    general way what has been already done on the subject, and in some degree
                    prepare him to appreciate the merits of that theory, substantially the same with
                    Mr Alison’s, which we shall now proceed to illustrate somewhat more in
                    detail.</p>
                <p>The basis of it is, that the beauty which we impute to outward objects is nothing
                    more than the reflection of our own inward emotions, and is made up entirely of
                    certain little portions of love, pity, and affection, which have been connected
                    with these objects, and still adhere as it were to them, and move us anew
                    whenever they are presented to our observation. Before proceeding to bring any
                    proof of the truth of this proposition, there are two things which it may be
                    proper to explain a little more distinctly; <hi rend="italic">first,</hi><note

                    connection by which we suppose that the objects we call beautiful are enabled to
                    suggest these affections?</p>
                <p>With regard to the first of these points, it fortunately is not necessary either
                    to enter into any tedious details, 'or to have recourse to any nice
                    distinctions. All sensations that are not absolutely indifferent, and are, at
                    the same time, either agreeable when experienced by ourselves, or attractive
                    when contemplated in others, may form the foundation of the emotions of
                    sublimity or beauty. The love of sensation seems to be the ruling appetite of
                    human nature; and many sensations, in which the painful seems to bear no little
                    share, are consequently sought for with avidity, and recollected with interest,
                    even in our own persons. In the persons of others, emotions still more painful
                    are contemplated with eagerness and delight; and therefore we must not be
                    surprised to find, that many of the pleasing sensations of beauty or sublimity
                    resolve themselves ultimately into recollections of feelings that may appear to
                    have a very opposite character. The sum of the whole is, that every feeling
                    which it is agreeable to experience, to recall, or to witness, may become the
                    source of beauty in external objects, when it is so connected with them as that
                    their appearance reminds us of that feeling. Now, in real life, and from daily
                    experience and observation, we know that it is agreeable, in the first place, to
                    recollect our own pleasurable sensations, or to be enabled to form a lively
                    conception of the pleasures of other men, or even of sentient beings of any
                    description. We know, likewise, from the same sure authority, that there is a
                    certain delight in the remembrance of our past, or the conception of our future
                    emotions, even though attended with great pain, provided they be not forced too
                    rudely on the mind, and be softened by the accompaniment of any milder feeling.
                    And, finally, we know, in the same manner, that the spectacle or conception of
                    the emotions of others, even when in a high degree painful, is extremely
                    interesting and attractive, and draws us away, not only from the consideration
                    of indifferent objects, but even from the pursuit of light or frivolous
                    enjoyments. All these are plain and familiar facts, of the existence of which,
                    however they may be explained, no one can entertain the slightest doubt, and
                    into which, therefore, we shall have made no inconsiderable progress, if we can
                    resolve the more mysterious fact, of the emotions we receive from the
                    contemplation of sublimity or beauty.</p>
                <p>Our proposition then is, that these emotions are not original emotions, nor
                    produced directly by any qualities in the objects which excite them; but are
                    reflections or images of the more radical and familiar emotions to which we have
                    already alluded, and are occasioned, not by any inherent virtue in the objects
                    before us, but by the accidents, if we may so express ourselves, by which these
                    may have been enabled to suggest or recall to us our own past sensations or
                    sympathies. We might almost venture, indeed, to lay it down as an axiom, that,
                    except in the plain and palpable case of bodily pain or pleasure, we can never
                    be <hi rend="italic">interested</hi> in any thing but the fortunes of sentient
                    beings; and that every thing partaking of the nature of mental emotion must have
                    for its object the feelings, past, present, or possible, of something capable of
                    sensation, ∏dependently, therefore, of all evidence, and without the θlp of any
                    explanation, we should have been apt to cone ude that the emotions of beauty and
                    sublimity must <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi>. <hi rend="superscript"> ave</hi>
                    for their objects the sufferings or enjoyments of sen-lent beings; and to reject
                    as intrinsically absurd and <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> ∏credible the
                    supposition, that material objects, which <hi rend="superscript"> 0</hi> viously
                    do neither hurt nor delight the body, should yet <hi rend="superscript"> eχ</hi>
                    cite, by their mere physical qualities, the very powerful emotions which are
                    sometimes excited by the spectacle of beauty.</p>
                <p>Of the feelings, by their connection with which external objects become
                    beautiful, we do not think it necessary to speak more minutely; and therefore it
                    only remains, under this preliminary view of the subject, to explain the nature
                    of that connection by which we conceive this effect to be produced. Here, also,
                    there is but little need for minuteness, or fulness of enumeration. Almost every
                    tie by which two objects can be bound together in the imagination, in such a
                    manner as that the presentment of the one shall recall the memory of the other,
                    or, in other words, almost every possible relation which can subsist between
                    such objects, may serve to connect the things we call sublime or beautiful, with
                    feelings that are interesting or delightful. It may be useful, however, to class
                    these bonds of association between mind and matter in a rude and general
                    way.</p>
                <p>It appears to us, then, that objects are sublime or beautiful, <hi rend="italic"
                    >first,</hi> When they are the natural signs and perpetual concomitants of
                    pleasurable sensations, or, at any rate, of some lively feeling or emotion in
                    ourselves or in some other sentient beings; or, <hi rend="italic">secondly,</hi>
                    When they are the arbitrary or accidental concomitants of such feelings; or, <hi
                    rend="italic">thirdly,</hi> When they bear some analogy or fanciful resemblance
                    to things with which these emotions are necessarily connected. In endeavouring
                    to illustrate the nature of these several relations, we shall be led to lay
                    before our readers some proofs that appear to us satisfactory of the truth of
                    the general theory.</p>
                <p>The most obvious and the strongest association that can be established between
                    inward feelings and external objects is, where the object is necessarily and
                    universally connected with the feeling by the law of nature, so that it is
                    always presented to the senses when the feeling is impressed upon the mind,—as
                    the sight or the sound of laughter, with the feeling of gaiety,—of weeping, with
                    distress,—of the sound of thunder, with ideas of danger and power. Let us dwell
                    for a moment on the last instance. —Nothing, perhaps, in the whole range, is
                    more strikingly and universally sublime than the sound we have just mentioned;
                    yet it seems obvious that the sense of sublimity is produced, not by any quality
                    that is perceived by the ear, but altogether by the impression of power and of
                    danger that is necessarily made upon the mind whenever that sound is heard. That
                    it is not produced by any peculiarity in the sound itself, is certain, from the
                    mistakes that are frequently made with regard to it. The noise of a cart
                    rattling over the stones is often mistaken for thunder; and as long as the
                    mistake lasts, this very vulgar and insignificant noise is actually felt to be
                    prodigiously sublime. It is so felt, however, it is perfectly plain, merely
                    because it is then associated with ideas of prodigious power and undefined
                    danger; and the sublimity is destroyed the moment the association is dissolved,
                    though the sound itself, and its effect on the organ, continue exactly the same.
                    This, therefore, is an instance in which sublimity is distinctly proved to
                    consist, not in any physical quality of the object to which it is ascribed, but
                    in its necessary connection with that vast and uncontrolled Power which is the
                    natural object of awe and veneration.</p>
                <p>We may now take an example a little less plain and elementary. The most beautiful
                    object in nature, perhaps, is the countenance of a young and beautiful woman ;—
                    and we are apt at first to imagine, that, independently of all associations, the
                    forms and colours which it displays are in themselves lovely and engaging, and
                    would appear charming to all beholders, with whatever other qualities or
                    impressions they might happen to be connected. A very little reflection,
                    however, will probably be sufficient <pb break="no" facs="nls:193195685"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0704-5685-0490"/>to convince us of the fallacy of this impression,
                    and to satisfy us, that what we admire is not a combination of forms and
                    colours, which could never excite any mental emotion, but a collection of signs
                    and tokens of certain mental feelings and affections, which are universally
                    recognised as the proper objects of love and sympathy. Laying aside the emotions
                    arising from difference of sex, and supposing female beauty to be contemplated
                    by the pure and unenvying eye of a female, it seems quite obvious that, amongst
                    its ingredients, we should trace the signs of two different sets of qualities,
                    that are neither of them the object of sight, but of a higher faculty ;—in the
                    first place, of youth and health; and, in the second place, of innocence,
                    gaiety, sensibility, intelligence, delicacy or vivacity. Now, without enlarging
                    upon the natural effect of these suggestions, we shall just suppose that the
                    appearances, which must be admitted at all events to be actually significant of
                    the qualities we have enumerated, had been by the law of nature attached to the
                    very opposite qualities; —that the smooth forehead, the firm cheek, and the full
                    lip, which are now so distinctly expressive to us of the gay and vigorous
                    periods of youth,—and the clear and blooming complexion, which indicates health
                    and activity,—had been in fact the forms and colours by which old age and
                    sickness were characterized; and that, instead of being found united to those
                    sources and seasons of enjoyment, they had been the badges by which nature
                    pointed out that state of suffering and decay which is now signified to us by
                    the livid and emaciated face of sickness, or the wrinkled front, the quivering
                    lip, and hollow cheek of age: if this were the familiar law of our nature, can
                    it be doubted that we should look upon these appearances, not with rapture, but
                    with aversion,—and consider it as abso-Iutely ludicrous or disgusting to speak
                    of the beauty of what was interpreted by every one as the lamented sign of pain
                    and decrepitude? Mr Knight himself, though a firm believer in the intrinsic
                    beauty of colours, is so much of this opinion, that he thinks it entirely owing
                    to those associations that we prefer the tame smoothness and comparatively poor
                    colours of a youthful face, to the richly fretted and variegated countenance of
                    a pimpled drunkard.</p>
                <p>Such, we conceive, would be the inevitable effect of dissolving the subsisting
                    connection between the animating ideas of hope and enjoyment, and those visible
                    appearances which are now significant of these emotions, and derive their whole
                    beauty from this signification. But the effect would be still stronger if we
                    could suppose the <hi rend="italic">moral</hi> expression of these appearances
                    to be reversed in the same manner. If the smile which now enchants us as the
                    expression of innocence and affection, were the sign attached by nature to guilt
                    and malignity,—if the blush which expresses delicacy, and the glance that speaks
                    intelligence, vivacity, and softness, had always been found united with brutal
                    passion or idiot moodiness,—is it not certain that the whole of their beauty
                    would be extinguished, and that our emotions from the sight of them would be
                    exactly the reverse of what they now are?</p>
                <p>That the beauty of a living and sentient creature should depend, in a great
                    degree, upon the qualities peculiar to such a creature, rather than upon the
                    mere physical attributes which it may possess in common with the inert matter
                    around it, cannot indeed appear a very improbable supposition to any one. But it
                    may be more difficult for some persons to understand how the beauty of mere dead
                    matter should be derived from the feelings and sympathies of sentient beings. It
                    is absolutely necessary, therefore, that we should give an instance or two of
                    this derivation.</p>
                <p>It is easy enough to understand how the sight of a picture or statue should
                    affect us nearly in the same way as the sight of the original; nor is it much
                    more difficult to conceive, how the sight of a cottage should give us something
                    of the same feeling as the sight of a peasant’s family, and the aspect of a town
                    raise many of the same ideas as the appearance of a multitude of persons. We may
                    begin, therefore, with an example a little more complicated. Take, for instance,
                    the case of a common English landscape—green meadows, with fat cattle—canals or
                    navigable rivers—well-fenced, well-cultivated fields neat, clean, scattered
                    cottages—humble antique church, with church-yard elms, and crossing
                    hedge-rows—all seen under bright skies, and in good weather: there is much
                    beauty, as every one will acknowledge, in such a scene. But in what does the
                    beauty consist? Not certainly in the mere mixture of colours and forms; for
                    colours more pleasing, and lines more graceful (according to any theory of grace
                    that may be preferred), might be spread upon a board, or a painter’s pallet,
                    without engaging the eye to a second glance, or raising the least emotion in the
                    mind; but in the picture of human happiness that is presented to our
                    imaginations and affections,—in the visible and unequivocal signs of comfort,
                    and cheerful and peaceful enjoyment,—and of that secure and successful industry
                    that insures its continuance,—and of the piety by which it is exalted,—and of
                    the simplicity by which it is contrasted with the guilt and the fever of a city
                    life,—in the images of health and temperance and plenty which it exhibits to
                    every eye,—and in the glimpses which it affords to warmer imaginations, of those
                    primitive or fabulous times, when man was uncorrupted by luxury and ambition,
                    and of those humble retreats in which we still delight to imagine that love and
                    philosophy may find an unpolluted asylum. At all events, however, it is human
                    feeling that excites our sympathy, and forms the object of our emotions. It is
                    man, and man alone, that we see in the beauties of the earth which he inhabits
                    ;—or, if a more sensitive and extended sympathy connect us with the lower
                    families of animated nature, and make us rejoice with the lambs that bleat on
                    the uplands, or the cattle that ruminate in the valley, or even with the living
                    plants that drink the bright sun and the balmy air beside them, it is still the
                    idea of enjoyment—of feelings that animate the existence of sentient beings—that
                    calls forth all our emotions, and is the parent of all the beauty with which we
                    proceed to invest the inanimate creation around us.</p>
                <p>Instead of this quiet and tame <hi rend="italic">English</hi> landscape, let us
                    now take a Welsh or a Highland scene, and see whether its beauties will admit of
                    being explained on the same principle. Here we shall have lofty mountains, and
                    rocky and lonely recesses,—tufted woods hung over precipices,—· lakes
                    intersected with castled promontories,—ample solitudes of unploughed and
                    untrodden valleys,—nameless and gigantic ruins,—and mountain echoes repeating
                    the scream of the eagle and the roar of the cataract. This, too, is beautiful;
                    and, to those who can interpret the language it speaks, far more beautiful than
                    the prosperous, scene with which we have contrasted it. Yet, lonely as it ιs,.ιt
                    is to the recollection of man and of human feelings that its beauty also is
                    owing. The mere forms and colours that compose its visible appearance, are no
                    more capable of exciting any emotion in the mind, than the forms and colours of
                    a Turkey carpet. It is sympathy with the present or the past, or the imaginary
                    <hi rend="italic">inhabitants</hi> of such a region, that alone gives it either
                    interest or beauty; and the delight of those who behold it will always be found
                    to be in exact proportion to the force of their imaginations, and the warmth of
                    their social affections. The leading impressions here are -those of romantic
                    seclusion and prime'a simplicity; lovers sequestered in these blissful solitude
                    “from towns and toils remote and rustic poets and phi' losophers communing with
                    nature, at a distance from the <pb break="no" facs="nls:193195698"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0704-5698-0491"/>low pursuits and selfish malignity of ordinary
                    mortals ;— ' then there is the sublime impression of the Mighty Power which
                    piled the massive cliffs upon one another, and rent the mountains asunder, and
                    scattered their giant fragments at their base,—and all the images connected with
                    the monuments of ancient magnificence and extinguished hostility the feuds, and
                    the combats, and the triumphs of its wild and primitive inhabitants, contrasted
                    with the stillness and desolation of the scenes where they lie interred, —and
                    the romantic ideas attached to their ancient traditions and the peculiarities of
                    their present life,—their wild and enthusiastic poetry,—their gloomy
                    superstitions, —their attachment to their chiefs,—the dangers, and the
                    hardships, and enjoyments of their lonely huntings and fishings,—their pastoral
                    shielings on the mountains in summer,—and the tales and the sports that amuse
                    the little groups that are frozen into their vast and trackless valleys in the
                    winter. Add to all this the traces of vast and obscure antiquity that are
                    impressed on the language and the habits of the people, and on the cliffs, and
                    caves, and gulfy torrents of the land,—and the solemn and touching reflection
                    perpetually recurring, of the weakness and insignificance of perishable man,
                    whose generations thus pass away into oblivion with all their toils and
                    ambition, while nature holds on her unvarying course, and pours out her streams,
                    and renews her forests, with undecaying activity, regardless of the fate of her
                    proud and perishable sovereign.</p>
                <p>We have said enough, we believe, to let our readers understand what we mean by
                    external objects being the natural signs or concomitants of human sympathies or
                    emotions. Yet we cannot refrain from adding one other illustration, and asking
                    on what other principle we can account for the beauty of spring? Winter has
                    shades as deep, and colours as brilliant, and the great forms of nature are
                    substantially the same through all the revolutions of the year. We shall seek in
                    vain, therefore, in the accidents of mere organic matter, for the sources of
                    that “vernal delight and joy” which subject all finer spirits to an annual
                    intoxication, and strike home the sense of beauty even to hearts that seem proof
                    against it under all other aspects. And it is not among the dead, but among the
                    living, that this beauty originates. It is the renovation of life and of joy to
                    all animated beings that constitutes this great jubilee of nature,—the young of
                    animals bursting into existence,—the simple and universal pleasures which are
                    diffused by the mere temperature of the air and the profusion of sustenance,—the
                    pairing of birds,—the cheerful resumption of rustic toils,—the great alleviation
                    of all the miseries of poverty and sickness,—our sympathy with the young life,
                    and the promise and the hazards of the vegetable creation,—the solemn yet
                    cheering impression of the constancy of nature to her great periods of
                    renovation,— and the hopes that dart spontaneously forward into the new
                    c&gt;rcle of exertions and enjoyments that is opened up by her hand and her
                    example. Such are some of the conceptions that are forced upon us by the
                    appearances of returning spring, and that seem to account for the emotions of
                    delight with which these appearances are hailed by every mind endowed with any
                    degree of sensibility, somewhat better than the brightness of the colours, or
                    the <hi rend="superscript"> a</hi> greeableness of the smells, that are then
                    presented to our senses.</p>
                <p>They are kindred conceptions that constitute all the beauty of childhood. The
                    forms and colours that are pe-Sp <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi><hi
                    rend="subscript"> 1</hi><hi rend="superscript"> a</hi> f <hi rend="superscript">
                    to t</hi> hat age are not necessarily or absolutely beau- ∏ul in themselves;
                    for, in a grown person, the same forms and colours would be either ludicrous or
                    disgusting. It is their indestructible connection with the engaging ideas
                    innocence,—of careless gaiety,—of unsuspecting con fidence, made still more
                    tender and attractive by the recollection of helplessness, and blameless and
                    happy ignorance,—of the anxious affection that watches over all their ways,—and
                    of the hopes and fears that seek to pierce futurity, for those who have neither
                    fears nor cares nor anxieties for themselves.</p>
                <p>These few illustrations will probably be sufficient to give our readers a general
                    conception of the character and the grounds of that theory of beauty which, we
                    think, affords the only true or consistent account of its nature. They are all
                    examples, it will be observed, of the <hi rend="italic">first</hi> and most
                    important connection which we think may be established between external objects
                    and the sentiments or emotions of the mind, or cases, in which the visible
                    phenomena are the natural and universal accompaniments of the emotion, and are
                    consequently capable of reviving that emotion, in some degree, in the breast of
                    every beholder.</p>
                <p>If the tenor of those illustrations has been such as to make any impression in
                    favour of the general theory, we conceive that it must be very greatly confirmed
                    by the slightest consideration of the <hi rend="italic">second</hi> class of
                    cases, or those in which the external object is not the natural and necessary,
                    but only the occasional or accidental, concomitant of the emotion which it
                    recalls. In the former instances some conception of beauty seems to be
                    inseparable from the appearance of the objects; and being impressed, in some
                    degree, upon all persons to whom they are presented, there is evidently room for
                    insinuating that it is an independent and intrinsic quality of their nature, and
                    does not arise from association with any thing else. In the instances, however,
                    to which we are now to allude, this perception of beauty is not universal, but
                    entirely dependent upon the opportunities which each individual has had to
                    associate ideas of emotion with the object to which it is ascribed; the same
                    thing appearing beautiful to those who have been exposed to the influence of
                    such associations, and indifferent to those who have not. Such instances,
                    therefore, really afford an <hi rend="italic">experimentum crucis</hi> as to the
                    truth of the theory in question; nor is it easy to conceive any more complete
                    evidence, both that there is no such thing as absolute or intrinsic beauty, and
                    that it depends altogether on those associations with which it is thus found to
                    come and to disappear.</p>
                <p>The accidental or arbitrary relations that may thus be established between
                    natural sympathies or emotions, and external objects, may be either such as
                    occur to whole classes of men, or are confined to particular individuals. Among
                    the former, those that apply to different nations or races of men, are the most
                    important and remarkable; and constitute the basis of those peculiarities by
                    which national tastes are distinguished. Take, again, for example, the instance
                    of female beauty, and think what different and inconsistent standards would be
                    fixed for it in the different regions of the world; in Africa, in Asia, and in
                    Europe; in Tartary and in Greece; in Lapland, Patagonia, and Circassia. If there
                    were any thing absolutely or intrinsically beautiful in any of the forms thus
                    distinguished, it is inconceivable that men should differ so outrageously in
                    their conceptions of it. If beauty were a real and independent quality, it seems
                    impossible that it should be distinctly and clearly felt by one set of persons,
                    where another set, altogether as sensitive, could see nothing but its opposite;
                    and if it were actually and inseparably attached to certain forms, colours, or
                    proportions, it must appear utterly inexplicable that it should be felt and
                    perceived in the most opposite forms and proportions in objects of the same
                    description. On the other hand, if all beauty consist in reminding us of certain
                    natural sympathies and objects of emotion, with which they have been habitually
                    connected, it is easy to perceive how <pb break="no" facs="nls:193195711"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0704-5711-0492"/>the most different forms should be felt to be
                    equally beautiful. If female beauty, for instance, consist in the visible signs
                    and expressions of youth and health, and of gentleness, vivacity, and kindness;
                    then it will necessarily happen, that the forms, and colours, and proportions
                    which nature may have connected with these qualities, in the different climates
                    or regions of the world, will all appear equally beautiful to those who have
                    been accustomed to recognise them as the signs of such qualities; while they
                    will be respectively indifferent to those who have not learned to interpret them
                    in this sense, and displeasing to those whom experience has led to consider them
                    as the signs of opposite qualities. The case is the same, though perhaps to a
                    smaller degree, as to the peculiarity of national taste in other particulars.
                    The style of dress and architecture in every nation, if not adopted from mere
                    want of skill, or penury of materials, always appears beautiful to the natives,
                    and somewhat monstrous and absurd to foreigners; and the general character and
                    aspect of their landscape, in like manner, if not associated with substantial
                    evils and inconveniences, always appears more beautiful and enchanting than the
                    scenery of any other region. The fact is still more striking, perhaps, in the
                    case of music; in the effects of those national airs, with which even the most
                    uncultivated imaginations have connected so many interesting recollections; and
                    in the delight with which all persons of sensibility catch the strains of their
                    native melodies in strange or in distant lands. It is owing chiefly to the same
                    sort of arbitrary and national association, that white is thought a gay colour
                    in Europe, where it is used at weddings,—and a dismal colour in China, where it
                    is used for mourning; that we think yew-trees gloomy, because they are planted
                    in churchyards,—and large masses of powdered horse hair majestic, because we see
                    them on the heads of judges and bishops.</p>
                <p>Next to those curious instances of arbitrary or limited associations that are
                    exemplified in the diversities of national taste, are those that are produced by
                    the differences of instruction or education. Ifexternal objects were sublime or
                    beautiful in themselves, it is plain that they would appear equally so to those
                    who were acquainted with their origin, and to those to whom it was unknown. Yet
                    it is not easy, perhaps, to calculate the degree to which our notions of beauty
                    and sublimity are now influenced over all Europe by the study of classical
                    literature; or the number of impressions of this sort which the well-educated
                    consequently receive, from objects that are utterly indifferent to uninstructed
                    persons of the same natural sensibility. Upon this subject we gladly avail
                    ourselves of the beautiful expressions of Mr Alison.</p>
                <p>“The delight which most men of education receive from the consideration of
                    antiquity, and the beauty that they discover in every object which is connected
                    with ancient times, is in a great measure to be ascribed to the same cause. The
                    antiquarian, in his cabinet, surrounded by the relics of former ages, seems to
                    himself to be removed to periods that are long since past, and indulges in the
                    imagination of living in a world which, by a very natural kind of prejudice, we
                    are always willing to believe was both wiser and better than the present. All
                    that is venerable or laudable in the history of these times presents itself to
                    his memory. The gallantry, the heroism, the patriotism of antiquity, rise again
                    before his view, softened by the obscurity in which they are involved, and
                    rendered more seducing to the imagination by that obscurity itself, which, while
                    it mingles a sentiment, of regret amid his pursuits, serves at the same time to
                    stimulate his fancy to fill up, by its own creation, those long intervals of
                    time of which history has preserved no record. The relics he contemplates seem
                    to approach him still nearer to the ages of his regard. The dress, the
                    ſurni-ture, the arms of the times, are so many assistances to his imagination,
                    in guiding or directing its exercise; and, offering him a thousand sources of
                    imagery, provide him with an almost inexhaustible field in which his memory and
                    liis fancy may expatiate. There are few men who have not felt somewhat, at
                    least, of the delight of such an employment. There is no man in the least
                    acquainted with the history of antiquity, who does not love to let his
                    imagination loose on the prospect of its remains, and to whom they are not in
                    some measure sacred, from the innumerable images which they bring. Even the
                    peasant, whose knowledge of former times extends but to a few generations, has
                    yet in his village some monument of the deeds or virtues of his forefathers, and
                    cherishes with a fond veneration the memoriaì of those good old times to which
                    his imagination returns with delight, and of which he loves to recount the
                    simple tales that tradition has brought him.</p>
                <p>“And what is it that constitutes that emotion of sublime delight which every man
                    of common sensibility feels upon the first prospect of Rome? It is not the scene
                    of destruction which is before him. It is not the Tiber, diminished in his
                    imagination to a paltry stream, flowing amid the ruins of that magnificence
                    which it once adorned. It is not the triumph of superstition over the wreck of
                    human greatness, and its monuments erected upon the very spot where the first
                    honours of humanity have been gained. It is ancient Rome which fills his
                    imagination. It is the country of Caesar, and Cicero, and Virgil, which is
                    before him. It is the mistress of the world which he sees, and who seems to him
                    to rise again from her tomb, to give laws to the universe. All that the labours
                    of his youth or the studies of his maturer age have acquired with regard to the
                    history of this great people, opens at once before his imagination, and presents
                    him with a field of high and solemn imagery, which can never be exhausted. Take
                    from him these associations—conceal from him that it is Rome that he sees, and
                    how different would be his emotion !”</p>
                <p>The influences of the same studies may be traced, indeed, through almost all our
                    impressions of beauty; and especially in the feelings which ŵe receive from the
                    contemplation of rural scenery, where the images and recollections which have
                    been-associated with such objects, in the enchanting strains of the poets, are
                    perpetually recalled by their appearance, and give an interest and a beauty to
                    the prospect, of which the uninstructed cannot have the slightest perception.
                    Upon this subject, also, Mr Alison has expressed himself with his usual warmth
                    and elegance. After observing that, in childhood, the beauties of nature have
                    scarcely any existence for those who have as yet but little general sympathy
                    with mankind, he proceeds to state that they are usually first recommended to
                    notice by the poets, to whom we are introduced in the course of education; and
                    who, in a manner, create them for us, by the associations which they enable us
                    to form with their visible appearance.</p>
                <p>“How different from this period become the sentiments with which the scenery of
                    nature is contemplated by those who have any imagination! The beautiful forms of
                    ancient mythology with which the fancy of poets peopled every element, are now
                    ready to appear to their minds upon the prospect of every scene. The
                    descriptions of ancient authors, so long admired, and so deserving of
                    admiration, occur to them at every moment, and, with them,-all those
                    enthusiastic ideas of ancient genius and glory which the study of so many years
                    of youth so naturally <hi rend="superscript"> r</hi> leads them to form. Or, if
                    the study of modern poetry has succeeded to that of the ancient, a thousan</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:193195724" xml:id="kp-eb0704-5724-0493"/>
                <p>other beautiful associations are acquired, which, instead of destroying, serve
                    easily to unite with the former, and to afford a new source of delight. The
                    awful forms of Gothic superstition, the wild and romantic imagery which the
                    turbulence of the middle ages, the crusades, and the institution of chivalry,
                    have spread over every country of Europe, arise to the imagination in every
                    scene; accompanied with all those pleasing recollections of prowess, and
                    adventure, and courteous manners, which distinguished those memorable times.
                    With such images in their minds, it is not common nature that appears to
                    surround them. It is nature embellished and made sacred by the memory of
                    Theocritus and Virgil, and Milton and Tasso; their genius appears still to
                    linger among the scenes which inspired it, and to irradiate every object where
                    it dwells; and the creation of their fancy seems the fit inhabitants of that
                    nature which their descriptions have clothed with beauty.”</p>
                <p>It is needless, for the purpose of mere illustration, to pursue this subject of
                    arbitrary or accidental association through all the divisions of which it is
                    susceptible; and, indeed, the task would be endless, since there is scarcely any
                    class in society which could not be shown to have peculiar associations of
                    interest and emotion with objects which are not so connected in the minds of any
                    other class. The young and the old—the rich and the poor—the artist and the man
                    of science—the inhabitant of the city and the inhabitant of the country—the man
                    of business and the man of pleasure—the domestic and the dissipated— nay, even
                    the followers of almost every different study or profession,—have perceptions of
                    beauty, because they have associations with external objects, that are peculiar
                    to themselves, and have no existence for any other persons. But, though the
                    detail of such instances could not fail to show, in the clearest and most
                    convincing manner, how directly the notion of beauty is derived from some more
                    radical and familiar emotion, and how many and various are the channels by which
                    such emotions are transmitted, enough, perhaps, has been already said to put our
                    readers in possession of the principles and general bearings of an argument
                    which we must not think of exhausting.</p>
                <p>Before entirely leaving this branch of the subject, however, let us pause for a
                    moment on the familiar but very striking and decisive instance of our varying
                    and contradictory judgments as to the beauty of the successive fashions of dress
                    that have existed within our own remembrance. All persons who still continue to
                    find amusement m society, and are not old enough to enjoy only the recollections
                    of their youth, think the prevailing fashions becoming and graceful, and the
                    fashions of twenty or twenty-five years old intolerably ugly and ridiculous. The
                    younger they are, and the more they mix in society, this impression is the
                    stronger; and the fact is worth noticing, because there is really no one thing
                    as to which persons judging merely from their feelings, and therefore less
                    likely to. be misled by any systems or theories, are so very positive and
                    decided, as that established fashions are beautiful in themselves; and that
                    exploded fashions are intrinsically and beyond all question preposterous and
                    ugly. We have never yet met a young lady or gentleman, who spoke from their
                    hearts, and without reserve, who had the cast doubt on the subject, or could
                    conceive how any person could be so stupid, as not to see the intrinsic elegance
                    θι the reigning mode, or not to be struck with the ludi-cious awkwardness of the
                    habits in which their mothers? <hi rend="superscript"> ere</hi> disguised. Yet
                    there can be no doubt, that if these <hi rend="superscript"> ιn</hi> gemous
                    critics had been born with the same natural sensibility to beauty, but twenty
                    years earlier, they would ave joined in admiring what they now laugh at, as cer-
                    <hi rend="superscript"> aι</hi> niy as those who succeed them twenty years
                    hereafter will laugh at them. It is plain, then, and we think scarcely disputed
                    out of the circles to which we have alluded, that there is, in the general case,
                    no intrinsic beauty or deformity in any of those fashions; and that the forms,
                    and colours, and materials, that are, we may say, universally and very strongly
                    felt to be beautiful while they are in fashion, are sure to lose all their
                    beauty as soon as the fashion has passed away. Now the forms, and colours, and
                    combinations, remain exactly as they were; and, therefore, it seems perfectly
                    obvious that the source of their successive beauty and ugliness must be sought
                    in something extrinsic, and can only be found in the associations which once
                    recommended and ultimately degraded them in our estimation. While they were in
                    fashion, they were the forms and colours which distinguished the rich and the
                    noble,—the eminent, the envied, the observed in society. They were the forms and
                    the colours in which all that was beautiful, and admired, and exalted, were
                    habitually arrayed. They were associated, therefore, with ideas of opulence, and
                    elegance, and gaiety, and all that is· captivating and bewitching in manners,
                    fortune, and situation,—and derived the whole of their beauty from those
                    associations. By and by, however, they were deserted by the beautiful, the rich,
                    and the elegant, and descended to the vulgar and dependent, or were only seen in
                    combination with the antiquated airs of faded beauties or obsolete beaux. They
                    thus came to be associated with ideas of vulgarity and derision, and with the
                    images of old and decayed persons, whom it is difficult for their juniors to
                    believe ever to have been young or attractive ;—and the associations being thus
                    reversed, in which all their beauty consisted, the beauty itself naturally
                    disappears.</p>
                <p>The operation of the same causes is distinctly visible in all the other apparent
                    irregularities of our judgments as to this description of beauty. Old people
                    have in general but little toleration for the obsolete fashions of their later
                    or middle years, but will generally stickle for the intrinsic elegance of those
                    which were prevalent in the bright days of their early youth,—as being still
                    associated in their recollections with the beauty with which they were first
                    enchanted, and the gay spirits with which they were then inspired. In the same
                    way, while we laugh at the fashions of which fine ladies and gentlemen were
                    proud in the days of our childhood, because they are now associated only with
                    images of decrepitude and decay, we look with some feelings of veneration on the
                    habits of more remote generations, the individuals of which are only known to us
                    as historical persons; and with unmingled respect and admiration on those still
                    more ancient habiliments which remind us either of the heroism of the feudal
                    chivalry, or the virtue and nobleness of classical antiquity. The iron mail of
                    the Gothic knight, or the clumsy shield and naked arms of the Roman warrior,
                    strike us as majestic and graceful, merely because they are associated with
                    nothing but tales of romantic daring or patriotic prowess; while the
                    full-bottomed periwigs that were added to the soldier’s equipment in the days of
                    Louis XIV. and King William, and no doubt had a noble effect in the eyes of that
                    generation, now appear to us equally ridiculous and unbecoming, merely because
                    such appendages are no longer to be seen but upon the heads of sober and
                    sedentary lawyers, or in the pictures of antiquated esquires.</p>
                <p>We cannot afford, however, to enlarge any further upon these considerations, and
                    are inclined indeed to think,’ that what has been already said on the subject of
                    associa- <hi rend="superscript"> j</hi> tions, which, though not universal, are
                    common to whole classes of persons, will make it unnecessary to enlarge on those
                    that are peculiar to each individual. It is almost <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193195737" xml:id="kp-eb0704-5737-0494"/>enough, indeed, to transcribe
                    the following short passage from Mr Alison.</p>
                <p>“There is no man who has not some interesting associations with particular
                    scenes, or airs, or books, and who does not feel their beauty or sublimity
                    enhanced to him by such connections. The view of the house where one was born,
                    of the school where one was educated, and where the gay years of infancy were
                    passed, is indifferent to no man. They recall so many images of past happiness
                    and past affections, they are connected with so many strong or valued emotions,
                    and lead altogether to so long a train of feelings and recollections, that there
                    is hardly any scene which one ever beholds with so much rapture. There are
                    songs, also, that we have heard in our infancy, which, when brought to our
                    remembrance in after years, raise emotions for which we cannot well account; and
                    which, though perhaps very indifferent in themselves, still continue, from this
                    association, and from the variety of conceptions which they kindle in our minds,
                    to be our favourites through life. The scenes which have been distinguished by
                    the residence of any person whose memory we admire produce a similar effect. <hi
                    rend="italic">AIovemur enim, nescio quo pacto, locis ipsis, in quibus eorum,
                    quos diligimus aut admiramur, adsunt vestigia.</hi> The scenes themselves may be
                    little beautiful; but the delight with which we recollect the traces of their
                    lives blends itself insensibly with the emotions which the scenery excites; and
                    the admiration which these recollections afford seems to give a kind of sanctity
                    to the place where they dwelt, and converts every thing into beauty which
                    appears to have been connected with them.”</p>
                <p>There are similar impressions,—as to the sort of scenery to which we have long
                    been accustomed,—as to the style of personal beauty by which we were first
                    enchanted,—and even as to the dialect, or the form of versification, which we
                    first began to admire,—that bestow a secret and adventitious charm upon all
                    these objects, and enable us to discover in them a beauty which is invisible,
                    because it is non-existent to every other eye.</p>
                <p>In all the cases we have hitherto considered, the external object is supposed to
                    have acquired its beauty by being actually connected with the causes of our
                    natural emotions, either as a sign of their existence, or as being locally
                    present to their ordinary occasions. There is a relation, however, of another
                    kind, to which it is necessary to attend, both to elucidate the general grounds
                    of the theory, and to explain several appearances that might otherwise expose it
                    to objections. This is the relation which external objects may bear to our
                    internal feelings, and the power they may consequently acquire of suggesting
                    them, in consequence of a sort of resemblance or analogy which they seem to have
                    to their natural and appropriate objects. The language of poetry is founded in a
                    great degree upon this analogy; and all language, indeed, is full of it, and
                    attests, by its structure, both the extent to which it is spontaneously pursued,
                    and the effects that are produced by its suggestion. We take a familiar instance
                    from the elegant writer to whom we have already referred.</p>
                <p>“What, for instance, is the impression we feel from the scenery of spring? The
                    soft and gentle green with which the earth is spread, the feeble texture of the
                    plants and flowers, and the remains of winter yet lingering among the woods and
                    hills,—all conspire to infuse into our minds somewhat of that fearful tenderness
                    with which infancy is usually beheld. With such a sentiment, how innumerable are
                    the ideas which present themselves to our imagination !—ideas, it is apparent,
                    by no means confined to the scene before our eyes, or to the possible desolation
                    which may yet await its infant beauty, but which almost involuntarily extend
                    themselves to analogies with the life of man, and bring before us all those
                    images of hope or fear which, according to our peculiar situations, have the
                    dominion of our hearts. The beauty of autumn is accompanied with a similar
                    exercise of thought: the leaves begin then to drop from the trees; the flowers
                    and shrubs with which the fields were adorned in the summer months decay; the
                    woods and groves are silent; the sun himself seems gradually to withdraw his
                    light, or to become enfeebled in his power. Who is there who at this season does
                    not feel his mind impressed with a sentiment of melancholy? or who is able to
                    resist that current of thought which, from such appearances of decay, so
                    naturally leads him to the solemn imagination of that inevitable fate which is
                    to bring on alike the decay of life, of empire, and of nature itself?” ⅛--</p>
                <p>A thousand such analogies, indeed, are suggested to us by the most familiar
                    aspects of nature. The morning and the evening present the same ready picture of
                    youth and of closing life as the various vicissitudes of the year. The withering
                    of flowers images out to us the languor of beauty or the sickness of childhood.
                    The loud roar of troubled waters seems to bear some resemblance to the voice of
                    lamentation or violence; and the softer murmur of brighter streams, to be
                    expressive of cheerfulness and innocence. The purity and transparency of water
                    or of air, indeed, is itself felt to be expressive of mental purity and gaiety;
                    and their darkness or turbulence, of mental gloom and dejection. The genial
                    warmth of autumn suggests to us the feeling of mild benevolence ;—the sunny
                    gleams and fitful showers of early spring remind us of the waywardness of
                    infancy ;—flowers waving on their slender stems impress us with the notion of
                    flexibility and lightness of temper. All fine and delicate forms are typical of
                    delicacy and gentleness of character; and almost all forms bounded by waving or
                    flowing lines suggest ideas of ease, pliability, and elegance. Rapid and
                    impetuous motion seems to be emblematical of violence and passion ;—slow and
                    steady motion, of deliberation, dignity, and resolution ;—fluttering motion, of
                    inconstancy or terror ;—and waving motion, according as it is slow or swift, of
                    sadness or playfulness. A lofty tower or a massive building gives us the idea of
                    firmness and elevation of character ;—a rock battered by the waves, of fortitude
                    in adversity. Stillness and calmness in the water or the air seem to shadow out
                    tenderness, indolence, and placidity ;—moonlight we call pensive and gentle
                    ;—and the unclouded sun gives us an impression of exulting vigour, and
                    domineering ambition and glory.</p>
                <p>It is not difficult, with the assistance which language affords us, to trace the
                    origin of all these and a thousand other associations. In many instances, the
                    qualities which thus suggest mental emotions do actually resemble their constant
                    concomitants in human nature, as is obviously the case with the forms and
                    motions which are sublime or beautiful; and, in some, their effects and
                    relations bear so obvious an analogy to those of human conduct or feeling, as to
                    force itself upon the notice of the most careless beholder. But, whatever may
                    have been their original, the very structure of language attests the vast extent
                    to which they have been carried, and the nature of the suggestions to which they
                    are indebted for their interest or beauty. If we speak familiarly of the
                    sparkling of wit, and the darkness of melancholy, can it be at all difficult to
                    conceive that bright light may be agreeable, because it reminds us of gaiety,
                    and darkness oppressive, because it is felt to be emblematical of sorrow? It is
                    very remarkable, indeed, that, whilst almost all the words by which the
                    affections of the mind are expressed seem to have been borrowed originally from
                    the qualities of matter, the <pb break="no" facs="nls:193195750"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0704-5750-0495"/>epithets by which we learn afterwards to
                    distinguish such material objects as are felt to be sublime or beautiful, are
                    all of them epithets that had been previously appropriated to express some
                    quality or emotion of mind. Colours are said to be gay or grave—motions to be
                    lively, or deliberate, or capricious—forms to be delicate or modest— sounds to
                    be animated or mournful—prospects to be cheerful or melancholy—rocks to be
                    bold—waters to be tranquil and a thousand other phrases of the same import; all
                    indicating most unequivocally the sources from which our interest in matter is
                    derived, and proving that it is necessary in all cases to confer mind and
                    feeling upon it, before it can be conceived as either sublime or beautiful. The
                    great charm, indeed, and the great secret of poetical diction, consists in thus
                    lending life and emotion to all the objects it embraces; and the enchanting
                    beauty which we sometimes recognise in descriptions of very ordinary phenomena,
                    will be found to arise from the force of imagination, by which the poet has
                    connected with human emotions a variety of objects, to which common minds could
                    not discover their relation. What the poet does for his readers, however, by his
                    original similes and metaphors iħ these higher cases, even the dullest of these
                    readers do in some degree every day for themselves; and the beauty which is
                    perceived, when natural objects are unexpectedly vivified by the glowing fancy
                    of the former, is precisely of the same kind that is felt when the closeness of
                    the analogy enables them to force human feelings upon the recollection of all
                    mankind. As the poet sees more of beauty in nature than ordinary mortals, just
                    because he perceives more of these analogies and relations to social emotion, in
                    which all beauty consists; so, other men see more or less of this beauty,
                    exactly as they happen to possess that fancy, or those habits, which enable them
                    readily to trace out these relations.</p>
                <p>From all these sources of evidence, then, we think it is pretty well made out,
                    that the beauty or sublimity of external objects is nothing but the reflection
                    of emotions excited by the feelings or condition of sentient beings, and is
                    produced altogether by certain little portions, as it were, of love, joy, pity,
                    veneration, or terror, that adhere to those objects which are present on
                    occasion of such emotions. Nor, after what we have already said, does it seem to
                    be necessary to reply to more than one of the objections to which we are aware
                    that this theory is liable.</p>
                <p>If beauty be nothing more than a reflection of love, pity, or veneration, how
                    comes it, it may be asked, to be distinguished from these sentiments? They are
                    never confounded with each other either in our feelings or our language. Why,
                    then, should they all be confounded under the common name of beauty? and why
                    should beauty, in all cases, affect us in a way so different from the love or
                    compassion of which it is said to be merely the reflection?</p>
                <p>Now, to these questions we are somewhat tempted to answer, after the manner of
                    Scotchmen, by asking, in our turn, whether it be really true that beauty always
                    affects us in one and the same manner, and always in a different manner from the
                    simple and elementary affections which it is its office to recall to us? In very
                    many cases it appears to us that the sensations which we receive from objects
                    that are felt to be beautiful, and that in the highest degree, do not differ at
                    all from the direct movements of tenderness or pity towards sentient beings. If
                    the epithet °f beauty be correctly (as it is universally) applied to many of the
                    most admired and enchanting passages in poetry, which consist entirely in the
                    expression of affect- <hi rend="superscript"> ln</hi> g sentiments, the question
                    would be speedily decided; <hi rend="superscript"> an</hi> d it is a fact, at
                    all events, too remarkable to be omitted, (mt some of the most powerful and
                    delightful emotions at are uniformly classed under this name, arise altogether
                    from the direct influence of these pathetic emotions, without the intervention
                    of any material imagery. We do not wish, however, to dwell upon an argument
                    which certainly is not applicable to all parts of the question; and, admitting
                    that, on many occasions, the feelings which we experience from beauty are
                    sensibly different from the primary emotions in which we think they originate,
                    we shall endeavour, in a very few words, to give an explanation of this
                    difference, which seems to be perfectly consistent with the theory we have
                    undertaken to illustrate.</p>
                <p>In the first place, it should make some difference on the primary affections to
                    which we have alluded, that, in the cases alluded to, they are <hi rend="italic"
                    >reflected</hi> from material objects, and not directly excited by their natural
                    causes. The light of the moon has a very different complexion from that of the
                    sun, though it is in substance the sun’s light; and glimpses of interesting, or
                    even of familiar objects, caught unexpectedly from a mirror placed at a distance
                    from these objects, will affect us, like sudden allusions in poetry, very
                    differently from the natural perception of those objects in their ordinary
                    relations. In the next place, the emotion, when suggested in the shape of
                    beauty, comes upon us, for the most part, disencumbered of all those
                    accompaniments which frequently give it a peculiar and less satisfactory
                    character, when it arises from direct intercourse with its living objects. The
                    compassion, for example, that is suggested by beauty of a gentle and winning
                    description, is not attended with any of that disgust and uneasiness which
                    frequently accompany the spectacle of real distress, nor with that importunate
                    suggestion of the duty of relieving it from which it is almost inseparable. Nor
                    does the temporary delight which we receive from beauty of a gay and animating
                    character, call upon us for any such expenditure of spirits, or active
                    demonstrations of sympathy, as are sometimes demanded by the turbulence of real
                    joy. In the third place, the emotion of beauty being partly founded upon
                    illusion, is far more transitory in its own nature, and is both more apt to
                    fluctuate and vary in its character, and more capable of being dismissed at
                    pleasure, than any of the primary affections, whose shadow and representative it
                    is. In the fourth place, the perception of beauty implies a certain exercise of
                    the imagination that is not required in the case of direct emotion, and is
                    sufficient of itself both to give a new character to every emotion that is
                    suggested by the intervention of such an exercise, and to account for our
                    classing all the various emotions that are so suggested under the same
                    denomination of beauty. When we are injured we feel indignation,—when we are
                    wounded we feel pain,—when we see suffering we feel compassion,—and when we
                    witness any splendid act of heroism or generosity we feel admiration, without
                    any effort of the imagination, or the intervention of any picture or vision in
                    the mind. But when we feel indignation, or pity, or admiration, in consequence
                    of seeing some piece of inanimate matter that merely suggests or recalls to us
                    the ordinary causes or proper objects of these emotions, it is evident that our
                    fancy is kindled by a sudden flash of recollection; and that the effect is
                    produced by means of a certain poetical creation that is instantly conjured up
                    in the mind. It is this active and heated state of the imagination, and this
                    divided and busy occupation of the mind, that constitute the great peculiarity
                    of the emotions we experience from the perception of beauty.</p>
                <p>Finally, and this is perhaps the most important consideration of the whole, it
                    should be recollected, that, along with the shadow or suggestion of associated
                    emotions, there is always present a real and direct perception, which not only
                    gives a force and liveliness to all the images which it suggests, but seems to
                    impart to them some share of its <pb break="no" facs="nls:193195763"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0704-5763-0496"/>own reality. That there is an illusion of this
                    kind in the case, is sufficiently demonstrated by the fact, that we invariably
                    ascribe the interest which we think has been proved to arise wholly from these
                    associations, to the object itself, as one of its actual and inherent qualities,
                    and consider <hi rend="italic">its</hi> beauty as no less a property belonging
                    to it than any of its physical attributes. The associated interest, therefore,
                    is beyond all doubt confounded with the present perception of the object itself;
                    and a livelier and more instant impression is accordingly made upon the mind,
                    than if the interesting conceptions had been merely excited in the memory by the
                    usual operation of reflection or voluntary meditation. Something analogous to
                    this is familiarly known to occur in other cases. When we merely think of an
                    absent friend, our emotions are incomparably less lively than when the
                    recollection of him is suddenly suggested by the unexpected sight of his
                    picture, of the house where he dwelt, or the spot on which we last parted from
                    him; and all these objects seem for the moment to wear the colours of our own
                    associated affections. When Captain Cook’s companions found, in the remotest
                    corner of the habitable globe, a broken spoon with the word <hi rend="italic"
                    >London</hi> stamped upon it, and burst into tears at the sight, they proved how
                    differently we are moved by emotions thus connected with the real presence of an
                    actual perception, and by the mere recollection of the objects on which those
                    emotions depend. Every one of them had probably thought of London every day
                    since he left it, and many of them might have been talking of it with
                    tranquillity but a little before this more effectual appeal was made to their
                    sensibility.</p>
                <p>If we add to all this, that there is necessarily something of vagueness and
                    variableness in the emotions most generally excited by the perception of beauty,
                    and that the mind wanders with the eye over the different objects which may
                    supply these emotions with a degree of unsteadiness and half voluntary half
                    involuntary fluctuation, we may come to understand how the effect not only
                    should be essentially different from that of the simple presentment of anyone
                    interesting conception, but should acquire a peculiarity which entitles it to a
                    different denomination. Most of the associations of which we have been last
                    speaking, as being founded on the analogies or fanciful resemblances that are
                    felt to exist between physical objects and qualities and the interesting
                    affections of mind, are intrinsically of this vague and wavering descriptidn;
                    and when we look at a fine landscape, or any other scene of complicated beauty,
                    a great variety of such images are suddenly presented to the fancy, and as
                    suddenly succeeded by others, as the eye ranges over the different features of
                    which it is composed, and feeds upon the charms which it discloses. Now, the
                    direct perception in all such cases not only perpetually accompanies the
                    associated emotions, but is inextricably confounded with them in our feelings,
                    and is even recognised upon reflection as the cause, not merely of their unusual
                    strength, but of the several peculiarities by which we have shown that they are
                    distinguished. It is not wonderful, therefore, either that emotions so
                    circumstanced should not be classed along with similar affections, under
                    circumstances extremely different, or that the perception of present existence,
                    thus mixed up, and indissolubly confounded with interesting conceptions, should
                    between them produce a sensation of so distinct a nature as naturally to be
                    distinguished by a peculiar name, or that the <hi rend="italic">beauty</hi>
                    which results from this combination should, in ordinary language, be ascribed to
                    the objects themselves, the presence and perception of which is a necessary
                    condition of its existence.</p>
                <p>What we have now said is enough, we believe, to give an attentive reader that
                    general conception of the theory before us, which is all that we can hope to
                    give in the limits to which this article is confined. It may be observed,
                    however, that we have spoken only of those sorts of beauty which we think
                    capable of being resolved into some passion, or emotion, or pretty lively
                    sentiment of our nature; and though these are undoubtedly the highest and most
                    decided kinds of beauty, it is certain that there are many things called
                    beautiful which cannot claim so lofty a connection.</p>
                <p>It is necessary, therefore, to observe, that, though every thing that excites any
                    feeling worthy to be called an ewo- <hi rend="italic">tion</hi> by its beauty or
                    sublimity, will be found to be related to the natural objects of human passions
                    or affections, there are many things which are pleasing or agreeable enough to
                    be called beautiful in consequence of their relation merely to human convenience
                    and comfort,— many others that please by suggesting ideas of human skill and
                    ingenuity,—and many that obtain the name of beautiful by being associated with
                    human fortune, vanity, or splendour. After what has been already said, it will
                    not be necessary either to exemplify or explain these subordinate phenomena. It
                    is enough merely to suggest that they all please upon the same great principle
                    of sympathy with human feelings, and are explained by the simple and
                    indisputable fact, that we are pleased with the direct contemplation of human
                    comfort, ingenuity, and fortune. All these, indeed, obviously resolve themselves
                    into the great object of sympathy—human enjoyment. Convenience and comfort is
                    but another name for a lower but very indispensable ingredient of that emotion.
                    Skill and ingenuity readily present themselves as means by which enjoyment may
                    be promoted; and high fortune, and opulence, and splendour, pass, at least at a
                    distance, for its certain causes and attendants. The beauty of fitness and
                    adaptation of parts, even in the works of nature, is derived from the same
                    fountain, partly by means of its obvious analogy to works of human skill, and
                    partly by suggestions of that creative power and wisdom to which human destiny
                    is subjected. The feelings, therefore, associated with all these qualities,
                    though scarcely rising to the height of emotion, are obviously in a certain
                    degree pleasing or interesting; and, when several of them happer to be united in
                    one object, may accumulate to a very great degree of beauty. It is needless, we
                    think, to pursue these general propositions through all the details to which
                    they so obviously lead. We shall confine ourselves, therefore, to a very few
                    remarks upon the beauty of architecture,—and chiefly as an illustration of our
                    general position.</p>
                <p>There are few things about which men of <hi rend="italic">virtù</hi> are more apt
                    to rave, than the merits of the Grecian architecture; and most of those who
                    affect an uncommon purity and delicacy of taste talk of the intrinsic beauty of
                    its proportions as a thing not to be disputed, except by barbarian ignorance and
                    stupidity. Mr Alison, we think, was the first who gave a full and convincing
                    refutation of this mysterious dogma; and, while he admits, in the most ample
                    terms, the beauty of the objects in question, he has shown, we think, in the
                    clearest manner, that it arises entirely from the combination of the following
                    associations :—M The association of utility, convenience, or fitness for the
                    purposes of the building; 2&lt;ŵ/, Of security and stability, with a view to the
                    nature of the materials; 3rfZy, Of the skill and power requisite to mould such
                    materials into forms so commodious; 4tZ*Zy, Of magnificence, and splendour, and
                    expense; <hi rend="italic">bthly,</hi> Of antiquity; and, <hi rend="italic
                    superscript"> ,</hi><hi rend="italic">othly</hi><hi rend="italic
                    subscript"> i</hi> Of Roman and Grecian greatness. His observations are summed
                    up in the following short sentence. . .</p>
                <p>“The proportions,” he observes, “of these orders, it <hi rend="superscript">
                    ιs</hi> to be remembered, are distinct subjects of beauty, fr° <hi
                    rend="superscript"> m</hi> the ornaments with which they are embellished, from
                    the <pb break="no" facs="nls:193195776" xml:id="kp-eb0704-5776-0497"
                    />magnificence with which they are executed, from the purposes of elegance they
                    are intended to serve, or the scenes of grandeur they are destined to adorn. It
                    is in such scenes, however, and with such additions, that we are accustomed to
                    observe them; and, while we feel the effect of all these accidental
                    associations, we are seldom willing to examine what are the causes of the
                    complex emotion we feel, and readily attribute to the nature of the architecture
                    itself the whole pleasure which we enjoy. But, besides these, there are other
                    associations we have with these forms, that still more powerfully serve to
                    command our admiration; for they are the <hi rend="smallcaps">Grecian</hi>
                    orders,—they derive their origin from those times, and were the ornament of
                    those countries, which are most hallowed in our imaginations; and it is
                    difficult for us to see them, even in their modern copies, without feeling them
                    operate upon our minds as relics of those polished nations where they first
                    arose, and of that greater people by whom they were afterwards borrowed.”</p>
                <p>This analysis is to us perfectly satisfactory. But, indeed, we cannot conceive
                    any more complete refutation of the notion of an intrinsic and inherent beauty
                    in the proportions of the Grecian architecture, than the fact of the admitted
                    beauty of such very opposite proportions in the Gothic. Opposite as they are,
                    however, the great elements of beauty are the same in this style as in the
                    other,—the impressions of religious awe and of chivalrous recollections, coming
                    here instead of the classical associations which constitute so great a share of
                    the interest of the former. It is well observed by Mr Alison, that the great
                    durability and costliness of the productions of this art have had the effect, in
                    almost all regions of the world, of rendering their fashion permanent, after it
                    had once attained such a degree of perfection as to fulfil its substantial
                    purposes.</p>
                <p>“Buildings,” he observes, <hi rend="italic">“may</hi> last, and are intended to
                    last, for centuries. The life of man is very inadequate to the duration of such
                    productions; and the present period of the world, though old with respect to
                    those arts which are employed upon perishable subjects, is yet young in relation
                    to an art which is employed upon so durable materials as those of architecture.
                    Instead of a few years, therefore, centuries must probably pass before such
                    productions demand to be renewed; and, long before that period is elapsed, the
                    sacredness of antiquity is acquired by the subject itself, and a new motive
                    given for the preservation of similar forms. In every country, accordingly, the
                    same effect has taken place; and the same causes which have thus served to
                    produce among us, for so many years, a uniformity of taste with regard to the
                    style of Grecian architecture, have produced also among the nations of the East,
                    for a much longer course of time, a similar uniformity of taste with regard to
                    their ornamental style of architecture; and have perpetuated among them the same
                    forms which were in use among their forefathers before the Grecian orders were
                    invented.”</p>
                <p>It is not necessary, we think, to carry these illustrations any farther, as the
                    theory they are intended to explain is now, we believe, universally adopted,
                    though with some limitations, which we see no reason to retain. Those suggested
                    by Mr Alison, we have already endeavoured to dispose of in the few remarks we
                    have made upon his publication; and it only remains to say a word or two more
                    upon Mr Knight’s doctrine as to the primitive and Independent beauty of colours,
                    upon which we have already hazarded some remarks.</p>
                <p>.. Agreeing as he does with Mr Alison, and all modern inquirers, that the whole
                    beauty of objects consists, in the <hi rend="superscript"> ar</hi> greater
                    number of instances, in the associations to <hi rend="superscript"> v</hi> ' <hi
                    rend="superscript"> nc</hi> h <hi rend="superscript"> we</hi> have alluded, he
                    still maintains that some few visible objects affect us with a sense of beauty
                    in consequence of the pleasurable impression they make upon the sense, and that
                    our perception of beauty is, in these instances, a mere organic sensation. Now
                    we have already stated that it would be something quite unexampled in the
                    history either of mind or of language, if certain physical and bodily sensations
                    should thus be confounded with moral and social feelings with which they had no
                    connection, and pass familiarly under one and the same name. Beauty consists
                    confessedly, in almost all cases, in <hi rend="italic">the suggestion</hi> of
                    moral or social emotions, mixed up and modified by a present sensation or
                    perception; and it is this suggestion, and this identification with a present
                    object, that constitutes its essence, and gives a common character to the whole
                    class of feelings it produces, sufficient to justify their being designated by a
                    common appellation. If the word beauty, in short, must mean something, and if
                    <hi rend="italic">this</hi> be very clearly what it means in all remarkable
                    instances, it is difficult to conceive that it should occasionally mean
                    something quite different, and denote a mere sensual or physical gratification,
                    unaccompanied by the suggestion of any moral emotion whatever. According to Mr
                    Knight, however, and, indeed, to most other writers, this is the case with
                    regard to the beauty of colours, which depends altogether, they say, upon the
                    delight which the eye naturally takes in their contemplation; this delight being
                    just as primitive and sensual as that which the palate receives from the contact
                    of agreeable flavours.</p>
                <p>It must be admitted, we think, in the first place, that such an allegation is in
                    itself extremely improbable, andĮ contrary to all analogy, and all experience of
                    the struc- <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> ture of language, or of the laws of
                    thought. It is further <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> to be considered, too,
                    that if the pleasures of the senses are ever to be considered as beautiful,
                    those pleasures which are the most lively and important would be the most likely
                    to usurp this denomination, and to take rank with the higher gratifications that
                    result from the perception of beauty. Now, it admits of no dispute, that the
                    mere organic pleasures of the cye are far inferior to those of the palate, the
                    touch, and indeed almost all the other senses,—none of which, however, are in
                    any case confounded with the sense of beauty. In the next place, it should
                    follow, that if what affords organic pleasure to the eye be properly called
                    beautiful, what offends or gives pain to it should be called ugly. Now,
                    excessive or dazzling light is offensive to the eye, but, considered by itself,
                    it is never called ugly, but only painful or disagreeable. The moderate
                    excitement of light, on the other hand, or the soothing of certain bright but
                    temperate colours, when considered in this primary aspect, is scarcely called
                    beautiful, but only agreeable or refreshing. So far as the direct injury or
                    comfort of the organ, in short, is concerned, the language which we use refers
                    merely to physical or bodily sensation, and is not confounded with that which
                    relates to mental emotion; and we really see no ground for supposing that there
                    is any exception to this rule.</p>
                <p>It is very remarkable, indeed, that the sense whose organic gratification is here
                    supposed to constitute the feeling of beauty, should be one, in the first place,
                    whose direct organic gratifications are of very little force or intensity; and,
                    in the next place, one whose office it is, almost exclusively, to make us
                    acquainted with the existence and properties of those external objects which are
                    naturally interesting to our inward feelings and affections. This peculiarity
                    makes it extremely probable, that ideas of emotion should be <hi rend="italic"
                    >associated</hi> with the perceptions of this sense, but extremely improbable
                    that its naked and <hi rend="italic">unassociated</hi> sensations should in any
                    case be classed with <pb break="no" facs="nls:193195789"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0704-5789-0498"/>such emotions. If the name of beauty were given to
                    what directly gratifies any sense, such as that of tasting or smelling, which
                    does <hi rend="italic">not</hi> make us acquainted with the nature or relations
                    of outward objects, there could be less room for such an explanation. But when
                    it is the business of a particular sense or organ to introduce to our knowledge
                    those objects which are naturally connected with ideas of emotion, it is easy to
                    understand how its perceptions should be associated with these emotions, and an
                    interest and importance thus extended to them, that belong to the intimations of
                    no other bodily organ. But, on those very accounts, we should be prepared to
                    suspect, that all the interest they possess is derived from this association;
                    and to distrust the accuracy of any observations that may lead us to conclude
                    that its mere organic impulses ever produced any thing akin to these associated
                    emotions, or entitled to pass under their name. This caution will appear still
                    more reasonable, when it is considered that all the other qualities of visible
                    objects, except only their colours, are now admitted to be perfectly indifferent
                    in themselves, and to possess no other beauty than they may derive from their
                    associations with our ordinary affections. There are <hi rend="italic">ηο
                    forms,</hi> for example, even in Mr Knight’s opinion, that have any intrinsic
                    beauty, or any power of pleasing or affecting us, except through their
                    associations, or affinities to mental affections, either as expressive of
                    fitness and utility, or as types and symbols of certain moral or intellectual
                    qualities, in which the sources of our interest are obvious. Yet the form of an
                    object is as conspicuous an ingredient of its beauty as its colour, and a
                    property, too, which seems at first view to be as intrinsically and
                    independently pleasing. Why, then, should we persist in holding that colours, or
                    combinations of colours, please from being <hi rend="italic">naturally</hi>
                    agreeable to the organ of sight, when it is admitted that other visible
                    qualities, which <hi rend="italic">seem</hi> to possess the same power of
                    pleasing, are found, upon examination, to owe it entirely to the principle of
                    association?</p>
                <p>The only reason that can be assigned, or that actually exists, for this
                    distinction, is, that it has been supposed more difficult to account for the
                    beauty of colours, upon the principles which have accounted for other beauties,
                    or to specify the particular associations by virtue of which they could acquire
                    this quality. Now it appears to us that there is no such difficulty; and that
                    there is no reason whatever for holding that one colour, or combination of
                    colours, is more pleasing than another, except upon the same grounds of
                    association which, recommend particular forms, motions, or proportions. It
                    appears to us, that the organic pleasures of the eye are extremely few and
                    insignificant. It is hurt, no doubt, by an excessive glare of light; and it is
                    in some degree gratified, perhaps, by a moderate degree of it. But it is only by
                    the quantity or intensity of the light, we think, that it is so affected. The
                    colour of it, we take it, is, in all cases, absolutely indifferent. But it is
                    the colour only that is called beautiful or otherwise; and these qualities, we
                    think, it very plainly derives from the common fountain of association.</p>
                <p>In the first place, we would ask, whether there is any colour that is beautiful
                    in all situations? and, in the next place, whether there is any colour that is
                    not beautiful in some situation? With regard to the first, take the colours that
                    are most commonly referred to as being intrinsically beautiful—bright and soft
                    green—clear blue—bright pink, or vermilion. The first is unquestionably
                    beautiful in vernal woods and summer meadows,—and, we humbly conceive, is
                    beautiful because it is the natural sign and concomitant of those scenes and
                    seasons of enjoyment. Blue, again, is beautiful in the vernal sky,—and, as we
                    believe, for the sake of the pleasures of which such skies are pro lific; and
                    pink is beautiful on the cheeks of a young woman or the leaves of a rose, for
                    reasons too obvious to be stated. We have associations enough, therefore, to
                    recommend all these colours, in the situations in which they are beautiful; but,
                    strong as these associations are, they are unable to make them universally
                    beautiful,—or beautiful indeed, in any other situations. Green would not be
                    beautiful in the sky, nor blue on the cheek, nor vermilion on the grass. It may
                    be said, indeed, that, though they are always recognised as beautiful in
                    themselves, their obvious unfitness in such situations counteracts the effect of
                    their beauty, and makes an opposite impression, as of something monstrous and
                    unnatural; and that,accordingly, they are all beautiful in indifferent
                    situations, where there is no such antagonist principle—in furniture, dress, and
                    ornaments. Now the fact, in the first place, is not so;—- these bright colours
                    being but seldom and sparingly admitted in ornaments or works of art; and no
                    man, for example, choosing to have a blue house, or a green ceiling, or a pink
                    coat. But, in the second place, if the facts were admitted, we think it obvious
                    that the <hi rend="italic">general</hi> beauty of these colours would be
                    sufficiently accounted for by the very interesting and powerful associations
                    under which all of them are so frequently presented by the hand of nature. The
                    interest we take in female beauty,—in vernal delights,—in unclouded skies,—is
                    far too lively and too constantly recurring, not to stamp a kindred interest
                    upon the colours that are naturally associated with such objects, and to make us
                    regard with some affection and delight those hues that remind us of them,
                    although we should only meet them upon a fan or a dressing-box, the lining of a
                    curtain or the back of a screen. Finally, we beg leave to observe, that all
                    bright and clear colours are naturally typical of cheerfulness and purity of
                    mind, and are hailed as emblems of moral qualities, to which no one can be
                    indifferent</p>
                <p>With regard to ugly colours, again, we really are not aware of any to which that
                    epithet can safely be applied. Dull and dingy <hi rend="superscript"> r</hi>
                    hues are usually mentioned as in themselves the least pleasing; yet these are
                    the prevailing tints in many beautiful landscapes and many admired pictures.
                    They are also the most common colours that are chosen for dress, for building,
                    for furniture, where the consideration of beauty is the only motive for the
                    choice. In fact, the shaded parts of all coloured objects pass into tints of
                    this description; nor can we at present recollect any one colour which we could
                    specify as in itself disagreeable, without running counter to the feelings and
                    the practice of the great mass of mankind. If the fact, however, were otherwise,
                    and if certain muddy and dull colours were universally allowed to be
                    disagreeable, we should think there could be no difficulty in referring these,
                    too, to natural associations. Darkness, and all that approaches it, is naturally
                    associated with ideas of melancholy, of helplessness, and danger; and the gloomy
                    hues that remind us of it, or seem to draw upon it, must share in the same
                    associations. Lurid skies, too, it should be observed, and turbid waters, and
                    unfruitful swamps, and dreary morasses, are the natural and most common wearers
                    of these dismal liveries. It is from these∙thatwe first become acquainted with
                    them; and it is needless, therefore, to say that such objects are necessarily
                    associated with ideas of discomfort, and sadness, and danger; and that the
                    colours that remind us of them can scarcely fad to recall some of the same
                    disagreeable sensations.</p>
                <p>Enough, however, and more than enough, has been said about the supposed primitive
                    and independent beauty o separate colours. It is chiefly upon the intrinsic
                    beaut) of their mixture or combinations that Mr Knight and his adherents have
                    insisted; and it is no doubt quite true, that, among painters and connoisseurs,
                    we hear a g <hi rend="superscript"> rer</hi><pb break="no" facs="nls:193195802"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0704-5802-0499"/>deal about the harmony and composition of tints,
                    and the charms and difficulties of a judicious colouring. In all this, however,
                    we cannot help suspecting that there is no little pedantry and no little jargon;
                    and that these phrases, when used without reference to the practical
                    difficulties of the art, which must go for nothing in the present question,
                    really mean little more than the true and natural appearance of coloured
                    objects, seen through the same tinted or partially obscure medium that commonly
                    constitutes the atmosphere. In nature, we know of no discordant or offensive
                    colouring, except what may be referred to some accident or disaster that spoils
                    the moral or sentimental expression of the scene, and disturbs the associations
                    upon which all its beauty, whether of forms or of hues, seems to us very plainly
                    dependent. We are perfectly aware, that ingenious persons have been disposed to
                    dogmatize and to speculate very confidently upon these subjects; and have had
                    the benefit of seeing various learned treatises upon the natural <hi
                    rend="italic">gamut</hi> of colours, and the inherent congruity of those that
                    are called complementary, with reference to the prismatic <hi rend="italic"
                    >spectrum.</hi> But we confess we have no faith in any of those fancies; and
                    believe, that, if all these colours were fairly arranged on a plain board,
                    according to the most rigid rules of this supposed harmony, nobody but the
                    author of the theory would perceive the smallest beauty in the exhibition, or be
                    the least offended by reversing their collocation.</p>
                <p>We do not mean, however, to dispute that the laws of colouring, insisted on by
                    learned artists, will produce a more pleasing effect <hi rend="italic">upon
                    trained judges of the art,</hi> than a neglect of these laws; because we have
                    little doubt that these combinations of colour are recommended by certain
                    associations, which render them generally pleasing to persons so trained and
                    educated ;—all that we maintain is, that there are no combinations that are
                    originally and universally pleasing or displeasing to the eye, independent of
                    such associations; and it seems to us an irresistible proof of this, that these
                    laws of harmonious colouring are perpetually and deliberately violated by great
                    multitudes of persons, who not only have the perfect use of their sight, but are
                    actually bestowing great pains and expense in providing for its gratification,
                    in the very act of this violation. The Dutch trader, who paints over the outside
                    of his country-house with as many bright colours as are to be found in his
                    tulip-bed, and garnishes his green shutters with blue facings, and his purple
                    roof with lilac ridges, not only sees as well as the studied colourist, who
                    shudders at the exhibition, but actually receives as much pleasure, and as
                    strong an impression of beauty, from the finished <hi rend="italic"
                    >lusthaus,</hi> as the artist does from one of his best pictures. It is
                    impossible, then, that these combinations of colours can be <hi rend="italic"
                    >naturally</hi> or intrinsically offensive to the organ of sight; and their
                    beauty or ugliness <hi rend="italic">must</hi> depend upon the associations
                    which different individuals may have happened to form with regard to them. We
                    contend, however, for nothing more; and are quite willing to allow that the
                    associations which recommend his staring tawdrmess to the buigomaster, are such
                    as could not easily have been formed in the mind of a diligent and extensive
                    observer of nature, and that they would probably be reversed by habits of
                    reflection and study. But the same dung, it i <hi rend="subscript"> s</hi>
                    obvious, may be said of the notions of beauty of any other description that
                    prevail among the rude, the inexperienced, and uninstructed; though, in all
                    other instances, we take it for granted that the beauty which <hi
                    rend="superscript"> is</hi> PJ <hi rend="superscript"> r</hi> cewed depends
                    altogether upon association, and in no degree on its power of giving a
                    pleasurable impulse to oe organ to which it addresses itself. If any consider-t
                    θ number of persons, with the perfect use of sight, ac-ually take pleasure in
                    certain combinations of colours, <hi rend="italic">that</hi> is complete proof
                    that such combinations are not naturally offensive to the organ of sight, and
                    that the pleasure of such persons, exactly like that of those who disagree with
                    them, is derived, not from the sense, but from associations with its
                    perceptions.</p>
                <p>With regard, again, to the effect of broken masses of light and shadow, it is
                    proper, in the first place, to remember, that by the eye we see <hi
                    rend="italic">colour only;</hi> and that lights and shadows, as far as the mere
                    organ is concerned, mean nothing but variations of tint. It is very true, no
                    doubt, that we soon learn to refer many of those variations to light and shade,
                    and that they thus become <hi rend="italic">signs</hi> to us of depth, and
                    distance, and relief. But is not this of itself sufficient to refute the idea of
                    their affording any primitive or organic pleasure? In so far as they are mere
                    variations of tints, they may be imitated by unmeaning daubs of paint on a
                    pallet ;—in so far as they are <hi rend="italic">signs,</hi> it is to the mind
                    that they address themselves, and not to the organ. They are signs, too, it
                    should be recollected, and the only signs we have, by which we can receive any
                    correct knowledge of the existence and condition of all external objects at a
                    distance from us, whether interesting or not interesting. Without the assistance
                    of variety of tint, and of lights and shadows, we could never distinguish one
                    object from another, except by the touch. These appearances, therefore, are the
                    perpetual vehicles of almost all our interesting perceptions; and are
                    consequently associated with all the emotions we receive from visible objects.
                    It is pleasant to see <hi rend="italic">many</hi> things in one prospect,
                    because some of them are probably agreeable; and it is pleasant to know the
                    relations of those things, because the qualities or associations, by means of
                    which they interest us, depend generally upon that knowledge. The mixture of
                    colours and shades, however, is necessary to this enjoyment, and consequently is
                    a sign of it, and a source of associated interest or beauty.</p>
                <p>Mr Knight, however, goes much farther than this; and maintains, that the beauty
                    which is so distinctly felt in many pictures of objects in themselves
                    disagreeable, is to be ascribed entirely to the effect of the brilliant and
                    harmonious tints, and the masses of light and shadow, that may be employed in
                    the representation. The filthy and tattered rags of a beggar, he observes, and
                    the putrefying contents of a dunghill, may form beautiful objects in a picture;
                    because, considered as mere objects of sight, they may often present beautiful
                    effects of colouring and shadow; and these are preserved or heightened in the
                    imitation, disjoined from all their offensive accompaniments. Now, if the tints
                    and shades were the exclusive sources of our gratification, and if this
                    gratification was diminished, instead of being heightened, by the suggestion
                    which, however transiently, <hi rend="italic">must</hi> still intrude itself,
                    that they appeared in an imitation of disgusting objects, it must certainly
                    follow, that the pleasure and the beauty would be much enhanced if there was <hi
                    rend="italic">no imitation of any thing whatever,</hi> and if the canvass merely
                    presented the tints and shades, unaccompanied with the representation, of any
                    particular object. It is perfectly obvious, however, that it would be absurd to
                    call such a collection of coloured spots a beautiful picture; and that a man
                    would be laughed at who should hang up such a piece of stained canvass among the
                    works of the great artists. Again, if it were really possible for any one but a
                    student of art to confine the attention to the mere colouring and shadowing of
                    any picture, there is nothing so disgusting but what might form the subject of a
                    beautiful imitation. A piece of putrid veal, or a cancerous ulcer, or the rags
                    that are taken from it, may display the most brilliant tints and the finest
                    distribution of light and shadow. Does Mr Knight, however, seriously think that
                    either of these experiments would <pb break="no" facs="nls:193195815"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0704-5815-0500"/>succeed? Or are there, in reality, no other
                    qualities in the pictures in question, to which their beauty can be ascribed,
                    but the organic effect of their colours? We humbly conceive that there are, and
                    that far less ingenuity than his might have been able to detect them.</p>
                <p>There is, in the first place, the pleasing association of the skill and power of
                    the artist,—a skill and power which, we know, <hi rend="italic">maybe</hi>
                    employed to produce unmingled delight, whatever may be the character of the
                    particular effort before us. But, in the second place, we do humbly conceive
                    that there are many interesting associations connected with the subjects which
                    have been represented as purely disgusting. The aspect of human wretchedness and
                    decay is not, at all events, an <hi rend="italic">indifferent</hi> spectacle;
                    and, if presented to us without actual offence to our senses, or any call on our
                    active beneficence, may excite a sympathetic emotion, which is known to be far
                    from undelightful. Many an attractive poem has been written on the miseries of
                    beggars; and why should painting be supposed more fastidious? Besides,.it will
                    be observed that the beggars of the painter are generally among the most
                    interesting of that interesting order ;—either young and lovely children, whose
                    health, and gaiety, and sweet expression, form an affecting contrast with their
                    squalid garments, and the neglect and misery to which they seem to be
                    destined,—or old and venerable persons, mingling something of the dignity and
                    reverence of age with the broken spirit of their condition, and seeming to
                    reproach mankind for exposing heads so old and white to the pelting of the
                    pitiless storm. While such pictures suggest images so pathetic, it looks almost
                    like a wilful perversity to ascribe their beauty entirely to the mixture of
                    colours which they display, and to the forgetfulness of these images. Even for
                    the dunghill we think it is possible to say something, though we confess we have
                    never happened to see any picture of which that useful compound formed the
                    peculiar subject. There is the display of the painter’s art and power here also;
                    and the dunghill is not only useful, but is associated with many pleasing images
                    of rustic toil and occupation, and of the simplicity, and comfort, and innocence
                    of agricultural life. We do not know that a dunghill is at all a disagreeable
                    object to look at, even in plain reality, provided it be so far off as not to
                    annoy us with its odour, or to soil us with its effusions. In a picture,
                    however, we are safe from any of these disasters; and considering that it is
                    usually combined, in such delineations, with other more pleasing and touching
                    remembrancers of humble happiness and contentment, we really do not see that it
                    was at all necessary to impute any mysterious or intrinsic beauty to its
                    complexion, in order to account for the satisfaction with which we can then bear
                    to behold it.</p>
                <p>Having said so much with a view to reduce to its just value, as an ingredient of
                    beauty, the mere organical delight which the eye is supposed to derive from
                    colours, we really have not patience to apply the same considerations to the
                    alleged beauty of sounds that are supposed to be insignificant. Beautiful sounds
                    in general, we think, are beautiful from association only,—from their resembling
                    the natural tones of various passions and affections, or from their being
                    originally and most frequently presented to us in scenes or on occasions of
                    natural interest or emotion. With regard, again, to successive or co-existent
                    sounds, we do not, of course, mean to dispute that there are such things as
                    melody and harmony, and that most men are offended or gratified by the violation
                    or observance of those laws upon which they depend. This, however, it should be
                    observed, is a faculty quite <hi rend="italic">unique,</hi> and unlike any thing
                    else in our constitution; by no means universal, as the sense of beauty is, even
                    in cultivated societies, and apparently withheld from whole communities of
                    quick-cared savages and barbarians. Whether the kind of gratification which
                    results from the mere musical arrangement of sounds would be referred to a sense
                    of beauty, or would pass under that name, if it could be presented entirely
                    detached from any associated emotions, appears to us to be exceedingly doubtful.
                    Even with the benefit of these combinations, we do not find that every
                    arrangement which merely preserves inviolate the rules of composition is
                    considered beautiful; and we do not think that it would be consonant, either to
                    the common feeling or common language of mankind, to bestow this epithet upon
                    pieces that had no other merit. At all events, and whatever may be thought of
                    the proper name of this singular gratification of a musical ear, it seems to be
                    quite certain that all that rises to the dignity of an <hi rend="italic"
                    >emotion</hi> in the pleasure we receive from sounds, is as clearly the gift of
                    association as in the case of visible beauty,—of association with ..the
                    passionate tones and modulations of the human voice,—with the scenes to which
                    the interesting sounds are native,—with the poetry to which they have been
                    married,—or even with the skill and genius of the artist by whom they have been
                    arranged.</p>
                <p>Hitherto we have spoken of the beauty of external objects only. But the whole
                    difficulty of the theory consists in its application to them. If that be once
                    adjusted, the beauty of immaterial objects can occasion no perplexity. Poems,
                    and other compositions in words, are beautiful in proportion as they are
                    conversant with beautiful objects, or as they suggest to us, in a more direct
                    way, the moral and social emotions on which the beauty of all objects depends.
                    Theorems and demonstrations are beautiful, according as they excite in us
                    emotions of admiration for the genius and intellectual power of their inventors,
                    and images of the magnificent and beneficial ends to which such discoveries may
                    be applied; and mechanical contrivances are beautiful when they remind us of
                    similar talents and ingenuity, and at the same time impress us with a more
                    direct sense of their vast utility to mankind, and of the great additional
                    conveniences with which life is consequently adorned. In all cases, therefore,
                    there is the suggestion of some interesting conception or emotion associated
                    with a present perception, in which it is apparently confounded and embodied;
                    and this, according to the whole of the preceding deduction, is the
                    distinguishing characteristic of beauty.</p>
                <p>Having now explained, as fully as we think necessary,! the grounds of that
                    opinion as to the nature of beauty <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> which appears
                    to be most conformable to the truth, we have only to add a word or two as to the
                    necessary consequences of its adoption upon several other controversies of a
                    kindred description.</p>
                <p>In the first place, then, we conceive that it establishes the substantial
                    identity of the sublime, the beautiful, and the picturesque, and consequently
                    puts an end to all controversy that is not purely verbal as to the difference of
                    those several qualities. Every material object that interests without actually
                    hurting or gratifying our bodily feelings, must do so, according to this theory,
                    in one and the same manner, that is, by suggesting or recalling some emotion or
                    affection of ourselves or some other sentient being, and presenting, to our
                    imagination at least, some natural object of love, pity, admiration, or awe. The
                    interest of material objects, therefore, is always <hi rend="italic">the
                    sarneì</hi> and arises in every case, not from any physical qualities they may
                    possess, but from their association with some idea of emotion. But, though
                    material objects have but one means of exciting emotion, the emotions they do
                    excite are infinite. They are mirrors that may reflect al shades and all
                    colours, and, in point of fact, do seldom <pb break="no" facs="nls:193195828"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0704-5828-0501"/>reflect the same hues twice. No two interesting
                    objects, perhaps, whether known by the name of beautiful, sublime, or
                    picturesque, ever produced exactly the same emotion in the beholder; and no one
                    object, it is most probable, ever moved any two persons to the very same
                    conceptions. As they may be associated with all the feelings and affections of
                    which the human mind is susceptible, so they may suggest those feelings in all
                    their variety, and, in fact, do daily excite all sorts of emotions, running
                    through every gradation, from extreme gaiety and elevation, to the borders of
                    horror and disgust.</p>
                <p>Now, it is certainly true, that all the variety of emotions raised in this way,
                    on the single basis of association, may be classed in a rude way under the
                    denominations of sublime, beautiful, and picturesque, according as they partake
                    of awe, tenderness, or admiration; and we have no other objection to this
                    nomenclature except its extreme imperfection, and the delusions to which we know
                    that it has given occasion. If objects that interest by their association with
                    ideas of power, and danger, and terror, are to be distinguished by the peculiar
                    name of sublime, why should there not be a separate name also for objects that
                    interest by associations of mirth and gaiety,—another for those that please by
                    suggestions of softness and melancholy,—another for such as are connected with
                    impressions of comfort and tranquillity,—and another for those that are related
                    to pity, and admiration, and love, and regret, and all the other distinct
                    emotions and affections of our nature? These are not in reality less
                    distinguishable from each other than from the emotions of awe and veneration
                    that confer the title of sublime on their representatives; and while all the
                    former are confounded under the comprehensive appellation of beauty, this
                    partial attempt at distinction is only apt to mislead us into an erroneous
                    opinion of our accuracy, and to make us believe both that there is a greater
                    conformity among the things that pass under the same name, and a greater
                    difference between those that pass under different names, than is really the
                    case. We have seen already that the radical error of almost all preceding
                    inquirers, has lain in supposing that every thing that passed under the name of
                    beautiful must have some real and inherent quality in common with every thing
                    else that obtained that name. And it is scarcely necessary for us to observe,
                    that it has been almost ’ as general an opinion, that sublimity was not only
                    something radically different from beauty, but actually opposite to it; whereas
                    the factis, that it is far more nearly related to some sorts of beauty than many
                    sorts of beauty are to each other; and that both are founded exactly upon the
                    same principle of suggesting some past or possible emotion of some sentient
                    being.</p>
                <p>Upon this important point we are happy to find our opinions confirmed by the
                    authority of Mr Stewart, who, in his Essay on the Beautiful, already referred
                    to, has observed, not only that there appears to him to be no inconsistency or
                    impropriety in such expressions as the <hi rend="italic">Sublime Beauties</hi>
                    of nature, or of the sacred Seriptures; but has added, in express terms, that,
                    “to oppose the beautiful to the sublime, or to the picturesque, strikes him as
                    something analogous to a contrast between the beautiful and the comic, the
                    beautiful and the tragie, the beautiful and the pathetic, or the beautiful and
                    the romantic.”</p>
                <p>The only other advantage which we shall specify as hkely to result from the
                    general adoption of the theory <hi rend="superscript"> we</hi> have been
                    endeavouring to illustrate, is, that it seems calculated to put an end to all
                    these perplexing and vexatious questions about the standard of taste, which have
                    given occasion to so much impertinent and so much elaborate discussion. If
                    things are not beautiful in themselves, but only as they serve to suggest
                    interesting conceptions to the mind, then every thing which does in point of
                    faet suggest such a conception to any individual, <hi rend="italic">is
                    beautiful</hi> to that individual; and it is not only quite true that there is
                    no room for disputing about tastes, but that all tastes are equally just and
                    correct, in as far as each individual speaks only of his own emotions. When a
                    man calls a thing beautiful, however, he may indeed mean to make two very
                    different assertions ;—he may mean that it gives <hi rend="italic">him</hi>
                    pleasure, by suggesting to him some interesting emotion; and, in this sense,
                    there can be no doubt that, if he merely speak truth, the thing is beautiful,
                    and that it pleases him precisely in the same way that all other things please
                    those to whom they appear beautiful. But if he mean further to say that the
                    thing possesses some quality which should make it appear beautiful to every
                    other person, and that it is owing to some prejudice or defect in them if it
                    appear otherwise, then he is as unreasonable and absurd as he would think those
                    who should attempt to convince him that he felt no emotion of beauty.</p>
                <p>All tastes, then, are equally just and true, in as far as concerns the individual
                    whose taste is in question; and what a man feels distinctly to be beautiful, <hi
                    rend="italic">is beautiful</hi> to him, whatever other people may think of it.
                    All this follows clearly from the theory now in question: but it does not follow
                    from it that all tastes are equally good or desirable, or that there is any
                    difficulty in describing that which is really the best, and the most to be
                    envied. The only use of the faculty of taste is to afford an innocent delight,
                    and to aid the cultivation of a finer morality; and that man certainly will have
                    the most delight from this faculty who has the most numerous and the most
                    powerful perceptions of beauty. But if beauty consist in the reflection of our
                    affections and sympathies, it is plain that <hi rend="italic">he</hi> will
                    always see the most beauty whose affections are warmest and most exercised,
                    whose imagination is the most powerful, and who has most accustomed himself to
                    attend to the objects by which he is surrounded. In as far as mere feeling and
                    enjoyment are concerned, therefore, it seems evident that the best taste must be
                    that which belongs to the best affections, the most active fancy, and the most
                    attentive habits of observation. It will follow pretty exactly, too, that all
                    men’s perceptions of beauty will be nearly in proportion to the degree of their
                    sensibility and soeial sympathies; and that those who have no affections towards
                    sentient beings, will be just as insensible to beauty in external objects, as he
                    who cannot hear the sound of his friend’s voice must be deaf to its echo.</p>
                <p>In so far as the sense of beauty is regarded as a mere source of enjoyment, this
                    seems to be the only distinction that deserves to be attended to; and the only
                    cultivation that taste should ever receive, with a view to the gratification of
                    the individual, should be through the indirect channel of cultivating the
                    affections and powers of observation. If we aspire, however, to be <hi
                    rend="italic">creators</hi> as well as observers of beauty, and place any part
                    of our happiness in ministering to the gratification of others—as artists, or
                    poets, or authors of any sort—then, indeed, a new distinction of tastes, and a
                    far more laborious system of cultivation, will be necessary. A man who pursues
                    only his own delight will be as much charmed with objects that suggest powerful
                    emotions in consequence of personal and accidental associations, as with those
                    that introduce similar emotions by means of associations that are universal and
                    indestructible. To him, all objects of the former class are really as beautiful
                    as those of the latter—and, for his own gratification, thecreation of that sort
                    of beauty is just as important an occupation; but if he conceive the ambition of
                    creating beauties for the admiration <pb break="no" facs="nls:193195841"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0704-5841-0502"/>of others, he must be cautious to employ only such
                    objects as are the <hi rend="italic">natural</hi> signs, or the <hi
                    rend="italic">inseparable</hi> concomitants of emotions, of which the greater
                    part of mankind are susceptible; and his taste will <hi rend="italic">then</hi>
                    deserve to be called bad and false, if he obtrude upon the public, as beautiful,
                    objects that are not likely to be associated in common minds with any
                    interesting impressions.</p>
                <p>For a man himself, then, there is no taste that is either bad or false; and the
                    only difference worthy of being attended to, is that between a great deal and a
                    very little. Some who have cold affections, sluggish imaginations, and no habits
                    of observation, can with difficulty discern beauty in any thing; while others,
                    who are full of kindness and sensibility, and who have been accustomed to attend
                    to all the objects around them, feel it almost in every thing. It is no matter
                    what other people may think of the objects of their admiration; nor ought it to
                    be any concern of theirs that the public would be astonished or offended if they
                    were called upon to join in that admiration. As long as no such call is made,
                    this anticipated discrepancy of feeling need give <hi rend="italic">them</hi> no
                    uneasiness; and the suspicion of it should produce no contempt in any other
                    person. It is a strange aberration indeed of vanity that makes us despise
                    persons for being happy, for having sources of enjoyment in which we cannot
                    share; and yet this is the true account of the ridicule which is so generally
                    poured upon individuals who seek only to enjoy their peculiar tastes unmolested;
                    for, if there be any truth in the theory we have been expounding, no taste is
                    bad for any other reason than because it is peculiar, as the objects in which it
                    delights must actually serve to suggest to the individual those common emotions
                    and universal affections upon which the sense of beauty is everywhere founded.
                    The misfortune is, however, that we are apt to consider all persons who make
                    known their peculiar relishes, and especially all who create any objects for
                    their gratification as in some measure dictating to the public, and setting up
                    an idol for general adoration; and hence this intolerant interference with
                    almost all peculiar perceptions of beauty, and the unsparing derision that
                    pursues all deviations from acknowledged standards. This intolerance, we admit,
                    is often provoked by something of a spirit of <hi rend="italic">proselytism</hi>
                    and arrogance, in those who mistake their own casual associations for natural or
                    universal relations; and the consequence is, that mortified vanity dries up the
                    fountain of their peculiar enjoyment, and disenchants, by a new association of
                    general contempt or ridicule, the scenes that had been consecrated by some
                    innocent but accidental emotion.</p>
                <p>As all men must have some peculiar associations, all men must have-some peculiar
                    notions of beauty, and, of course, to a certain extent, a taste that the public
                    would be entitled to consider as false or vitiated. For those who make no
                    demands on public admiration, however, it is hard to be obliged to sacrifice
                    this source of enjoyment; and, even for those who labour for applause, the
                    wisest course, perhaps, if it were only practicable, would be to have two
                    tastes,—one to enjoy, and one to work by; one founded upon universal
                    associations, according to which they finished those performances for which they
                    challenged universal praise; and another guided by all casual and individual
                    associations, through which they looked fondly upon nature, and upon the objects
                    of their secret admiration. (p. p.)</p>
