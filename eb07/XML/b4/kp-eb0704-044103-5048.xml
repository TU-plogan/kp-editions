                    ornamented buildings, erected by the ancients for the sake of bathing. Baths
                    made a part of the ancient <hi rend="italic">gymnasia,</hi> though they were
                    frequented more for the sake of pleasure than of health.</p>
                <p>The most magnificent baths were those of Titus, Paulus Aemilius, and Diocletian,
                    of which some ruins still remain. It is said that at Rome there were eight
                    hundred and fifty-six public baths. Fabricius justly observes, that the
                    excessive luxury of the Romans appeared in nothing more visible than in their
                    baths. Seneca complains that the baths of plebeians were filled from silver
                    pumps, and that the freedmen trod on gcms; and Macrobius tells us of one Sergius
                    Oratus, a fantastical voluptuary, who had baths suspended in the air.</p>
                <p>According to Dion, Maecenas was the first who erected a bath at Rome; but there
                    were instances of public baths prior to his time, although they were small,
                    poorly decorated, and of cold water only. Agrippa, while aedile, built a hundred
                    and sixty places for bathing, where the citizens might be accommodated either
                    with hot or with cold water gratis; and, following his example, Nero, Vespasian,
                    Titus, Domitian, Severus, Gordian, Aurelian, Maximian, Diocletian, and most of
                    the emperors who studied to gain the affections of the people, erected baths
                    inlaid with the richest marble, and wrought according to the rules of the most
                    delicate architecture. The wealthy had baths, frequently very magnificent ones,
                    at their own residences, especially after the practice of pillaging the
                    provinces had commenced; but these they only used on extraordinary occasions.
                    The great men, and even the emperors themselves, sometimes bathed in public with
                    the rest of the people. Alexander Severus was the first who allowed the public
                    baths to be opened in the night-time during the heats of summer.</p>
                <p>The Greek baths were usually annexed to the <hi rend="italic">palest roe</hi> or
                    <hi rend="italic">gymnasia,</hi> of which they were considered a part; and
                    consisted of seven different apartments, usually separated from one another, and
                    intermixed with other bulldogs belonging to different sorts of exercises. These
                    were, the cold bath, <hi rend="italic">frigida lavatio;</hi> the <hi
                    rend="italic">elceothesium,</hi> or room where they were anointed with oil; the
                    <hi rend="italic">frigidarium,</hi> or cooling room; the <hi rend="italic"
                    >propnigeum,</hi> or entrance of the <hi rend="italic">hypo-caustum</hi> or
                    stove; the vaulted room for sweating in, or vapour-bath, called <hi
                    rend="italic">concamerata sudatio,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">tepidarium;</hi>

                    baths disjoined from the palestrae, they appear to have been usually double; one
                    for men and another for women, but so near that the same furnace heated both.
                    The middle part was occupied by a large basin, which received water by several
                    pipes, and was surrounded by a balustrade, behind which there was an area for
                    the reception of those who waited to usc the bath. These baths were vaulted
                    over, and only received light from the top.</p>
                <p>In the Roman baths, the first part which appeared was a large basin, called <hi
                    rend="italic">κοί.υμζτβζα</hi> in Greek, and <hi rend="italic">natatio or
                    piscina</hi> in Latin. In the middle was the <hi rend="italic">hypocaustum,</hi>
                    which had a row of four apartments on each side, called <hi rend="italic"
                    >balnearia;</hi> these were the stove, hot bath, cold bath, and <hi
                    rend="italic">tepidarium.</hi> The two stoves, called <hi rend="italic"
                    >laconicum</hi> and <hi rend="italic">tepidarium,</hi> were circular, and joined
                    together; and their floor was hollow and suspended, in order to receive the beat
                    of a large furnace, which communicated with the stoves through the vacuities of
                    their floor. This furnace also heated another room called msaríww, in which were
                    three large brazen vessels called <hi rend="italic">milliaria,</hi> containing
                    respectively hot, warm, and cold water, and so disposed that, by means of
                    siphons and pipes, the water might be made to pass out of one or other of them
                    into the bath, in order to adjust its temperature. Such is the description given
                    by Vitruvius.</p>
                <p>At three in the afternoon, which Pliny calls <hi rend="italic">hora octava et
                    nona,</hi> the Romans repaired to the baths, public or private. This was called
                    the <hi rend="italic">hora balnei,</hi> or the “bath hour.” In summer the
                    earliest hour of admission was eight, and in winter nine; whence the expression
                    of Pliny applied to the hour of general resort. The public baths were opened at
                    the sound of a bell, and always at the same hour. Those who came too late stood
                    a chance of obtaining only cold water. The bathers commenced with hot water; but
                    when the pores had been thus opened, and a profuse perspiration produced, they
                    thought it prudent to close them again, either with the cold bath, or at least
                    with a sprinkling of cold water. During the bath the body was scraped with a
                    kind of blunt knife or strigil, such as may still be found in the cabinets of
                    the curious. Bathing was succeeded by unction and perfuming, after which they
                    went fresh to the <hi rend="italic">ccenaculum.</hi></p>
                <p>The Romans, when they found their stomachs overcharged, proceeded to the bath.
                    This we learn from Juvenal, who inveighs against those who, having gorged
                    themselves with eating, were forced to go into the baths to seek relief. They
                    also repaired to a bath to refresh themselves after any considerable fatigue or
                    travel; and hence Plautus says, on one occasion, that all the baths in this
                    world were not sufficient to remove the weariness he felt. After Pompey’s time
                    the humour of bathing was carried to such excess that many were ruined, and some
                    had brought themselves to such a state that they could not take food without
                    first bathing. The emperor Titus is said to have lost his life in consequence of
                    the artificial habit thus induced. Hence Pliny inveighs against those physicians
                    who held that hot baths aided digestion; and the emperor Hadrian laid a
                    restraint on the immoderate humour of bathing, by a public edict, prohibiting
                    all persons from bathing before the eighth hour.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic smallcaps"> Baths</hi><hi rend="italic">of Agrippa, Thermae
                    Agrippinae,</hi> were built of brick, but painted in enamel. Those of Nero, <hi
                    rend="italic">Thermae Neronianae,</hi> were not only furnished with fresh water,
                    but had the sea brought into them; those of Caracalla were adorned with two
                    hundred marble columns, and furnished with sixteen hundred marble seats, which,
                    Lipsius assures us, were so large, that eighteen hundred persons might
                    conveniently bathe in them at the same time. But the baths of Diocletian, <hi
                    rend="italic">thermae Diocletianoe,</hi> surpassed all the rest in magnificence;
                    one hundred and forty thousand <pb break="no" facs="nls:193195061"

                    them. A considerable portion of this vast structure, as well as of the baths of
                    Caracalla, still remains; and, from the dimensions of the arches, the beauty of
                    the pillars, the profusion of foreign marble, the curious moulding of the roofs,
                    the multitude of spacious apartments, and a variety of other circumstances,
                    these ruins may be regarded as the most remarkable relics of ancient taste and
                    splendour.</p>

                    oracles, which is frequently mentioned in their books, especially the Talmud.
                    The bath-kol was a fantastic method of divination invented by the Jews, though
                    called by them a revelation of God’s will, made to his chosen people after all
                    verbal prophecies had ceased in Israel, being, in fact, analogous to the <hi
                    rend="italic">Sortes Virgilianae</hi> among the Romans. For as, with the latter,
                    the first words they happened to turn to in the works of the Mantuan bard were
                    considered a kind of oracle prognostic of future events, so with the Jews, when
                    they appealed to Bath-kol, the first words they heard from any man’s mouth were
                    regarded as a voice from heaven, directing them in the, matter they inquired
                    about. And· even the Christians were not quite free from this superstition,
                    often making the same use of the Scriptures as the Romans did of the works of
                    Virgil; and it descended, through them, to later times. In France it was the
                    practice for several ages to use this kind of divination at the consecration of
                    a bishop, in order to discover his life, manners, and future behaviour; and the
                    usage came into England with the Norman conquest, for we are told, that, at the
                    consecration of William, the second Norman bishop of the diocese of Norwich, the
                    words which first occurred on dipping into the Bible were, “Not this man, but
                    Barabbas.” William died soon after, and was succeeded by Herbert de Lozinga,
                    chief simony broker to King William Rufus, on whose consecration the Bible
                    opened at the words in which Jesus accosted Judas Iscariot; “Friend, wherefore
                    art thou come ?” This circumstance so affected Herbert that it brought him to a
                    thorough repentance of his crime, in expiation of which he built the cathedral
                    church of Norwich, the first stone of which he laid in the year 1096.</p>
