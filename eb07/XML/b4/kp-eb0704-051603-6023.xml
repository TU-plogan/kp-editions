                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra

                <p><label type="entry">BEDFORDSHIRE</label>, an inland English county, situated
                    nearly in the centre of the island, but rather towards the eastern side. It is
                    bounded on the north by Huntingdonshire and Northamptonshire, on the west by
                    Buckinghamshire, on the south by that county and Hertfordshire and on the east
                    by the latter and Cambridgeshire. Its greatest length is about thirty-six miles,
                    and its greatest breadth only twenty-two miles. Its extent is 463 square miles,
                    or 296,320 English statute acres.</p>
                <p>The face of the country is in general level, but with gentle undulations,
                    scarcely deserving the name of hills, except towards Buckinghamshire, from which
                    county a part of the Chiltern Hills enter, but only the lowest portion of that
                    range. The chalk of these hills is found a valuable manure on some of the other
                    soils of the county. From the south-east to the centre of the county is a
                    valuable district of dairy land. The western side is chiefly a sandy soil, but,
                    being well cultivated on the Norfolk system, is productive; near Woburn it is
                    generally sandy, and was sterile till the modern improvements in agriculture,
                    fostered by the late Duke of Bedford, had extended their influence and
                    productiveness. Near to Biggleswade is a portion of land which yields the
                    highest rent and most valuable products. It is cultivated by a kind of market
                    gardeners, and onion and other seeds are grown there for the supply of the shops
                    of the seedsmen in London. Much of the former barren sandy soils has been
                    planted of late years, and the inclosure of many of the largest common fields
                    has improved both the beauty and the fertility of the county.</p>
                <p>The land is drained by . many brooks, which contribute to increase the rivers,
                    and, by rendering them navigable, administer to the benefit of the inhabitants.
                    No county is better accommodated with good roads than Bedfordshire, chiefly
                    owing to the exertions of the late Mr Whitbread, before whose time they were in
                    a very bad condition. The river ©use enters this county on its northwestern
                    side, collects the water from a considerable district during a winding course,
                    and becomes navigable at Bedford. In its progress towards Huntingdonshire it
                    receives the waters of the Ivel, which is also navigable S3 high up as
                    Biggleswade, and the united stream runs to the German Ocean at Lynn. A small
                    portion of the western side of the county is benefited by its water
                    communication with London, and with the coal districts of Staffordshire, which
                    it enjoys through the Grand Junction Canal.</p>
                <p>As Bedfordshire is merely an agricultural county, and as four fifths of the land
                    are devoted to pasture or to the dairy, and only one fifth to tillage, the
                    increased number of inhabitants has caused a scarcity of employment, and a
                    consequent great advance in the poor rates. The chief occupation of the
                    manufacturing kind consists in plaiting straw and forming it into chip hats,
                    making baskets and other articles; and is confined almost exclusively to
                    females. Dunstable has long been celebrated for this trade, and it is
                    considerably extended over other parts of the county. Besides this, till of late
                    years, the trade of bone lace, made both from silk and thread, afforded employ*
                    ment to the females, and still continues to do so in an inferior degree, though
                    it has been much diminished by the introduction and improvements in machine
                    lace. Some trade is carried on by the rivers and canal, by which corn and butter
                    are conveyed to distant markets, and the inhabitants supplied with fuel. As the
                    great north roads pass through the county in two lines, the traffic on these gi'
                    <hi rend="superscript"> ,es</hi> some activity to its commerce.</p>

                <p>The civil division of the county is into nine hundreds, which contain nine
                    market-towns and 124 parishes. In an ecclesiastical view it forms part of the
                    diocese of Lincoln and the archdeaconry of Bedford; in its judicial relation it
                    is in the Norfolk circuit.</p>
                <p>The titles derived from the county are duke to the house of Russell, and baron of
                    Bletsoe to the family of Lord St John. Two members to the house of commons are
                    returned by the county, and two by the town of Bedford, the only borough within
                    it.</p>
                <p>The most distinguished residences in this county are, lrf, Woburn Abbey, near the
                    town of that name. It was formerly a Cistertian abbey, granted at the
                    Reformation by Henry VIII. to the family of Russell, the fourth duke of which
                    house erected the present edifice. It is situated in an extensive park, is a
                    very grand and capacious pile, and is furnished with a large and valuable
                    collection of paintings and statues. 2√Zy, Luton Hoo, a mansion which, though
                    not built by John earl of Bute, was by him brought to a regular design under the
                    direction of Adam the architect. A new library, 146 feet in length, furnished
                    with a valuable collection of books, and a large selection of paintings of some
                    of the first masters, chiefly of the Italian school, are its distinguished
                    ornaments. The grounds have received every improvement that art can produce in a
                    situation not naturally picturesque. 3 &lt;/(?/, Ampthill Park, formerly the
                    seat of the earls of Upper Ossory, now of Lord Holland. It is a superb edifice,
                    with a good library, valuable collections of paintings, with a museum of natural
                    history, and is placed in a delightful park, adorned with most beautiful
                    spreading ancient oaks.</p>
                <p>Besides these there are other mansions which are highly deserving of notice and
                    admiration, especially that of Mr Whitbread at South-hill; Wrest Park, belonging
                    to the Countess de Grey; Ridgemount, to Mr Potter M ’ Queen; Morgenhanger House,
                    to Mr Thornton; Potton, to Sir John Burgoyne; Oakley House, to the Marquis of
                    Tavistock; Colworth House, to Dr Lee; and, though not so distinguished by its
                    extent as many others, Cardington House, the residence of Howard the
                    philanthropist, now of Mr S. C. Whitbread.</p>
                <p>The population of the county stood at the three decennial numerations as

                <p>ln the year 1821 the families chiefly employed in trade and manufactures were
                    4827; those employed in agriculture 10,754; and those not comprised in either of
                    these classes 1792. The towns and their population in 1821 were as follows
                    :—Bedford, 5466; Biggleswade, 2778; Dunstable, 1831; Ampthill, 1527; Luton,
                    2986; Leighton-Buzzard, 2749; Potton, 1498.</p>
                <p>When the Romans landed in this kingdom Bedfordshire formed a portion of a
                    district called Catieuchlana, whose sovereign or chief, Cassibelenus or
                    Cassibelaunus, commanded the united forces which opposed Julius Caesar. V hen,
                    in the year 310, the emperor Constantine ruled the whole island, and divided it
                    into five provinces, Bedfordshire was included in the third division called <hi
                    rend="italic">Flavia Coesariensis,</hi> and remained in that location till the
                    final abandonment of Britain by the Romans. Under the Saxon heptarchy it formed
                    part of the kingdom of Mercia, until, with the rest of the island, it was united
                    with the kingdom of the West Saxons, which was divided by Alfred mto counties,
                    hundreds, and tythings; when this county hist received the name it has since
                    retained.</p>
                <p>liiere are many remains of Roman, Saxon, and Norman antiquities. Traces of a
                    Roman station are to be seen at</p>
                <p>Sandys, near Potton, and at Maiden-Bower, near Dunstable. Leighton-Buzzard, or
                    Beaudesart, is supposed to have ∙been a Roman camp; and vestiges of an
                    amphitheatre of that people may be seen near Bradford Magna. The ancient
                    Icknield and Watling Street roads passed through the county, and the remains of
                    each may be definitely traced, as well as of some others constructed by that
                    people. <hi rend="smallcaps">(g.)</hi></p>
