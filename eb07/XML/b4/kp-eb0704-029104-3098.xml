                    >Berytus,</hi> in Greek <hi rend="italic">Bngurος,</hi> a seaport of Syria, in
                    the pashalic of Saide or Acre. A tongue of land, which presents a conspicuous
                    headland when viewed from the north, extends itself in a plain about five or six
                    miles from the mountains towards the sea; and on the northern edge of this plain
                    the town is situated, on a rising ground, which contributes both to its
                    cleanliness and salubrity. To the north the projection of the land forms a fine
                    bay, the bottom of which is five or six miles east-south-east of the town; and
                    there is thus a roadstead to the north-east, secured from the south-west wind,
                    which is the prevailing one. The harbour is now choked up with sand and rubbish;
                    and all that remains of the ancient structure is a pier, to which boats can
                    approach sufficiently for discharging goods. All along its front are ranged fine
                    shafts of gray granite pillars, which are used for mooring small vessels.
                    Merchant vessels and ships of war anchor at a distance in the roadstead. The
                    town itself is an irregular square, open towards the sea, and surrounded on the
                    three sides which face the land with a wall built by Djezzar Pasha, defended by
                    a few round towers of little strength, and far too feeble to resist an attack of
                    artillery. Near the sea is an old castle, on which are six pieces of artillery;
                    and at the common landing place is a ruined tower, built on a rock in the sea.
                    The town is in general better built than any along the coast, and the streets
                    are wider, being paved with large stones. The dwelling-houses are spacious,
                    lofty, and well built; the bazars are amply furnished with provisions, as well
                    as with the manufactures of the country and of Europe; and the magazines near
                    the sea-shore are large and convenient. The town contains three mosques, with
                    their courts, fountains, and minarets; and four Christian churches. Water is
                    abundantly supplied at all seasons from several fountains, constructed by
                    Djezzar Pasha. The suburbs are nearly as large as the town, consisting of houses
                    interspersed with gardens, which, being planted with fruit-trees, are extremely
                    beautiful. “The situation,” says Mr Carne, “is the most beautiful of all the
                    Syrian towns; the environs are laid out in plantations of mulberry trees, and a
                    quantity of silk is produced and exported.” Indeed, the commerce of Bairout is
                    greater than that of <pb break="no" facs="nls:193193111"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0704-3111-0292"/>any other port in Syria; and it is increasing. It
                    is the maritime emporium of Damascus, and of the surrounding country. British
                    manufactures, such as cottons, muslins, cloths, &amp;c. with bar-iron, lead,
                    coffee, spices, indigo, &amp;c. are imported. The returns are made in cotton,
                    corn, raw silk, which is the staple commodity of the country, sometimes in wine
                    and oil, and occasionally in specie. The wall of the town is supposed to be not
                    more than a mile in circuit; yet it is thought to contain from 6000 to 7000
                    inhabitants. Bairout still boasts some relics of the ancient magnificence of
                    Berytus, that celebrated “nurse of tranquil life” <hi rend="italic">(Bηξuτoζ
                    βιοτοιο γαλr∣vαιoio rι0ηvη),</hi> as Nonnus has called it <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Dionysiaca,</hi> lib. xli. p. 708. ed. Falk. Antv. 1569.) Here a public school
                    of jurisprudence, founded in the third century, acquired and long maintained a
                    high reputation. During the reign of Justinian, the two imperial cities and
                    Berytus were the only places within the limits of the empire where law was
                    permitted to be publicly taught; and of the three, the Syrian school (of which
                    Theophilus and Dorotheus, the associates of Tribonian in the compilation of the
                    <hi rend="italic">Institutions</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Digest,</hi> were
                    <hi rend="italic">antecessores</hi> or teachers), appears to have stood highest
                    in general estimation. But the prosperity of Berytus was first interrupted, and
                    finally subverted, by some of the great convulsions of nature. In the year 384,
                    the town was greatly injured by an earthquake, and in 554 it was visited by
                    another earthquake, which left it a heap of ruins. After this last catastrophe
                    the professors transferred their school to Sidon, and the surviving inhabitants
                    made an effort to raise a new city from the ruins of the old; but another
                    calamity awaited them, and this famous seat of jurisprudence was totally
                    consumed by fire. After a long interval, the modern town of Bairout was founded
                    by the Derouzis near the ancient site, and was possessed by the emirs as their
                    capital and only seaport, until they were expelled by Djezzar pasha of Acre.
