                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">The</hi> name of Barbary, or the Barbary States, is applied
                    by the moderns to an extensive district, occupying, with the exclusion of Egypt,
                    the whole northern coast of Africa. It comprehends also that portion of the
                    western coast which lies to the north of the Great Desert. The states included
                    within this district are entirely independent of and even hostile to each other,
                    and they also differ in some particulars of their political constitution. There
                    prevails, however, a striking similarity in the whole of their moral and
                    physical circumstances. Throughout all these states we see the same races
                    inhabiting the towns, the plains, and the mountain districts; the same forms of
                    social life; the same degraded and corrupted barbarism succeeding to ancient
                    grandeur and civilization. Nature presents a corresponding similarity in all the
                    peculiar qualities of aspect, soil, and climate. These resembling features
                    constitute Barbary decidedly one region; and it will, therefore, be convenient
                    to introduce here a general view ⅝f what is common to that region; while under
                    the heads of Algiers, Morocco, Tripoli, Tunis, <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193194008" xml:id="kp-eb0704-4008-0361"/>&amp;c. will be given a view
                    of the special history and circumstances of each.</p>
                <p>This part of the world has at different periods been subject to memorable
                    revolutions, and made a distinguished figure in history. It was the domain of
                    Carthage, the most flourishing seat of commerce, and one of the most powerful
                    states in antiquity,—of the prosperous Greek colony of Cyrene,—and of the potent
                    kingdom of Numidia. Even when entirely subjected to the Roman power, it ranked
                    as one of the most valuable provinces of that empire, and fully shared in the
                    measure of civilization which its influence diffused. In a few centuries,
                    however, it was overpowered by the barbarous torrent of Vandal invasion, when
                    Genseric made Carthage the seat of a powerful piratical dominion. In the seventh
                    century the rapid tide of Saracen inroad swept over the whole of this coast, and
                    subjected it to the Moslem creed and institutions, which have remained unaltered
                    to the present day. On the establishment, however, of the Turkish power on the
                    eastern shores of the Mediterranean, the barbarous corsairs, Barbarossa and
                    Dragut, seized the leading seaports upon this coast, and converted them into
                    dens of the most atrocious piracy. This system was prosecuted without
                    interruption for several centuries, till it was arrested by the interposition of
                    the great European powers. France has even undertaken, with regard to the
                    fiercest and most powerful of these states, a system of conquest and
                    colonization, the result of which, however, remains yet to be decided, in as
                    far, at least, as regards the latter.</p>
                <p>Among the natural objects which this region presents, the most prominent is that
                    immense and celebrated mountain chain which, under the name of Atlas, traverses
                    nearly its whole extent. The loftiest portion is that which towers over the
                    plain of Morocco, and, notwithstanding the intense heat of the climate, presents
                    a range of summits clad in perpetual snow. The most recent traveller in this
                    country, known by the name of Ali Bey, states that, after a very careful
                    measurement, he found its highest pinnacles to rise 13,200 feet above the level
                    of the sea. The lower stages are well cultivated and of luxuriant fertility;
                    while, in ascending, the sides exhibit every variety of climate, from the torrid
                    to the frigid zone. In skirting the kingdoms of Algiers and Tunis, its height is
                    greatly diminished, and is represented by Dr Shaw as not exceeding the loftier
                    eminences of our own island. The greater part of its declivity is here covered
                    with vines and forests; and only occasionally a rocky precipice rears its head
                    above the rest. This part of the range separates into various branches,
                    differently named, of which the most elevated is Mount Jurjura, in the province
                    of Algiers, covered with snow during a great part of the year. It forms a
                    species of chain by itself, rising very high above all others east of Morocco.
                    Besides the grand chain, there is found between it and the sea another, called
                    the Little Atlas, extending from the Straits of Gibraltar to Bona in
                    Algiers.</p>
                <p>The structure and component parts of this vast range have been very imperfectly
                    explored. It appears probable, however, that, as in other mountain groups of the
                    first magnitude, the central mass, as well as the loftier pinnacles, is composed
                    of granite. Ali Bey states, that the rocks on the coast consist of secondary
                    granite, with sandstone resting on it; a combination which seems deserving of
                    notice, from its resemblance to that which occurs at the southern extremity of
                    Africa. Marble also is said to occur abundantly in the western regions. The
                    lower and eastern branches appear, however, to contain a arge proportion of
                    calcareous rocks. The chain, consi-enng its extent, is thought not peculiarly
                    rich in metal- “ores, though this character may have been derived from the
                    supine neglect of the inhabitants in exploring its mineral treasures. Silver and
                    copper are procured to a considerable amount in the Tunisian territory. Algiers
                    produces lead, and a small proportion of iron. Morocco contains no mines that
                    are known or worked, unless in the province of Suse, the southern extremity of
                    the empire. There, iron is found at Idaultit, and copper in considerable
                    quantity in the vicinity of Tessellert. The report of gold and silver mines is
                    treated as a fable by Chenier; but Jackson asserts that he saw evident traces of
                    them in the neighbourhood of Messa. He also confirms the report of Leo, that the
                    sovereigns of Morocco discourage the working of these mines, lest the natives,
                    who at present can with difficulty be retained under the yoke, should thus be
                    enabled to set them completely at defiance.</p>
                <p>That narrow tract between the Atlas chain and the sea, which comprises the
                    Barbary States, forms a plain of luxuriant fertility, traversed by innumerable
                    streams descending from this mighty storehouse of waters. Chenier calculates
                    that upwards of six thousand are poured down from the western Atlas upon the
                    plains of Morocco. The vicinity, however, of the receptacle to their source
                    prevents their forming rivers of any great magnitude. The principal are, in
                    Morocco, the Seboo, the Morbeya, the Tensift, and the Suse; in Algiers, the
                    Shelliff; in Tunis, the Mejerdah. The soil, which is naturally of the same loose
                    and sandy character prevalent over northern Africa, is, by this profusion of
                    moisture, rendered equal in fertility to any in the world. Its lightness is even
                    beneficial, by rendering it capable of being worked with the utmost facility; so
                    that, according to Dr Shaw, a yoke of oxen can plough an acre in the day. But
                    wherever water fails, deserts are produced; presenting, on a smaller scale, the
                    same appearances with those immense wastes which extend south of the Atlas. Thus
                    the moisture which these mountains supply is the sole spring of fertility to
                    northern Africa; and Tripoli, where they terminate, borders almost immediately
                    on the sandy waste.</p>
                <p>Along the southern base of the Atlas extends a vast region, called Bildulgerid,
                    or more properly Bled-el-Jereed, <hi rend="italic">the dry country.</hi> It
                    presents a gradual transition from the luxuriant plains of Barbary to the
                    sterile desolation of the Sahara. Large streams, descending from the great
                    chain, traverse it from north to south, till they expand into lakes, or are lost
                    in the sands of the desert. The moisture, evaporated by the scorching winds
                    which blow from the south, is not sufficient for the production of wheat,
                    barley, or the finer fruits: dates are its abundant and almost sole product.
                    They form the food of its inhabitants, and the basis of their commerce.
                    Considered in a political view, this region is nominally subject to those states
                    of Barbary which lie in contact with it; but the subjection scarcely amounts to
                    more than the payment of a certain tribute. The part contiguous to and dependent
                    upon Morocco is known by the names of Tafilet and Sigil-messa.</p>
                <p>The whole of Barbary abounds, in a very remarkable degree, with different species
                    of saline substances. Common salt, particularly, is found in every form, and in
                    the greatest abundance. That drawn from the mines of Morocco is of a red colour,
                    very strong and coarse; but a white and finer kind is produced by evaporation on
                    the seacoast. The lakes of. Barbary are almost all salt to an equal degree with
                    the sea itself; and in the course of the summer many of these dry up entirely,
                    leaving the mineral encrusted on their beds. Near the lake of Marks, in the
                    Algerine territory, there is a mountain composed entirely of salt; and all the
                    chains which traverse it contain copious repositories of this mineral. Most of
                    the springs which are not warm are salt; and in the territory of Tunis <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193194021" xml:id="kp-eb0704-4021-0362"/> there is no fresh
                    water unless from rain. Many of the rivers, when they dry up in summer, leave
                    their banks copiously encrusted with nitrous and saline exudations. Saltpetre is
                    not found in a concrete state; but at Elemsan, Kairwan, and many other places,
                    the earth is so impregnated with it, that six ounces are obtained from a quintal
                    of soil.</p>
                <p>’ The Atlas Mountains, as far as is hitherto known, are not the seat of any
                    volcanic eruptions. In East Barbary earthquakes are frequent during the hot and
                    dry season, and have sometimes thrown down houses, and even carried them to a
                    considerable distance; but these are rare instances, for their effects are by no
                    means so terrible as in the south of Europe and other countries particularly
                    exposed to their ravages. The interior heat, however, manifests itself by that
                    which it communicates to a large proportion of the waters which flow through
                    this territory. Most of the streams of the Jereed are at least lukewarm; and
                    near Oran, Elemsan, Gabs, and other places in the territory of Algiers, they
                    acquire a temperature which fits them for warm baths. About forty miles to the
                    east of Constantina are those called the Hamman Meskouteen, the heat of which is
                    so intense as to boil animal food in a quarter of an hour. The rocks over which
                    this rivulet flows are entirely calcined by its influence, which, acting
                    variously on the different substances, consuming some and leaving others nearly
                    entire, produces some curious phenomena. The rocks at one place represent a line
                    of regular cones, believed by the Arabs to be the tents of their ancestors
                    converted into stone. At another place the action is still deeper and more
                    irregular; the figures of sheep, horses, camels, even of men, women, and
                    children, are presented to the eye, all of which are believed by the natives to
                    have undergone the same transformation.</p>
                <p>The productions of the soil in Barbary are not materially different from those of
                    southern Europe, the climate being brought by the vicinity of the mountains to
                    pretty nearly the same temperature. The grains chiefly cultivated are wheat and
                    barley, of which the crops are abundant, though there is not above one in the
                    year. Oats are not frequent, but beans and lentils are very common. Peas have
                    been introduced by Europeans. Pot herbs and fruits are abundant, and nearly
                    resemble those of Europe; with the addition, in the last branch, of the
                    palm-tree and the lotus.</p>
                <p>The animal world, particularly in its wild members, presents an interesting field
                    of observation. The Numidian lion still retains its ancient character of
                    strength and ferocity. To guard against its attacks, the villages and
                    encampments are surrounded with a species of palisade, and upon the slightest
                    alarm large fires are kindled; yet these multiplied precautions are not always
                    sufficient to prevent the irruption of this lord of the forests. The animal
                    called here a tiger is in reality only a panther. Wild boars are very numerous,
                    and the hunting of them affords a favourite amusement. The hyena is common, and
                    is called the <hi rend="italic">dubbah.</hi> Jackson mentions an animal called
                    the <hi rend="italic">aoudad,</hi> which inhabits the most lofty and precipitous
                    regions of the Atlas; but, on account of its rugged and inaccessible haunts, has
                    never been sufficiently observed or described. The antelope, or gazelle, from
                    its beauty, is the favourite of the Arabs. The Barbary females paint their eyes
                    with a preparation of lead called Elkahol-filelly, in order that they may rival
                    the largeness and blackness of those of the gazelle. Gazelle here, as angel with
                    us, is the most flattering epithet that can be applied to female beauty.
                    Although the antelope be the swiftest of all animals, he is soon fatigued, so
                    that the greyhound at length comes up with him. The flesh is valued, and is
                    similar to venison. Among the smaller animals the most noted are the jerboa and
                    jird, which are about the size of a rat, burrow in the ground, and afford
                    agreeable food.</p>
                <p>Among birds, the chief is the ostrich, a species often described, and which
                    occurs along the whole northern border of the desert. About Wedinoon and Cape
                    Bojador they are said to be the largest, and to have the finest feathers, of any
                    in the world. The feathers form a considerable article in the commerce of
                    Morocco.</p>
                <p>The serpent species is very numerous. The great boa constrictor frequently
                    appears in the Sahara. It is not poisonous, and destroys merely by its strength
                    and ferocity. There are several species which contain a very active poison; but
                    these, Dr Shaw conceives, do not exist in that great variety which is enumerated
                    by ancient writers. There are also domestic serpents, of a more harmless nature,
                    never molested, and held even in a kind of veneration. The most destructive of
                    this class are the scorpions, which swarm to such a degree that, in summer, they
                    are often found in the beds. It is believed in Morocco that the flesh of this
                    animal affords a cure for its bite; and most of the inhabitants on that account
                    keep a bottle of scorpions preserved in olive oil. Shaw observes that those of
                    Algiers and Tunis, to the north of the Atlas, are not very noxious, causing only
                    a slight inflammation and fever; but that in the Sahara they are much larger,
                    and their venom more malignant.</p>
                <p>The insect tribe in this country presents a much more terrible enemy, the locust.
                    This destructive insect is bred on the confines of the desert; but at irregular
                    intervals, impelled by some unknown cause, its swarms take their direction
                    towards the cultivated regions. They move in vast bodies, and with an order
                    which resembles that of regular armies. The march is all in one direction, led
                    by a chief, called by the natives Sultan Jeraad∙ All attempts to stop their
                    course by digging deep pits or by kindling fires have proved abortive. The
                    foremost, indeed, fall victims to these means of annoyance; but the vast mass
                    behind, undismayed by the fate of their forerunners, continue to pour on, file
                    after file, in close and uninterrupted succession. The fires are extinguished;
                    the pits are filled up; and the husbandman abandons in despair all attempts to
                    arrest their progress. Every thing green is thoroughly consumed; and the fields,
                    from being clad in all the verdure of spring, assume at once the aspect of
                    wintry desolation. This scourge sometimes continues for several years, and is
                    not unfrequently followed by the still more terrible evil of plague. It forms a
                    very inconsiderable compensation to the inhabitants, that they use the locusts
                    as food, and in that view regard them even as a delicacy.</p>
                <p>The domestic animals do not differ materially from; those of Europe, with the
                    exception of the camel, which, <hi rend="smallcaps">í</hi> though frequent in
                    Barbary, belongs more properly to the desert. The excellence of the horse was
                    formerly the boast of Numidia; and Barbary horses have been highly valued, even
                    in modern times. But the breed is said to have degenerated, chiefly in
                    consequence of the best horses being liable to be seized by persons in power,
                    lhe ass, and still more the mule, are the animals chiefly employed in labour.
                    The cows are small, and produce little milk. The sheep fed on the Atlas arc
                    often of exquisite flavour. The wool being left entirely to nature, is of
                    various quality, some of it coarse, but some very fine. The goats of Morocco
                    produce that species of leather, the softness and pliability of which cause it
                    to be held in such high estimation.</p>
                <p>After surveying the aspect of nature, our attention is drawn to the ruins of
                    ancient art. The whole extent of Algiers and Tunis, and even deep into the
                    desert, is co-vered<pb break="no" facs="nls:193194034"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0704-4034-0363"/> with the most superb monuments of Roman grandeur.
                    Constantina (the ancient Cirta), Spaitla (Suffetula), El Gemme, and many other
                    places, exhibit specimens of the architecture of that people in its highest
                    perfection. The temple at Spaitla is considered by Bruce as the most perfect
                    example of the composite order existing. It seems matter of regret, as well as
                    of surprise, considering the general interest taken in these objects, that the
                    drawings made by Bruce, or under his direction, though said to be very fine,
                    should never have been given to the public. The remains of Carthage are entirely
                    subterraneous, yet these still convey an idea of the greatness and industry of
                    that celebrated capital. Of the immense aqueduct which conveyed water to the
                    city from the distance of sixty miles, many hundred arches are still to be seen,
                    and several cisterns, nearly entire, are used as habitations by the Arabs. A few
                    years ago, in digging among the ruins of Utica, some labourers found a number of
                    beautiful statues, some mutilated, but others in complete preservation. Among
                    them were two of Tiberius and Augustus, the former very finely executed; also
                    four female figures, two of them exquisite specimens of Grecian sculpture. The
                    spirit of antiquarian research seems to be active among the Christian
                    inhabitants of Tunis; and many, even of the poorer classes, are said to be in
                    possession of, medals, engraved stones, and other curiosities. These, however,
                    by being dispersed, are in some measure lost to the public.</p>
                <p>The population of the Barbary States is made up of a number of distinct races. A
                    particular survey of each will therefore be necessary, in order to afford any
                    complete view of the subject.</p>
                <p>The first and most numerous class are the Moors. This is a European term, derived
                    from the ancient <hi rend="italic">Mauri,</hi> of whom probably no traces are
                    now to be found. It is applied to the inhabitants of the cities of Barbary, and
                    the country in their immediate vicinity. Generally speaking, a Mahommedan city
                    presents a uniform aspect. Everywhere the same silence and seclusion, the same
                    absence of all gaiety, bustle, and animation; narrow and dirty streets, bordered
                    on each side by lines of dead wall; every individual burying himself in the
                    interior of his family, and shrouding his existence, as it were, from all other
                    eyes; while the female sex, who in Europe form the ornament of society, are
                    immured in the apartments of the haram, bought and sold almost as slaves.
                    Withal, however, there is combined an outward deportment of great gravity,
                    solemnity, and decorum, with which neither the sentiments nor actions are found
                    to correspond. But this is more particularly true of the cities of Morocco; for
                    in Algiers and Tunis, an unsettled government, and the habits of a seafaring
                    life, have produced, especially in the lower orders, a greater appearance of
                    activity and turbulence, though without any departure from the general tenor of
                    oriental habits.</p>
                <p>A collection of <hi rend="italic">Letters</hi> has been published by a female
                    relation of Mr Tully, formerly consul at Tripoli, which gives a very lively
                    picture of the manners of a Barbary court, and particularly oßfemale society.
                    This she had peculiar access to observe, in consequence of the intimate footing
                    on which she lived with the ladies of the palace. The wives of the pasha and the
                    other grandees are generally Georgian or Circassian captives, who are purchased
                    at Constantinople at an early age, and trained in all those accomplishments
                    which fit them for the harams of the great. By the Mahommedan law, each
                    individual may have four wives and an equal number of concubines; but there is
                    one principal wife, who alone shares the sovereign power. She has usually the
                    same origin with the others, and enters the haram as a slave, but succeeds, by
                    address and superior powers of captivation, in raising herself to this envied
                    dignity. It; <hi rend="subscript"> s</hi> unlawful for the daughters of the
                    sovereign to marry a subject; and as they do not usually form alliances with
                    foreign states, they have no resource but to marry Turks and renegadoes, the
                    refuse of society. They thus often choose as companions for life persons
                    unworthy even to appear in their company. Accordingly, the husband is ruled with
                    the most absolute sway, and treated usually worse than their slaves; to all
                    which he quietly submits, in consideration of the lucrative offices this
                    connection secures his advancement to.</p>
                <p>The toilet of a Moorish lady is said to be formed entirely after the ancient
                    model. No dressing-table is used; but a number of slaves attend, to each of whom
                    a different office is assigned. One plaits and perfumes the hair, another
                    arranges the eyebrows, a third paints them, and so on. A profusion of the
                    richest Arabian perfumes and scented waters is used, and powdered cloves in vast
                    quantity are stuffed into the hair. The eyelashes, by a very tedious process,
                    are painted black, and, by pulling out a number of the hairs, are formed into a
                    particular shape. This operation, though attended with very acute pain, is
                    cheerfully submitted to. In short, a Moorish lady cannot be fully dressed under
                    several hours; and her appearance is then so completely altered, that her
                    nearest relations could scarcely recognise her.</p>
                <p>These ladies are represented, in the Letters alluded to, as by no means spending
                    their time, as usually supposed, in listless indolence. It is their task to
                    overlook the numerous slaves who grind, spin, and perform all the necessary
                    domestic offices. They are particularly expected to superintend the culinary
                    operations, in order to guard against poison, the administering of which at
                    meals is not unusual in these countries. These cares, with those of their
                    family, fill up the time of the more amiable and domestic members of the haram;
                    whilst those of a lighter turn find full occupation in the difficult and
                    dangerous intrigues to which their disposition prompts them. With a few
                    exceptions, however, they seem tolerably cheerful; and the view which these
                    Letters give of their character is, on the whole, favourable.</p>
                <p>The inhabitants of the towns do not form a race by themselves, but are aggregated
                    from the various races who inhabit, or have inhabited, the country districts;
                    the Arabs, the Brebers, probably in part also the ancient possessors, and the
                    Vandal conquerors of Northern Africa. All these have been cast into that mould
                    which Moslem despotism invariably forms. There is, however, a peculiar race,
                    called Andalousie, descendants of those Moors expelled from Spain by the stupid
                    despotism of that government. They inhabit chiefly the northern cities of the
                    empire of Morocco, pique themselves on their descent, and seem to retain
                    somewhat of that pride of birth which was probably formed during their residence
                    in Europe.</p>
                <p>The sciences, which anciently formed the glory of the Saracen name, are now,
                    throughout the whole of this region, entirely extinct. Instruments are still
                    shown, which display the most exquisite mechanical skill; but they are preserved
                    merely as antique curiosities, without any knowledge of the principles by which
                    they were constructed. Astronomy does not extend to the construction of a
                    sundial, nor chemistry beyond the making of rose-water. With regard to medicine,
                    the estimation in which that science, once so flourishing, is held, may be
                    judged from the emolument reaped by its professors. The fee of a physician
                    scarcely ever exceeds sixpence, and the most serious operations are performed
                    for a shilling. These humble practitioners, however, succeed tolerably when only
                    external wounds are to be healed; but in all internal maladies it appears very
                    doubtful whether more patients die of the disease or of the remedies
                    administered.</p>
                <p>The Jews form a numerous class throughout all the <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193194047" xml:id="kp-eb0704-4047-0364"/>cities, both of Eastern and
                    Western Barbary. They seem to exist there nearly on the same footing as in
                    Europe during the middle ages, the objects of universal hatred, contempt, and
                    derision, and their plunder the invariable resource, whenever the sovereign
                    finds himself in pecuniary embarrassment. Yet their knowledge of trade, and
                    entire devotion to it, have almost secured to them the monopoly of mercantile
                    and money transactions; and they are thus enabled to make such enormous profits
                    as induce them to endure all this oppression. In Morocco, however,
                    long-suffering appears at length to have wearied out their patience, and their
                    numbers have been considerably thinned. In the capital, they are not now
                    supposed to exceed 2000. But no such diminution seems to have occurred in the
                    other states. Tunis is calculated to contain above 15,000.</p>
                <p>The country Moors, or those who cultivate the plains of Barbary, appear to differ
                    very widely from the inhabitants of the cities. The property, or rather the
                    occupation of land, is, as usual in despotic countries, much subdivided. The
                    manners of the cultivators have been little observed, but they are said to be
                    characterized by a peculiar degree of ignorance and simplicity.</p>
                <p>The inhabitants of the pastoral districts intermediate between the sea-coast and
                    the Sahara are known by the name of Arabs. They appear, in fact, to comprise
                    such of the descendants of the conquerors of Barbary as have adhered to their
                    original and native employments. They exhibit the same migratory habits, the
                    same simplicity of life, and the same union of hospitality and plunder, which
                    distinguish their countrymen in Arabia. The touch of despotism has, however,
                    taken from them much of that sense of honour and dignity which elevate the
                    latter above the common level of barbarous tribes. They live in tents, thirty or
                    forty of which united form a camp or <hi rend="italic">douar,</hi> under the
                    command of a scheik; and the supremacy over a number of these camps constitutes
                    a great scheik or emir. The tents are made by themselves, of camels’ hair and
                    the fibres of the palm-tree; and they are arranged generally in three concentric
                    circles, around the habitation of the scheik. The cattle go out to pasture
                    during the day, and are tended by the men and boys; at night they are brought
                    within the circle of the tents, where they arc further guarded by a number of
                    vigilant dogs, which bark incessantly. The complexion of the Arabs is of a deep
                    copper. The females possess beauty when young, but quickly lose it. They adorn
                    themselves by puncturing and tattooing, practices unknown to the other
                    inhabitants of Barbary. When the spot occupied by a <hi rend="italic">douar</hi>
                    is exhausted, they remove to another; the women are then conveyed in groups,
                    generally of three upon the back of each camel; whilst the children, lambs, and
                    kids, are lodged in panniers on the sides. The scheiks embrace every opportunity
                    of acting independently; and whenever a weak government or civil war occurs,
                    they immediately begin to plunder. Of all the inhabitants of Barbary, the Arabs
                    are animated with the most bigoted zeal for the Moslem tenets, and the deadliest
                    enmity to the Christian name. This disposition, the effects of which have been
                    felt by all European visitors, has probably darkened somewhat beyond reality the
                    picture drawn by them of these tribes.</p>
                <p>From the inhabitants of the plains, we ascend to those of the mountain districts.
                    The greater part of the declivity of the Atlas chain is cultivated by a very
                    remarkable people, called the Brebers. They have been named also Brebes,
                    Berebbers, Barbars; and from them the name of Barbary is supposed to be derived.
                    They appear to be descended from the original possessors of this region; view
                    themselves still as its rightful owners; and regard with boundless indignation
                    all the other nations by whom it is now occupied. Their subjection has always
                    been very imperfect, the slightest injury being sufficient to drive them into
                    rebellion. Their chiefs are elective, and they alone, in this part of Africa,
                    have a government moulded into somewhat of a republican form. They bear an
                    extremely warlike character, and excel the inhabitants of the plains in the
                    management of fire-arms. The army of Morocco has often been completely defeated
                    by them, and pursued to the gates of the capital. In general, however, they
                    carry on war chiefly by surprise and ambuscade. The idea formed of them by the
                    Saracen conquerors may be conceived by a passage in a celebrated Arabian writer,
                    Bakoui, who gravely informs us that they are the offspring of the giant Goliah,
                    whom they resemble in strength and wickedness. They are divided into various
                    tribes, of whom the Errifi, inhabiting a province of the same name between
                    Algiers and’ Morocco, are the most powerful and ferocious.</p>
                <p>The Brebcrs are distinguished from the other inhabitants of Barbary by a language
                    which has nothing in common with any of the rest. It is considered by Adelung as
                    being the same, allowing for some variation of dialect, with that of the Tibboo,
                    the Tuarick, and of all the indigenous population of this part of Africa.
                    Marsden and Langles have supposed it to be a corruption of the ancient Punic
                    language; but Mr Pinkerton forcibly argues, that a language which has no
                    abstract terms, none belonging to the arts and sciences, and no written
                    characters, could scarcely be even a corruption of the language of a civilized
                    people. Its high antiquity, however, cannot well be doubted.</p>
                <p>The Shelluhs inhabit the southern parts of Morocco. They are smaller in stature
                    than the Brebers, and in character somewhat less rude. In all other respects
                    they exactly resemble, and may be considered as a branch of, that race. Some
                    writers have asserted that their language is different; but the vocabulary given
                    by Chenier, and the information of Dupuis, seem to leave no doubt that it is
                    merely a dialect with very slight variations.</p>
                <p>To these different classes we may finally add one which is not inconsiderable,
                    namely, that of the negroes. Originally brought as slaves from Soudan and
                    Timbuctoo, they have multiplied greatly, and have even risen to distinguished
                    situations. The sovereigns of Morocco, unable, from the natural jealousy of
                    despotism, to trust their own subjects, have placed their entire confidence in
                    negro troops. These form the standing army of the empire, the body-guard of the
                    sovereign, and the garrison of all the principal fortresses. Their pay is very
                    limited, not exceeding a penny a day; but its smallness is compensated by the
                    license in which they are allowed to indulge. A person well acquainted with
                    Morocco being asked its amount, answered, “Whatever they can rob or steal.”
                    Muley Ishmael maintained nearly 100,000 of these troops. Their fidelity to their
                    monarch is said to be exemplary. Negro slaves still continue to be imported in
                    great numbers, particularly into Morocco.</p>
                <p>The different states, however, have each features peculiar to itself, which will
                    be noticed under their respective heads.</p>
                <p>The political state of this extensive region has suffered no change from the
                    lapse of time, and is that of a savage, uncontrolled, and turbulent despotism.
                    In Turkey and the Asiatic empires, there are public bodies rendered venerable by
                    religion, by law, and even by knowledge, who share and moderate the power of the
                    despot. In Barbary there are none such; the will, or rather momentary caprice,
                    of the sovereign, rules every thing. Yet the throne, though thus absolute, is
                    not thereby rendered secure: resting on no basis, it is overturned by the
                    slightest storm that arises. The death of a sovereign is almost <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193194060" xml:id="kp-eb0704-4060-0365"/>invariably followed by
                    disputed succession and civil war; so that tranquillity, the sole boast of
                    despotism, is not even secured by it to this unfortunate country.</p>
                <p>The religion of Barbary is well known to be throughout Mahommedan, professed with
                    a degree of rigour and intolerance unknown in any other region of the globe.
                    There is not, however, as in Turkey, any great body, like the Ulema, to act as
                    the depositary of its doctrines and influence. This power is here enjoyed by
                    individuals who raise themselves, by personal merit or demerit, to the character
                    of saints. Saints, in Morocco, almost share with the sovereign the power of the
                    empire. Sidi Ali and Sidi Alarbi are the two most eminent reigning saints. Their
                    consideration is chiefly supported by working miracles, and does not require any
                    sacrifice of the pleasures of life. They indulge in all without reserve, and,
                    besides the usual number of wives, keep numerous concubines. The districts in
                    which these saints reside pay no taxes, and are subject to no authority except
                    theirs; and they are perpetually surrounded by a body of armed men, to chastise
                    their own enemies and those of the prophet. At some distance from Tripoli is a
                    fortified village possessed by a saint, called the Lion, serving as an asylum
                    for every species of criminals, even those who are guilty of high treason.
                    Idiots throughout Barbary are generally reputed saints; and some, in order to
                    maintain the reputation of sanctity, find it expedient to counterfeit the total
                    absence of reason.</p>
                <p>The population of Barbary has been very variously reported, and has never been
                    fixed on any precise or authentic <hi rend="italic">data.</hi> We shall collect
                    the different statements made on the subject. Mr Jackson gives that of Morocco
                    at 14,886,600, of whom the cities and towns contain 895,600, the provinces
                    within Atlas 10,341,000, the Berebbers amount to 3,000,000, the Tafilets to
                    650,000. He states these numbers to be founded upon information extracted from
                    the Imperial Register. They are quite improbable, and very far beyond any
                    estimate formed by preceding travellers. Chenier does not conceive that the
                    empire can contain above six millions; and some have even reduced the estimate
                    as low as two. Mr Macgill heard the population of the Tunisian territory
                    generally estimated at five millions, but is inclined to reduce the estimate to
                    half that amount. Of these he supposes that 7000 may be Turks, 100,000 Jews,
                    7000 Christians; the rest Moors, Arabs, and renegadoes. The Algerine territory
                    has been estimated at somewhat more than two millions and a half. Tripoli is
                    reckoned by Ali Bey to contain two millions, which is probably beyond the truth.
                    Of the great cities, Morocco is generally supposed to contain 30,000; Fez, by
                    Jackson 380,000, by Ali Bey only 100,000; Tunis, by Mr Macgill 100,000, by Mr
                    Blaquiere 130,000; Algiers, by Dr Shaw 117,000; Tripoli, by Mr Blaquiere 25,000,
                    by Ali Bey only 15,000.</p>
                <p>With a soil so fertile, and where manufacturing industry is in so low a state,
                    the productions of the earth must form the staple articles of export. Barbary,
                    in ancient, and even in modern times, has been the granary of southern Lurope.
                    More lately, however, this branch of trade has been nearly cut off by a general
                    prohibition, in all the states, against the exportation of corn. The materials
                    for export are thus reduced to fruits, gums, hides, wax, and the produce of the
                    very few manufactures which flourish throughout these states. Of these Morocco
                    leather is the most important. Fez is the place where this manufacture has
                    t&gt;θen brought to the highest perfection; but it is also carried <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 0n</hi> in the other cities of Morocco, as well as those of
                    East- <hi rend="superscript"> ern</hi> Barbary. Fez is also distinguished by the
                    manufacture of woollen haiks, a species of long cloths universally worn by the
                    Moors when they go abroad; of sashes and silk handkerchiefs; and of carpets,
                    which are little inferior to those of Turkey. Tunis is famous for the
                    manufacture of a species of conical woollen caps called scullcaps, universally
                    worn, not only in Barbary, but over the Levant. This fabric formerly employed
                    fifty thousand persons; but the manufacturers of Leghorn and Marseilles now
                    imitate it, and succeed in underselling the Tunisians, though, in the quality of
                    the stuff, the latter remain still unrivalled. Robes and shawls of woollen gauze
                    are also made to a great extent. Concerning the manufactures of Algiers and
                    Tripoli we have few details; but, with the exception of caps, they appear to be
                    nearly similar to those of Tunis.</p>
                <p>The caravan trade with the interior of Africa is chiefly carried on from Morocco
                    and Tripoli. From the former it is very extensive. The caravans carry chiefly
                    salt, tobacco, and European goods; and bring back slaves, ivory, and gold dust.
                    Lempriere estimates the amount of the former at one million, the latter at ten
                    millions; which, if at all correct, would imply that the profits on this trade
                    are immense. The trade from Tripoli has been greatly diminished, in consequence
                    of the pasha having embroiled himself with his Arab neighbours, who, occupying
                    the route by which the caravans must pass, render the communication extremely
                    precarious.</p>
                <p>The European goods for which there exists a demand in the Barbary States are
                    exceedingly various. They <hi rend="superscript"> 7</hi> include more or less of
                    almost every article, both of manufacture and of colonial produce. In the former
                    class are such articles as, being of inferior quality, can be afforded at a
                    cheap rate; Yorkshire cloths, particularly druggets and serges; muslins of the
                    coarsest and cheapest sorts; coarse linens, particularly German. Raw silk and
                    Spanish wool w ere imported to a great extent when their manufactures were more
                    flourishing. French wines are imported into the eastern states, where the
                    precepts of Mahomet are less rigidly observed. The other imports are tin and
                    lead to a considerable extent, English being preferred; coffee, sugar, and the
                    different kinds of spices; hardware, cutlery, toys, in some demand; also alum,
                    vitriol, cochineal, gum-lac, and vermillion, for their manufactures.</p>
                <p>The commerce of Eastern Barbary has hitherto been carried on chiefly from Leghorn
                    and Marseilles. Louis XIV. established at the latter port a Royal African
                    Company, which formed several establishments upon the coast of the Algerine
                    province of Constantina. The objects were the corn trade and the coral fishery,
                    which they shared at first with an English company already established; but the
                    latter failing, the whole trade fell into the hands of the French. Their first
                    establishment was at the <hi rend="italic">Bastion de France.</hi> at the
                    western extremity of Algiers; but this was abancſoned, and they settled at La
                    Cala, Bona, Il Col, and Tabarca. They paid L.4000 a year to the dey of Algiers,
                    and 100 per cent, to the bey of Constantina, on the grain exported; in addition
                    to which they were obliged to submit to various forms of extortion and
                    humiliation. The continental war, and the extinction of the French naval power,
                    threw a large proportion of this trade into the hands of the British; and Malta
                    became the channel through which it was conducted. In 1806 the British
                    government contracted with the dey of Algiers for the possession of La Cala,
                    Bona, and II Col; in consideration of which they stipulated to pay him the sum
                    of 50,000 dollars (L.l 1,000 sterling). Mr Blaquiere, and other persons
                    acquainted with this coast, are of opinion that very important advantages might
                    be derived from this settlement. The coral fishery alone might employ 500 boats
                    and 9000 men; besides which, there is a large export of hides, wax, and wool. It
                    is added, that the <pb break="no" facs="nls:193194073"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0704-4073-0366"/>country produces ship-timber, particularly oak, of
                    the best <hi rend="subscript"> f</hi> quality, and in inexhaustible abundance;
                    and that excellent hemp and flax might be raised. The British government,
                    however, never formed any establishment or derived any benefit from the
                    privilege thus purchased. The coral fishery is carried on by a small number of
                    French and Neapolitan boats; and the spirited attempts made by the merchants at
                    Malta to open a communication with this quarter have been frustrated.</p>
                <p>We shall finally consider these states under the view which has so justly excited
                    the interest and sympathy of the British nation. Piracy, with the main view of
                    capturing Christians as slaves, has for ages formed the main employment of the
                    barbarous states situated along the Mediterranean. To be placed under the
                    absolute control of the most brutal and corrupted of mortals, whom religious
                    antipathy has besides divested of every human sympathy—without any law or
                    earthly power to appeal to—the hopeless victims of brutal cruelty, and still
                    more brutal voluptuousness;—this is’certainly the most dreadful fate to which
                    human beings were ever devoted. Yet such has been the fate of thousands of
                    Europeans, among whom were often those who, from rank, sex, and cultivation of
                    mind, must have been most keenly sensible of its horrors. Painful as the subject
                    is, it seems indispensable to give some details which may illustrate the extent
                    of the evil, and the necessity which existed for some arrangements to remedy
                    it.</p>
                <p>The most particular and authentic account of the treatment of slaves at Algiers
                    is that given in the American work already alluded to. On the 23d October 1792,
                    the ship President saw approaching an armed xebeck, bearing Spanish colours till
                    she came within gun-shot, when she instantly hoisted the bloody flag, and fired.
                    Escape was now impossible; the xebeck instantly put out a boat, with thirty
                    armed men, who rowed furiously towards the vessel, and boarded it with the
                    wildest shouts and outcries. No resistance being made, they began to strip the
                    crew with a fury of avarice of which it was impossible to form an idea.
                    Sometimes several fell upon one American, and fought over him for the clothes of
                    which he was stript. Having ransacked every corner, they then ordered the
                    Americans to descend into the boat; and those who showed any hesitation were
                    instantly knocked down and kicked over into it. On reaching Algiers the
                    distribution took place. The dey first made his choice, which was formerly
                    limited to an eighth of the whole, but at this time extended to as great a
                    number as he chose to demand. For this purpose they were conducted to the
                    palace, and drawn up in files along a court, where they passed under this
                    review. Having made his selection, he dismissed the rest with the compliment,
                    “Go, you Christian dogs, and eat stones.” The youngest were employed in menial
                    offices about the palace, the rest were put to work in the marine and in public
                    buildings. Whenever a foreign vessel was in the port, they were loaded with
                    thirty or forty pounds weight of chains, in order to prevent their escape. Their
                    heaviest labour consisted in dragging immense stones from a neighbouring quarry,
                    for the repair and enlargement of the mole. A body of Turks attended to urge
                    them on, but gave no aid, unless by continually roaring out <hi rend="italic"
                    >Hyomoly,</hi> “heave away,” with a noise so tremendous, that it was heard at
                    the distance of more than a league. At night they were locked up in two huge
                    buildings called bagnios, the lower part of which was employed for shops, and
                    the upper for the joint accommoda tion of the captives and of the wild beasts
                    belonging to the dey. There was no bed in the place, and they were obliged to
                    lie on the floor, till their own ingenuity enabled them to erect some humble
                    substitute. The daily allowance of food was a pound of very bad bread and a
                    small quantity of oil. Many sunk under this accumulation of distress, and were
                    carried to the Spanish hospital, the only relief provided for their miseries.
                    The sympathy of the American people having been at length excited by reports of
                    their sufferings, they opened a negociation, and at the expense of nearly
                    800,000 dollars, procured the release of the captives.</p>
                <p>The observations made by Captain Croker during his visit in 1815 agree with the
                    narrative of the Americans and prove that no improvement had taken place. At the
                    period of his arrival, three hundred Christian captives had been driven in from
                    Bona, exposed to such treatment that fifty died within six days after reaching
                    Algiers. They were still employed in the quarries, and loaded with chains, as
                    before. His description of the house in which they were locked up is, that, “if
                    it had light,” it would resemble those in which the West Indian negroes keep
                    their pigs. When at peace with the great powers, their piracy is chiefly
                    exercised on Naples and Sardinia, with whom they have always taken care to
                    continue at war. European, and even English colours, are assumed to entrap the
                    unfortunate victims. They frequently also make descents on the coast, and sweep
                    away all the inhabitants, without distinction of age or sex. The Tunisians, at
                    the commencement of the reign of the late bey, landed on the island of St
                    Pierre, belonging to Sardinia, and carried off the whole population, amounting
                    to upwards of a thousand. At Tunis and Tripoli the treatment of slaves is not so
                    utterly inhuman as at Algiers. The most dreadful fate is that of those who are
                    judged fit to be received into the haram of the prince, or any of his principal
                    officers; which, in consequence of the depraved propensities here prevalent, is
                    not confined to one sex. Of those who become the slaves of private persons, both
                    at Tunis and Algiers, some are tolerably, and a few very well treated.</p>
                <p>It is not easy to ascertain the precise extent to which this enormous evil
                    existed. Mr Blaquiere, though he represents its horrors in the most glowing
                    colours, considers the whole number of captives as amounting only to a thousand.
                    Mr Macgill calculates two thousand in Tunis alone, and the Americans the same
                    number at Algiers. The first estimate, however, is probably the more correct,
                    as, by a calculation of the amount and rate of ransoms returned, the number in
                    Algiers, at the time of Lord Exmouth’s first expedition, appears to have been
                    four hundred and fifteen.</p>
                <p>For the measures by which, in each of the Barbary states, the system of piracy
                    has been at last suppressed, and for the formation, in the greatest of these
                    states, of a French colony, which promises to effect a remarkable change in the
                    condition of this part of the African continent, the reader is referred to the
