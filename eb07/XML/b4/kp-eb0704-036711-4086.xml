                <p><label type="entry">BARBOUR, <hi rend="smallcaps">John</hi></label>, the
                    contemporary and in some respects the rival of Chaucer, is the author of a poem
                    which may justly be described as a national work: it relates the exploits of a
                    very heroic monarch, whose memory is still cherished by his countrymen, and it
                    displays so conspicuous a union of talent and patriotism, that, after the lapse
                    of nearly five centuries, it has not ceased to attract an uncommon degree of
                    attention. The orthography of this poet’s name is very unsettled; it is to be
                    found under the different forms of Barber, Barbere, Barbar, Barbare, and
                    Barbour. It evidently belongs to that very numerous class of names originally
                    derived from trades or occupations; but as <hi rend="italic">Barbour</hi>
                    appears to have been the ancient orthography of the word denoting this
                    particular trade, there is sufficient propriety in adhering to the form now so
                    generally adopted, and writing the name Barbour instead of Barber. Those authors
                    who aver that he was born at Aberdeen, and educated in the abbey of
                    Aberbrothick, seem to have substituted conjecture for evidence; no document
                    which can enable us to ascertain the place of his birth or education has yet
                    been discovered. His birth has been referred to the year 1316. When he describes
                    the person of Randolph, says Lord Hailes, he seems to speak from personal
                    observation; and as Randolph died in 1331 and Barbour in 1396, the poet, if we
                    suppose him to have reached the age of eighty, would have been fifteen years old
                    at the period of that illustrious warrior’s death.<note anchored="true"

                    calculation, resting on no solid basis; for he neither professes to describe the
                    person of Randolph from actual observation, <pb break="no" facs="nls:193194099"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0704-4099-0368"/>nor is his description so minute and graphic as to
                    justify the inference-that he must have acquired his knowledge in this manner.
                    It has been suggested by Dr Jamieson, that the strongest presumption of his
                    having been born at so early a period, is to be found in the circumstance of his
                    being a dignitary of the church in the year 1357. If we suppose him to have been
                    born in 1316, he may have obtained this preferment about the age of forty; and
                    the same learned writer remarks that it must have required very powerful
                    interest to obtain it at a much earlier period. We are not however sufficiently
                    acquainted with the details of his personal history, to be enabled to estimate
                    the probability of his rapid promotion; but, according to the canon law, he
                    could be regularly appointed an archdeacon at the age of twenty-five.<note

                    be content to leave conjectural dates as we found them, without attempting to
                    decide whether he was born in 1316, 1326, or 1330; but more authentic notices of
                    this venerable archdeacon have fortunately been preserved. On the 13th of August
                    1357, Edward III., on the application of the Scotish king, granted Barbour a
                    safeconduct to visit the university of Oxford, accompanied by three
                    students.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Rymer, <hi

                    they are to repair thither for the purpose of study, and of performing
                    scholastic exercises; and it has been stated by a distinguished ornament of the
                    university that Barbour studied there during the years 1357 and 1365.<note

                    the safeconduct describes him as archdeacon of Aberdeen, we cannot so easily
                    admit that he comes under the common denomination of an academical student, if
                    by this term we understand a person subjected to college discipline, and
                    following a prescribed course of study; nor is it unreasonable to conclude that
                    the scholastic exercises were solely to be performed by the three scholars who
                    accompanied him. That he completed his studies in this celebrated university, is
                    however sufficiently probable, though it must apparently have been at an earlier
                    period of life. We may venture to infer, that on the present occasion he
                    repaired to Oxford, as many individuals still repair to it, for the purpose of
                    conferring with learned clerks, and of consulting books which he had no
                    opportunity of consulting at home; and such a document may therefore be regarded
                    as an honourable testimony of his love of learning. Nor is it the only document
                    of this kind. There is another safeconduct, dated on the 6th of November 1364,
                    and authorizing the archdeacon of Aberdeen to visit England with four horsemen,
                    in order to study at Oxford or elsewhere, as he may judge expedient;<note

                    November 1368, authorizes him to travel through England with two servants and
                    two horses, on his way towards France for the same purpose of study.<note

                    bishop of his diocese had nominated him one of the commissioners who were to

                    passportfor Oxford, it is conjectured that this nomination was only intended as
                    a compliment, and that the actual duty was to devolve on a coadjutor, who is
                    named in the same instrument. On the 16th of October 1365 Edward had granted him
                    permission to travel through England, with six companions on horseback, towards
                    St Denis and other sacred places;<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    that the object of his expedition was of a religious nature. After an interval
                    of several years, his name occurs in another authentic record; namely, in the
                    list of the auditors of exchequer, appointed on the 18th of February 1373, or,
                    according to our present computation, 1374. Here he is described as archdeacon
                    of Aberdeen, and “clericus probacionis domus domini nostri Regis and in the same

                    commemorates; and that a considerable pension was granted to him as an
                    encouragement to prosecute this design.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    years before Barbour had written one half of his poem. The history of his
                    pension was involved in much obscurity, which has at length been removed by the
                    researches of Dr Jamieson. Hume of Godscroft had affirmed that his merit as the
                    author of this poem was rewarded by a pension from the exchequer during his
                    life, that he transferred this pension to the hospital of Aberdeen, and that it
                    still continued to be paid in his own lifetime.<note anchored="true"

                    each other; but the fact of his having received a pension, or rather two
                    different pensions, from the crown, rests on unquestionable authority; and this
                    fact cannot but be regarded as creditable to the government of his country, nor
                    must the extent of such liberality be estimated by so fallacious a standard as
                    the present value of money. At a much later period, Hector Boyce enjoyed a
                    revenue of forty marks, as principal of King’s College, Aberdeen. Barbour’s
                    pensions consisted of ten pounds payable from the customs of Aberdeen, and
                    twenty shillings payable from the rent of the lands and fisheries which that
                    city held of the crown.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    life, but the other was granted to him and his assignees, with an express
                    permission to dispose of it in mortmain; and it appears from the records to have
                    been granted by Robert II. as a reward for the composition of his historical

                    His larger pension seems likewise to have been conferred by the same king; and
                    although this circumstance has not been traced in any record, it was probably
                    conferred for the same reason.</p>
                <p>Although the <hi rend="italic">Pruce</hi> is the only work of Barbour that is
                    known to be extant, it is not the only work of which he was the author. He
                    appears to have written another book, doubtless in rhyme, comprising a
                    genealogical history of the kings of Scotland, and deducing their origin from
                    the Trojan colony of Brutus.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    regarded as a curious relique of the literature of the middle ages. The

                    that the first impression is of a much earlier date. Several other editions

                    request of Simon Lochmalony, vicar of Moonsic; and thus every individual more
                    immediately concerned, the poet, the copyist, and his employer, belonged to the
                    church.</p>
                <p>When we endeavour to appreciate the literary merit of Barbour, we must at the
                    same time endeavour to transport ourselves to the remote and unrefined age in
                    which he lived; we must recollect the general barbarism of many preceding
                    centuries, the difficulty of acquiring liberal knowledge, the rude and grotesque
                    taste of almost all his contemporaries. When all these circumstances are duly
                    considered, his poem will be found entitled to an ample share of our
                    approbation. Fortunate in the choice of a subject, he has unfolded a series of
                    remarkable events, and has diffused over a very long narrative that lively
                    interest which an ordinary writer is incapable of exciting. Here we are not to
                    expect the blandishments of modern poetry: the author stands conspicuous amid
                    the ruins of time, and, like an undecayed Gothic tower, presents an aspect of
                    majestic simplicity. The lively strain of his narrative, the air of sincerity
                    which he always exhibits, his earnest participation in the success or sufferings
                    of his favourite characters, as well as the splendid attributes of the
                    characters themselves, cannot fail of arresting the attention of every reader
                    familiarly acquainted with the language in which he writes. The age of the great
                    King Robert was the age of Scotish chivalry, and the monarch himself presented
                    the most perfect model of a valiant knight. Whatever inconsistencies may have
                    appeared in his early conduct, the best portion of his life was undoubtedly
                    spent in the exercise of heroic valour or of political wisdom. Such a hero and
                    such a crisis were a most fortunate selection; and although the intrinsic merit
                    of the poet is very conspicuous, yet the attraction of the poem is partly to be
                    ascribed to his judicious choice of a subject.</p>
                <p>Barbour was evidently skilled in such branches of knowledge as were then
                    cultivated, and his learning was so well regulated as to conduce to the real
                    improvement of his mind: the liberality of his views, and the humanity of his

                    appear occasionally to have been unconfined by· the narrow boundaries of his own
                    age. He has drawn various illustrations from ancient history and from the
                    stories of romance, but has rarely displayed his erudition by decking his verses
                    with the names of ancient authors: the distichs of Cato,<note anchored="true"

                    which, as Mr Warton remarks, shews that he was more familiarly known from the

                    moral lessons, which are often conveyed with a considerable degree of terseness
                    and compression. ' The author possesses so much purity of diction, that Joseph
                    Scaliger supposes he cannot have flourished subsequently to the reign of
                    Commodus or Severus; and Hen. Cannegieter, who was alike conversant with
                    philology and the civil law, has employed several arguments, drawn from the
                    history of the Roman jurisprudence, to prove that this poet must at least have
                    preceded the reign of Constantine. <hi rend="italic">(Rescripta Boxhornìi de

                    should become troublesome, “si coeperit esse molesta.” (Lib. iii. 13.) But after
                    the law of divorce had been modified by that emperor, it was not competent for a
                    husband to dismiss his. wife, merely because he did not find her agreeable. <hi

                    Dictys Cretensis are the only profane books to which he formally refers. He has
                    borrowed more than one illustration from Statius, who was the favourite classic
                    of those times, and who likewise appears to have been the favourite of Barbour;
                    the more chaste and elegant style of Virgil and Horace was not so well adapted
                    to the prevalent taste, as the strained thoughts and gorgeous diction of Statius
                    and Claudian. The manner in which he has incidentally discussed the subject of
                    astrology and necromancy, may be specified as not a little creditable to his
                    good sense. It is well known that these branches of divination were assiduously
                    cultivated during the ages of intellectual darkness. The absurdity of astrology
                    and necromancy he has not openly attempted to expose; for as the opinions of the
                    many, however unfounded in reason, must not be too rashly stigmatized, this
                    might have been too bold and decided a step. Of the possibility of predicting
                    events he speaks with the caution of a philosopher; but the following passage
                    may be considered as a sufficient indication of his deliberate sentiments:</p>

                </lg>
                <p>To form such an estimate, required a mind capable of resisting a strong torrent
                    of prejudice; nor is it superfluous to remark, that in an age of much higher
                    refinement, Dryden suffered himself to be deluded by the prognostications of
                    judicial astrology.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    109.</p></note> It was not however to be expected that Barbour should on every
                    occasion evince a decided superiority to the general spirit of the age to which
                    lie belonged. His terrible imprecation on the person who betrayed Sir
                    Christopher Seton, “In hell condampnyt mot he be !” ought not to have been
                    uttered by a Christian priest. His detestation of the treacherous and cruel King
                    Edward induced him to lend a credulous ear to the report of his consulting an
                    infernal spirit. The misfortunes which attended Bruce at almost every step of
                    his early progress, he attributes to his sacrilegious act of slaying Comyn at
                    the high altar. He supposes that the women and children who assisted in
                    supplying the brave defenders of Berwick with arrows and stones, were protected
                    from injury by a miraculous interposition. Such instances of superstition or
                    uncharitable zeal are not to be viewed as marking the individual: gross
                    superstition, with its usual concomitants, was the general spirit of the time;
                    and the deviations from the ordinary track are to be traced in examples of
                    liberal feeling or enlightened judgment.</p>
                <p>His encomium on political freedom is distinguished by a manly and dignified
                    strain of sentiment:</p>

                <p>From the satisfaction with which the poet seems to contemplate any example of the
                    gentler virtues, we may venture to draw a favourable inference respecting the
                    native benevolence of his disposition. The subsequent passage cannot be passed
                    without particular notice: the annals of heroes furnish but few instances of so
                    pleasing a nature, whether it be that heroes seldom stoop to actions of mere

                <p>Barbour seems to have been acquainted with those nicer springs of human action
                    which elude vulgar observation; he catches the shades of character with a
                    delicate eye, and sometimes presents us with instances of nice discrimination.
                    His work is not a mere narrative of events; it contains specimens of that minute
                    and distinct delineation which marks the hand of a skilful artist. An
                    illustration of this remark may perhaps be found in the following incident. When
                    Bruce has with his single arm defended a narrow pass against a party of two
                    hundred Gallovidians, his soldiers are represented as flocking around him with
                    the same eager curiosity as if they had never had another opportunity of seeing
                    him.</p>

                <p>In the opinion of an exquisite critic, Barbour has adorned the English language
                    by a strain of versification, expression, and poetical imagery, far superior to
                    the age.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Warton’s <hi

                    Nott remarks that he “had given his countrymen a fine example of the simple
                    energetic style, which resembled Chaucer’s best manner, and wanted little to
                    make it the genuine language of poetry.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    versification, will be to compare it with that of some English poet who
                    flourished about the same period; and, if placed in competition with the
                    versification of Chaucer, Gower, or Lydgate, the most celebrated English poets
                    of that era, it must certainly be admitted to appear with sufficient advantage.
                    Although a general conclusion cannot safely be drawn from a particular instance,
                    it may yet be worth while to compare the following quotations from Chaucer and
                    Barbour:</p>

                <p>Here the versification of Barbour is certainly not inferior o that of Chaucer;
                    but we have no intention to aver that the general merit of the two poets is
                    equal. Chaucer has attempted a great variety of subjects, and, for the most
                    part, with eminent success. His measures are also varied; , and, if we compare
                    his versification with that of preceding poets, or indeed with that of his
                    immediate successors, it will be found entitled to high commendation. He
                    reformed the taste and improved the language of his native country. The merit of
                    Barbour, though more circumscribed, is yet so eminent as to entitle him to a
                    very honourable place in the history of British poetry.</p>
                <p>The style of this poet is distinguished by its terseness, and he often exhibits a
                    happy brevity of expression. His work contains a greater proportion of French
                    idioms than we discover in the writings of the preceding Scotish poets, though
                    their positive number is far from being considerable. Fiction is not inseparably
                    connected with verse. The historical merit of Barbour’s poem has been admitted
                    by very competent judges; and, among others, Lord Hailes has repeatedly
                    acknowledged the general fidelity of his narrative. King Robert died in 1329;
                    and, as Barbour was employed in writing his poem within forty-six years from
                    that period, he must have enjoyed many opportunities of collecting information.
                    He might himself have conversed with warriors who fought at Bannockburn; and on
                    one occasion he quotes the authority of a valiant knight, Sir Allan Catheart,
                    who was personally engaged in a particular exploit which he is about to
                    relate.</p>

                <p>Of the general merit of Barbour’s work, so favourable an estimate has been formed
                    by Mr Pinkerton, that it may not be improper here to produce his testimony.
                    “Perhaps the editor may be accused of nationality, when he says, that, taking
                    the total merits of this work together, he prefers it to the early exertions of
                    even the Italian muse, to the melancholy sublimity of Dante, and the amorous
                    quaintness of Petrarca, as much as M. Le Grand does <hi rend="italic">a
                    fabliau</hi> to a Provencal ditty. Here indeed the reader will find few of the
                    graces of fine poetry, little of the Attic dress of the muse; but here are life,
                    and spirit, and ease, and plain sense, and pictures of real manners, and
                    perpetual incident, and entertainment. The language is remarkably good for the
                    time, and far superior in neatness and elegance even to that of Gawin Douglas,
                    who wrote more than a century after. But when we consider that our author is not
                    only the first poet, but the earliest historian of Scotland, who has entered
                    into any detail, and from whom any view of the real state and manners of the
                    country can be had; and that the hero whose life he paints so minutely, was a
                    monarch equal to the greatest of modern times; let the historical and poetical
                    merits of his work be weighed together, and then opposed to those of any other
                    early poet of the present nations in Europe.”<note anchored="true"
