                <p><label type="entry">BLOCK-MACHINERY</label>. To acquire a greater degree of
                    accuracy and uniformity, as well as celerity, in the making of blocks, Mr Walter
                    Taylor of Southampton took out a patent in the year 1781, to secure to himself
                    the benefit of some improvement he had made in the construction of the sheaves;
                    he also shaped the shells, cut the timber, &amp;c. by machinery, which was put
                    in motion by water on the river Itchin, near Southampton, where he carried on so
                    extensive a manufactory of blocks, as to be able to contract with the
                    commissioners of the navy for nearly the whole supply of blocks and blockmakers’
                    wares required for the use of the royal navy.</p>
                <p>Mr Dunsterville of Plymouth had also a set of machines for making the principal
                    parts of blocks, which was wrought by horses; his manufacture, however, of this
                    article was not carried to any great extent; but the blocks made by this
                    machinery, as well as those by Mr Taylor’s, were said to be of a superior
                    quality to those constructed by the hand, though still deficient in many
                    respects.</p>
                <p>No objection, however, would probably have been made to the quality of the blocks
                    furnished by Mr Taylor, and used in the navy. It would rather appear that the
                    enormous quantity consumed in the course of a long protracted war first called
                    the attention of the admiralty or navy board to the possibility of some
                    reduction being made in the expense of so indispensable and important an article
                    in the naval service; and that it was not prudent to depend entirely on a single
                    contractor, whom accident or misfortune might disable from fulfilling his
                    contract. A fire might destroy his wood-mills, in which case it would have been
                    difficult to procure, in all England, an adequate supply of blocks for the
                    navy.</p>
                <p>On these considerations, it seems to have been the intention of government to
                    introduce, among other improvements then carrying on in Portsmouth dock-yard, a
                    set of machines for making blocks, at the new wood-mills erected in that yard in
                    1801. About this time the improvements which had been introduced into private
                    concerns were gradually finding their way into the great public establishments
                    of the country. Still, however, an old maxim seemed to prevail, that government
                    ought not to be its own manufacturer. This maxim, though perhaps generally just
                    in political economy, is, we conceive, neither just nor wise when applied to
                    those articles which are of the first necessity in the king’s navy. Indeed,
                    where the safety of so many thousand lives depends wholly, as is sometimes the
                    case, on the strength of materials and goodness of workmanship, it is most
                    desirable that the whole ship, and every part of it, from the pin of a sheave to
                    the sheet anchor, should be manufactured under the immediate superintendence of
                    respectable officers in the king’s service.</p>
                <p>About this time, too, Mr Brunell, an ingenious mechanist from America, had
                    completed a working model of certain machines for constructing, by an improved
                    method the shells and sheaves of blocks. This model was submitted to the
                    inspection of the lords commissioners of the admiralty, and by them referred to
                    General Bentham the inspector-general of naval works, who represented that, as
                    the making of blocks was one of the purposes for which a part of the force of
                    the steam-engine erecting at the wood-mills was intended to be applied, he did
                    not hesitate to recommend the new machine, as an invention which would enable
                    the government to construct its own blocks with a greater degree of celerity and
                    exactness than those which were then in use; and that it appeared to be well
                    suited for manufacturing blocks of every description and size, with a degree of
                    accuracy, uniformity, and cheapness, far beyond any of the metìiods hitherto
                    practised. The adoption of Mr Brunell’s machinery was the consequence of this
                    opinion.</p>
                <p>The advantages to be expected from blocks so made were stated by Mr Brunell to
                    consist,—first, in bringing the shape of the outside of the shell to certain
                    determined dimensions, so that those of the same size should actually be so, and
                    not differ from one another, either in the proportion of the mortises, or in the
                    shape and dimensions of the outside; secondly, in adding strength where it was
                    wanted, by making the head and bottom more substantial, and less liable to
                    split; and, thirdly, in leaving the wood between the two mortises thicker, so as
                    to admit a sufficient bearing for the pins,—all of which would be accomplished
                    without requiring any dexterity on the part of the workmen, but entirely by the
                    operation of the machinery. The uniformity and exactness with which they were to
                    be made would be attended with another important advantage to the public; the
                    difficulty of counterfeiting them would act as a precaution against
                    embezzlement. Another very considerable advantage would be derived from the
                    employment of much waste wood in the dock-yard, usually sold for little or
                    nothing, for firewood and other purposes.</p>
                <p>The sheaves or shivers would, by this new machinery, be made so mathematically
                    true, and so exact to each other in their thickness and diameters, that every
                    sheave of any particular size would equally fit any shell of the size for which
                    it was intended; and the inconvenience to which ordinary blocks are liable from
                    the friction of the ropes against one or alternately both of the sides of the
                    mortises, was intended to be removed by placing a sheet of metal on the upper
                    part of the mortise, bent to the proper shape by an engine adapted for the
                    purpose. Brunell also proposed a new form for the <hi rend="italic"
                    >clue-line</hi> and <hi rend="italic">clue-gαrrxi</hi> blocks, so as to secure
                    the sails from splitting, by preventing the points of the sails getting into the
                    blocks; which has since been adopted and greatly approved of in tlae navy.</p>
                <p>In the sheaves, instead of the double coak or cogue inserted in two halves, he
                    substituted a mixed metal coak of a new and particular form, which will be
                    described hereafter, of increased strength and durability. This coak was to be
                    cast with precision in moulds, and fitted by an engine with the greatest nicety;
                    and the pins or axes of the sheaves were to be of wrought iron, case-hardened
                    and coated with tin, which would preserve the iron from rust in the parts which
                    are not kept free from it by friction; as it has been found by experience that,
                    however tight the pin be forced into the shells, the water will insinuate itself
                    and corrode the pin; and when this is the case, the rust soon extends itself to
                    the parts on which the sheave turns, and renders it unfit for use.</p>
                <p>From the machines that were already completed for manufacturing blocks of certain
                    dimensions, Mr Brünell <pb break="no" facs="nls:193198480"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0704-8480-0705"/>was enabled tô make a calculation of the saving as
                    to the first cost, compared with the contract prices, which would be effected by
                    the adoption of his invention. It was as under:</p>

                <p>These savings, if realized to the full extent, were probably not more important
                    than the increased strength, durability, and facility of working, which have
                    been gained by the adoption of the block-machinery.</p>
                <p>Those parts of the machinery which Brunell had completed in London under his
                    patent were transferred to Portsmouth, and, in the course of the year 1804, were
                    in operation; but the increased number of machines, the improvements that
                    suggested themselves to the ingenious inventor, the application of .other
                    machines for making dead-eyes, trucks, and all manner of block-maker’s wares,
                    besides circular and upright saws, lathes, engines for turning pins, rivetting,
                    polishing, &amp;c. exercised his skill and ingenuity till the year 1808, when he
                    considered the whole system to be complete in every part, and incapable, as far
                    as he could judge, of further improvement. From that time to the present, the
                    block-machinery has been in full and constant employment, without requiring the
                    least alteration, and very little repair, beyond the unavoidable wear and tear
                    of engines that are kept in almost constant motion; and, which is still more
                    extraordinary, without requiring the aid of the inventor, though attended only
                    by a few common workmen or labourers; but they are . superintended by Mr Burr,
                    the master of the wood-mills, who is considered as an able and ingenious
                    machinist. The quantity of blocks of every description, manufactured by the
                    machinery in Portsmouth wood-mills, is more than sufficient for the consumption
                    of the whole navy and the board of ordnance, and if pushed to the utmost extent
                    of the works, would also have been sufficient to supply the greater part of the
                    shipping employed in the transport service.</p>
                <p>It may be a matter of some curiosity to know the results of this system of
                    machinery. It is put in motion by a steam-engine of thirty-two horses’ power,
                    which, however, is applied to a great variety of other purposes at the same
                    time, wholly independent of the block-machinery. It has been found by
                    calculation, that four men with the machinery, as it now stands, can complete
                    the shells of as many blocks as fifty men could do by the old method; and that
                    six men will furnish as many sheaves as before required sixty; and that these
                    ten men, in displacing the labour of one hundred and ten men, can with ease
                    finish in one year from 130,000 to 140,000 blocks of different sorts and sizes,
                    the total value of which cannot be less than L.50,000; and this is stated to be
                    the average number which has annually been made from the year 1808 to the
                    conclusion of the war. This number is found to be fully sufficient for supplying
                    the wear and tear of blocks, not only in the naval, but also in the ordnance
                    department. The consumption, however, must depend on other circumstances besides
                    the number of ships in commission, and will be greater or less according as
                    ships have been employed on severe or easy service, in a good or bad climate, in
                    fine or rough weather, &amp;c. Nor will the number here stated appear to be
                    enormous, when it is considered what a multitude of blocks are required for a
                    thousand sail of ships, which at one period of the war were in commission at the
                    same time. A ship of 74 guns, for instance, requires the following blocks for
                    her equipment:</p>

                <p>The average number of ships of the line in commission appears to have been about
                    100; these would require 143,000 blocks; and allowing the remaining 900 ships
                    and vessels to require only twice this number, there would be wanted for the
                    first equipment of the 1000 ships of war 429,000 blocks, which, at the ordinary
                    rate of making them at the mills, would require three years in completing.</p>
                <p>The different sorts and sizes of blocks used in the navy exceed two hundred, and
                    they vary from four to twenty-eight inches in length. Those above eighteen
                    inches are more sparingly used, and the shells of the largest kinds are made in
                    parts, and fitted together by hand.</p>
                <p>To the completion of this ingenious machinery, Brunell gave his whole attention
                    from the month of September 1802 to June 1808, during which time he received no
                    other compensation beyond the daily allowance of one guinea; but as it was now
                    in full operation, and ascertained to be capable of making a sufficient number
                    of blocks for the whole naval and ordnance departments, it became a question in
                    what manner the author of the invention should be rewarded. It was suggested by
                    General Bentham, and agreed to by Brunell, that the savings of one year, as
                    compared with the contract prices, would be a fair and not an unreasonable
                    remuneration for the time, labour, and ingenuity bestowed on these extraordinary
                    machines. It was no easy matter, however, to ascertain with precision what the
                    actual savings amounted to.</p>

                <p>Supposing, therefore, the whole coast of the buildings, steam-engine, machinery,
                    interest of money, &amp;c. to amount (which we understand to be about the mark)
                    to L.53,000, and the net compensation for profits to about L. 18,000, the whole
                    expense of the concern was completely cleared in four years. The savings of
                    L.18,000 on one year’s manufactured articles of the value of L.50,000 amounts to
                    something more than Brunell had originally made it by computation.</p>
                <p>It would occupy too much space to enter into a minute description, and require
                    more time than we can spare to prepare engravings in detail, of the various
                    complicated systems of machinery that are employed for the completion of a
                    block; and, after all, they would afford but little use or instruction,
                    excepting perhaps to a professed machinist; and perspective views of the several
                    systems would tend rather to mislead or confuse than to inform the <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193198493" xml:id="kp-eb0704-8493-0706"/> general reader.
                    But as everybody who happens to inspect Portsmouth dock-yard makes a point of
                    visiting the block-machinery, we think it may be of some use, in conveying a
                    general idea of the most striking parts of the machinery, by following the
                    process of making a block from the rough unsided tree, till the last finish is
                    given to it.</p>
                <p>We have stated that the original intention of the building was that of a
                    wood-mill, in which all manner of sawing, turning, boring, rabbetting, and the
                    like, was to be performed, and that the block-machinery was superadded to the
                    first design, with which, however, it has interfered so little, that, in
                    addition to the immense number of blocks manufactured at the mill, upwards of a
                    hundred different articles of wood-work are made by other machinery, put in
                    motion by the same steam-engine, from the boring of a pump of forty feet in
                    length, to the turning of a button for the knob or handle of a drawer. (See <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Dock-yard, Portsmouth.)</hi> Lest, however, the engine, with
                    such a variety of work, might be overloaded, a second engine has been added, to
                    assist, if found necessary, or to be substituted in the event of accident
                    happening to the other. Among the many ingenious machines belonging to the
                    wood-mills, exclusive of those for making blocks, one of very great effect, and
                    at the same time great simplicity, is a circular saw for cutting rabbets in the
                    edges of deal planks, invented by Mr Burr, the superintending master of the
                    wood-mills.</p>
                <p>The whole of the machinery in these mills is put in motion by straps passing over
                    drum-heads, by which the several movements, numerous as they are, are carried on
                    without the least noise; and all the engine-work, and every part of the
                    machinery, are so truly made, and so firmly put together, and work with such
                    accuracy in all their motions, that though the spectator is surrounded on all
                    sides with movements in every possible direction, and some most rapid and
                    violent, the only noise that disturbs him arises from the cutting, boring,
                    turning, polishing, and other instruments which are actually in contact with the
                    work that is under execution, and none of it from the working of the machinery.
                    All the iron work, of which it is chiefly composed, was made by Mawdsley; and
                    there is but another workman, perhaps, in the united kingdom, who could have
                    finished the engines in a manner so worthy of the invention.</p>
                <p>The first wing of the building is chiefly occupied by upright and circular saws,
                    used for a variety of purposes not immediately connected with the making of
                    blocks. The only operation for this department is that of converting the rough
                    timber, which is generally elm or ash, most commonly the former, into its proper
                    scantling; that is to say, squaring it by the upright or straight-cutting saw,
                    and then, by a circular saw, cross-cutting it into a certain number of
                    parallelopipedons, whose lengths may bear the required proportion to the
                    thickness of the log. Some of these pieces are again cut longitudinally,
                    according to the thickness that may be required for the shell of the block,
                    especially those for single and double blocks, which of course are thinner than
                    three and four-fold blocks. This operation is performed by what is called a
                    ripping-saw. The logs thus cut out are then taken into the second wing of the
                    wood-mills, where the machinery peculiar for the construction of blocks is
                    erected ;' and here the first process may be said to commence in making the <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Shell.</hi></p>
                <p>This operation is performed by the <hi rend="italic">Boring Machine,</hi> which,
                    by means of a centre bit applied to the middle of the shell, bores a hole for
                    the centre pin of the sheave, while another bores one, two, or three holes, at
                    right angles to the direction of the first, to admit the first stroke of the
                    chisel, and, “at the same time, to serve for the head of the mortise or
                    mortises, according as the intended block is to contain one, two, or three
                    sheaves. When thus bored, the log is carried from hence to the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Mortising Machine,</hi> which is an ingenious and striking piece of mechanism.
                    The block being firmly fixed on a movable carriage, the latter is so contrived
                    as to be made to advance to the cutting chisels, which are set fast in a movable
                    frame. Every time the frame with the chisels ascends, the block in its carriage
                    advances a little, so as to present to the chisels a fresh surface of wood to be
                    acted upon at each stroke of their descent; and this up and down motion is
                    continued with such rapidity, that the chisels make from one hundred to one
                    hundred and thirty strokes in a minute, until the prescribed length has been
                    mortised out; when, by raising a handle, which is done by a boy, the machine is
                    stopped precisely when the chisels stand at their greatest elevation; and are
                    thus left in the proper position, ready to commence a second operation. No harm,
                    however, would happen, either to the block or the machinery, should the
                    attending boy neglect to stop the work at the proper time, or even to fall
                    asleep, notwithstanding the force and rapidity of the stroke; for, by a
                    particular contrivance, the farther advance of the block is stopped, and the
                    chisels, therefore, act in full space, and cut only the air. It is, indeed, a
                    general characteristic of Brunell’s machinery, to be so constructed as to carry
                    with it a defence or protection against its own operations, and to counteract
                    all ill effects that might otherwise arise from any neglect or inattention of
                    the workmen.</p>
                <p>The chips cut by the chisels are thrust out of the mortise by small pieces of
                    steel attached to and projecting from the back of each chisel. They are each of
                    them, besides, armed with two cutters placed at right angles to the edge, called
                    <hi rend="italic">scribers,</hi> which mark out the width of the chip to be cut
                    by the chisel at each stroke. These scribers answer another purpose; their
                    cutting is so true as to leave the two sides of the mortise so perfectly smooth
                    as to require no further trimming or polishing.</p>
                <p>The next process is to remove the block from the mortising machine to a circular
                    saw, in order to have the four corners taken off, by which operation it is
                    reduced to an octagonal shape. This saw being fixed into a table or bench, the
                    workman has nothing more to do than to slide each log along the surface of the
                    table, in the direction of the line marked out for the saw to cut it.</p>
                <p>The next operation is to place the block upon the <hi rend="italic">Shaping
                    Machine.</hi> This is perhaps one of the most ingenious and most effective
                    contrivances in the whole machinery of the wood-mills. It consists principally
                    of two equal and parallel circular wheels moving on the same axis, to which one
                    of them is firmly fixed, but on which the other is made to slide; so that these
                    two wheels may be placed at any given distance from each other, and blocks of
                    any size admitted between their two rims or peripheries. For this purpose, both
                    rims are divided into ten equal parts, for the reception of ten blocks, which
                    are firmly and immovably fixed between the two wheels. When the double wheel
                    with its ten attached blocks is put in motion, the outer surfaces of the blocks,
                    or those which are farthest from the centre, strike with great violence against
                    the edge of a chisel or gouge fixed in a movable frame, which, being made to
                    slide in a curved direction in the line of the axis, cuts those outward faces of
                    the blocks to their proper curvature, which can be altered in any way the
                    workman pleases, by a contrivance attached to the cutting tool. As soon as the
                    tool has traversed the whole length of the block, or over the space contained
                    between the two peripheries of the wheels, the machine is thrown out of the
                    gear, and its prodigious velocity checked by a particular contrivance. The tea
                    <pb break="no" facs="nls:193198506" xml:id="kp-eb0704-8506-0707"/> blocks are
                    then, by a single operation, and without re- ’· moving them, each turned one
                    fourth part round, and another fourth part of their surface brought outwards,
                    which, being exposed to the cutting instrument traversing in the same direction
                    as before, have the same curvature given to these new surfaces. A third side is
                    then turned outwards, and, after that, the fourth and last side, when the whole
                    ten blocks are completely shaped, and ten other octagonal logs applied to the
                    peripheries to undergo the same operation.</p>
                <p>The immense velocity with which the wheels revolve, and the great weight with
                    which their peripheries are loaded, would make it dangerous to the workmen or
                    byestanders, if, by the violence of the centrifugal force, any of the blocks
                    should happen to be thrown off from the rim of the wheels; to prevent the
                    possibility of such an accident, an iron cage or guard is placed between the
                    workman and the machine.</p>
                <p>The shell of the block being now mortised and completely shapen, the last
                    operation is performed by the <hi rend="italic">Scoring Machine,</hi> which, by
                    means of cutters, scoops out a groove round the longer diameter of the block,
                    deepest at the ends, and vanishing to the central hole for the pin on which the
                    sheave turns. The intention of this groove or channel is to receive the hempen
                    or iron strap Which surrounds the block. The only thing that now remains for
                    completing the shell, is the removal of the little roughnesses from the surface,
                    and giving to it a kind of polish, which is done by the hand.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="smallcaps">Sheaves.</hi> The wood generally used for making sheaves
                    is lignumvitae, but iron or bell-metal have occasionally been substituted for
                    this wood. An attempt was made to introduce sheaves of a kind of porcelain,
                    which answered well enough for some particular purposes, but were not to be
                    trusted in situations where they were liable to sudden jerks and irregular
                    motions. In the navy they are almost invariably of lignumvitae, a few perhaps of
                    ebony. The machinery employed for making this part of the block consists of a
                    <hi rend="italic">Circular Saiv,</hi> by which the log is cut into plates of the
                    thickness required for the sheaves, according to their several diameters. These
                    plates are next carried to a <hi rend="italic">Crown Saw,</hi> which bores the
                    central hole, and at the same time reduces them to a perfect circle of the
                    assigned diameter. The sheave, thus shaped, is next brought to the <hi
                    rend="italic">Coaking Machine,</hi> a piece of mechanism not inferior in
                    ingenuity to the <hi rend="italic">Shaping Machine</hi> for the shells. It would
                    be useless to attempt to describe by words the movements of this engine, but the
                    effect of the operation is singularly curious. A small cutter, in traversing
                    round the central hole of the sheave, forms a groove for the insertion of the
                    coak or bush, the shape of which is that of three semicircles, not concentric
                    with each other, nor with the sheave, but each having a centre equally distant
                    from that of the sheave. The manner in which the cutter traverses from the first
                    to the second, and from this to the third semicircle, after finishing each of
                    them, is exceedingly curious, and never fails to attract the particular notice
                    of visitors. So very exact and accurate is this groove cut for the reception of
                    the metal coak, and so uniform in their shape and size are the latter cast, in
                    moulds, that they are invariably found to fit each other so nicely and without
                    preparation, that the tap of a hammer is sufficient to fix the coak in its
                    place. The coaks are cast with small grooves or channels in the inside of their
                    tubes, which serve to retain the oil or grease, without which it would soon ooze
                    out, and the pin become dry.</p>
                <p>The sheave, with its coak thus fitted in, is now taken to the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Drilling Machine,</hi> which is kept in constant motion. In casting the coaks a
                    mark is left in the centre of each of the three semicircles. This mark is
                    applied by a boy to the point of the moving drill, which speedily goes through
                    the two coaks and the intermediate wood of the sheave. A copper pin, cut from
                    wire, of the proper length and thickness, is inserted into the holes thus
                    drilled. And the sheave is then taken to the <hi rend="italic">Eivetting
                    Hammer,</hi> which is something like a small tilt hammer, and can easily be made
                    to strike on the pin with greater or less velocity, according as the workman
                    presses with more or less force on the treadle. The rivetting being performed,
                    the next operation is that of broaching the central hole on which the sheave
                    turns, by means of a steel drill or cutter.</p>
                <p>The last process is that of turning a groove for the rope to run in round the
                    periphery of the sheave, and this operation is performed by a lathe, which is so
                    constructed, that while this groove is cutting round the rim of the sheave,
                    another part of the engine is turning smooth the two surfaces or faces of the
                    sheave; and this lathe can be made to adapt itself to sheaves of different
                    diameters.</p>
                <p>The shell and the sheave being now completed, there remains only the iron pin,
                    which, passing through the two sides of the former, serves as the axis on which
                    the latter turns within the mortise. These pins are also made, turned, and
                    polished by engines for the purpose, so that, with the exception of strapping by
                    rope or iron, the whole block is completed at the wood-mills. It may here be
                    remarked, that the French, in the dock-yard of Brest, have long been in the
                    practice of making blocks by machinery, but they have not attempted anything
                    like a shaping machine, nor any substitute for it, the external shape of the
                    shell being made entirely by hand; nor have they such a coaking machine as that
                    invented by Brunell. The machinery at Brest is put in motion by horses. (See <hi
