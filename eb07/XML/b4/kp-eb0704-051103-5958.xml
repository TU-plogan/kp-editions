                <p><label type="entry">BED</label>, a convenience to stretch and compose the body
                    upon for ease, rest, or sleep, consisting generally of feathers, down, or other
                    soft material, enclosed in a ticken case. In the first ages it was universally
                    the practice for mankind to sleep upon skins of beasts. This was originally the
                    custom of the Greeks and Romans, as also of the ancient Britons previous to the
                    Roman invasion; and the skins thus employed were spread on the floor of their
                    apartments. But they were afterwards changed for loose rushes and heath; and in
                    process of time the Romans suggested to the central Britons the use, and the
                    introduction of agriculture supplied them with the means, of the greater
                    conveniency of straw beds. The beds of the Roman gentry at this period were
                    generally filled with feathers, and those of the inns with the soft down of
                    reeds. But for many ages the beds of the Italians had been constantly composed
                    of straw; it still formed those of the officers and soldiers present at the
                    conquest of Lancashire; and from both, it is probable, our countrymen learnt the
                    use of it. It appears, however, to have been used only by gentlemen, as the
                    common Welsh had their beds thinly stuffed with rushes as late as the end of the
                    twelfth century; and with the gentlemen it continued for many ages afterwards.
                    Straw was used in the royal chambers of England as late as the close of the
                    thirteenth century. Most of the peasants in different parts of the country sleep
                    on chaff beds at present; in the Highlands heath is also very generally employed
                    as bedding; and in France and Italy straw beds remain in general use to this
                    day.</p>

                    the ancients reclined at meals. The dining or dis-cubitory beds were four or
                    five feet in height. Three of these beds were ordinarily ranged by a square
                    table, (whence both the table and the apartment where it stood were called <hi
                    rend="italic">triclinium),</hi> in such a manner that one of the sides of the
                    table remained open and accessible to the waiters. Each bed was fitted to
                    receive three or four, rarely five persons. These beds were unknown before the
                    second Punic war; for the Romans till then had sat down to eat on plain wooden
                    benches, in imitation of the heroes of Homer, or, according to Varro, after the
                    manner of the Lacedaemonians and Cretans. But Scipio Africanus first introduced
                    a new mode, having brought from Carthage some of the little beds called <hi
                    rend="italic">punicani</hi> or <hi rend="italic">archaici,</hi> which were
                    constructed of a wood common enough, very low, stuffed only with straw or hay,
                    and covered with goats’ or sheeps’ skins, <hi rend="italic">haedinis pellibus
                    strati.</hi> In point of luxury, there was really no great difference between
                    these new beds and the ancient benches; but the custom of frequent bathing,
                    which already began to be general, by softening and relaxing the body, put men
                    on trying to rest themselves more commodiously than by sitting down in an
                    upright posture. As to the ladies, it did not seem consistent with modesty for
                    them to adopt the recumbent posture, and, accordingly, they kept to the old
                    custom during the continuance of the commonwealth, and only began to use <hi
                    rend="italic">triclinia</hi> in the times of the first Caesars. The youth,
                    again, who had not yet put on the <hi rend="italic">toga virilis,</hi> were long
                    kept to the ancient discipline, and, when admitted to table, only sat on the
                    edge of the beds of their nearest relations. Never, says Suetonius, did the
                    young Caesars, Caius and Lucius, eat at the table of Augustus; they were set <hi
                    rend="italic">in ∙ imo loco,</hi> or, as Tacitus expresses it, <hi rend="italic"
                    >ad lecti fulcra.</hi> But, from the greatest simplicity, the Romans by degrees
                    carried their dining beds to the most surprising magnificence. Pliny assures us
                    it was no uncommon thing to see them covered over with plates of silver, and
                    adorned with the softest mats and richest counterpanes. Lampridius, speaking of
                    Heliogabalus, says, he had beds of solid silver, <hi rend="italic">solido
                    argento habuit lectos et tricliniares, et cubiculares.</hi> We may add, that
                    Pompey, in his third triumph, brought in beds of gold. The Romans had also beds
                    on which they studied, and beds on which the dead were carried to the funeral
                    pile.</p>

                    France, under the old regime, a throne upon which the king sat when he went to
                    the parliament. The king never held a bed of justice unless for affairs that
                    concerned the state, and then all the officers of parliament were clothed in
                    scarlet robes.</p>

                    situation, though apparently a menial one, is eagerly Sought after, even by the
                    high nobility, from the access which it gives to the person of the
