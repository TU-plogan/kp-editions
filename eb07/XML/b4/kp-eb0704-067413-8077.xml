                    significant corrections to the OCR text, predominantly in cases of confusing "c"
                    and "e." Isolates 90 entries that were mistakenly included at the end of prior
                    entries in v1 and v2. Normalizes ordinal numbers. Separates metadata in
                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra
                    space around the <gi>pb</gi> tag. Where a word is hyphenated at a <gi>pb</gi>,
                    the end fragment is now joined to the start fragment, making a machine-readable
                    word.</change>

                    the writers of the middle ages, it is used to denote simply blaming or
                    condemning any person or thing. But among the Greeks, to blaspheme was to use
                    words of evil omen, or portending something ill, which the ancients were careful
                    to avoid; substituting instead of them other words of softer and gentler import,
                    sometimes the very reverse of the proper ones.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Blasphemy</hi> is more peculiarly restricted to evil or
                    reproachful words spoken of the Deity. Hence Augustin says, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Jam vulgo blasphernia non accipitur nisi mala verba de Deo dicere.</hi>
                    According to Lindwood, blasphemy is an injury offered to God, by denying that
                    which is due and belongs to him, or by attributing to him what is not agreeable
                    to his nature. According to the Mosaic law, blasphemy was punished with death;
                    and the same punishment was also awarded by the civil law. By the canon law,
                    blasphemy was only visited by a solemn penance; and introduced the commutation
                    of corporal punishment into a pecuniary fine. According to the English laws,
                    blaspheming God, as denying his being or providence, and all contumelious
                    reproaches of Jesus Christ, are offences at common law, and punishable by fine,
                    imprisonment, and the pillory. And, by the statute law, he who denies one of the
                    persons in the Trinity, or asserts that there are more than one God, or denies
                    Christianity to be true, is for the first offence rendered incapable of any
                    office, and for the second adjudged incapable of suing, being executor or
                    guardian, receiving any gift or legacy, and ordered to be imprisoned for three
                    years.</p>
                <p>By the law of Scotland, as it originally stood, the punishment of blasphemy was
                    death. The first species of blasphemy consists in railing at or cursing God; and
                    here the single act constitutes the crime. The second consists in denying the
                    existence of the Supreme Being, or any of the persons of the Trinity, and in
                    obstinately persevering in this denial to the last. For reiterated denial does
                    not fully constitute the crime, because the statute of Charles II. 1661 admits
                    of repentance before conviction as a complete expiation. And this statute of
                    1661 is ratified by an act of King William, by which the calling in question the
                    existence of God, or of any of the persons of the Trinity, or the authority of
                    the Scripture, or the Divine Providence, is made penal; the punishment for the
                    first offence being imprisonment till satisfaction be given by public repentance
                    in sackcloth, and for the second a fine of a year’s valued rent of the real
                    estate of the culprit, and the twentieth part of his personal estate; and the
                    trial in both these cases being competent to inferior judges. The punishment of
                    the third offence is death, and hence it can only be tried by the court of
                    justiciary.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic smallcaps"> Blasphemy</hi><hi rend="italic">against the Holy
                    Ghost.</hi> Divines are not agreed with respect to the nature of the crime thus
                    denominated, and the grounds of the extreme guilt ascribed to it. Dr Tillotson
                    maintains that it consists in maliciously attributing to the devil the
                    miraculous operations which Christ performed by the power of the Holy Ghost. But
                    Dr. Whitby refers it to the dispensation of the Holy Ghost, which commenced
                    after our Lord’s resurrection and ascension; and contends that those were guilty
                    of the crime who persisted in their unbelief, and blasphemed the Holy Ghost,
                    representing him as an evil spirit. The crime was unpardonable, because it
                    implied a wilful opposition to the last and most powerful evidence which God had
                    vouchsafed to mankind, and precluded the possibility of a return to faith and
                    repentance.</p>
