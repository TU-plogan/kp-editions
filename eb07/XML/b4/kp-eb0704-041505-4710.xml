                <p><label type="entry">BARTHELEMY, <hi rend="smallcaps">John James</hi></label>, a
                    celebrated literary character, born at Cassis, a little sea-port on the shores
                    of the Mediterranean, in January 1716. At twelve years of age he was sent to
                    school at Marseilles. Being admitted into the college of the oratory, he was put
                    under the care of Father Renaud, a person of taste and wit, w ho soon discovered
                    similar qualities in his pupil, and became uncommonly attentive to his progress.
                    Μ. de Visclède, a man of letters, and friend to the former, also concurred with
                    him in his endeavours; and young Barthélemy’s career soon became equally rapid
                    and brilliant.</p>
                <p>He had resolved to dedicate himself to the church; but, in order to qualify
                    himself, it became necessary to change his place of residence, since Μ. de
                    Belzunce, bishop of Marseilles, being actuated by a narrow jealousy, refused to
                    admit to holy orders the students of the oratory. Barthélemy, therefore,
                    quitting his old masters with regret, found himself under the necessity of
                    studying philosophy and theology under the Jesuits.</p>
                <p>As he had not at first the good fortune to fall into able hands, he determined to
                    follow a private plan of education, independently of the professors. He
                    accordingly applied himself to the ancient languages, and was indefatigable in
                    acquiring a knowledge of the Greek, Hebrew, thaldee, and Syriac. His passion for
                    learning, however, <hi rend="superscript"> a</hi> d nearly cost him his life;
                    for he fell dangerously ill, <hi rend="superscript"> an</hi> d did not recover
                    his strength until he had entered the seminary where he received the
                    tonsure.</p>
                <p>In this retreat lie dedicated his leisure hours to the study of Arabic; and a
                    young Maronite, who had been educated at Rome, having afforded him assistance,
                    he was soon able not only to read, but even to speak that language. By way of
                    return, his new friend proposed to him to render all the services in his power
                    to the Maronites, Armenians, and other Catholic Arabians, who were but slightly
                    acquainted with the language of the country in which they resided; in other
                    words, he expressed a wish that Barthélemy would announce the word of God to
                    them in their native tongue, and accordingly presented him with some Arabic
                    sermons composed by a Jesuit who had belonged to the Propaganda. Accordingly,
                    Barthélemy got one or two of them by heart, and pronounced them in a spacious
                    hall belonging to the seminary, to the entire satisfaction of his oriental
                    auditors.</p>
                <p>His reputation now rose high, and he began to be considered a youth of uncommon
                    promise, when a trifling incident occurred which tended not a little to increase
                    his fame. Ten or twelve of the principal merchants of Marseilles one day
                    introduced to him a person who had implored their charity on the exchange. The
                    stranger described himself as a Jew by birth, who, on account of his great
                    learning, had been raised to the dignity of rabbi, but who, perceiving from his
                    researches that the Christian was the true religion, had become a convert to
                    that faith; adding, at the same time, that he was profoundly instructed in the
                    oriental languages, and desired to be put to the proof by being confronted with
                    some learned man. Barthélemy, not then twenty-one years of age, was immediately
                    pitched upon. It was in vain he assured his friends that although he could read
                    he was unable to speak the languages in question. They pressed him to enter into
                    conversation with the native of the East; and the stranger himself entreated
                    that the conference might immediately commence. The challenge was at length
                    accepted, and the foreigner began the contest, from which Barthélemy retired
                    with the character of a prodigy of oriental learning.</p>
                <p>Barthélemy having now finished his education at the seminary, retired to Aubagne,
                    and spent some time in the bosom of his family, by all the members of which he
                    was greatly beloved. He was accustomed, however, to repair frequently to
                    Marseilles, in order to visit the academicians and other learned men residing
                    there. Among those to whom he attached himself in a particular manner was a Μ.
                    Cary, the possessor of a fine cabinet of medals, and a valuable collection of
                    books adapted to the favourite subject of his pursuits and studies. They spent
                    whole days together in conversing on literary subjects; after which Barthélemy,
                    as if insatiable of knowledge, would retire to the Minims, where Father
                    Sigaloux, a correspondent of the Academy of Sciences, was employed in making
                    astronomical observations. In these labours the young abbé became his associate,
                    for he was ambitious of improving in every kind of knowledge.</p>
                <p>But he at length began to perceive, that, in order to render his studies
                    profitable, it would be necessary to circumscribe them; as mediocrity of
                    knowledge, the inevitable result of diversity of application, was but little
                    preferable to ignorance itself. Impressed with these sentiments, he repaired to
                    Paris in 1744, with the view of devoting himself entirely to literature. He was
                    furnished with a letter to Μ. de Boze, keeper of the medals, and perpetual
                    secretary of inscriptions and belles lettres. This learned man, so estimable in
                    every point of view, received him with great politeness, and introduced him to
                    the acquaintance of the most distinguished members of the three academies, who
                    dined twice a week at his apartments. Mixing with society of this kind,
                    Barthélemy became more deeply enamoured of letters than ever, and of those who
                    cultivated them.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:193194723" xml:id="kp-eb0704-4723-0416"/>
                <p>Μ. de Boze, having in the meanwhile carefully studied the character and
                    disposition of the young man, at length favoured him with his friendship, and
                    even with his confidence; at least he conferred on him as much of these as was
                    possible for a man of so much circumspection and reserve to bestow on any one.
                    As the increasing age and declining health of Μ. de Boze no longer admitted of
                    his applying with the intense devotion necessary for the completion of the
                    cabinet of medals, he entertained some thoughts of associating M. de Bastie, a
                    learned antiquary belonging to the academy of inscriptions, as a partner in his
                    labours. But that gentleman lost the appointment, in consequence of an unlucky
                    expression; Barthélemy was selected a few months afterwards; and the nomination
                    was approved of by M. Bignon the librarian, and Maurepas the minister of the
                    department. From that moment the abbé dedicated both his days and nights to the
                    study of those medals which his colleagŭe had been prevented by his infirmities
                    from arranging.</p>
                <p>Amidst his multiplied occupations, Barthélemy began to enjoy a mode of life so
                    conformable to his taste and his talents, when he beheld with concern a new
                    career present itself. In the course of his journey to the capital he had seen
                    Μ. de Bausset, then a canon at Aix. They were friends and countrymen; for Μ. de
                    Bausset was born at Aubagne, where his family had long been established. As he
                    was a young man of considerable expectations, he had promised that Barthélemy
                    should become his vicar-general the moment he himself was decoratedwith the
                    mitre. Such a flattering offer was not to be rejected; and as the canon had just
                    been nominated to the bishopric of Bezières, he did not fail to remind his old
                    acquaintance of their mutual engagement. The regret felt by the medallist on
                    this occasion was unaffected and real; but he was too scrupulous an observer of
                    his word to break his promise; and the prelate, who saw and felt for the
                    embarrassment of Barthélemy, immediately desisted from his importunities.</p>
                <p>On the death of Μ. de Boze, keeper of the cabinet of medals, in 1753, Barthélemy,
                    who had been his colleague during seven years, expected of course to succeed him
                    in that honourable situation. One person, however, appeared as a candidate; and
                    notwithstanding the abbé, relying on the justice of his pretensions, took no
                    step whatever to obtain the appointment, the zeal of his friends, who were both
                    numerous and powerful, rendered all solicitations on his part unnecessary. Μ. de
                    Malesherbes, whose unfortunate and tragical death was universally deplored; Μ.
                    de Stainville, afterwards a duke and minister; and Μ. de Gontaut, brother of the
                    last marshal de Biron; supported his pretensions, and he was accordingly
                    nominated successor to his friend in 1753.</p>
                <p>Μ. de Stainville, afterwards better known during his administration by the title
                    of duke de Choiseul, being appointed ambassador to Rome in 1754, Madame de
                    Stainville, a lady both young and beautiful, as well as passionately attached to
                    learning and learned men, conceived a particular regard for the abbé; and it was
                    proposed that he should occupy a place in their carriage on this occasion, and
                    make the tour of Italy along with them. Such a proposition could not fail to be
                    highly flattering; but he was obliged, from principles of duty, to refrain for a
                    time from complying with their wishes. He set out soon after, however, and in
                    November arrived at Rome, where he and his companion were received and treated
                    in the kindest manner by the French plenipotentiary, who lived in magnificent
                    style. Pope Benedict XIV., who then wore the tiara, and was a learned man
                    himself, did not fail to distinguish Barthélemy by the most courteous reception.
                    But his stay at Rome was not of long duration; for he was desirous of visiting
                    Naples, rendered particularly interesting to an antiquary, at that period, by
                    the recent discoveries made in its neighbourhood. During a whole month he and
                    his fellow-traveller were occupied in admiring the curiosities of that capital,
                    and in studying ancient literature; after which they took a journey of thirty
                    leagues to examine the monuments of Grecian architecture still extant amidst the
                    splendid ruins of the ancient city of Paestum.</p>
                <p>But the spacious apartments of the palace of Portici, containing the antiquities
                    of Herculaneum and Pompeii, were still more interesting, and excited a higher
                    degree of curiosity in the breasts of the French philosophers. There they beheld
                    an immense quantity of paintings, statues, busts, vases, and utensils of every
                    kind; objects peculiarly calculated to engage their attention and excite their
                    admiration. It was not, however, without a certain mixture of grief and surprise
                    that they noticed the four or five hundred manuscripts, saved from the ruins of
                    Herculaneum, lying in the same forlorn state in which they were discovered. Two
                    or three only had been unrolled, of which the learned Mazocchi has given an
                    explanation; but as these contained nothing important, the operation was
                    abandoned. Barthélemy, however, was not so easily discouraged; for he
                    unceasingly solicited, nay, he almost condescended to intrigue, with a view to
                    engage the possessors of these treasures to turn them to the best advantage.
                    But, a few years afterwards, when his labours were about to be crowned with
                    success, he was finally disappointed by the death of the Marquis Caraccioli, the
                    minister of Naples, who had entered most cordially into his views.</p>
                <p>Another subject about this time also engaged the attention of the abbé. He was
                    exceedingly desirous of presenting the learned men of France with a specimen of
                    the ancient writing employed in the Greek manuscripts. He accordingly addressed
                    himself on this subject to his friend Mazocchi, and also to Μ. Paderno, who
                    superintended the treasures of Portici; but both replied that they were
                    expressly enjoined not to make any communication on the subject. On this he
                    solicited permission to look, for a few minutes only, on a page of a manuscript
                    which had been cut from top to bottom since its discovery. It contained
                    twenty-eight lines, and Barthélemy read it over six different times with extreme
                    attention, after which he retired to a corner and transcribed the precious
                    fragment on apiece of paper, from memory. He then returned, and having made a
                    mental collation between the copy and the original, he corrected two or three
                    trifling errors that had escaped his attention. And having thus rendered himself
                    master of a fac-similé of the manuscript, which related to the persecution of
                    the Greek philosophers during the time of Pericles, he transmitted the literary
                    plunder in the course of that very day to the Academy of Belles Lettres;
                    strictly enjoining secrecy, however, that Mazocchi and Paderno might escape all
                    manner of blame.</p>
                <p>Μ. de Stainville having been appointed ambassador to the court of Vienna in 1757,
                    the abbé accompanied his lady thither. On his arrival he found that his friend
                    and protector had made certain engagements with the French ministry with the
                    view of gratifying his passion for antiquities; and, in consequence, he received
                    permission to visit, at the king’s expense, Greece and the sea-ports of the
                    Mediterranean, where he was to collect new treasures, and return with them to
                    his native country by Marseilles-But notwithstanding all the attractions which
                    this project presented, his scrupulous attachment to his duty prevailed over his
                    passion for knowledge; and as he deemed it highly improper that the cabinet of
                    medals should remain so long shut, he abandoned the scheme of visiting the
                    Levant.</p>

                <p>Ät length', towards the end of 1758, Μ. dè Stainville, now become duke de
                    Choiseul, was nominated minister for forei <hi rend="superscript"> σ</hi> n
                    affairs, in the room of the abbé de Bernis, who had retired with a cardinal’s
                    hat. No sooner had this event taken place, than both the duke and his lady
                    determined to provide for their friend. They accordingly requested Barthélemy to
                    state the sum which would make him easy for life; and he instantly mentioned
                    6000 livres a year, blushing at the same time at the largeness of the
                    demand.</p>
                <p>As the national purse was now open to the minister, he distributed his favours
                    with a liberal hand; and it must be owned that, on this occasion, an object
                    worthy of remuneration presented itself in the person of the learned abbé.
                    Accordingly, in 1759, the duke presented him with a pension on the archbishopric
                    of Alby; in 1765 he conferred on him the treasurership of St Martin de Tours;
                    and, in 1768, he made him secretary-general to the Swiss guards. In addition to
                    these the abbé also enjoyed a pension of 5000 livres on the Mercure de France.
                    By these means his income was now very large; but he employed it nobly; for he
                    distributed the surplus, which was considerable, among indigent men of
                    letters.</p>
                <p>In 1771 M. de Choiseul was disgraced, being succeeded in his office by his enemy
                    the duke d’ Aiguillon, and exiled to his estate at Chantcloupe. On this occasion
                    he was as usual forsaken by the courtiers who had basked in the sunshine of his
                    favour. But he was not deserted by the grateful antiquary, who instantly
                    repaired to Chanteloupe to pay his respects to the fallen minister; and when the
                    king demanded the duke’s resignation of the post of colonel-general of the Swiss
                    guards, the abbé, with a spirit which does honour to his memory, insisted on
                    sending in his own resignation of the secretaryship. The ex-minister, however,
                    interfered, and prevailed upon him not to deliver it up without an
                    indemnification, sanctioned by the great seal, and authorized by letters patent
                    enregistered in the parliament.</p>
                <p>Barthélemy was now in possession of more than L.1200 sterling per annum, of which
                    he distributed between L.300 and L.400 in the manner before related; and the
                    remainder was not dissipated in pomp and ostentation, but employed in such a
                    manner as to enable him to enjoy philosophic ease. He also educated and
                    established in life three nephews, one of whom was successively an ambassador
                    and a director; at the same time supporting the rest of his family in Provence,
                    and collecting a noble library, which he disposed of some years before his
                    death. But after having thus possessed an ample income during more than twenty
                    years, the abbé Barthélemy found himself, towards the close of his existence,
                    reduced to live on a pittance barely adequate to furnish the necessaries of
                    life, in consequence of the suppression of places and appointments occasioned by
                    the revolution. He was never heard to complain, however, nor, indeed, did he
                    seem to perceive the change; and while age and infirmities permitted him to walk
                    from θ∏e end of Paris to the other, in order to pay his respects to Madame de
                    Choiseul, his happiness suffered no apparent diminution.</p>
                <p>In 1788 appeared his celebrated work, entitled <hi rend="italic">Voyage du jeune
                    Anacharsis en Grèce, dans le milieu du quatrième siècle avant l’ere
                    Chrétienne.</hi> He had begun it in 1757, and, during an uninterrupted
                    succession of thirty years, occupied his leisure hours in bringing it to
                    maturity. His hero, a young Scythian, descended from the famous philosopher
                    Anacharsis, whose name he bears, is supposed to repair to Greece for instruction
                    in his early youth, and after making the tour of her republics, colonies, and!
                    <hi rend="superscript"> s</hi> ands, to return to his native country and write
                    this ook in his old age, after the Macedonian hero had over- <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ur</hi> ∏ed the Persian empire. In the manner of modern
                    travellers, he gives an account of the customs, government, and antiquities, of
                    the country he is supposed to have visited; a copious introduction supplies
                    whatever may be wanting in respect to historical details; whilst various
                    dissertations on the music of the Greeks, on the literature of the Athenians,
                    and on the economy, pursuits, ruling passions, manners, and customs, of the
                    surrounding states, supply ample information on the subjects of which they
                    treat. The author, indeed, is not profound; and the young Scythian seldom
                    penetrates much below the surface. But his remarks are commonly <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 7</hi> judicious, and to respectable erudition he unites
                    singular skill in the distribution of his materials, and a happy talent for
                    presenting his subject in the most agreeable and attractive form. The assumed
                    character is so admirably sustained throughout, that we can scarcely persuade
                    ourselves we are not perusing a book of real travels, and communing with an
                    actual personage, who has recorded his observations and experience for the
                    instruction and improvement of his countrymen.</p>
                <p>In 1789 Barthélemy became a candidate for a chair in the French Academy; and the
                    reputation he had obtained by his labours was such, that this learned body
                    became anxious to enrol him among its members, which was accordingly done by
                    acclamation. The speech delivered by the abbé on his inauguration has been
                    equally celebrated for its simplicity and modesty <hi rend="superscript">
                    7</hi>.</p>
                <p>In 1790 Μ. dc St Priest, minister of the department of Paris, made him an offer
                    of the situation of librarian to the king, then vacant by the resignation of Μ.
                    le Noir. But this very flattering proposal was not accepted; for the abbé
                    imagined that it might interfere with his literary occupations, and therefore
                    respectfully declined the intended favour.</p>
                <p>But while Barthélemy was thus refusing one of the most honourable offices which a
                    man of letters could at that time aspire to, he did not neglect the department
                    which had so long been confided to his charge. His ardour respecting every thing
                    that concerned the cabinet of medals remained unabated through life; and he now
                    found means to have his nephew, Barthélemy Courcy, associated with him in his
                    labours. This grand collection had received a considerable increase, and had
                    been embellished with a number of fine specimens since it was first confided to
                    his care. To enrich it still more, he carried on an extensive correspondence,
                    not only with the various provinces of France, but also with every part of
                    Europe.</p>
                <p>In the mean time the health of the learned medalist declined daily, and in 1792
                    his strength had so much failed him that, towards the close of the year, he
                    became subject to fainting fits, which deprived him of the exercise of his
                    faculties for several hours together. Being naturally calm and courageous, he
                    did not appear to be in the least affected by these accidents; his friends,
                    however, considered them as symptoms of approaching dissolution. He was now
                    seventy-eight years of age, sixty of which had been spent in literary toils; and
                    it might therefore have been expected that, even at that agitated period, the
                    venerable veteran would have been suffered to die in peace. But it was not so.
                    On the 30th of August 1793 this feeble old man was denounced as an aristocrat,
                    and his nephew and several other young men employed about the library were
                    included in the charge. The accusation proceeded from a person of the name of
                    Duby, a clerk in the library, and it was conveyed in a letter written by him to
                    a person of the name of Chrétien, a pastry-cook (who happened to be a member of
                    the section before which it was first read), and then transmitted to the
                    municipality. It was of no consequence that Duby did not know Chrétien, nor
                    Chrétien Duby, and that Barthélemy was not acquainted<pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193194749" xml:id="kp-eb0704-4749-0418"/> with either. A warrant was
                    immediately issued against the supposed culprits, and the fact was signified, by
                    the officers of justice, to the abbé, while at Madame de Choi-seul’s, on the
                    morning of the 2d of September. On receiving the intimation, he instantly rose,
                    without discovering any symptoms of perturbation, and taking his leave of that
                    lady, was conducted to the Magdelonettes, where he found bis nephew Courcy.
                    Such, however, was the respect paid to his virtue and his talents, even within
                    the walls of a prison, that, on entering the gate, he was received with every
                    expression of regard by the inhabitants of this dreary mansion; and even the
                    jailer, whose name was Vanbertrand, paid him the most respectful attention. He
                    was accordingly lodged in a little apartment along with his relation; and in the
                    course of that evening he received a visit from Madame de Choiseul, who had
                    taken care to notify the event to the government. No sooner was the Committee of
                    Public Safety informed that the Abbé Barthélemy had been included in the order,
                    which was meant to extend only to some of the subalterns employed in the
                    library, than orders were instantly issued for his release; and it is said that
                    the clerks in the public offices displayed the utmost zeal in forwarding the
                    necessary papers for his liberation; in consequence of which he was awaked from
                    his sleep at eleven o’clock at night, and conducted to the house of his fair
                    friend. Nor did the attention of the government stop here. In a few weeks
                    afterwards, the office of national librarian having become vacant by the death
                    of Carra and the resignation of Chamfort, who had held it jointly, it was
                    offered to the abbé, with the most flattering marks of respect. But his advanced
                    age and increasing infirmities did not admit of his accepting the offer.</p>
                <p>In 1794 his approaching dissolution was apparent to every one but himself, for
                    his fainting fits became longer and more frequent; but as he did not retain any
                    remembrance of them, he occupied his time as usual, and continued to devote all
                    his hours to friendship and literature. He had now reached the eightieth year of
                    a life which had been entirely spent in laborious and incessant application to
                    study, and might even have attained a greater age. But the rigour of the winter
                    of 1795, against which he had adopted no precautions, is supposed to have
                    hastened the catastrophe, which, however, did not occur until the ensuing
                    spring.</p>
                <p>On the 25th of April he dined with Madame de Choiseul. In the course of the night
                    he became so weak that he was unable to ring his bell; and in the morning, when
                    his servant entered, he was found with his feet in the bed and his head on the
                    floor, entirely deprived of sensation. After being replaced, his recollection
                    returned; but he became gradually worse, and at length died without a struggle
                    on the 30th April 1795. He retained full possession of his faculties until the
                    very last moment. At one o’clock he read Horace as if nothing extraordinary had
                    occurred; but his hands turning cold in consequence of the approach of death, he
                    became unable to support the book, and it fell to the ground. Soon after his
                    head was seen to incline on one side; he appeared to sleep, and it was believed
                    by his nephew and his attendants that he had fallen into a slumber; but it was
                    soon discovered that his respiration had ceased, and that this learned man was
                    no more. Thus died John James Barthélemy, one of the greatest ornaments of his
                    age, a man whose life presented an example, and an author whose works form a
                    model, for literary men. In his person Barthélemy was above the middle size;
                    and, if we are to credit his admirers, his countenance displayed an air of
                    antiquity wonderfully corresponding with his studies. His bust, sculptured by
                    the chisel of Houdon, is allowed to be a masterpiece of art; and that able
                    artist has contrived to infuse into the physiognomy a mixture of the mildness,
                    simplicity, good-nature, and elevation of soul, so visible in the original.</p>
