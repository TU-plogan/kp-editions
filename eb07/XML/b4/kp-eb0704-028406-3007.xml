                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra

                <p><label type="entry">BAIAE</label>, an ancient village of Campania, in Italy,
                    situated between the promontory of Misenum and Puteoli, on the Sinus Batanus,
                    and famous for its natural hot baths, which served the wealthier Romans for the
                    purposes both of medicine and pleasure. The variety of these baths, the softness
                    of its climate, and the beauty of its landscape, captivated the minds of opulent
                    nobles, whose passion for bathing knew no bounds. Abundance of linen, and disuse
                    of unguents, render the practice less necessary in modern life; but the ancients
                    performed no exercise and engaged in no study without previous ablutions, which
                    at Rome required an enormous expense in aqueducts, stoves, and attendants; and
                    therefore a place where waters naturally <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> heated to
                    every degree of temperature bubble spontaneously out of the ground, in the
                    pleasantest of all situations, formed a treasure which could not be overlooked.
                    Such was Baiae in the highest perfection: its easy communication with Rome was
                    also a great advantage. Hither retired for temporary relaxation the mighty
                    rulers of the world, to recruit their strength and revive their spirits,
                    fatigued with bloody campaigns and civil contests. Their habitations at first
                    were small and modest; but increasing luxury soon added palace to palace with
                    such expedition, that ground could no longer be had for new erections; while
                    enterprising architects, supported by boundless wealth, carried their
                    foundations into the sea, and drove that element back from its ancient limits.
                    From being a place of occasional resort for a season, Baiae now grew up into a
                    regular city; and whoever found himself disqualified by age or infirmity for any
                    longer sustaining an active part on the political theatre; whoever, from
                    indolence of disposition, sought a place where the pleasures of a town were
                    combined with the sweets of rural life; whoever wished to withdraw from the
                    dangerous neighbourhood of a court, and the baneful eye of informers, flocked
                    hither to enjoy life untainted with fear or trouble. Such a confluence of
                    wealthy inhabitants rendered Baiae as much a miracle of art as it had before
                    been of nature; and its splendour may still be inferred from its innumerable
                    ruins, heaps of marbles, mosaics, stucco, and other precious fragments of taste.
                    It flourished in undiminished magnificence till the days of Theodoric the Goth;
                    but the destruction of these enchanted palaces followed quickly upon the
                    irruption of the northern conquerors, who overturned the Roman power, sacked and
                    burned all before them, and destroyed or dispersed the whole race of nobility.
                    Loss of fortune left the Romans neither the means nor indeed the thought of
                    supporting such expensive establishments, which can only be enjoyed in
                    perfection during peace and prosperity. No sooner had opulence failed, and the
                    guardian hand of man been withdrawn, than the sea rushed back upon its old
                    domain; moles and buttresses were torn asunder and washed away; and
                    promontories, with the proud towers that once crowned their brows, were
                    undermined and tumbled into the deep. ìet, in its ruined state, and stripped of
                    all its ornaments, Baiae still presents many striking objects for the admiration
                    of the traveller and the pencil of the artist. Long. 14.45. E. Lat. 4L 6. N.</p>
