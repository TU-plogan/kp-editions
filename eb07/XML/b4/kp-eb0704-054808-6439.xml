                    of Moray, occupies a conspicuous place in the literary annals of Scotland, but
                    his personal history is still involved in some degree of obscurity. It is
                    evident ⅛at several writers have confounded him with Sir John Bellenden of
                    Auchinoul. Their names are indeed the same, but this is the only circumstance to
                    support their identity; and the judge appears to have survived the archdeacon
                    for so long a period as twenty-seven years. Dr Bellenden was probably educated
                    in the university of St Andrews: a student of the same name, and described as
                    belonging to the Lothian nation, was matriculated in 1508;<note anchored="true"

                    poets of this age were too generally disposed to adopt terms of a French as well
                    as Latin origin; and that the practice cannot be considered as peculiar to those
                    who had been educated in France. Sir David Lindsay, in a poem supposed to have
                    been written in the year 1530, mentions him in the following terms:</p>

                <p>The literary merit of Bellenden does not seem to have been disregarded by the
                    court; but he experienced the precarious fortune which so frequently attends
                    courtiers. For this information we are partly indebted to his poem entitled the
                    Proheme of the Cosmographe:</p>

                <p>In the epistle subjoined to his translation of Boyce’s history, he likewise
                    states that he had been in the service of the king from his majesty’s early
                    infancy. It has been conjectured that he was employed in superintending the
                    young monarch’s education: but he makes no allusion to such an appointment, of
                    which it would have been very natural to remind the king, if they had ever stood
                    in the relation of tutor and pupil; and he very clearly informs us that his
                    place in the royal household was that of clerk of accompts. James’s preceptor
                    was Gavin Dunbar, afterwards promoted to the archbishopric of Glasgow. Being
                    dismissed from the king’s service, as he states in the verses last quoted,
                    Bellenden is supposed to have entered into that of Archibald earl of Angus,
                    because a person of the same name was the earl’s secretary in the year 1528. In
                    the course of that year, Angus and some of his relations were accused of
                    treason: John Ballentyne, who is described as his secretary, presented himself
                    at the bar of the parliament on the 4th of September, and delivered a written
                    protest in the name of the earl of Angus, his brother George Douglas, and his
                    uncle Archibald Douglas of Kilspindie, stating the reasons why they ought not to
                    be compelled to answer to the charge of treason which had been preferred against
                    them; and in the afternoon of the same day, the secretary again made his
                    appearance, probably because they found such a protest altogether unavailing,
                    and explained the conditions on which the earl was willing to surrender to his
                    trial.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic"

                    a transaction of this nature we should expect to find him employing a lawyer
                    rather than a clergyman; and accordingly we are informed by Hume that the
                    individual who thus appeared for the Douglases was “Sir John Ballandine, who was
                    then one of their dependers, and afterward justice clerk.”<note anchored="true"

                <p>Whatever may have been Bellenden’s employment at this period, it is certain that
                    he was soon afterwards an attendant at court; and that at the request of the
                    king he undertook a translation of the Roman history of Livy, and the Scotish
                    history of Boyce.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>It is
                    not to be supposed that the king was able to read Latin authors with much
                    facility. Lindsay, vol. i. p. 259, mentions that he was taken from school at the
                    age of twelve; and the metrical paraphrast of Boyce’s history has more
                    particularly described the state of his knowledge:</p><lg part="N">

                    </lg><p>We cannot however suppose that the king was entirely ignorant of the
                    Latin language. It may perhaps be considered as a proofhis knowledge, that he
                    urged Buchanan to write against the Franciscan friars, and to render his satire
                    more poignant. “Igitur aenus in cosjussus scribere, eam silvam, quae nunc sub

                    the three ensuing years. The treasurer’s accounts contain various entries
                    respecting the remuneration of his labours ·. the sum total which he is there
                    stated to have received amounts to L.114; namely, L.78 for the translation of
                    Boyce, and L.36 for that of Livy. But this was not the only reward which he
                    obtained. The archdeaconry of Moray had become vacant during the vacancy of the
                    see; and two clergymen, Duncan and Harvey, having solicited the pope in favour
                    of James Douglas, were convicted of treason, and their property escheated to the
                    crown. The annual emoluments arising from the pensions and benefices of John
                    Duncan, who was parson of Glasgow, and from all the property belonging to
                    Alexander Harvey for the two successive years 1536 and 1537, were bestowed upon
                    Bellenden. For the first grant he paid a composition of 350 marks, and for the
                    second, of L.300.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    to the archdeaconry, which had lapsed to the crown in consequence of the vacancy
                    in the bishopric: it was perhaps about the same period that he was appointed a
                    canon of Ross; and this appears to have been the full extent of his preferment
                    in the church, while many worthless and illiterate men were enjoying its highest
                    dignities and emoluments.</p>

                    that the date here assigned, if it is not merely conjectural, must have been
                    ascertained from some other document. The book was printed by Thomas Davidson,

                    the'translator as archdeacon of Moray and canon of Ross: the bishopric did not

                    was vacated at a later period. Under the date of April 1538, when he obtained a
                    grant of the two clergymen’s emoluments for the preceding year, he was not
                    described as a dignitary. It has likewise been stated that the work was

                    seem all to belong to the same edition. It was Bellenden’s intention to execute
                    a complete version of Livy, but he did not advance beyond the first five books,
                    nor was his translation printed till the year 1822. From a manuscript in the
                    Advocates Library, it was then published by Mr Maitland, to whose antiquarian
                    zeal we are likewise indebted for a new edition of his other translation, as

                <p>These two works exhibit the most ample specimen of ancient Scotish prose that has
                    descended to our times, and are distinguished beyond most others by their
                    fluency and neatness of style. Bellenden frequently surprises a modern reader by
                    the happy vivacity of his expressions; nor can we peruse these translations
                    without beinσ∙ convinced that his learning and talents had qualified him for
                    original composition. In his version of the Scotish historian, he does not
                    adhere very scrupulously to his author· he has assumed the liberty of adding, as
                    well as of retrenching, and may therefore+e considered as having exceeded the
                    proper limits of a translation. He has at all events produced a very curious,
                    and, to those who have a competent knowledge of the language, a very
                    entertaining work. To his version of Boyce’s history he has subjoined an
                    epistle, addressed to James the Fifth, and written in a strain of manly freedom:
                    of the distinction between a king and a tyrant, and of the miseries to which
                    wicked princes have generally been exposed, he speaks in bold and unequivocal
                    terms, which may excite some degree of surprise, but which cannot fail of
                    exciting a high degree of respect for his character.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>In the Proheme of the History, Bellenden
                    takes occasion to suggest that it is impossible for a king to possess at once
                    the hearts and the goods of his barons.</p><lg part="N">

                    for preferment; and in all ages ambitious churchmen have been sufficiently
                    disposed to encourage sovereigns in their most flagrant attempts to encroach on
                    the liberties of their subjects; but the conduct of the worthy archdeacon, and
                    of some other beneficed clergymen of the ancient Scotish church, must completely
                    exempt them from this censure. John Mair, who was provost of St Salvator’s
                    College, and treasurer of the chapel royal, and Hector Boyce, who was principal
                    of King’s College, canon of Aberdeen, and rector of Tyrie, have each written the
                    history of their native country, and have each evinced a laudable zeal in
                    vindicating the unalienable rights of the people. If such sentiments were
                    cherished by some of the catholic clergy, it is not surprising that they should
                    animate the breast of Buchanan, who had never been accustomed to pace in the
                    trammels of the church, and who had more completely imbibed the spirit of
                    classical antiquity.</p>
                <p>Whatever might be the liberality of his political sentiments, Bellenden seems to
                    have been unprepared for any change in the national religion.<note

                    have even extorted applause from the zealous bishop of Ossory, John Bale, who
                    has so frequently treated the papists with unrelenting severity. In his poetical
                    remains, which are not numerous, he frequently displays an excursive fancy, with
                    considerable taste and skill as a versifier; and it is therefore to be regretted
                    that so few of his compositions have been preserved. The most poetical of his
                    works is the Proheme of the Cosmographe: the principal incidents are borrowed
                    from the ancient fiction of the choice of Hercules,<note anchored="true"

                    characteristic air of an original. Nor is his Proheme of the History destitute
                    of poetical merit. These two poems, as well as the metrical prologue to his
                    translation of Livy, bear internal evidence of having been composed for the
                    instruction of the young king. Two copies of his unpublished prolusion on the

                    Boyce’s preliminary description of Scotland. It was stated by Dr Campbell that

                    Scotland; and he particularly mentions that several of his poems were in the
                    possession of Laurence Dundas, apparently the professor of humanity at
                    Edinburgh.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi

                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Bellenden,</hi><hi rend="italic">William,</hi> is a Scotish
                    name familiarly known to those who have explored the recesses of modern
                    literature, but with respect to the history of the individual himself very few
                    particulars have hitherto been discovered. Whether he belonged to any family of
                    distinction, we are not informed; nor is the gentility of his birth attested by
                    Dempster, who supplies the only biographical notices with which we are
                    acquainted. According to this contemporary authority, he was a professor in the
                    university, and an advocate in the parliament of Paris. We must apparently
                    conclude that he relinquished the functions of a professor, and betook himself
                    to the practice of the bar. The same writer has stated that both Queen Mary and
                    King James employed him in some diplomatic services, and that the latter
                    nominated him master of requests.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    That he bore such a title, is sufficiently ascertained from his own
                    publications, in all of which he is described as “Magister supplicum Libellorum
                    Augusti Regis Magnae Britanniae but there are obvious reasons for suspecting
                    that his office, if not unconnected with emolument, was altogether unconnected
                    with official duty; for he appears to have spent the greater part of his life in

                    an honourable title in France, Bellenden might solicit and obtain such a title
                    from a sovereign who could not so easily bestow an ample salary. The terms
                    employed by Dempster in describing his appointment, seem rather to indicate
                    honour than emolument. It is supposed that he must have belonged to the Scotish
                    establishment, for, in England, a person who bore this title was a judge of a
                    particular court: of the court of requests, which professed to distribute
                    justice gratuitously, the lord privy seal was chief judge, and was assisted by
                    two judges called masters of requests, the one for the common, and the other for

                <p>If he practised at the bar in Paris, his early education must in all probability
                    have been French; and if he was a regent or professor in one of the colleges, he
                    may be supposed to have adhered to the popish religion. Since the massacre of St
                    Bartholomew, which had proved fatal to Ramus and other men of learning, there
                    probably had been no protestant professor in any college of Paris. His nephew,

                    overlook the important intelligence that his former publication had been thought
                    worthy of the attention of mighty princes. Both these works partake of the
                    nature of a cento. In the first of them, the author has collected from the
                    writings of Cicero the various precepts and remarks which relate to the origin
                    and principles of regal government, and with no small labour has combined the
                    whole in a regular and systematic form. Adopting a similar plan in the other
                    work, he has compiled a treatise on the dignity and authority of the consuls,
                    and on the constitution of the Roman senate. Although this may seem an effort of
                    mere diligence, it required both learning and ability to present such materials
                    in such a shape.</p>
                <p>His next publication is entitled “De Statu prisci Orbis in Religione, Re
                    politica, et Literis, liber unus. Ad serenissimum Principem Carolum Principem
                    Scotiae et Walliae.” Paris. 1615, 8vo. This is a work of more originality, and
                    affords a very favourable specimen of the author’s talents and erudition.<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Br Parr, in his famous
                    preface to'Bellenden, p. v. mentions this work with much commendation. “Stylus
                    est Bellendem pθ <hi rend="superscript"> r</hi> librum, huncce, dilucidus in
                    primis, neque exquisitus nimis. Sententiae hic illic occurrunt recondita?,

                    suo.”</p></note> It exhibits, in a very condensed form, a sketch of the history
                    of philosophy and civil polity, tracing its progress among the Hebrews, Greeks,
                    and Romans. Of this work very few copies appear to have been separately
                    published; for the author speedily combined all the three tracts in a volume
                    which bears the following title: “De Statu libri tres. I. De Statu prisci Orbis
                    in Religione, Re politica, et Literis.</p>
                <p>II. Ciceronis Princeps, sive de Statu Principis et Imperii.</p>
                <p>III. Ciceronis Consul, Senator, Senatusque Romanus, sive de Statu Reip. et Urbis

                    Notwithstanding this notice on the title-page, we suspect that the second and
                    third treatises were not actually reprinted. Each treatise has a distinct series
                    of pages, and it was therefore easy to combine the whole. In its separate form
                    and in this volume, <hi rend="italic">Ciceronis Consul</hi> exhibits the very
                    same list of typographical errors. Dr Parr remarks, that in all the copies which
                    he had seen, the date seems to have been changed from <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >m.dc.xv.</hi> to <hi rend="smallcaps">m.dc∙xvi.</hi> by the printer adding the
                    letter ι after the impression had been finished: but in a copy belonging to the
                    Advocates Library, the additional letter is apparently printed, not with a type,
                    but with a pen; and in a copy belonging to the writer of this notice, the
                    original date remains unaltered. Another minute variation may likewise be
                    mentioned; in the latter copy, the plate in the second treatise' is not
                    impressed on the reverse of a printed page of the dedication. In a paper written
                    by Dr Bennet, the late bishop of Cloyne, we find the subsequent statement
                    respecting the books <hi rend="italic">De Statu.</hi> “The great work being now
                    completed, Bellenden looked forward with a pretty well-grounded expectation for
                    that applause which his labour and his ingenuity deserved. But his views were
                    disappointed, by one of those events which no art of man could foresee or
                    remedy. The vessel in which the whole impression was embarked was overtaken by a
                    storm before she could reach the English coast, and foundered with all her
                    cargo. A very few copies only, which the learned author either kept for his own
                    use, or had sent as presents by private hands, seem to have been preserved from
                    the destruction which awaited the others.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>See Dr Johnstone’s <hi rend="italic">Memoirs of Parr,</hi>
                    p. 182.</p></note> We are not aware of any early authority for such a statement;
                    and the learned prelate, misled by an imperfect recollection, seems to have
                    misapplied Dr Warton’s account of Bellenden’s larger work, which is likewise an
                    account that requires confirmation. There is a manifest fallacy in supposing
                    that almost all the impression of such a book must have been destined for
                    England. After a long interval, the fame of the author was greatly extended by
                    Dr Parr’s publication of“Gulielmi Bellendem, Magistri supplicum Libellorum
                    Augusti Regis Magnae Britanniae, &amp;c. de Statu libri tres. Editio secunda
                    longe emendation.” Lond. 1787,8vo. The preface, extending to seventy-six pages,
                    is written in a style of elegant and powerful Latinity, but is too much
                    replenished with modern politics, and, in the opinion of some readers, is not
                    free from a considerable mixture of pedantry. It is however such a composition
                    as no other Englishman of that period could perhaps have produced.</p>
                <p>The last work which Bellenden himself published is of very small extent,
                    consisting merely of two short poems: “Caroli Primi et Henricae Mariae, Regis et
                    Reginae Magnae Britanniae, &amp;c. Epithalamium; et in ipsas augustissimas
                    Nuptias, celeberrimam que Legationem earum causa obitam, &amp;c. panegyricum
                    Carmen, et Elogia.” Paris. 1625, 4to. This little work has likewise been
                    republished by Dr Parr.</p>
                <p>But the greatest labour of his life was a posthumous production, which made its
                    appearance under the title of “Guilielmi Bellendem Scoti, Magistri supplicum
                    Libellorum Augusti Regis Magnae Britanniae, de tribus Luminibus Romanorum libri
                    sex-decim.” Paris. 1633, fol. With respect to the date of this publication, one
                    bibliographer frequently contradicts another, and some minute particulars
                    require explanation. In the Advocates Library, that great repository of Scotish
                    literature, there are two copies of the book, which exhibit considerable
                    variations. In both of them we find the same extract of the royal privilege,
                    dated on the third of September 1631. The one bears, “Achevé d’imprimer pour la
                    premiere fois, lθ vingtseptiesme jour d’Aoust 1633.” Of this copy the
                    dedication, “HenricoBorbonio, Sacro-sancti Imp. Rom. Principi, illustriss.
                    Metens. Praesuli,” is subscribed by the author’s nephew, “Guilielmus
                    Bellendenus, Presbyter Scotus.” It consists of nearly four pages, but is not
                    followed<pb break="no" facs="nls:193196504" xml:id="kp-eb0704-6504-0553"/> by a
                    preface. The other copy has a similar titlepage, but with the date of 1634; and
                    the note subjoined to the privilege bears, “Achevé d’imprimer pour la premiere
                    fois, le vingtroisiesme jour de Mars 1634.” It contains a different and a
                    shorter dedication, “Potentissimo et invictissimo Principi Carolo Magnae
                    Britanniae Regi, &amp;c.” subscribed by the publisher, Toussaint du Bray. This
                    dedication is followed by a brief preface, “Lectori benevolo.” In other respects
                    the two copies present a complete resemblance; and it appears sufficiently
                    evident that one set of copies must have been intended for the French, and
                    another for the British market.</p>
                <p>Of this elaborate work, which consists of no fewer than 824 pages, printed on a
                    small type, the subject is very faintly indicated by the title. It is the
                    author’s object to combine, in an historical form, all the statements and
                    reflections of Cicero which relate to the civil and religious affairs of Rome;
                    and his plan is executed in such a manner as to display the essence of the Roman
                    history, from the foundation of the city to the extinction of the republic.<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Clement has described this
                    work in terms of too extensive import: “Guillaume Bellenden, grand admirateur de
                    Cicéron, s’est donné la torture pour écrire l’Histoire <hi rend="italic">des
                    Empereurs</hi> et des Consuls Romains, avec les propres termes de cet ancien
                    orateur, dont il a “te constamment les ouvrages à la marge: et comme il n’osoit
                    pas s’étendre à son gré, en écrivant d’une manière si bornée, il a ajouté des
                    notes à la fin de chaque livre, dans lesquelles il explique plus amplement ses
                    idées.” <hi rend="italic">{Bibliothèque curieuse historique et critique, ou

                    himself in no other words than those of Cicero; but he has interspersed
                    occasional observations, drawn from various sources of information. The latter
                    part of the work, relating to the times of his great prototype, is very ample
                    and satisfactory; and here it is evident that the materials must be chiefly
                    derived from the epistles. The reader cannot fail to perceive that this is
                    precisely such a digest as would be necessary for an historian of the life and
                    times of Cicero; it is such a digest as Dr Middleton professes to have formed by
                    his own unaided industry. “My first business therefore,” as he is pleased to
                    state, “after I had undertaken this task, was, to read over Cicero’s works, with
                    no other view than to extract from them all the passages that seemed to have any
                    relation to my design; where the tediousness of collecting an infinite number of
                    testimonies scattered through many different volumes; of sorting them into their
                    classes, and ranging them in proper order; the necessity of overlooking many in
                    the first search, and the trouble of retrieving them in a second or third; and
                    the final omission of several through forgetfulness or inadvertency; have helped
                    to abate that wonder which had often occurred to me, why no man had ever
                    attempted the same work before me, or at least in this enlarged and
                    comprehensive form, in which it is now offered to the public.”<note

                    If previously acquainted with the work of Bellenden, he must have been fully
                    aware that this labour of collecting and digesting was altogether superfluous;
                    nor is it probable that such a book was unknown to Dr Middleton, a man of
                    extensive learning, and the keeper of a great public library, that of the
                    university of Cambridge. He has therefore been repeatedly accused of plagiarism;
                    and it must be confessed that the accusation does not appear to be destitute of
                    foundation. “It may be worth observing,” says Dr Wanton, “that he is much
                    indebted, without acknowledging it, to a curious book little known, entitled <hi
                    rend="italic">G. Bellendeni Scoti de tribus Luminibus Romanorum,</hi> &amp;c. It
                    comprehends a history of Rome, from the foundation of the city to the time of
                    Augustus, drawn up in the very words of Cicero, without any alteration of any
                    expression. In this book Middleton found every part of Cicero’s own history, in
                    his own words, and his works arranged in chronological order, without further
                    trouble. The impression of this work being shipped for England, was lost in the
                    vessel, which was cast away, and only a few copies remained that had been left
                    in France.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Warton’s <hi

                    in the dedication of his work, acknowledged his acquaintance with Bellenden, but
                    has not mentioned him in the most appropriate terms. “Si Bellenden, dans son

                    que les expressions de cet orateur, il a donné dans un autre; et sa compilation,
                    de quelque utilité qu’elle puisse être à un auteur qui embrasseroit une histoire
                    générale, ne sauroit guère servir dans la composition d’une histoire
                    particulière, qu’à fournir la matière d’un gros livre qui ne seroit lu.”<note

                    in either case desirable; and for a person who undertook to write the history of
                    Cicero in two volumes quarto, it might have been thought necessary to inspect
                    all the materials which Cicero had himself furnished.</p>
                <p>Bellenden has bestowed upon his book a title which to many readers must require
                    explanation. It appears to have been his original intention to compose, on a
                    similar plan, three different works illustrative of the civil and literary
                    history of Rome. The first of his three luminaries is Cicero, who has supplied
                    him with the materials of civil history. According to Lenglet du Fresnoy, the
                    other two whom he had in his contemplation were Seneca and the elder Pliny;<note

                    same laborious arrangement and digest of their respective writings, he intended
                    to exhibit a comprehensive view of the moral and physical science of the Romans.
