                    significant corrections to the OCR text, predominantly in cases of confusing "c"
                    and "e." Isolates 90 entries that were mistakenly included at the end of prior
                    entries in v1 and v2. Normalizes ordinal numbers. Separates metadata in
                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra
                    space around the <gi>pb</gi> tag. Where a word is hyphenated at a <gi>pb</gi>,
                    the end fragment is now joined to the start fragment, making a machine-readable
                    word.</change>

                    History,</hi> a denomination of Christians, distinguished from other Christians
                    by their particular opinions respecting the mode and the subjects of
                    baptism.</p>
                <p>Instead of administering the ordinance by sprinkling, they maintain that it ought
                    to be administered only by immersion. Such, they insist, is the import of the
                    word ∕3αwr∕ζω; so that a command to baptize is a command to immerse. And thus it
                    was understood by those who first administered it. John the Baptist and the
                    apostles of Christ administered it in Jordan and other rivers and places where
                    there was much water. Both the administrators and the subjects are described as
                    going down into and coming up again out of the water; and the baptized are said
                    to be buried in baptism, and to be raised again; which language could not, they
                    say, be properly adopted on supposition of the ordinance being administered in
                    any other manner than by immersion. Thus also, they affirm» it was in general
                    administered in the primitive church; thus it is now administered in the Russian
                    and Greek church; and thus it is at this day directed to be administered in the
                    church of England to all who are thought <pb break="no" facs="nls:193193956"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0704-3956-0357"/>capable of submitting to it in this manner. With
                    regard to the subjects of baptism, the Baptists say that this ordinance ought
                    not to be administered to children or infants at all, nor to grown up persons in
                    general; but to adults only of a certain character and description. Our
                    Saviour’s commission to his apostles, by which Christian baptism was instituted,
                    is to go and teach all nations, baptizing them; that is, say they, not to
                    baptize all they meet with, but first to instruct them, to teach all nations, or
                    to preach the gospel to every creature, and whoever receives it, him to baptize
                    in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost. To such
                    persons, and to such only, baptism appears to have been administered by the
                    apostles and the immediate disciples of Christ. They are described as repenting
                    of their sins, as believing in Christ, and as having gladly received the word.
                    Peter acquaints those who were converted by his sermon, that without these
                    qualifications he could not have admitted them to baptism; Philip holds the same
                    language in his discourse with the Ethiopian eunuch; and Paul treats Lydia, the
                    jailer, and others, in the same manner. Without these qualifications Christians
                    in general think it wrong to admit persons to the Lord’s supper; and for the
                    same reasons, without these qualifications, or at least a profession of them,
                    the Baptists think it wrong to admit any to baptism. Wherefore they withhold it,
                    not only from the impenitently vicious and profane, and from infidels, who have
                    no faith, but also from infants and children, who have no knowledge, and are
                    incapable of every action civil and religious. They further insist that all
                    positive institutions depend entirely upon the will and declaration of the
                    founder; wherefore, that reasoning by analogy from abrogated Jewish rites is to
                    be rejected, and the express commands of Christ respecting the mode and subjects
                    of baptism ought to be our only rule.</p>
                <p>The Baptists in England form one of the denominations of Protestant dissenters.
                    They separate from the establishment for the same reasons as their brethren of
                    the other denominations do; and an additional motive is derived from their
                    particular tenets respecting baptism. The constitution of their churches, and
                    their mode of worship, is congregational or independent; and in the exercise of
                    it they are protected, in common with other dissenters, by the act of
                    toleration. Before this act they were liable to pains and penalties as
                    nonconformists, and often for their peculiar sentiments as Baptists. A
                    proclamation was in fact issued out against them, and some of them were burnt in
                    Smithfield in 1538. They bore a considerable share in the persecutions of the
                    seventeenth and preceding centuries, and, as it should seem, in those of even an
                    earlier date; for among the Lollards and the followers of Wickliffe there were
                    several who disapproved of infant baptism, and there were many of this
                    persuasion among the Protestants and reformers abroad. In Holland, Germany, and
                    the North, they went by the names of Anabaptists and Mennonites; and, in
                    Piedmont and the south, they were found among the Albigenses and Waldenses.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Baptists</hi> subsist under two denominations; the
                    Particular or Calvinistical, and the General or Arminian. The former is by far
                    the most numerous. Some of both denominations allow of <hi rend="italic">mixed
                    communion,</hi> that is, with persons who have been sprinkled in their infancy,
                    and therefore unbaptized in the view of the Baptists. Others, again, disallow
                    it; and a few of them observe the seventh day of the week as the Sabbath,
                    apprehending the law that enjoined it not to have been repealed by Christ or his
                    <hi rend="superscript"> a</hi> P°stles. But a difference of opinion respecting
                    these and θtrer matters is not peculiar to the Baptists, being common to all
                    Christians, and to all bodies of men who think and judge for themselves.</p>
