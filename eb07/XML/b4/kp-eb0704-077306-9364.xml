                <p><label type="entry">BOOK</label>, the general name of almost every literary
                    composition, but, in a more limited sense, applied only to such compositions as
                    are large enough to make a volume.</p>
                <p>Several sorts of materials were formerly used in making books. Plates of lead and
                    copper, the bark of trees, bricks, stone, and wood, were the substances
                    anciently employed to engrave such things upon as men were willing to have
                    transmitted to posterity. Josephus speaks of two columns, the one of stone and
                    the other of brick, on which the children of Seth wrote their inventions and
                    astronomical discoveries; and Porphyry mentions some pillars preserved in Crete,
                    on which the ceremonies observed by the Corybantes in their sacrifices were
                    recorded. Hesiod’s works were originally written upon tablets of lead, and
                    deposited in the temple of the Muses, in Boeotia; the ten commandments delivered
                    to Moses were written upon stone; and the laws of Solon were inscribed upon
                    wooden planks. Tables of wood, box, and ivory, were common among the ancients;
                    but when of wood, they were latterly covered with wax, and the letters traced in
                    the soft matter of the coating by means of a pointed style, so that writing in
                    this fashion might be exactly executed, and as easily obliterated. The leaves of
                    the palm-tree were afterwards used instead of wooden planks; and also the finest
                    and thinnest part of the bark of such trees as the lime, the ash, the maple, and
                    the elm; whence comes the word <hi rend="italic">liber</hi><hi rend="italic
                    subscript"> i</hi> which literally signifies the inner bark of a tree. And as
                    these barks were rolled up, in order to be removed with greater ease, the rolls
                    were called <hi rend="italic">volumxn,</hi> a volume; a name afterwards given to
                    the like rolls of paper or parchment.</p>
                <p>Thus we find books were first written on stones, as the decalogue of Moses; then
                    on the parts of plants, as leaves, chiefly of the palm-tree, the rind and barks,
                    especially of <pb break="no" facs="nls:193199377" xml:id="kp-eb0704-9377-0774"
                    />the tilia, or phillyrea, and the Egyptian papyrus. By degrees wax came to be
                    used; then leather, especially the skins of goats and sheep, of which at length
                    parchment was prepared; then lead was employed; then linen, silk, and horn; and
                    lastly paper itself.</p>
                <p>The first books were in the form of blocks and tablets; but when flexible matter
                    came into use it was found more convenient to make books in the form of rolls,
                    which were composed of several sheets fastened to each other, and rolled upon a
                    stick, or <hi rend="italic">umbilicus;</hi> the whole forming a kind of column
                    or cylinder, which was managed by the umbilicus as a handle. The outside of the
                    volume was called <hi rend="italic">frons,</hi> and the ends of the umbilicus
                    <hi rend="italic">cornua;</hi> which were usually carved, and adorned with
                    silver, ivory, or even gold and precious stones. The title, c <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ,</hi> υλλα⅛os, was struck on the outside; and the whole
                    volume, when extended, might be about a yard or more in width, and fifty in
                    length. The form which obtains among us is the square, composed of separate
                    leaves; and it was also known, though little used, by the ancients.</p>
                <p>To the form of books belongs also the internal economy, embracing the order and
                    arrangement of points and letters into lines and pages, with margins and other
                    accessories. This has undergone many varieties. At first the letters were
                    divided only into lines; then into separate words; and these, by degrees, were
                    noted with accents, and distributed, by points and stops, into periods,
                    paragraphs, chapters, and other divisions. In some countries, as among the
                    orientals, the direction of the lines was from right to left; in others, as
                    among the northern and western nations, from left to right; while the early
                    Greeks followed both directions, writing alternately from right to left and from
                    left to right, which was called <hi rend="italic">boustrophedon,</hi> from its
                    analogy to the path of oxen in ploughing. In most countries the lines run from
                    one side to the other; in some, particularly among the Chinese, their direction
                    is from top to bottom. The Egyptian monumental writing, or hieroglyphics, is
                    arranged in all these directions, and in several peculiar to itself. Sometimes
                    we find it proceeding from right to left; sometimes from left to right; very
                    frequently from top to bottom, in regular parallel columns; in a few instances,
                    and but a few, <hi rend="italic">boustrophedon;</hi> occasionally arranged in
                    groups or clusters, as in anaglyphs; and, where the space was irregular, as on
                    the sides of obelisks, disposed in an arbitrary manner, varying according to the
                    circumstances. But this total Avant of system, or rather this mode of arranging
                    the characters upon all systems and in all ways, can never be productive of any
                    difficulty or ambiguity, as the disposition and true sequence of the writing is
                    in every case clearly and almost intuitively indicated by the direction given to
                    the principal figures, more especially to those which represent animals, or the
                    human form. With regard to the other modes of writing practised by the ancient
                    Egyptians, that called the hieratic follows to a certain extent the varieties of
                    the hieroglyphic; but the demotic, enchorial, or civil form, is generally
                    disposed from right to left, in the ordinary manner of oriental writing.</p>
                <p>Of the scarcity and value of books during the seventh and subsequent centuries,
                    the following curious account is given by Mr Warton :—</p>
                <p>“1owards the close of the seventh century,” says this writer, “even in the papal
                    library at Rome, the number of books was so inconsiderable, that Pope Saint
                    Martin requested Sanctamund, bishop of Maestricht, if possible, to supply this
                    defect from the remotest parts of Germany. In the year 855 Lupus, abbot of
                    Ferrières, in France, sent two of his monks to Pope Benedict III. to beg a copy
                    of <hi rend="italic">Cicero de Oratore,</hi> and Quintilian’s Institutes, and
                    some other books: <hi rend="superscript"> i</hi> for, says the abbot, <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ζ</hi> although we have part of these books, yet there is no
                    whole or complete copy of them in all France.’ Albert, abbot of Gemblours,' who
                    with incredible labour and immense expense had collected a hundred volumes on
                    theological, and fifty on profane subjects, imagined he had formed a splendid
                    library. About the year 790 Charlemagne granted an unlimited right of hunting to
                    the abbot and monks of Sithin, for making their gloves and girdles of the skins
                    of the deer they killed, and covers for their books. We may imagine that these
                    religious were more fond of hunting than reading. It is certain that they were
                    obliged to hunt before they could read; and at least it is probable that, under
                    these circumstances, and of such materials, they did not manufacture many
                    volumes. At the beginning of the tenth century books were so scarce in Spain,
                    that one and the same copy of the bible, Saint Jerome’s Epistles, and some
                    volumes of ecclesiastical offices and martyrologies, often served several
                    different monasteries. Among the constitutions given to the monks of England by
                    Archbishop Lanfranc, in the year 1072, the following injunction occurs. At the
                    beginning of Lent the librarian is ordered to deliver a book to each of the
                    religious: a whole year was allowed for the perusal of this book, and at the
                    returning Lent those monks who had neglected to read the books they had
                    respectively received are commanded to prostrate themselves before the abbot,
                    and to supplicate his indulgence. This regulation was partly occasioned by the
                    low state of literature which Lantranc found in the English monasteries. But at
                    the same time it was a matter of necessity, and is in a great measure to be
                    referred to the scarcity of copies of useful and suitable authors. In an
                    inventory of the goods of John de Pontissara, bishop of Winchester, contained in
                    his capital palace of Wulvesey, all the books which appear are nothing more than
                    <hi rend="italic">Septendecim sp&gt;ecies librorum de diversis scientiis.</hi>
                    This Avas in the year 1294. The same prelate, in the year 1299, borrows of his
                    cathedral convent of St SAvithin at Winchester, <hi rend="italic">Bibliam bene
                    glossatam;</hi> that is, the bible Avith marginal annotations, in two large
                    folio volumes; but gives a bond for due return of the loan, drawn up with great
                    solemnity. This bible had been bequeathed to the convent the same year by
                    Pontissara’s predecessor, Bishop Nicholas de Ely; and in consideration of so
                    important a bequest, that is, <hi rend="italic">pro bona Biblia dicti episcopi
                    bene glossata,</hi> and one hundred merks in money, the monks founded a daily
                    mass for the soul of the donor. When a single book Avas bequeathed to a friend
                    or relation, it was seldom Avithout many restrictions and stipulations. If any
                    person gave a book to a religious house, he believed that so valuable a donation
                    merited eternal salvation; and he offered it on the altar Avith great ceremony.
                    The most formidable anathemas Avere peremptorily denounced against those <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">av1io</hi> should dare to alienate a book presented to the
                    cloister or library of a religious house. The prior and convent of Rochester
                    declare that they will every year pronounce the irrevocable sentence of
                    damnation on him who shall purloin or conceal a Latin translation of Aristotle’s
                    Physics, or even obliterate the title. Sometimes a book Avas given to a
                    monastery on condition that the donor should have the use of it during his life;
                    and sometimes to a private person, with the reservation that he who receives it
                    should pray for the soul of his benefactor. The gift of a book to Lincoln
                    Cathedral by Bishop Repingdon, in the year 1422, occurs in this form, and under
                    these curious circumstances. The memorial is written in Latin with the bishop’s
                    own hand, which I Avill give in English, at the beginning of Peter’s Breviary of
                    the Bible. ‘ I Philip of Repyndon, late bishop of Lincoln, give this book,
                    called <hi rend="italic">Peter de Areolis,</hi> to the new library to be built
                    within the church of Lincoln; reserving<pb break="no" facs="nls:193199390"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0704-9390-0775"/> the use and possession of it to Richard Trysely,
                    clerk, canon, and prebendary, of Miltoun, in fee, and to the term of his life;
                    and afterwards to be given up and restored to the said library, or the keepers
                    of the same, for the time being, faithfully, and without delay. Written with my
                    own hand, <hi rend="smallcaps">a. d.</hi> 1422.’ When a book was bought, the
                    affair was of so much importance, that it was customary to assemble persons of
                    consequence and character, and to make a formal record that they were present on
                    this occasion. Among the royal manuscripts in the book of the Sentences of Peter
                    Lombard, an archdeacon of Lincoln has left this entry: ‘ This book of the
                    Sentences belongs to master Robert archdeacon of Lincoln, which he bought of
                    Geoffrey the chaplain, brother of Henry vicar of Northelkington, in the presence
                    of master Robert de Lee, master John of Lirling, Richard of Luda clerk, Richard
                    the almoner, the said Henry the vicar, and his clerk, and others; and the said
                    archdeacon gave the said book to God and St Oswald, and to Peter abbot of
                    Barton, and the convent of Barden.’ The disputed property of a book often
                    occasioned the most violent altercations. Many claims appear to have been made
                    to a manuscript of Matthew Paris, belonging to the last-mentioned library; in
                    which John Russel, bishop of Lincoln, thus conditionally defends or explains his
                    right of possession. ‘ If this book can be proved to be or to have been the
                    property of the exempt monastery of St Alban, in the diocese of Lincoln, I
                    declare this to be my mind, that in that case I use it at present as a loan
                    under favour of those monks who belong to the said monastery. Otherwise,
                    according to the condition under which this book came into my possession, 1 will
                    that it shall belong to the college of the blessed Winchester Mary at Oxford, of
                    the foundation of William Wykham. Written with my own hand at Buck-dane, 1st
                    Jan. <hi rend="smallcaps">a. d.</hi> 1488. Jo. Lincoln. Whoever shall obliterate
                    or destroy this writing, let him be anathema.’ About the year 1225, Roger de
                    Insula, dean of York, gave several Latin bibles to the university of Oxford,
                    with a condition that the students who perused them should deposit a cautionary
                    pledge. The library of that university, before the year 1300, consisted only of
                    a few tracts, chained or kept in chests in the choir of St Mary’s church. In the
                    year 1327 the scholars and citizens of Oxford assaulted and entirely pillaged
                    the opulent Benedictine abbey of the neighbouring town of Abingdon. Among the
                    books they found there were one hundred psalters, as many grayles, and forty
                    missals, which undoubtedly belonged to the choir of the church; but besides
                    these there were only twenty-two <hi rend="italic">codices,</hi> which 1
                    interpret books on common subjects. And although the invention of paper at the
                    close of the eleventh century contributed to multiply manuscripts, and
                    consequently to facilitate knowledge, yet, even so late as the reign of our
                    Henry VI. I have discovered the following remarkable instance of the
                    inconveniences and impediments to study, which must have been produced by a
                    scarcity of books. It is in the statutes of St Mary’s College at Oxford, founded
                    as a seminary to Oseney Abbey in the year 1446: <hi rend="superscript"> i</hi>
                    Let no scholar occupy a book in the library above one hour, or two hours at
                    most, so that others be hindered from the use of the same.’ The famous library
                    established in the university of Oxford by that munificent patron of literature
                    Humphrey duke of Gloucester, contained only 600 volumes. About the commencement
                    of the fourteenth century there were only four classics in the royal library of
                    Paris. These were one copy of Cicero, Ovid, Lucan, and Boethius. The rest were
                    chiefly books of devotion, which included but few of the fathers; many treatises
                    of astrology, geomancy, chiromancy, and medicine, originally written in Arabic,
                    and translated into Latin or French; pandects, chronicles, and romances. This
                    collection was principally made by Charles V., who began his reign in 1365. This
                    monarch was passionately fond of reading; and it was the fashion to send him
                    presents of books from every part of the kingdom of France. These he ordered to
                    be elegantly transcribed and richly illuminated; and he placed them in a tower
                    of the Louvre, from thence called <hi rend="italic">La Tour de la Libraire.</hi>
                    The whole consisted of 900 volumes. They were deposited in three chambers, which
                    on this occasion were wainscotted with Irish oak, and ceiled with cypress
                    curiously carved. The windows were of painted glass, fenced with iron bars and
                    copper wire. The English became masters of Paris in the year 1425, on which
                    event the duke of Bedford, regent of France, sent the whole library, then
                    consisting of only 853 volumes, and valued at 2223 livres, into England, where
                    perhaps they became the ground-work of Duke Humphrey’s library just mentioned.
                    Even so late as the year 1471, when Louis XI. of France borrowed the works of
                    the Arabian physician Rhasis from the faculty of medicine at Paris, he not only
                    deposited, by way of pledge, a quantity of valuable plate, but was obliged to
                    procure a nobleman to join with him as surety in a deed, by which he bound
                    himself to return it under a considerable forfeiture. Of the excessive prices of
                    books in the middle ages there are numerous and curious proofs. I will mention a
                    few only. In the year 1174 Walter, prior of St Swithin’s at Winchester,
                    afterwards elected abbot of Westminster, a writer in Latin of the lives of the
                    bishops who were his patrons, purchased of the monks of Dorchester in
                    Oxfordshire, Bede’s Homilies and St Austin’s Psalter, for twelve measures of
                    barley, and a pall, on which was embroidered in silver the history of St Birinus
                    converting a Saxon king. Among the royal manuscripts in the British Museum there
                    is Comestor’s Scholastic History in French, which, as it is recorded in a blank
                    page at the beginning, was taken from the king of France at the battle of
                    Poictiers; and being purchased by William Montague, earl of Salisbury, for 100
                    marcs, was ordered to be sold by the last will of his Countess Elizabeth for
                    forty livres. About the year 1400 a copy of John of Meun’s <hi rend="italic"
