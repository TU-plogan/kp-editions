                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra

                <p><label type="entry">BETTINÉLLI, <hi rend="smallcaps">Xavier</hi></label>, one of
                    the most celebrated Italian literati of the eighteenth century, was born at
                    Mantua on the 18th of July 1718. After studying under the Jesuits in his native
                    city and at Bologna, he entere in 1736 upon the noviciate of this society. He
                    then undertook a new course of study; and afterwards taught t e belles lettres,
                    from the year 1739 to 1744, at Brescia, <pb break="no" facs="nls:193197180"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0704-7180-0605"/>where the Cardinal Quirini, Count Mazzuchelli,
                    Count Duranti, and other scholars, formed an illustrious academy. He there began
                    to distinguish himself by some pieces of poetry, composed as scholastic
                    exercises. Being sent to Bologna to pursue his divinity, he continued, at the
                    same time, to cultivate his poetical talent, and wrote also, for the theatre of
                    the college, his tragedy of <hi rend="italic">Jonathan.</hi> The number of
                    learned and literary persons collected in this city exceeded by far what he had
                    met with at Brescia. The Institute, recently founded by the Count Marsigli, the
                    Clementine Academy of Design, the school of the astronomical poet Manfredi, the
                    growing reputation of his ingenious and learned pupils Zanotti, Algarotti, and
                    others, at this time fixed the attention of the literary world on Bologna. It
                    was in the midst of this society, to which he was admitted, that Bettinelli
                    completed his education, and attained the age of thirty. He went in 1748 to
                    Venice, where he became professor of rhetoric. He left it for various missions,
                    and returned to it often. We may see by his epistles in free verse, or <hi
                    rend="italic">sciolti,</hi> that he was connected on friendly terms with all
                    that this city and state could boast as most illustrious. He was destined by the
                    superiors of his order for the oratorical department; but the weakness of his
                    chest compelled him to relinquish it. The superintendence of the college of
                    nobles at Parma was intrusted to him in 1751; and he principally directed the
                    studies of poetry and history, and the entertainments of the theatre. He
                    remained here eight years, but not without visiting, at intervals, different
                    cities of Italy, either on the affairs of his order, or for pleasure, or for
                    health. In 1755 he undertook a longer journey, traversed part of Germany,
                    proceeded as far as Strasburg and Nancy, and returned by way of Germany into
                    Italy, taking with him two young princes, sons or nephews of the prince of
                    Hohenlohe, who had requested him to take charge of their education. He made, the
                    year following, another journeyinto France, along with the eldest of these two
                    young princes, and lodged, while at Paris, at the College of Louis le Grand. It
                    was during this excursion that he wrote the famous <hi rend="italic">Letters of
                    Virgil,</hi> which were published at Venice with his <hi rend="italic"
                    >sciolti</hi> verses, and those of Frugoni and Algarotti. The opinions, and we
                    may add without much hesitation, the literary heresies, maintained in these
                    letters against the two great luminaries of Italian poetry, and particularly
                    against Dante, created him many enemies, and, what was still more unpleasant to
                    him, embroiled him with Algarotti. Willing to know something more of France than
                    Paris, he made several excursions into Normandy and other provinces; he went
                    also into Lorraine, to the court of King Stanislaus, and thence proceeded to
                    Lyons, and afterwards to Geneva. Soon after his arrival he went to visit
                    Voltaire. This celebrated writer sent to his inn an edition of his works, upon
                    which he inscribed this stanza, in allusion to Bettinelll’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Letters of Virgil:</hi></p>
                <lg part="N">

                <p>From Geneva, where he consulted Tronchin the physician, Bettinelli proceeded to
                    Marseilles, from thence to Nismes, and returned by Genoa to Italy and Parma,
                    where he arrived in 1759. The same year he took a journey to Venice, and
                    afterwards to Verona, where he meant to settle. Ŗc resided here till 1767.
                    Having resumed the occupations of preaching and teaching, he, according to the
                    Chevalier Pindemonti, in his <hi rend="italic">Poesie Campestri,</hi> converted
                    the youth to God in the church, and to good taste in his own ιouse. He
                    afterwards lived for some years at Modena, and he had just been appointed
                    professor of rhetoric there, Mien, i∏ 1773 the <hi rend="subscript"> or</hi> d
                    <hi rend="subscript"> er 0</hi> f Jesuits was abolished in Italy.</p>
                <p>He then returned into his own country, where he resumed his literary labours with
                    new ardour. He there published several works, and regretting, as it appears,
                    that he had written so much in his life without having been able, till then, to
                    write any thing to please the women, perhaps in consequence of the habit which
                    he wore, he determined to make up for lost time by publishing, one after the
                    other, his <hi rend="italic">Correspondence between two Ladies,</hi> his <hi
                    rend="italic">Letters to Lesbia on Epigrams,</hi> his <hi rend="italic">Letters
                    on the Fine Arts,</hi> and, lastly, his <hi rend="italic">Twenty four Letters on
                    Love.</hi> These he published in 1796, when the war raged in all parts of Italy,
                    and when the siege laid by the French to Mantua had compelled him to leave it.
                    He retired to Verona, and there formed the most intimate friendship with the
                    Chevalier Hippolito Pindemonti, notwithstanding the disproportion of their age.
                    In 1797, after Mantua had surrendered, he returned thither. Though nearly eighty
                    years old, he resumed his labours and his customary manner of life. He began in
                    1799 a complete edition of his works, which was finished at Venice in
                    twenty-four volumes duodecimo. Arrived at the age of ninety years, he still
                    retained the gaiety and vivacity of his mind, and died on the 13th of∙September
                    1808, after fifteen days of illness, with the firmness of a philosopher and the
                    sentiments of a believer. Without giving a list of all his works, or specifying
                    the separate editions, it will be sufficient to refer to them in the order in
                    which they are placed in this last edition.</p>
                <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Ragionamenti Filosofici, con Annotaziom.</hi> These
                    philosophical discourses, which occupy the first two volumes, form a system of
                    religious morality, in which the author endeavours to exhibit man under all his
                    relations, and in all states, following the order of the sacred writings, and
                    treating, first, of man as created, as reasonable, as lord of the other
                    creatures, and in all the different states of solitude, society, innocence,
                    error, repentance, &amp;c. He only finished ten of these discourses. The notes
                    arc themselves little philosophical treatises on beauty in general, on beauty of
                    expression, on physiognomy, &amp;c.</p>
                <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Dell</hi> ’ <hi rend="italic">Entusiasmo delle Belle
                    Arti,</hi> two volumes, in three parts, of which the last is an appendix to the
                    two others, and treats of the history of enthusiasm in different nations, and
                    the influence which climates, governments, and all the modifications of society,
                    have had on enthusiasm. In the first two parts the author, who was not very
                    subject to enthusiasm, sometimes writes a little obscurely on it, becomes turgid
                    when he endeavours to be sublime, and remains a stranger to the warmth which he
                    affects.</p>
                <p>3. <hi rend="italic">Dialoghi d' Amore,</hi> 2 vols. The object of the author is
                    to point out the influence which the imagination, vanity, friendship, marriage,
                    honour, the love of glory, the study of the sciences, and fashion, have on the
                    passion of love; and afterwards to trace the influence which it exercises on the
                    productions of the arts of genius, and of the dramatic arts in particular. The
                    last dialogue, which is entitled <hi rend="italic">On Love and on Petrarch,</hi>
                    is followed by the <hi rend="italic">Eulogy of Petrarch,</hi> one of the
                    author’s best pieces.</p>
                <p>4. <hi rend="italic">Risorgimento negli Study, nelle Arti e nd Costumi dopo il
                    Mille,</hi> 3 vols.; a work regarded in Italy as superficial, but which,
                    nevertheless, contains some enlightened sentiments, and in which facts are often
                    presented under a philosophical point of view, which is not destitute either of
                    novelty or justness.</p>
                <p>5. <hi rend="italic">Delle Lettere e delle Arti Mantouane: Lettere ed Arti
                    Modenesi,</hi> 1 vol.; almost entirely filled with anecdotes of literary
                    history, tending to the glory of Mantua, the country of the author.</p>
                <p>6. <hi rend="italic">Lettere dieci di Virgilio agli Arcadi,</hi> 1 vol. These
                    letters, which have been translated into French by Μ. de Pommereul, Paris, 1778,
                    are, of all the works of Bettinelli, <pb break="no" facs="nls:193197193"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0704-7193-0606"/>that which has attracted most notice. They are
                    followed in this volume by <hi rend="italic">Letters from an Englishman to a
                    Venetian,</hi> which treat somewhat vaguely on different topics of
                    literature.</p>
                <p>7. <hi rend="italic">Italian Letters from a Lady to her Friend on the Fine
                    Arts,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Letters from a Friend, copied from the
                    Originals,</hi> 3 volumes, of which the letters on the fine arts occupy only the
                    first.</p>
                <p>, 8. <hi rend="italic">Poetry,</hi> 3 vols., containing seven small poems,
                    sixteen epistles in easy verse, sonnets, canzonets, &amp;c. Without ever showing
                    himself a great poet, the author is always elegant and ingenious. These three
                    volumes are preceded by a well-written discourse on Italian poetry. Several of
                    the epistles and smaller poems are seasoned with Attic salt. Such is the poem in
                    four cantos entitled <hi rend="italic">Le Pac-colte,</hi> in which Bettinelli
                    very happily turns into ridicule those insipid collections of verses which in
                    his time appeared on every occasion in Italy.</p>
                <p>9. <hi rend="italic">Tragedies,</hi> 2 vols. These tragedies are <hi
                    rend="italic">Xerxes, Jonathan, Demetrius Poliorcetes,</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">Pome Delivered,</hi> a translation from Voltaire. Prefixed to them
                    are some letters written in French, and a discourse in Italian on the Italian
                    tragedy. Some letters on tragedy, among others one on the tragedies of Alfieri,
                    follow; and the second of these two volumes concludes with a eulogy on Father
                    Granelli, a Jesuit, a preacher, and a poet, author of some tragedies, which are
                    in much esteem, particularly for the elegance and beauty of the style.</p>
                <p>10. <hi rend="italic">Lettere a Lesbia Cidonia sopra gli Epigrammi,</hi> 2 vols.
                    consisting of twenty-five letters, intermixed with epigrams, madrigals, and
                    other light pieces, translated and original.</p>
                <p>11. Lastly, an <hi rend="italic">Essay on Eloquence,</hi> to which are added,
                    some letters, discourses, and other miscellanies. It would be hazardous to
                    pronounce a judgment on so great a diversity of productions. It should seem, in
                    general, that the author is distinguished more for wit and talent than for
                    warmth and genius; that his writings contain literary opinions dictated by a
                    taste not always correct, and which, having been publicly declared early in
                    life, have often reduced the author to the unpleasant dilemma, either of
                    retracting, or of persisting, in spite of his better judgment, in what he must
                    have perceived to be the errors of his youth; that his philosophy, of which the
                    morality is pure, wants, when it aspires to metaphysical questions, both
                    determinate principles and just conclusions, and is too often verbose and
                    declamatory; but that, though his ideas are not always entitled to praise, his
                    style is so almost always; that having been to blame, according to the Italian
                    critics, in paying too little respect to the great writers of the fourteenth
                    century, he has the merit of having remained constantly attached to those of the
                    sixteenth, and to the authors who were his contemporaries, and who have taken
                    him for their guide; and also of having defended to the last, both by his
                    opinions and his example, the finest of the modern languages against the
                    corruption which threatens, or rather which overwhelms, it on all sides. See <hi
