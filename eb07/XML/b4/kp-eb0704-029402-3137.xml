                    rend="italic">loaf-bread,</hi> which is white, soft, ull of cavities, has an

                <p><hi rend="subscript"> t</hi> 1. Like most of the arts of primary importance, its
                    origin precedes the period of history, and is involved in the obscurity of the
                    early ages of the world. There is no evidence from Scripture that Abraham was
                    acquainted with the method of making loaf-bread. Cakes and unleavened bread are
                    repeatedly mentioned as made by him, but no notice is taken of loaf-bread. We
                    are certain that it was known in the time of Moses, as in the Jewish law there
                    is a prohibition against making use of it during the celebration of the
                    passover. (Exodus, chap. xii. verse 15.) Egypt, both from the nature of the
                    country and the early period of its civilization, seems very likely to have been
                    the place where this art was first practised. The Chaldeans, however, put in a
                    claim. They were civilized nearly as early as the Egyptians, and they were
                    celebrated<pb break="no" facs="nls:193193150" xml:id="kp-eb0704-3150-0295"/>
                    among the ancients for the excellence of their bread. The Greeks assure us that
                    they were taught the art of making bread by the god Pan. This lively and
                    superstitious people ascribed almost all the important arts of common life to
                    their gods; or rather, perhaps, their gratitude induced them to deify the
                    authors of these most useful inventions. Bakers were unknown in Rome till the
                    year of the city 580, or about 200 years before the commencement of the
                    Christian era. They settled in that city during the war with Perseus, King of
                    Macedon. (Plinii <hi rend="italic">Hist. Nat.</hi> xviii. 11.) It was then that
                    the Romans became acquainted with the refinements of the Greeks, and that their
                    capital became crowded with adventurers of all kinds, with artists and
                    philosophers, from the prolific soil of Achaia. Before this period the Romans
                    were often distinguished or reproached by the appellation of the <hi
                    rend="italic">pulse-eating nation.</hi></p>
                <p>Since the introduction of bakers into Rome, the art of making bread has always
                    been practised in the south of Europe. But it made its way into the north very
                    slowly; and even at present, in the northern countries of Europe and Asia,
                    loaf-bread is seldom used except by the higher classes of inhabitants. In
                    Sweden, for example, you see rolls frequently in the towns, but never loaves.
                    Göttenburg is a town containing about 23,000 inhabitants. In the year 1812 it
                    was crowded with merchants from all parts of Europe, being the great connecting
                    link between Britain and the Continent. Towards the end of that year the captain
                    of an English packet ordered a Göttenburg baker to bake for him a quantity of
                    bread, amounting to L.l sterling in value. The baker was confounded at so great
                    an order, and refused to comply till the captain gave him security that he would
                    carry off and pay for the loaves, declaring that he could never dispose of so
                    great a quantity of bread in Göttenburg if it were left upon his hand. In the
                    country part of Sweden you meet with nothing but rye-cakes, as hard nearly as
                    flint, and which are only baked twice a year. About thirty years ago loaf-bread
                    was almost as rare in the country places and villages of Scotland, <hi
                    rend="italic">barley bannocks</hi> and <hi rend="italic">oaten cakes</hi>
                    constituting the universal substitutes among almost all ranks. But the case is
                    wonderfully altered at present. At that time no wheat was raised in the fertile
                    valley of Strath-earn; and the village of Crieff, the largest in that valley,
                    with a population of nearly 3000 persons, contained only two bakers, who could
                    scarcely find employment. At present it contains five or six, and each has a
                    brisk trade.</p>
                <p>In many parts of England it is the custom for private families to bake their own
                    bread. This is particularly the case in Kent, and in some parts of Lancashire.
                    In the year 1804 the town of Manchester, with a population of 90,000 persons,
                    did not contain a single public baker. We do not know whether or not it contains
                    any at present.</p>
                <p>2. 1he only substance adapted for making loaf-bread is the flour of wheat, a
                    grassy plant, distinguished among botanists by the name of <hi rend="italic"
                    >triticum.</hi> This plant is cultivated perhaps over a greater extent of the
                    globe than any other, and, like man, it seems to adapt itself to almost every
                    climate. We have seen excellent crops of it raised m north latitude 60°. It is
                    cultivated in the East Indies, considerably within the limits of the torrid
                    zone; and, in ,. <hi rend="superscript"> le n</hi> °rth of Hindostan, it
                    constitutes a chief article in the θod of the inhabitants. The original <hi
                    rend="italic">habitat</hi> of this plant is unknown. We know, however, that it
                    improves consi-θ <hi rend="superscript"> r</hi> ably in Rs quality as we advance
                    south. The wheat θ Essex and. Kent brings a much higher price than the cat
                    raised in East Lothian and Berwickshire. French <hi rend="superscript"> λ</hi>
                    eat is superior to that of England. The Italians have <hi rend="superscript">
                    e</hi> superiority over the French in their wheaten crops, <hi
                    rend="superscript"> n</hi> perhaps the best wheat of all is raised in Barbary
                    and Egypt. Mr Bruce found wheat growing wild in Abyssinia; and, in his opinion,
                    that kingdom is the native country of the plant. It would seem to be originally
                    an African plant, since it thrives best in Barbary and Egypt; and perhaps the
                    mountains of Abyssinia, though within the torrid zone, may not differ much in
                    point of climate from the more northern plains of Egypt. In India the plant
                    seems to have deteriorated. It is always dwarfish, and the crop, we have been
                    told, is less abundant than in more northern climates.</p>
                <p>3. The culture of the different varieties of wheat, as practised in this country,
                    and the method of grinding and fitting the flour for the baker, being foreign to
                    the present subject, we cannot with propriety touch upon them. It may be
                    sufficient to say, that originally in England the baker was his own
                    manufacturer. He purchased his own wheat, and got it ground as he wanted it. At
                    that period the miller separated the wheat into three portions; namely, flour,
                    pollard, and bran. The bran was the outside of the grain. It was not used as
                    food at all, or only given to horses. The pollard was the portion of the grain
                    next the husk; it was coarser and darker coloured than the flour, which
                    constituted the interior or central portion of the grain. This flour, at an
                    average, amounted to three fourths of the wheat ground. But, by insensible
                    degrees, the manufacture of bread became separated into two distinct
                    employments; that of the mealman, who ground the wheat and sold the flour, and
                    that of the baker, who converted it into bread. The mealman made different kinds
                    of flour, some extremely fine and white, while others were very coarse and
                    unpalatable. This white flour, when made into bread, was so pleasing to the eye
                    and the taste, that it gradually got into general use, and the people refused to
                    purchase the bread made of the whole of the flour. At present, in the mills in
                    the neighbourhood of London, wheat is divided into no fewer than seven distinct
                    kinds of flour. The following are the average proportions of these obtained from
                    a quarter of wheat :—</p>

                <p>Thus we see that wheat almost doubles in bulk by being ground into flour.</p>
                <p>During the bolting of the wheat there is a fine white gritty substance, called
                    <hi rend="italic">sharps,</hi> obtained. It constitutes the centre and finest
                    part of the grain of wheat. This is partly sold to the biscuit-makers, and is
                    employed in baking the finest kind of sea-biscuit. It is partly ground again,
                    and constitutes the finest and most valuable kind of flour.</p>
                <p>4. The bakers in Great Britain at present are restricted by act of parliament to
                    bake only three kinds of bread, namely, <hi rend="italic">wheaten, standard
                    wheaten,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">household.</hi> The first must be marked
                    with a W, the second with S W, and the third with H; and the baker who neglects
                    to mark them in this manner is liable to a penalty. The wheaten loaf is made of
                    the finest flour, the standard wheaten of the whole flour mixed together, and
                    the household of the coarser flour. The loaves baked are usually peck loaves,
                    half-peck, and quartern loaves; the weights of which, provided they be weighed
                    within forty-eight hours of the time of baking, must be as follows ;—</p>

                <p>From this it appears that the average loss of the quartern loaf in weight by
                    baking is 9į ounces, or not quite so much as one seventh of the whole. From the
                    experiments of Tillet and the other French commissioners who were appointed to
                    examine the subject in 1783 (in consequence of an opinion prevailing in Paris
                    that the bakers did not give the full weight, while these tradesmen declared
                    that they put the proper quantity of flour in the loaves), it appears that the
                    French loaf loses a considerably greater weight in the oven. A loaf which, when
                    put into the oven, weighed 4*625 lbs., when taken out of the oven weighed at an
                    average only 3∙813 lbs., or 0*812 lb. less than at first. This amounts to
                    somewhat more than one sixth, or very nearly to y⅜ths of the whole. This greater
                    loss is chiefly owing to the difference between the shape of the English and
                    French loaf. The English has nearly a cubic form, while the French loaf is very
                    long and slender. For it is obvious that the loaf which presents the greatest
                    surface must lose most weight in the oven.</p>
                <p>The French commissioners, however, found that this loss of weight was by no means
                    uniform, even with respect to those loaves which were in the oven at the same
                    time, of the same shape, in the same place, and which were put in and taken out
                    at the same instant. The greatest difference in these circumstances amounted to
                    0*2889 or 7*5 parts in the hundred, which is about <hi rend="subscript">
                    τ</hi><hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi><hi rend="subscript"> 7</hi> th part of the
                    whole. According to this rate, we may suppose that an English quartern loaf,
                    when taken out of the oven, may vary in weight ⅛th part, which amounts to rather
                    more than ounces. So that the law which subjects the baker to a penalty if his
                    bread weighs one ounce less than it ought to do, seems too severe, and must have
                    a tendency to injure the goodness of the bread, by making the baker more
                    solicitous about the weight than the quality of his loaf. To this we ascribe in
                    part the badness of the London bread in general, compared with the bread in
                    other places, particularly in Edinburgh, where it is remarkably good. But there
                    are other causes for this deterioration of the London bread<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>In London, where the goodness of bread is
                    estimated entirely by its whiteness, it is usual with those bakers who employ
                    flour of an inferior quality to add as much alum as common salt to the dough;
                    or, in other words, the quantity of salt added is diminished one half, and the
                    deficiency supplied by an equal weigh of alum. This improves the look of the
                    bread very much, rendering it much whiter and firmer.</p></note>, which we
                    believe to be of recent date. These we shall notice hereafter.</p>
                <p>5. A sack of flour weighing 280 lbs. and containing five bushels, is supposed
                    capable of being baked into 80 loaves in the acts of Parliament regulating the
                    assize upon bread. According to this estimate, one fifth of the loaf consists of
                    water and salt, the remaining four fifths of flour. But the fact is, that the
                    number of quartern loaves which can be made from a sack of flour depends
                    entirely on the goodness of that article. Good flour requires more water than
                    bad flour, and old flour more than new flour. Sometimes 82, 83, or even 86
                    loaves, may be made out of a sack, sometimes scarcely 80.</p>
                <p>6. Let us now proceed to give a short description of the mode of baking as
                    practised in Great Britain.</p>
                <p>The bakehouse ought to be a large room. On one side should be erected a dresser
                    with suitable shelves above it; on another side a kneading-trough, about seven
                    feet long, three feet high, two feet and a half broad at top, and nineteen
                    inches at bottom, with a sluice-board to pen the dough up at one end, and a lid
                    to shut down like that of a box. On a third side should be a copper capable of
                    holding three or four pailfuls of water, with a fire-place to warm the liquid.
                    The oven of course occupies the fourth side. It is a square apartment, about
                    three or four feet high, with an arched circular roof and a brick or stone
                    floor, and furnished with a door which may be shut close. It is the general
                    custom to heat the oven with wood, either faggots or brushwood; but it would be
                    much more economical and cleanly to employ pit-coal for that purpose. The
                    requisite fire-place should be erected at one side of the oven, and the heat may
                    be easily communicated by making the flue wind round the oven. This fire may
                    also be employed to heat the copper and the water in it, which would save an
                    additional fire, or spare the baker the disagreeable necessity of heating the
                    copper in the oven itself, which is pretty generally practised in London. We are
                    persuaded that an oven constructed upon this principle would save the baker a
                    considerable annual expense, which for many years past has been continually
                    increasing. Indeed it is obvious that the price of wood must keep pace with the
                    augmentation of the population and wealth of the country.</p>
                <p>The temperature to which the oven must be raised to fit it for baking bread is
                    450°. <hi rend="italic">{Encyclop. Method, des Arts et des Metiers,</hi> i.
                    275.) The bakers do not employ a thermometer; but they reckon the oven
                    sufficiently heated when flour thrown on the floor of it becomes very soon black
                    without taking fire.</p>
                <p>Let us suppose that a baker is going to convert a sack of flour into loaves. He
                    pours the flour into the kneading-trough, and then sifts it through a fine wire
                    sieve, which makes it lie very light, and serves to separate any impurities with
                    which the flour may be mixed. An ounce of alum <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> is
                    then dissolved over the fire in a tin pot, and the solution poured into a large
                    tub, called by bakers <hi rend="italic">the seasoning tub.</hi> Four pounds and
                    a half of salt are likewise put into the tub, and a pailful of hot water. When
                    this mixture'has cooled down to the temperature of 84°, three English pints of
                    yeast are added; the whole is well mixed together, strained through the
                    seasoning sieve, emptied into a hole in the flour, and mixed up wUh the
                    requisite portion of it to the consistence of a thick batter. Some dry flour is
                    then sprinkled over the top, and it is covered up with cloths. This operation is
                    called in London <hi rend="italic">setting quarter-sponge.</hi></p>
                <p>In this situation it is left about three hours. It gradually swells and breaks
                    through the dry flour scattered on its surface. An additional pailful of warm
                    water is now added, and the dough is made up into a paste as before; then the
                    whole is covered up. This is called <hi rend="italic">settingh</hi><hi
                    rend="italic superscript"> a</hi><hi rend="italic">tf' sponge.</hi> In this
                    situation it is left about five hours.</p>
                <p>Three pailfuls of warm water are now added; the whole is intimately blended and
                    kneaded upwards of an hour. The dough is then cut out in pieces with a knife,
                    thrown over the sluice-board, and penned to one side of the trough. Some dry
                    flour is sprinkled over it, and it is left in this state for four hours. It is
                    then kneaded again for half an hour. The dough is now cut into pieces, and
                    weighed in order to furnish the requisite quantity for each loaf; four pounds
                    fifteen ounces being allowed for every quartern loaf. The method of moulding the
                    dough <pb break="no" facs="nls:193193176" xml:id="kp-eb0704-3176-0297"/>into a
                    loaf can scarcely be described, and can only be ’ learned by ocular inspection.
                    The loaves are left in the oven about two hours and a half. When taken out, they
                    are carefully covered up, to prevent as much as possible the loss of weight.
                    .</p>
                <p>The above description applies only to the mode of baking as practised in London.
                    No doubt, slight differences exist in different countries. The French loaf,
                    which is baked in a pan, requires obviously a different process from the English
                    loaf, and it is kept a longer time in the oven.</p>
                <p>Alum is not added by all bakers. The writer of this article has been assured by
                    several bakers of respectability, both in Edinburgh and Glasgow, on whose
                    testimony he relies, and who made excellent bread, that they never employed any
                    alum. The reason for adding it, given by the London bakers, is, that it renders
                    the bread whiter, and enables them to separate readily the loaves from each
                    other. This addition has been alleged by medical men, and is considered by the
                    community at large, as injurious to the health, by occasioning constipation; but
                    if we consider the small quantity of this salt added by the baker, not quite
                    5ļ-grains to a quartern loaf, we will not readily admit these allegations.
                    Suppose an individual to eat the seventh part of a quartern loaf a day, he would
                    only swallow eight tenths of a grain of alum, or in reality not quite so much as
                    half a grain; for one half of this salt consists of water. It seems absurd to
                    suppose that half a grain of alum swallowed at different times during the course
                    of a day should occasion constipation.</p>
                <p>7. The addition of the yeast of beer to make the dough swell is an improvement of
                    the original practice. <hi rend="italic">Leaven</hi> was used by the ancients
                    for this purpose. Hence we read in the Old Testament of <hi rend="italic"
                    >unleavened bread,</hi> as distinguished from <hi rend="italic">loaf-bread.</hi>
                    The method of baking by means of leaven is this: A quantity of flour is made up
                    into dough with water; and this dough being set in a warm place, is left for
                    about thirty-six hours. During that period it swells considerably, and becomes
                    of a thinner consistency; in short, it undergoes a species of fermentation. It
                    has now acquired a peculiar smell and a disagreeable sour taste, and is the
                    substance known by the name of <hi rend="italic">leaveii.</hi> lf this substance
                    be mixed with a quantity of fresh dough, it occasions the whole to undergo a
                    speedy fermentation, and to swell precisely in the same manner as dough mixed
                    with yeast. Bread skilfully baked in this manner is not inferior to yeast bread;
                    but when unskilfully managed, it has a sour taste, and contains a quantity of
                    acetic acid. According to the experiments of Mr Edlin, a pound of flour, when
                    converted into leaven, contains as much acetic acid as requires 40 ‘grains of
                    carbonate of potash to neutralize it. If by carbonate he means, as is probable,
                    <hi rend="italic">bicarbonate</hi> of potash, 40.grains of it contain 21 grains
                    of potash, which require for saturation 22’ grains of acetic acid.</p>
                <p>Pliny informs us that yeast in his time was employed in Spain and Gaul as a <hi
                    rend="italic">ferment</hi> of bread. <hi rend="italic">Galliae et His-parnae

                    the Romans employed leaven to raise their bread, but that they were sensible of
                    the superiority of yeast. Leaven, however, made its way both into France and
                    Spain, and was universally employed in the manufacture of bread till towards the
                    end of the seventeenth century, when the <hi rend="superscript"> a ers</hi> °f
                    Paris began to import yeast from Flanders, and <hi rend="superscript"> 0</hi> 3

                    generally as a substitute for leaven.</p>

                    1</hi> which they are disposed to arm tķemselves against all alterations and
                    improvements. The bread by this substitution was manifestly improved both in
                    appearance and in flavour. This variation excited attention; the cause was
                    discovered; the faculty of medicine in Paris declared it prejudicial to the
                    health; the French government interfered, and the bakers were prohibited, under
                    a severe penalty, from employing yeast in the manufacture of bread.</p>
                <p>But it is in vain for governments, colleges, and universities, to oppose
                    themselves to those improvements which take place in the arts and manufactures
                    essential to civilized society. The ingenuity and perseverance of selfinterest
                    is proof against prohibitions, and contrives to elude the vigilance of the most
                    active government. The laws of Queen Elizabeth, however tyrannical and absurd,
                    did not prevent the introduction of indigo as a dye-stuff into England. Neither
                    did the authority of Louis the Fourteenth, nor the decision of the physicians,
                    deter the Parisian bakers from persisting in their improved mode of making
                    bread. The yeast m Flanders was put into sacks; the moisture was allowed to drop
                    out; and in this comparatively dry state it was carried to the capital of
                    France.</p>
                <p>The superiority of yeast bread became gradually visible to all; the decisions of
                    the medical faculty were forgotten; and the prohibition laws were allowed
                    tacitly to sink into oblivion. The new mode of baking by degrees extended itself
                    to other countries, and is now, we believe, practised everywhere. In warm
                    climates, where the yeast of beer cannot be had, other substitutes are employed,
                    which answer the same purpose. In the East Indies, bread is raised by means of
                    the liquor called <hi rend="italic">toddy,</hi> which flows out of the cocoa-nut
                    tree when its branches are cut, and which ferments so rapidly, that in two or
                    three hours it becomes an intoxicating liquor. In the West Indies <hi
                    rend="italic">dander</hi> is employed for the same purpose. This is the liquid
                    which remains in the still after the rum is distilled off, and is therefore
                    analogous to what our distillers call <hi rend="italic">spent wash.</hi> It no
                    doubt consists of a solution of unaltered sugar, prevented from fermenting by
                    the alcohol which the liquid contained before distillation, and mixed,
                    doubtless, with a quantity of yeast. In that warm climate it undergoes a very
                    speedy fermentation, and on that account answers all the purposes of yeast in
                    the baking of bread. In this country it is no uncommon thing to convert the
                    spent wash into small beer, which the workmen drink with avidity; but it only
                    undergoes this change when fermented in the usual way with yeast.</p>
                <p>8. The appearance of wheat flour is too familiar to every person to require any
                    description here. The an-, cients knew that it consisted chiefly of a substance
                    called <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi><hi rend="italic">starch,</hi> which, as
                    Pliny informs us, was first separated <hi rend="superscript">:</hi> from wheat
                    by the inhabitants of the island of Chio; and in his time the starch of Chio was
                    considered as the best and lightest, because it was made from wheat which was
                    not ground. <hi rend="italic">(Hist. Nat.</hi> xviii. 7.) This is the mode still
                    followed by the manufacturers of starch, and is no doubt the reason why the
                    other constituents of wheat were so long in being discovered. About the year
                    1728 Beccaria, an Italian philosopher, discovered another constituent of wheat,
                    to which the name of <hi rend="italic">gluten</hi> has been given. His method of
                    obtaining it was this: He took a quantity of flour, and formed it into dough
                    with water; this dough he kneaded continually between his fingers, while a small
                    stream of water dropt upon it. He continued the kneading as long as the water
                    ran off milky. By this process, the whole of the starch was washed away, and
                    there remained in his hand a gray-coloured, elastic, and very adhesive
                    substance, which was the gluten. (Cb∕- <hi rend="italic">lect. Academ-</hi>
                    partie étrang. x. 1.) No other grain besides wheat contains gluten in any
                    considerable quantity. Traces of it may be discovered in barley. But the gluten
                    of <pb break="no" facs="nls:193193189" xml:id="kp-eb0704-3189-0298"/>barley
                    cannot be separated by washing. It is obtained by solution in water; for gluten
                    is soluble in a small proportion in cold water. But when that liquid is heated
                    to 120° or 130° the gluten coagulates, and falls down in graycoloured flocks. By
                    this method gluten may likewise be discovered in the leaves of many trees.</p>
                <p>The water employed to wash out the starch soon deposits that substance in the
                    form of a white powder. If this water be now filtered, evaporated to a small
                    quantity, filtered again to separate the coagulated gluten, clarified with white
                    of egg, and then evaporated to the consistence of a syrup, it deposits,
                    according to Mr Edlin, crystals of sugar in four-sided prisms, with dihedral
                    summits. (Edlin <hi rend="italic">On Bread Making,</hi> p. 49.) If this
                    experiment be correct, wheat contains a portion of common sugar. But we have
                    great doubts respecting it. We scarcely believe it possible to obtain in regular
                    crystals the very small quantity of sugar that must be contained in a pound of
                    wheat by the process described by Mr Edlin, for he merely set the syrup aside to
                    crystallize in a cool place. Common sugar thus treated would concrete into a
                    hard mass, but would not crystallize. We believe that wheat flour contains a
                    portion of saccharine matter, but it is a species different from common sugar.
                    We have never, indeed, made any experiments on the sugar of wheat, but we have
                    made a great many on the saccharine matter of barley, which we found similar in
                    its properties to the sugar into which starch is converted by being long boiled
                    in very dilute sulphuric acid. There is every reason to believe that the sugar
                    in wheat is similar to that in barley. Now the sugar in barley crystallizes in
                    spheres similar to candied honey.</p>
                <p>9. Starch, the first, the most important, and by far the most abundant
                    constituent of wheat flour, is a white, crisp, crystalline-like substance,
                    insoluble in cold water, but forming with hot water a thick paste, which has the
                    property of gluing bodies together. If it be roasted on the fire till it assume
                    a brown colour; it becomes soluble in water, and acquires the properties of gum.
                    If it be boiled for forty-eight hours in water holding one hundredth part of its
                    weight of sulphuric acid in solution, it is dissolved and converted into a
                    species of sugar. This sugar is heavier than the starch from which it was
                    formed; the sulphuric acid remains unaltered; and no gaseous body is either
                    absorbed or emitted. Hence it has been concluded that this sugar is merely a
                    combination of starch and water, and that the acid acts only by promoting the
                    solution of the starch, without which it is incapable of uniting with water.
                    Starch is one of the most nourishing articles of food, and is undoubtedly the
                    portion of the wheat flour that renders bread so nutritive.</p>
                <p>10. The gluten, the second constituent of wheat flour, is but small in quantity
                    when compared with the starch. It is a gray substance, exceedingly elastic and
                    adhesive. It is not sensibly soluble in water after it has been collected into
                    an adhesive mass, nor does it dissolve in alcohol or ether. When dried, it
                    becomes brown and semitransparent; and when thrown on hot coals, it emits a
                    smell similar to that of burning horn. If it be put into a vessel, moist, and
                    set in a damp place, it undergoes a species of fermentation. Bubbles of gas
                    separate from it. After some days it becomes of a much thinner consistence, and
                    may then be employed to agglutinate substances together. In about ten days or a
                    fortnight it acquires exactly the smell and taste of cheese, which it resembles
                    in every thing but the colour, which is too dark. This <hi rend="italic"
                    >caseous</hi> fermentation, if the expression may be permitted, distinguishes
                    gluten from all other vegetable bodies with which we are acquainted. It is to
                    the gluten that wheat flour owes the property of being converted into
                    loaf·bread. All other grains are unfit for that purpose; but they become fit as
                    soon as we add to them a sufficient quantity of gluten, or mix them with wheat
                    flour. In this way barley, potatoes, and even turnips, may be made into very
                    good bread.</p>
                <p>11. The sugar is by far the smallest in proportion, of all the constituents of
                    wheat flour. If it be starch sugar, as we believe it to be, it possesses the
                    following properties: It does not crystallize in prisms like common sugar, but
                    assumes the form of spheres like honey. It is not so hard as common sugar,
                    neither is it so soluble in water. Its sweetening power, according to Kirchoff,
                    is to that of common sugar as 1 to 2⅜. But the most distinguishing property is,
                    that, when dissolved in water, it ferments of itself, without the addition of
                    any yeast; whereas common sugar does not undergo that process unless yeast be
                    mixed with its aqueous solution. Hence the reason why the dough of wheat flour
                    ferments, and is converted into leaven. This fermentation does not take place if
                    the saccharine matter be washed out of it by water, as Mr Edlin ascertained by
                    direct experiment. The fermentation of wheat flour is at first confined to the
                    saccharine matter. It first undergoes the vinous fermentation: here the process,
                    if possible, ought to be stopped. But as this is usually not possible, the
                    acetous fermentation commences, and vinegar is formed. Probably at last the
                    starch itself is acted on, and occasions the bad taste of ill-baked leavened
                    bread, though this is doubtful.</p>
                <p>12. As to the proportions of these three constituents, they differ so much in
                    different kinds of wheat flour, that nothing precise on the subject can be
                    determined. The greater the proportion of gluten, the better in all cases is the
                    flour. When the wheat has not fully ripened, or when it has been exposed to rain
                    while lying on the field, the gluten cannot easily be separated from the starch
                    by the process above described; nor does it form an elastic, adhesive mass, but
                    a friable substance, distantly resembling the fibrous matter of potatoes. Hence
                    the goodness of the flour may be determined by the state of the gluten. The
                    writer of this article has repeatedly applied this test to London flour, but he
                    has been always unlucky enough to find it decidedly bad. From the flour
                    furnished by two or three different bakers in different parts of the town, he
                    either was unable to obtain any gluten, or it wantee the adhesiveness which
                    characterizes the gluten of good wheat. No doubt there must be abundance of
                    excellent flour in London, but we believe (and our opinion is founded on the
                    bread, which in general is greatly inferior in goodness to the Edinburgh bread)
                    that a very considerable proportion of the flour used is bad. The inhabitants of
                    London pride themselves on the goodness of their bread, but never was any set of
                    men more mistaken, lhe London bread is indeed whiter, but, in other respects,
                    worse than any we have met with in Great Britain, except the bread baked in
                    Berwick-upon-Tweed, which is very bad, owing entirely to the unskilfulness of
                    the bakers.</p>
                <p>To furnish an idea of the proportions of the constituents of flour in good wheat,
                    we shall give the result of an analysis of Mr Edlin’s. He separated a pound
                    avoirdupois of wheat into the following ingredients:</p>

                <p>13. The yeast which is employed to ferment or raise the dough is obtained in
                    London from the brewers of ale. In Edinburgh the greater part of the yeast used
                    by the bakers is either prepared by these tradesmen themselves, or procured from
                    those who manufacture yeast on purpose to supply the bakers. Various methods and
                    various ingredients are used for this purpose; but the following method is, we
                    believe, as good as any.</p>
                <p>Add ten pounds of flour to two gallons of boiling water: stir it very well into a
                    paste. Let this mixture stand for seven hours, and then add about a quart of
                    yeast. In about six or eight hours this mixture, if kept in a warm place, will
                    have fermented, and produced as much yeast as will bake a hundred and twenty
                    quartern loaves.</p>
                <p>Yeast made in this way answers the purposes of the baker much better than
                    brewers’ yeast, because it is clearer, and free from the hop mixture, which
                    sometimes injures the yeast of the brewer. Some years ago the bakers of London,
                    sensible of the superiority of this artificial yeast, invited a company of
                    manufacturers from Glasgow to establish a manufactory of it in London, and
                    promised to use no other. About L.5000, accordingly, were laid out on buildings
                    and materials, and the manufactory was begun on a considerable scale. The
                    ale-brewers, finding their yeast, for which they had drawn a good price, he
                    heavy on their hands, invited all the journeymen bakers to their cellars, gave
                    them their full of ale, and promised to regale them in that manner every day,
                    provided they would force their masters to take all their yeast from the
                    ale-brewers. The journeymen accordingly declared in a body that they would work
                    no more for their masters unless they gave up taking yeast from the new
                    manufactory. The masters were obliged to comply; the new manufactory was
                    stopped, and the inhabitants of London were obliged to continue to eat worse
                    bread, because it was the interest of the ale-brewers to sell their yeast. Such
                    is the influence of journeymen bakers in the metropolis of England.</p>
                <p>What the substance in yeast is which induces fermentation, has not yet been
                    determined. Beer yeast may be dried, and kept in that state for a considerable
                    length of time; and if moistened again with water, it becomes capable of acting
                    again as a ferment. If it be washed in alcohol, its fermenting power is
                    destroyed. If it be kept in a moist place, it undergoes a change very similar to
                    the caseous fermentation of gluten. But yeast and gluten are distinct
                    substances; for gluten is incapable of producing the vinous fermentation. Sugar
                    of starch ferments of itself when diluted with water; and the juice of grapes
                    also ferments of its own accord, because it contains a quantity of sugar similar
                    to the sugar of starch.</p>
                <p>But, as far as baking is concerned, the knowledge of the peculiar substance which
                    occasions fermentation is not Material. The only useful purpose which
                    fermentation m dough serves, is to generate a quantity of carbonic acid gas. If
                    the dough be impregnated with this gas by any <hi rend="superscript"> 0</hi> yl
                    <hi rend="superscript"> er</hi> method, fermentation is not necessary. Mr Henry
                    or Manchester found, that if flour be kneaded into dough <hi rend="superscript">

                    baked, will constitute a very light and excellent bread.</p>
                <p>14. These examples are sufficient to explain what is called the <hi rend="italic"
                    >panary</hi> fermentation. There is, in fact, no such thing as a fermentation
                    peculiar to bread. But wheat flour contains a portion of saccharine matter,
                    which readily undergoes the vinous fermentation. During this fermentation,
                    carbonic acid gas is evolved in every part of the dough. This gas is prevented
                    from escaping by the gluten, which forms everywhere through the dough an
                    adhesive web, through which gaseous substances cannot make their way. Hence the
                    dough swells in every direction, the particles of starch are separated from each
                    other, and by the heat of the oven they are arrested in that position; so that
                    the loaf, when cut, appears full of round and oblong cavities, each of which in
                    the dough had been filled with a globule of carbonic acid gas. It is to the
                    presence of these cavities that the bread owes its lightness, its agreeable
                    taste, and its easy digestion. Even its colour is owing, in a great measure, to
                    the same cause; for when loaves of wheat flour are baked without the addition of
                    yeast, or the presence of carbonic acid, they constitute one solid,
                    dark-coloured, disagreeable-tasted mass, which has been found not only nauseous
                    to the palate, but likewise of difficult digestion. These disagreeable qualities
                    are, in a great measure, obviated by converting the dough into thin cakes, and
                    baking them rapidly on a hot iron plate over the fire. Accordingly, this is the
                    method followed when wheat flour is converted into bread without
                    fermentation.</p>
                <p>Thus, then, the theory of bread-making is completely developed. Nothing can be
                    simpler or more ingenious than the process followed by the baker. Nor ought the
                    wonderful composition of wheat flour, which adapts it so well for the
                    manufacture of bread, to be passed over in silence. Without the presence of the
                    saccharine matter, the fermentation could not be produced in it, carbonic acid
                    gas would not be evolved, and the bread would be hard, heavy, black, and
                    difficultly digestible. Without the presence of the gluten, the carbonic acid
                    would make its escape as soon as formed, and the advantages of the fermentation
                    would be lost. And, finally, without the presence of the starch in such a
                    notable proportion, the bread would neither be a palatable nor a nourishing
                    article of food. It has been supposed, indeed, that the gluten is the substance
                    which renders bread so nourishing. But we conceive this to be a mistake. In the
                    first place, its quantity, when compared with that of the starch, is trifling;
                    and, in the second place, we know from other circumstances, that starch is
                    peculiarly fitted for being the food of animals. Nearly one half of the human
                    race live almost wholly on rice, a grain which consists almost entirely of
                    starch; and the small quantity of that grain which constitutes the daily food of
                    an inhabitant of Hindostan, and which supports his life, is truly
                    astonishing.</p>
                <p>15. As no other grain except wheat flour contains these three constituents in the
                    requisite proportions, it would be in vain to attempt to convert them into bread
                    by the same process as is followed by the baker in making wheaten bread.
                    Potatoes, for example, contain no sensible quantity of saccharine matter. It
                    would be in vain, therefore, to expect them to ferment like wheat dough when
                    mixed with yeast; but we have little doubt that mashed potatoes might be made
                    into very good bread if they were kneaded with water impregnated with carbonic
                    acid gas, or still better, if, instead of common salt, the constituents of that
                    substance were added in the proper proportions, as they have been already given
                    in this article. Potatoes <pb break="no" facs="nls:193193215"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0704-3215-0300"/>contain a very great proportion of water, and when
                    boiled in water, they communicate a brown colour, and give the liquid a
                    disagreeable taste and smell.</p>
                <p>It is proper that this substance, which some have considered as of a poisonous
                    nature, should be previously removed. Einhof has given us the following
                    substances as the constituents which he found in potatoes:</p>

                <p>Dr Pearson’s analysis is somewhat similar, only he obtained a greater proportion
                    of water. Einhof found both tartaric and phosphoric acid in potatoes. The
                    fibrous matter in potatoes seems to be a peculiar modification of starch. It
                    supplies the place of the gluten in wheat flour, and gives to the paste of
                    potatoes considerable stiffness and adhesiveness. It is upon these properties
                    that we found our opinion, that if the paste of potatoes were properly
                    impregnated with carbonic acid gas, it would make a good-looking and well-tasted
                    loaf. There is, however, the less occasion for this attempt, as potatoes, when
                    properly boiled, constitute an agreeable substitute for bread without any
                    further preparation. When made into bread, they are always mixed with wheat
                    flour. A mixture of two parts flour and one potatoes makes an agreeable bread,
                    which cannot be distinguished from wheaten bread. The starch of potatoes is
                    remarkably beautiful, and goes farther than wheat starch. We have been assured,
                    that what is sold in the shops under the name of Indian arrow root, is nothing
                    else than potato starch mixed with a little gum tragacanth. It is well known
                    what an agreeable food this preparation is capable of furnishing.</p>
                <p>I. Rye is very much used as an article of food in northern countries. In Sweden
                    it constitutes almost the only bread of the common people, not baked in loaves,
                    but made up into cakes, which are usually as hard as wood. When baked into
                    loaves, it has a brown colour and a sweetish taste, which gives it a
                    considerable resemblance to gingerbread. Rye, according to the analysis of
                    Einhof, is composed of the following constituents:</p>

                <p>The saccharine matter present in this grain is p <hi rend="superscript"> r</hi>
                    obably sufficient to cause it to undergo fermentation; but the proportion of
                    gluten is very small, probably not amounting to 3 per cent. Accordingly, when
                    rye flour is washed in water, the whole of the gluten is dissolved in that
                    liqυiu. Hence it is obvious, that, in order to make good rye bread, it ought to
                    be mixed with <hi rend="italic">a</hi> quantity of wheat flour. This kind of
                    bread is very much used in the counties of Northumberland and Durham, and we
                    have no doubt that it is both palatable and nourishing. Certainly it is very
                    superior to the rye cakes used by the peasants in Sweden.</p>
                <p>We have been told that rice flour may be made into loaf-bread; but we have never
                    had an opportunity of seeing these loaves, and do not know how far they resemble
                    those of wheat flour. Rice has never been subjected to chemical analysis. We do
                    not know, therefore, what its constituents are, though there is every reason,
                    from its properties, to consider it as almost entirely composed of starch.</p>
                <p>16. Gingerbread is composed of flour, treacle, butter common potashes, and alum.
                    After the butter is melted and the potashes and alum dissolved in a little warm
                    water, these three ingredients, along with the treacle, are poured into the
                    flour which is to form the basis of the bread. The whole is then kneaded into a
                    stiff dough. The alum renders the bread crisper and lighter, and accelerates the
                    period at which the dough is fit for baking; for gingerbread dough must stand
                    over from three or four to eight or ten days before it is fit for baking. The
                    reason of this is, that the carbonic acid gas, by means of which the bread is to
                    be raised, exists in the potashes, which, so far as they are useful, consist of
                    carbonate of potash. This gas is evolved by the action of an acid on the
                    carbonate, derived chiefly from the fermentation of the treacle, and its partial
                    conversion into acetic acid. This conversion is more or less rapid in different
                    circumstances. Hence the uncertainty respecting the time when the dough becomes
                    fit for being baked.</p>
                <p>This method of making gingerbread, at present universally followed, is obviously
                    a bad one. The length of time that the dough must lie before it becomes fit for
                    baking is apt to injure its quality. The large quantity of potash used affects
                    the taste of the bread, unless it be concealed by the addition of some aromatic
                    ingredient. It would be much better, therefore, to substitute some other less
                    injurious method. Were we, for every 7∙∣∙ parts of common salt which would be
                    required for the bread, to add lθ; parts of bicarbonate of soda, and then
                    incorporate the dough with I3^ parts by weight of the common muriatic acid of
                    commerce, the carbonic acid gas evolved would be amply sufficient to render the
                    bread exceedingly light, and the dough would be immediately fit for baking,
                    while the additions thus made would be merely equivalent to the quantity of
                    common salt used in baking loaf-bread.</p>
                <p>Dr Colquhoun, in his Essay on Baking, published in the <hi rend="italic">Annals
                    of Philosophy</hi> (2d series), vol. xii. p. 276, has proposed the following
                    mode, which he found by trial to make excellent gingerbread. “Take a pound of
                    flour, a quarter of an ounce of carbonate of magnesia, and one eighth of an
                    ounce of tartaric acid. Let the butter, treacle, and aromatics, be added in the
                    same way as at present. The magnesia should be intimately mixed with the flour
                    before the latter is wetted. Dissolve the tartaric acid in a small quantity of
                    water, and pour it, together with the melted butter and treacle, into the flour.
                    Let the whole be incorporated into a mass of dough by kneading, and then set
                    aside the dough for an hour. If now baked, it makes a light, spongy, pleasant
                    bread.” The baker would accomplish the same object if he were to mix bicarbonate
                    of potash with the dough, in the proportion of four parts bicarbonate to three
                    parts tartaric acid.</p>
                <p>.17. Having now given a description of the method of baking bread, and explained
                    the nature of the process, we might here conclude this article. But it may be of
                    some utility, if we give a short statement of the principal laws which have been
                    enacted in Great Britain respecting bread, and we endeavour to lay before the
                    public the present state of the bread trade in London, and explain the abuses
                    and frauds which are practised by those concerned in it in that capital. We
                    despair of seeing these abuses rectified, but it is a great point at least to
                    make them known.</p>
                <p>In the period of English history between the Norman conquest and the reign of
                    Edward the First, the price of wheat fluctuated enormously. Thus, in the 43d
                    year of Henry the Third, it was sold for 20s. or 60s. of our money <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193193228" xml:id="kp-eb0704-3228-0301"/> a quarter.
                    Multitudes of poor people were forced to live upon the bark of trees, and upon
                    horse-flesh, and above 20,000 died in London of famine. In the same reign, as
                    appears from the statutes, the price of wheat was as low as Is. a quarter. These
                    prodigious fluctuations show the little communication at that time existing
                    between the different countries of Europe. Farming must then have been in a very
                    low state in England. When wheat was very cheap, the farmer could not dispose of
                    his crop, which lay rotting on his hands. When it was dear, there was such a
                    scarcity that he could hardly procure seed for sowing his fields, or was unable
                    to afford money to purchase it.</p>
                <p>It was conceived that these evils would be in a great measure remedied by fixing
                    the price of bread, which was accordingly done by a proclamation of King John.
                    This absurd innovation being found ineffectual, it was repealed by the <hi
                    rend="italic">statute of assize,</hi> enacted in the 51st year of Henry the
                    Third, <hi rend="smallcaps">a. d.</hi> 1267. By this law the price of bread was
                    regulated by the price of wheat, and the baker was allowed 7∣d. for baking a
                    quarter of wheat, and furnishing salt and the other ingredients which are added
                    to bread; besides the profit which accrued from the additional loaves made from
                    a quarter of wheat beyond what the statute allows. This money allowance was
                    gradually augmented to the baker in different reigns, according to the following
                    statement:</p>

                <p>This last regulation took place in the year 1798. By this act, the magistrates
                    were enjoined to set the assize from a sack of flour, instead of a quarter of
                    wheat, and to allow the baker Ils. 8d. for his expenses. The new duty on salt,
                    during the French revolutionary war, raised this sum to 12s., at which it
                    continued. By the act of parliament, the baker was supposed to make 80 quartern
                    loaves from the sack of flour; whatever greater number the sack produced was so
                    much more profit to the baker.</p>
                <p>Very particular laws were enacted, obliging the cornfactors to give in the
                    quantities and prices of the flour sold, and the bakers the quantities and
                    prices at which they bought it. Penalties were enacted to prevent false returns,
                    to prevent adulterations and improper combinations between the bakers, or the
                    corn-factors and bakers. The weight of the loaf was determined, and all loaves
                    deficient in weight one ounce, or not marked with the letters W, S W, H,
                    according to the quality of the bread, may be seized; and the baker, besides the
                    loss of his bread, is subjected to a penalty. These laws are so numerous and so
                    minute that it would be tedious to copy them. Nothing would be learned from them
                    but the amount of the penalty for each offence, varying from L.50 to Is.,
                    according to the supposed enormity of the transgression. It is the business of
                    the magistrates in towns, and of justices of the peace in the country, to
                    regulate the assize; and the price of bread is determined by the price of wheat,
                    according to a table given in one of the acts. When that price varies 6s. the
                    quarter, then the price of the loaf is varied one assize, or a halfpenny the
                    quartern loaf. Magistrates likewise may alter the price of the loaf half an
                    assize, or a farthing in the quartern loaf.</p>
                <p>Whoever considers the indecent way in which oaths are administered in English
                    courts (for it is upon the oaths of the bakers and corn-factors that the acts
                    depend for the accuracy of the returns), and the little regard paid to them by
                    merchants and manufacturers, partly in consequence of this indecency, partly in
                    consequence of their ' multiplicity, and partly on account of the many absurd
                    impediments that the legislature has thrown in the way of merehants and
                    manufacturers; whoever considers these things, will be at no loss to conclude,
                    that all these checks, and penalties, and oaths, have entirely failed in
                    producing the intended effects. In London, where the number of bakers is great,
                    and the competition in consequence ought to insure the best bread at the lowest
                    possible price, the bread-laws, by making the prices of all bakers the same,
                    have destroyed this competition; formed the bakers into a regular company,
                    having occasional meetings to consult their peculiar interest; and raised in
                    them a feeling of honour, which makes them consider it unhandsome to undersell
                    their neighbours. The price of flour is easily regulated between the bakers and
                    the corn-factors; the consequence of which regulation is, that the quartern loaf
                    is always 2d. dearer than in any other part of Great Britain. The reason
                    assigned is, that the finest flour only is employed in London, and that the
                    London bread is better than any other. The w riter of this article is well aware
                    of the contrary. The London bread is, in his opinion, nearly the worst bread in
                    Great Britain; and the flour is greatly inferior to that which is used by the
                    bakers in Edinburgh. He has frequently examined flour purchased from bakers in
                    both cities, and the Edinburgh flour, except in bad years, when the crop had
                    been injured, was uniformly superior in quality to the London flour.</p>
                <p>The magistrates of London have at last become sensible of the truth of these
                    facts; and that the government, by their officious interference and their minute
                    enactments, have injured instead of improved the quality of the bread. They
                    have, in consequence, applied to parliament, and by their influence, the assize
                    on bread, as far as it affects London and its environs, has been taken off. But
                    the good effects expected have not yet resulted from this judicious measure. The
                    spirit of monopoly has been sunk so deep into the minds of the bakers by the
                    assize laws, that some time must elapse before it can be eradicated. It is said
                    that they have a weekly meeting, and settle the assize privately in the same
                    manner as it was before publicly done by the lord mayor and aidermen of London.
                    But this <hi rend="italic">esprit de corps</hi> cannot continue very long. Where
                    there are 1600 bakers, as in London and Westminster, it is not consistent with
                    the nature of things to suppose that they can long continue united, so as to act
                    only together and by concert. Self-interest will induce first one individual,
                    and then another, to consult to his own private advantage, and to endeavour to
                    secure an increase of business by underselling his neighbours. The bond will
                    thus be broken asunder, and every one will be obliged to serve the community at
                    the lowest possible rate.</p>
                <p>It is a pity that the legislature would not see that the same liberty which has
                    been given to the baker ought to be extended to the corn trade in general. The
                    depreciation of money, which was the consequence of the unnatural state into
                    which Europe was brought by the French revolution, our almost total seclusion
                    from the Continent, and a series of bad crops for several years, raised the
                    price of corn in this country to an enormous height. The landlords took
                    advantage of this increase to raise the rents, while government loaded the
                    farmer with heavy taxes. But in a state of peace, and supposing the seasons to
                    be tolerably favourable, the prices cannot be kept up. The landed proprietors,
                    indeed, conceived that the price of corn could be continued in this country at
                    its unnatural height, simply by prohibiting the importation of foreign corn. It
                    was with this view that the corn-bill was brought into parliament and carried in
                    the year 1815 by a great majority, <pb break="no" facs="nls:193193241"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0704-3241-0302"/> notwithstanding the almost universal expression
                    of the inhabitants of Great Britain against the measure. These legislators did
                    not consider that the average deficiency of corn in Great Britain does not
                    amount to a week’s consumption; that though they may prevent corn from being
                    imported into Great Britain, they cannot prevent such of the inhabitants as
                    choose it from going to those places where corn is cheap. The corn-bill will not
                    have the effect of keeping up the price of corn; but it will act as an
                    encourager of emigration. Suppose the population of Great Britain to be
                    16,000,000, the emigration of 100,000 inhabitants would probably be sufficient
                    to prevent the necessity of importing corn. Perhaps a smaller number would be
                    sufficient, as those who will be obliged to emigrate are chiefly families with
                    small fortunes, who may be supposed to consume more wheaten bread than the very
                    lowest of the people. The hardships of the farmer cannot be alleviated in any
                    other manner than by lowering his rent, and easing him of his oppressive taxes.
                    The present mode of allowing the importation of foreign corn at a tax which
                    diminishes as the price advances, till it is reduced at last to Is. per quarter,
                    is an improvement on the old mode, but it is still defective. Prices never can
                    become steady till all restrictions on the trade of corn are removed.</p>
                <p>18. About sixty years ago the dealers in corn in London carried on their business
                    at Bear Quay; but, this situation being very inconvenient, the Corn Exchange in
                    Mark Lane was erected by a company of proprietors, for the accommodation of the
                    factors and dealers. Seventy-two stands were allotted on which the samples of
                    corn are exposed to sale. Sixty-four of these stands are let out on lease to
                    factors or dealers, and the remaining eight are appropriated to the use of the
                    Kentish hoymen. “Although the Corn Exchange is considered as open to all who
                    come to buy and sell, yet no person can carry on the business of a corn-factor,
                    to any considerable extent, unless he is in possession of one of these stands.
                    Here the factors are at liberty, either to expose all their samples at the same
                    time, or as few of them as they think fit; so that a buyer has no means whatever
                    of judging, from the appearance of the samples exposed on the stands, during any
                    period of the market, what the supply is, or what quantities of corn are
                    imported, coastwise or from abroad.” <hi rend="italic">(Report of the Committee
                    of the House of Commons respecting Corn?)</hi></p>
                <p>Here the millers, mealmen, and corn-chandlers, transact their business with the
                    corn-factor, and not with the seller. These men purchase the wheat, carry it
                    down to Essex and other counties, convert it into flour, and bring it back to
                    London to supply the bakers. The profits of the baker are but small, supposing
                    him to carry on his trade without any fraud. Let us suppose him to bake twelve
                    sacks a week, which, from the evidence of the bakers examined before the
                    committee of the House of Commons, seems to be a fair average. They are allowed
                    12s. for each sack, which amounts in the week to L.7. Let us suppose further,
                    that every sack yields eighty-tw <hi rend="subscript"> 0</hi> loaves instead of
                    eighty, so that they have a profit of two loaves on each sack. This, when the
                    quartern loaf is at 10d., will amount to L.l more. And let us suppose still
                    further, that the puddings, pyes, and meat, which they bake, will defray the
                    expense of their fuel. By this statement, their weekly income will be L.8, out
                    of which they have to pay for salt and yeast, and likewise their journeymen’s
                    wages. Now, L.4∣ seems as little as can well be allowed for these purposes.
                    According to this statement, L.208 a year seems to be the amount of an ordinary
                    baker’s income in London, supposing him not to practise any fraud.</p>
                <p>The consequence of this small profit is, that men of capital seldom embark in the
                    trade. The bakers in London are mostly poor men, who begin the world without any
                    capital, and, in consequence of the great competition, are never able to deal so
                    extensively as to acquire one. It is scarcely necessary to observe what must be
                    the consequence of this. They are at the mercy of the mealmen, who supply them
                    with flour as they think proper, of what quality they think proper, and at what
                    price they think proper. Hence the high price and the badness of the London
                    bread. The profits go all into the pockets of the mealmen, who keep the bakers
                    in a state of comparative slavery, and oblige the inhabitants of London to eat
                    the worst and the dearest bread in Great Britain.</p>
                <p>Some ingenious bakers in London, in order to make up for the smallness of their
                    profits, have hit upon the plan of mixing potatoes with their flour; and we are
                    credibly informed that not less than 300 tons of potatoes are consumed for this
                    purpose every week. Perhaps the quality of the bread is not much injured by this
                    practice; for some of the bakers most in repute employ potatoes to a
                    considerable extent, and the consumption of wheat is very materially diminished
                    by it. But the grievance is, that the same price is taken for a potato loaf as
                    for a loaf of the finest wheaten flour, though it must cost the baker much
                    less.</p>
