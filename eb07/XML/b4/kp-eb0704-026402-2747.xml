                    significant corrections to the OCR text, predominantly in cases of confusing "c"
                    and "e." Isolates 90 entries that were mistakenly included at the end of prior
                    entries in v1 and v2. Normalizes ordinal numbers. Separates metadata in
                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra
                    space around the <gi>pb</gi> tag. Where a word is hyphenated at a <gi>pb</gi>,
                    the end fragment is now joined to the start fragment, making a machine-readable
                    word.</change>

            <div facs="nls:193192747" type="entry">
                <p><label type="entry">B</label>, the second letter, and first consonant, in all
                    known alphabets, excepting the Ethiopic, where it occupies the ninth place. It
                    is a labial and mute, representing the compression of the lips, and consequently
                    incapable of being uttered or pronounced without the aid of a vowel, or a
                    forcible expiration equivalent in effect to vocality. This letter has a near
                    affinity to the other labials, with which, indeed, it is interchangeable
                    according as the compression of the lips, which it primarily indicates, is
                    modified by simultaneous expiration; and hence, although its ordinary power or
                    effect is intermediate between the smooth and easy sound of P, and the rough
                    aspirations of PH, F, and V, yet, in the articulation of many languages, it is
                    habitually confounded with one or other of the letters of the same class, and,
                    in the same language at different times, is frequently interchanged with its
                    cognate consonants. Thus <hi rend="italic">βo&lt;faω</hi> in Greek becomes <hi
                    rend="italic">pasco</hi> in Latin; <hi rend="italic">γ∣λβος, gilvus;
                    βp&gt;μω,fremo;</hi> τruξoς, <hi rend="italic">buxus; aμφω, ambo; φαxαινα,
                    balaena; βξiαμβoς, triumphus;</hi> and so in many other instances. Again, in
                    Latin, the B of the olden time, and of the inscriptions, passes into V in a
                    subsequent age; while, on the other hand, the P of the antique orthgraphy is
                    commuted into B in that of amore recent date. Hence we have <hi rend="italic"
                    >abavus</hi> for <hi rend="italic">ababus, ave</hi> for <hi rend="italic">abe,
                    vixit</hi> for <hi rend="italic">bixit</hi>, <hi rend="italic">curvatus</hi> for
                    <hi rend="italic">curbatus,</hi> and hundreds of other analogous instances in
                    Gruter, Reinesius, Funccius, Gorius, Dempster, Fréret, and Lanzi, not to mention
                    the <hi rend="italic">Monumenti degli Scipioni,</hi> and similar works; while
                    <hi rend="italic">Poplius</hi> for <hi rend="italic">Publius, Poplicus</hi> for
                    <hi rend="italic">Publicus, Poplicola</hi> for <hi rend="italic">Publicola,</hi>
                    are of frequent occurrence in the inscriptions and other elder monuments of the
                    Latin language. This letter is also sometimes inserted in the middle of compound
                    words for the sake of <pb break="no" facs="nls:193192760"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0704-2760-0265"/>euphony, and to prevent the <hi rend="italic"
                    >hiatus</hi> which would otherwise result from the concurrence of vowels, as <hi
                    rend="italic">ambages, ambio, amburo;</hi> it is servile in the dative and
                    ablative plural of , the third, fourth, and fifth declensions of Latin nouns,
                    and in the praeterimperfect and future tenses of the first and second
                    conjugations; and it is interchangeable with P, F, and other letters, both in
                    the composition and conjugation of a number of verbs.—In Hebrew, the name of the
                    second letter, n'2, <hi rend="italic">bith</hi> or <hi rend="italic">beth,</hi>
                    indicates the original hieroglyph to have represented a house or temple; whilst
                    an abbreviated form of the figure has been employed to denote the initial sound
                    of the word in the spoken language; a principle, also, upon which the ancient
                    Egyptians appear to have constructed their phonetic alphabet, or used the
                    symbolical characters of their complex system of writing, for representing the
                    constituent sounds of proper names and of legends. A difference, however, will
                    be observed between the two Phoenician forms of this letter; the first of which
                    is that of a house or temple, whilst, in the second, another figure seems to
                    have been combined with the first; from which it is probable that this people,
                    the inventors of alphabetical characters or signs, had originally two
                    hieroglyphs for the letter, and consequently two words by which it was named.
                    This compound hieroglyph seems to have been composed of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >beth</hi> or house, and of the head and horns of some animal placed over it,
                    perhaps those of a ιρι=ι, <hi rend="italic">boher,</hi> ox or wild goat; which
                    would explain the assertion of Hesiod, that the second or third letter of the
                    Phoenicians was represented by an ox. At all events the Phoenician, reproduced
                    in the early Greek, has servedasthebasisof most modern varieties in the
                    languages of the west; and, amidst every change which time, accident, or
                    caprice, has superinduced, it is still easy to detect and distinguish the
                    elementary or primitive form. With regard to the different sounds or powers
                    attached to the letter in modem languages, these have varied within the limits
                    of its natural affinity; the Germans giving it the effect of P, the Spaniards,
                    Gascons, and others, that of V; and the modem Greeks, sometimes that of V, but
                    more frequently sounding it as we do F. The satirical epigrammatist who affirmed
                    that, in Gascony, <hi rend="italic">bibere</hi> is the same as <hi rend="italic"
                    >vivere,</hi> stated a literal truth, in as far at least as the pronunciation of
                    the words is concerned. In abbreviations B stands for <hi rend="italic">Badio,
                    beatus, Beleno, bene, beneficiarius, berna</hi> for <hi rend="italic">verna,
                    biga, bivus</hi> for <hi rend="italic">vivus, bixit</hi> for <hi rend="italic"
                    >vixit, bonum, Brutus, burra, bustum.</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">(a.)</hi></p>
